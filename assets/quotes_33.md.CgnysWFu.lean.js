Sir John Glubb, The Empire of the Arabs, 200 Tabari further records descriptions of Yazid as being tall and handsome.  Rebellion  During the reign of his cousin al-Walid II, Yazid spoke out against Walid's \\"immorality\\" which included discrimination on behalf of the Banu Qays Arabs against Yemenis and non-Arab Muslims, and Yazid received further support from the Qadariya and Murji'iya (believers in human free will).von Ess, \\"Kadar\\", Encyclopedia of Islam 2nd Ed. Yazid slipped into Damascus and deposed Walid in a coup, following this up with a disbursement of funds from the treasury.Theophilus. Quoted Robert Hoyland, Seeing Islam as Others Saw It (Darwin Press, 1998), 660 According to Yazid's own account, Yazid sent Abd al-Aziz ibn al-Hajjaj to meet Walid at al-Bakhra'.1234 Chronicle apud Hoyland confirms this, 660; it was a fortress near Palmyra. 1234 and Muslim sources dispute over whether Walid was there all along or whether he had fled there. 'Abd al-Aziz offered to set up a tribal assembly (shura) to decide the future of the realm. Walid rejected this offer and attacked, by which action he lost his life.Patricia Crone, God's Caliph (Cambridge University Press, 1986), 127 Yazid had Walid's head hoisted \\"on a lance and paraded around Damascus\\"; Yazid then imprisoned Walid's sons 'Uthman and Hakam,Theophilus and Muslim sources apud Hoyland, 660-1 whom Walid had designated as his heirs.God's Caliph 124-5 Pound weight's inscription, stamped on top in an angular script known as kufic, evokes Yazid III. On accession, Yazid explained that he had rebelled on behalf of the Book of Allah and the Sunna of His Prophet, and that this entailed ensuring that the strong not prey upon the weak. He promised \\"to engage in no building works, squander no money on wives or children, transfer no money from one province to another\\" without reason, \\"keep no troops on the field too long\\", and not to overtax the ahl al-dhimma; instead, he would eschew discrimination and would make his payments on time. He promised abdication if he failed to meet these goals, and held in principle to al-amr shura ‚Äì to an elected caliphate.God's Caliph, 68, 107 Tabari records Yazid's nickname \\"the Diminisher (Naqis)\\", given because he reduced military annuities by 10%,Philip Khuri Hitti, 478 whereas his predecessor had promised a raise. According to Islamic popular tradition, recorded in an apocalyptic style, Yazid would go himself into the marketplace.David Cook, Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic, 350: appendix I, III, 12 a The city of Homs refused allegiance to Yazid, and there were several other dissident movements against him.1234 Chronicle apud Hoyland, 661 Another cousin, Marwan ibn Muhammad ibn Marwan, governor of Armenia, had initially supported Walid and on Walid's death entered Iraq to avenge him.Theophilus apud Hoyland, 661 Marwan eventually rallied around Yazid.  Caliphate  Yazid appointed Mansur ibn Jumhur to replace Yusuf ibn 'Umar as governor of Iraq. On May 15, Yazid wrote a letter, preserved from oral sources in al- Mada'ini (reproduced in Tabari) and in al-Baladhuri. It supports the Umayyad dynasty up to but not including \\"the enemy of Allah\\" al-Walid II, at which point it lays out Yazid's version of the event at al-Bakhra'. At the end, Tabari's rendition has Yazid exhorting the Iraqis to follow Mansur ibn Jumhur.God's Caliph, 126f Yusuf ibn 'Umar was subsequently imprisoned and later killed by the son of Khalid ibn 'Abdallah al-Qasri. Mansur attempted to dismiss the Khurasani governor Nasr ibn Sayyar, but Nasr refused to accept this. Facing opposition from Juday al-Kirmani, Nasr invited al-Harith ibn Surayj to return from his thirteen-year stay in Turgesh territory. Al-Harith arrived wearing a fine suit of armour the Khaqan had given him and gained the support of many people in Khurasan. Yazid named his brother Ibrahim as his successor. Yazid fell ill of a brain tumourDionysius of Telmahre apud Hoyland, 661 n 193 and died on October 3 or 4, 744. Ibrahim duly succeeded him.

Marwan II decided to oppose Yazid III, and even though he later gave allegiance to Yazid, on the early death of that caliph, Marwan continued his own ambitions.

Born in Palam√≥s, Girona, he travelled through Europe and stayed for a long time in Paris. He was involved in Joventut (1900‚Äì1906), the best \\"modernisme\\" review of Catalonia. During World War I, he fought with the French army. Vall√®s wrote \\"Homes Artificials\\" (Artificial Men) which is the first short science fiction novel in the canon of Catalan literature. It was originally published in 1912, by Biblioteca Joventut in Barcelona. In this novel, the protagonist Doctor Pericart wants to obtain a new society, unsocialized and perfect. Transformed into a demigod, he creates a group of individualized androids, which will be the seeds of the new society. In 1914, he was in Paris with his first wife, where he was organizing en International Convention of Esperanto. When that very year the 1914-1918 war broke out, he enlisted as an infantry soldier and took part at the first battles against the German army. Later on, as he could read and write the Morse alphabet, he was transferred to Communications between detachments of the French Army. It was during this period that, as a war correspondent of the daily paper \\"El Diluvio\\" he wrote a series of articles in Spanish about how was life in the trenches. When he returned to Barcelona, he was appointed Staff editor of that newspaper, which was favourable to a federal system for Spain. When in 1941 the fascist armies entered into Barcelona, they closed \\"El Diluvio\\", because Franco considered Federalism to be an offense. Consequently, Frederic Pujul√† Vall√®s was sent to prison, together with the owner of the paper and the owner's two sons. Frederic Pujul√† received the death penalty, which was two weeks later commuted to twenty years and one day. At the end, he was set free two years and two months since he was imprisoned.

Warriors from numerous tribes joined the uprising in an effort to drive British soldiers and settlers out of the region. The war is named after Odawa leader Pontiac, the most prominent of many Indian leaders in the conflict. The war began in May 1763 when Native Americans were offended by the policies of British General Jeffery Amherst and attacked a number of British forts and settlements. Eight forts were destroyed and hundreds of colonists were killed or captured, with many more fleeing the region. Hostilities came to an end after British Army expeditions in 1764 led to peace negotiations over the next two years. The Native Americans were unable to drive away the British, but the uprising prompted the British government to modify the policies that had provoked the conflict. Naming the conflict The conflict is named after Ottawa leader Pontiac; variations include \\"Pontiac's War\\", \\"Pontiac's Rebellion\\", and \\"Pontiac's Uprising\\". An early name for the war was the \\"Kiyasuta and Pontiac War\\", \\"Kiyasuta\\" being an alternate spelling for Guyasuta, an influential Seneca/Mingo leader.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 303n21; Peckham, Pontiac and the Indian Uprising, 107n. The war became widely known as \\"Pontiac's Conspiracy\\" after the 1851 publication of Francis Parkman's The Conspiracy of Pontiac.Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", x. Parkman's book was the definitive account of the war for nearly a century and is still in print.McConnell, \\"Introduction\\", xiii; Dowd, War under Heaven, 7. In the 20th century, some historians argued that Parkman exaggerated the extent of Pontiac's influence in the conflict and that it was misleading to name the war after him. Francis Jennings wrote in 1988: \\"In Francis Parkman's murky mind the backwoods plots emanated from one savage genius, the Ottawa chief Pontiac, and thus they became 'The Conspiracy of Pontiac,' but Pontiac was only a local Ottawa war chief in a 'resistance' involving many tribes.\\"Jennings, Empire of Fortune, 442. Alternate titles for the war have been proposed, but historians generally continue to refer to it by the familiar names, with \\"Pontiac's War\\" the most commonly used. \\"Pontiac's Conspiracy\\" is now infrequently used by scholars.Alternative titles include \\"Western Native Americans' Defensive War\\" (used by McConnell, A Country Between, after historian W. J. Eccles) and \\"The Amerindian War of 1763\\" (used by Steele, Warpaths). \\"Pontiac's War\\" is the term most used by scholars listed in the references. \\"Pontiac's Conspiracy\\" remains the Library of Congress subject heading. The case for using the title \\"Pontiac's War\\" is made in Richard Middleton's \\"Pontiac: Local Warrior or Pan Indian Leader?\\" Michigan Historical Review, vol. 32 (2006), 1‚Äì32 Background In the decades before Pontiac's Rebellion, France and Great Britain participated in a series of wars in Europe; they also fought the French and Indian Wars in America in which France lost New France to Great Britain. The British colonists made peace with the Shawnee and Lenape Native Americans in 1758 with the Treaty of Easton, where the British promised not to settle beyond the ridge of the Allegheny Mountains, a demarcation which the king confirmed in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. Most fighting in the French and Indian War came to an end after British General Jeffrey Amherst captured Montreal in 1760, the last important French settlement.Anderson, Crucible of War, 453. British troops proceeded to occupy the various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded American territory. The French had long cultivated alliances among certain of the Indian tribes, but the British post- war approach was essentially to treat the Native Americans as a conquered people.White, Middle Ground, 256. Before long, Native Americans who had been French allies found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and their new policies. Tribes involved Indian tribes involved in Pontiac's Rebellion lived in a vaguely defined region of New France known as the pays d'en haut (\\"the upper country\\"), which was claimed by France until the Paris peace treaty of 1763. Native Americans of the pays d'en haut were from many different tribes. A tribe was a linguistic or familial group rather than a political unit; no chief spoke for an entire tribe, and no tribe acted in unison. For example, Ottawas did not go to war as a tribe; some Ottawa leaders chose to do so, while others denounced the war and stayed clear of the conflict.See White, Middle Ground, xiv, 287. The tribes of the pays d'en haut consisted of three basic groups. The first group was composed of tribes of the Great Lakes region: Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi, who spoke Algonquian languages, and the Huron, who spoke an Iroquoian language. They had long been allied with French habitants with whom they lived, traded, and intermarried. Great Lakes Native Americans were alarmed to learn that they were under British sovereignty after the French loss of America. A British garrison took possession of Fort Detroit from the French in 1760, and local Native Americans cautioned them that \\"this country was given by God to the Indians.\\"White, Middle Ground, 260. The main area of action in Pontiac's Rebellion The second group was made up of the tribes from eastern Illinois Country, which included the Miami, Wea, Kickapoo, Mascouten, and Piankashaw.Dowd, War under Heaven, 168. Like the Great Lakes tribes, these people had a long history of close trading and other relations with the French. Throughout the war, the British were unable to project military power into the Illinois Country, which was on the remote western edge of the conflict. The Illinois tribes were the last to come to terms with the British.Anderson, Crucible of War, 626‚Äì32. The third group was made up of tribes of the Ohio Country: Delawares (Lenape), Shawnee, Wyandot, and Mingo. These people had migrated to the Ohio valley earlier in the century from the mid-Atlantic and other eastern areas in order to escape British, French, and Iroquois domination in the New York and Pennsylvania area.McConnell, Country Between, ch. 1. Unlike the Great Lakes and Illinois Country tribes, Ohio tribes had no great attachment to the French regime. They had fought as French allies in the previous war in an effort to drive away the British.White, Middle Ground, 240‚Äì45. They made a separate peace with the British with the understanding that the British Army would withdraw from the Ohio Country. But after the departure of the French, the British strengthened their forts in the region rather than abandoning them, and so the Ohioans went to war in 1763 in another attempt to drive them out.White, Middle Ground, 248‚Äì55. Outside the pays d'en haut, most warriors of the influential Iroquois Confederacy did not participate in Pontiac's War because of their alliance with the British, known as the Covenant Chain. However, the westernmost Iroquois nation, the Seneca tribe, had become disaffected with the alliance. As early as 1761, the Seneca began to send out war messages to the Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes, urging them to unite in an attempt to drive out the British. When the war finally came in 1763, many Seneca were quick to take action.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 85‚Äì89Richard Middleton; Pontiac's War: Its Causes, Course and Consequences; (2007); pp. 96‚Äì99 Amherst's policies The policies of General Jeffrey Amherst, a British hero of the Seven Years' War, helped to provoke another war. Oil painting by Joshua Reynolds, 1765. British commander in chief General Amherst administered policy towards Native Americans, which involved both military matters and regulation of the fur trade, and he believed that they would have no choice but to accept British rule with France out of the picture. He also believed that they were incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army, so he stationed only 500 troops in the region where the war erupted out of the 8,000 under his command.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 157‚Äì58. Amherst and his officers made little effort to conceal their contempt for the Native Americans, and the Native Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.Dowd, War under Heaven, 63‚Äì69. Amherst decided in February 1761 to cut back on the gifts given to the Native Americans. Gift-giving had been an integral part of the relationship between the French and the tribes of the pays d'en haut, following an Indian custom that carried important symbolic meaning. The French gave presents such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing to village chiefs, who distributed them to their people. The chiefs thus gained stature among their people and were able to maintain the alliance with the French.White, Middle Ground, 36, 113, 179‚Äì83. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.White, Middle Ground, 256‚Äì58; McConnell, A Country Between, 163‚Äì64; Dowd, War under Heaven, 70‚Äì75. Gifts were considered necessary to diplomacy and peaceful co- existence, and this change in policy led to a breakdown in any future talks. Amherst also began to restrict the amount of ammunition and gunpowder that traders could sell to Native Americans. The French had always made these supplies available, but Amherst did not trust the Native Americans, particularly after the \\"Cherokee Rebellion\\" of 1761 in which Cherokee warriors took up arms against their former British allies. The Cherokees had failed because of a shortage of gunpowder, so Amherst hoped that future uprisings could be prevented by restricting it. This created resentment and hardship because gunpowder and ammunition helped the Native Americans to provide game for their families and skins for the fur trade. Many believed that the British were disarming them as a prelude to making war. Indian Department superintendent William Johnson tried to warn Amherst of the dangers of cutting back on gifts and gunpowder, but to no avail.See Anderson, Crucible of War, 468‚Äì71; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 78, and Dowd, War under Heaven, 76‚Äì77; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 83 Land and religion Historian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion were not in danger of being displaced by colonial settlers, and that historians have over- emphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. Dowd believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army were more important factors, which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting.Dowd, War under Heaven, 82‚Äì83. Also contributing to the outbreak of war was a religious movement which swept through Indian settlements in the early 1760s. The most influential individual in this phenomenon was Neolin, known as the \\"Delaware Prophet\\", who called upon Native Americans to shun the trade goods, alcohol, and weapons of the colonists. He melded Christian doctrines with traditional Indian religion, telling the people that the Master of Life was displeased with them for taking up the bad habits of the colonists, and that the British posed a threat to their very existence. \\"If you suffer the English among you,\\" he said, \\"you are dead men. Sickness, smallpox, and their poison [alcohol] will destroy you entirely.\\"Dowd, Spirited Resistance, 34. Outbreak of war, 1763 Pontiac takes up the war hatchet Fighting began in 1763 in Pontiac's rebellion, although rumors reached British officials as early as 1761 that discontented Native Americans were planning an attack. Senecas of the Ohio Country (Mingos) circulated \\"war belts\\" made of wampum which called for the tribes to form a confederacy and drive away the British. Guyasuta and Tahaiadoris led the Mingos, and they were concerned about being surrounded by British forts.White, Middle Ground, 272; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 85‚Äì87; Middleton, Pontiac's War, 33‚Äì46 Similar war belts originated from Detroit and the Illinois Country.White, Middle Ground, 276. The Native Americans were not unified, however, and Native Americans at Detroit informed the British commander of the Seneca plot in June 1761.Dowd, War under Heaven, 105; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 87‚Äì88. William Johnson held a large council with the tribes at Detroit in September 1761, and they maintained a tenuous peace; but war belts continued to circulate.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 92‚Äì93, 100; Nester, Haughty Conquerors\\", 46‚Äì47. Violence finally erupted after the Native Americans learned in early 1763 of the imminent French cession of the pays d'en haut to the British.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 104. Pontiac has often been imagined by artists, as in this 19th- century painting by John Mix Stanley, but no actual portraits are known to exist.Dowd, War under Heaven, 6. The war began at Fort Detroit under the leadership of Pontiac and quickly spread throughout the region. They took eight British forts but unsuccessfully besieged others, including Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt. Francis Parkman's The Conspiracy of Pontiac portrayed these attacks as a coordinated operation planned by Pontiac.Parkman, Conspiracy, 1:186‚Äì87; McConnell, A Country Between, 182. Parkman's interpretation remains well known, but other historians have since argued that there is no clear evidence that the attacks were part of a master plan or overall conspiracy.Peckham, Indian Uprising, 108‚Äì10. Historian Wilbur Jacobs supported Parkman's thesis that Pontiac planned the war in advance, but objected to the use of the word \\"conspiracy\\" because it suggested that the Indian grievances were unjustified; Jacobs, \\"Pontiac's War\\", 83‚Äì90. The prevailing view among scholars today is that the uprising spread as word traveled throughout the pays d'en haut of Pontiac's actions at Detroit, inspiring discontented Native Americans to join the revolt. The attacks on British forts were not simultaneous; most Ohio Indians did not enter the war until nearly a month after Pontiac began the siege at Detroit.McConnell, A Country Between, 182. Parkman also believed that French colonists had secretly instigated the war by stirring up the Indians in order to make trouble for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but subsequent historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. Some historians even argue that the Indians were trying to stir up the French. Pontiac and other Indian leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Indian alliance; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village.Dowd, War under Heaven, 105‚Äì13, 160, 268 Some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, but it was Indians who initiated and conducted war for their own objectives.White, Middle Ground, 276‚Äì77; Calloway, Scratch of a Pen, 126. Peckham argued that the Indians took up arms due to the \\"whispered assurances of the French\\" (p. 105), although he admitted that the evidence was sketchy. Historian Richard Middleton (2007) argues that Pontiac's vision, courage, persistence, and organizational abilities allowed him to activate a remarkable coalition of Indian nations prepared to fight against the British. Tahaiadoris and Guyasuta originated the idea to gain independence for all Indians west of the Allegheny Mountains, although Pontiac appeared to embrace the idea by February 1763. At an emergency council meeting, he clarified his military support of the broad Seneca plan and worked to galvanize other tribes into the military operation that he helped to lead, in direct contradiction to traditional Indian leadership and tribal structure. He achieved this coordination through the distribution of war belts, first to the northern Ojibwa and Ottawa near Michilimackinac, and then to the Mingo (Seneca) on the upper Allegheny River, the Ohio Delaware near Fort Pitt, and the more westerly Miami, Kickapoo, Piankashaw, and Wea peoples.Richard Middleton, Pontiac's War, 68‚Äì73 Siege of Fort Detroit Pontiac spoke at a council on the banks of the Ecorse River on April 27, 1763 in Lincoln Park, Michigan, about 10 miles (15 km) southwest of Detroit. He used the teachings of Neolin to inspire his listeners and convinced a number of Ottawas, Ojibwas, Potawatomis, and Hurons to join him in an attempt to seize Fort Detroit.Parkman, Conspiracy, 1:200‚Äì08. He visited the fort with 50 Ottawas in order to assess the strength of the garrison,Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 108; Peckham, Indian Uprising, 116. and he proclaimed: > It is important for us, my brothers, that we exterminate from our lands this > nation which seeks only to destroy us. You see as well as I that we can no > longer supply our needs, as we have done from our brothers, the French.‚Ä¶ > Therefore, my brothers, we must all swear their destruction and wait no > longer. Nothing prevents us; they are few in numbers, and we can accomplish > it.Peckham, Indian Uprising, 119‚Äì20; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 109. On May 6, 1763 a small lake surveying party from Fort Detroit of about twelve on the St Clair River was ambushed and four of the occupants killed (among whom was Sir Robert Davers, 5th Baronet (c. 1730‚Äì1763), of the Davers baronets Robert Davers Canadian Biography) and the rest captured.A survivor of the ambush was John Rutherford who later served as an officer in the Black Watch Regiment and those account was reprinted in American Heritage April 1958; see [https://www.americanheritage.com/journal-indian-captivity-during-pontiacs- rebellion-year-1763-mr-john-rutherfurd-afterward-captain A Journal-indian- captivity-during-pontiacs-rebellion-year-1763-mr-john-rutherfurd-afterward- captainPontiac entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men carrying concealed weapons on May 7, hoping to take the stronghold by surprise. The British had learned of his plan, however, and were armed and ready.The fort's commander Major Gladwin did not reveal the identity of the person who warned him of Pontiac's plan, but historians have named several possible candidates. (Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 109‚Äì10; Nester, Haughty Conquerors\\", 77‚Äì78) Pontiac withdrew after a brief council and laid siege to the fort two days later. He and his allies killed all of the British soldiers and settlers whom they could find outside of the fort, including women and children.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 111‚Äì12. They ate one of the soldiers, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Indian cultures.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 114. They directed their violence at the British and generally left French colonists alone. Eventually more than 900 Indians from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege. They ambushed a British supply column from Fort Niagara led by Lieutenant Abraham Cuyler at Point Pelee on May 28.Peckham, Indian uprising, 156. The British got reinforcements and attempted to make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation remained a stalemate at Fort Detroit, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Indians began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. Pontiac finally lifted the siege on October 31, 1763, convinced that the French would not come to his aid at Detroit, and removed to the Maumee River where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.Dowd, War under Heaven, 139. Small forts taken Forts and battles of Pontiac's War Before other British outposts had learned about Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Indians captured five small forts in a series of attacks between May 16 and June 2.Dowd, War under Heaven, 125. Fort Sandusky was the first to be taken, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots who warned the commander in 1762 that they would burn it down.McConnell, A Country Between, 167; Nester, Haughty Conquerors\\", 44. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort.Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", 86, gives the number of traders killed at Sandusky as 12; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, mentions \\"three or four\\", while Dowd, War under Heaven, 125, says that it was \\"a great many\\". These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed in the early stages of the war. They ritually scalped the dead and burned the fort to the ground, as the Wyandots had threatened a year earlier.Nester, Haughty Conquerors\\", 86; Parkman, Conspiracy, 1:271. Potawatomis captured Fort St. Joseph in Niles, Michigan on May 25, 1763 using the same method as at Sandusky. They seized the commander and killed most of the 15-man garrison.Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", 88‚Äì89. Fort Miami in Fort Wayne, Indiana was the third fort to fall on May 27, 1763. The commander was lured out of the fort by his Indian mistress and shot dead by Miami Indians. The nine-man garrison surrendered after the fort was surrounded.Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", 90. In the Illinois Country, , Kickapoos, and Mascoutens took Fort Ouiatenon (about west of Lafayette, Indiana) on June 1, 1763. They lured soldiers outside for a council, and took the 20-man garrison captive without bloodshed. The Indians around Fort Ouiatenon had good relations with the British garrison, but emissaries from Pontiac at Detroit had convinced them to strike. The warriors apologized to the commander for taking the fort, saying that \\"they were obliged to do it\\" by the other tribes.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 121. The Indians did not kill the British captives at Ouiatenon.Nester, Haughty Conquerors\\", 90‚Äì91. Fort Michilimackinac in Mackinaw City, Michigan was the fifth to fall, the largest fort taken by surprise. Ojibwas staged a game of stickball with visiting Sauks on June 2, 1763. The soldiers watched the game as they had done on previous occasions. The Indians hit the ball through the open gate of the fort, then they rushed in and were given weapons which Indian women had smuggled into the fort. They killed about 15 of the 35-man garrison in the struggle; they later tortured five more to death.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 122; Dowd, War under Heaven, 126; Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", 95‚Äì97. Three forts in the Ohio Country were taken in a second wave of attacks in mid-June. Iroquois Senecas took Fort Venango near Franklin, Pennsylvania around June 16, 1763. They killed the entire 12-man garrison, keeping the commander alive to write down the grievances of the Senecas. After that, they burned him at the stake.Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", 99. Possibly the same Seneca warriors attacked Fort Le Boeuf in Waterford, Pennsylvania on June 18, but most of the 12-man garrison escaped to Fort Pitt.Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", 101‚Äì02. On June 19, 1763, about 250 Ottawa, Ojibwa, Wyandot, and Seneca warriors surrounded Fort Presque Isle in Erie, Pennsylvania, the eighth and final fort to fall. The garrison of 30 to 60 men held out for two days, then surrendered on the condition that they could return to Fort Pitt.Dixon (Never Come to Peace, 149) says that Presque Isle held 29 soldiers and several civilians, while Dowd (War under Heaven, 127) writes that there were \\"perhaps sixty men\\" inside. The Indians agreed, but then killed most of the soldiers after they came out of the fort.Dowd, War under Heaven, 128. Siege of Fort Pitt Colonists in western Pennsylvania fled to the safety of Fort Pitt after the outbreak of the war. Nearly 550 people crowded inside, including more than 200 women and children.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 151; Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", 92. Simeon Ecuyer was the Swiss-born British officer in command, and he wrote that \\"we are so crowded in the fort that I fear disease‚Ä¶ the smallpox is among us.\\"Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 151. Delawares and others attacked Fort Pitt on June 22, 1763. It was too strong to be taken by force, but the Indians kept it under siege throughout July. Meanwhile, Delaware and Shawnee war parties raided deep into Pennsylvania, taking captives and killing unknown numbers of settlers in scattered farms. Indians sporadically fired on Fort Bedford and Fort Ligonier throughout the conflict, smaller strongholds that linked Fort Pitt to the east, but they never took them.Dowd, War under Heaven, 130; Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", p. 130 One of the most infamous and well documented issues during Pontiac's War was the use of biological warfare against the Native Americans. The British Army attempted use of smallpox against Native Americans during the Siege of Fort Pitt in June 1763. During a parley in midst of the siege on June 24, 1763, Captain Simeon Ecuyer gave representatives of the besieging Delawares Turtleheart and Mamaltee two blankets and a handkerchief enclosed in small metal boxes that had been exposed to smallpox, in an attempt to spread the disease to the Natives in order to end the siege.Anderson, Crucible of War, 541‚Äì42; Jennings, Empire of Fortune, 447n26.Ecuyer, Simeon: Bouquet Papers: Fort Pitt and Letters From the Frontier, 93‚Äì93Anderson, Crucible of War, 541‚Äì42; Jennings, Empire of Fortune, 447 n26; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 153. William Trent, the trader turned militia commander who had come up with the plan, sent a bill to the British Army indicating that the purpose of giving the blankets was \\"to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians.\\" The invoice's approval confirms that the British command endorsed Trent's actions. Reporting on parleys with Delaware chiefs on June 24, Trent wrote: '[We] gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect.' The military hospital records confirm that two blankets and handkerchiefs were 'taken from people in the Hospital to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians.' The fort commander paid for these items, which he certified 'were had for the uses above mentioned.' Before the war, Amherst had dismissed the possibility that the Indians would offer any effective resistance to British rule, but that summer he found the military situation becoming increasingly grim. He ordered subordinates to immediately put to death captured enemy Indian warriors. Colonel Henry Bouquet at Lancaster, Pennsylvania was preparing an expedition to relieve Fort Pitt; Amherst wrote to him on about July 8, 1763: \\"Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.\\"Peckham, Indian Uprising, 226; Anderson, Crucible of War, 542, 809n. Bouquet responded to Amherst on July 13: > P.S. I will try to inocculate the Indians by means of Blankets that may fall > in their hands, taking care however not to get the disease myself. As it is > pity to oppose good men against them, I wish we could make use of the > Spaniard's Method, and hunt them with English Dogs. Supported by Rangers, > and some Light Horse, who would I think effectively extirpate or remove that > Vermine. Amherst replied on July 16: > P.S. You will Do well to try to Innoculate the Indians by means of Blankets, > as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this > Execrable Race. I should be very glad your Scheme for Hunting them Down by > Dogs could take Effect, but England is at too great a Distance to think of > that at present. Historians are at odds as to how much damage was caused in the attempt to spread smallpox at Fort Pitt. Historian Francis Jennings concluded that the attempt was \\"unquestionably successful and effective\\" and inflicted great damage to the Indians.Jennings, Empire of Fortune, 447‚Äì48. Historian Michael McConnell writes that, \\"Ironically, British efforts to use pestilence as a weapon may not have been either necessary or particularly effective\\", noting that smallpox was already entering the territory by several means, and Indians were familiar with the disease and adept at isolating the infected.McConnell, A County Between, 195‚Äì96.For an overview of the evidence and historical interpretations, see Elizabeth A. Fenn, \\"Biological Warfare in Eighteenth- Century North America: Beyond Jeffery Amherst\\", The Journal of American History, vol. 86, no. 4 (March 2000), 1552‚Äì80. A reported outbreak that began the spring before left as many as one hundred Native Americans dead in Ohio Country from 1763 to 1764. It is not clear, however, whether the smallpox was a result of the Fort Pitt incident or the virus was already present among the Delaware people as outbreaks happened on their own every dozen or so years and the delegates were met again later and they seemingly hadn't contracted smallpox. On July 22, Trent writes, \\"Gray Eyes, Wingenum, Turtle's Heart and Mamaultee, came over the River told us their Chiefs were in Council, that they waited for Custaluga who they expected that Day\\". There are eyewitness reportsHanna, Charles A.: The wilderness trail : or, the ventures and adventures of the Pennsylvania traders on the Allegheny path, with some new annals of the old West, and the Records of some Strong Men and some Bad Ones (1911) 366‚Äì67Burke, James P.: Pioneers of Second Fork, 19‚Äì22 that outbreaks of smallpox and other diseases had plagued the Ohio Indians in the years prior to the siege of Fort Pitt.McConnell, A Country Between, 195; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 154. Colonists also caught smallpox from Indians at a peace conference in 1759 which then led to an epidemic in Charleston and the surrounding areas in South Carolina. Bushy Run and Devil's Hole On August 1, 1763, most of the Indians broke off the siege at Fort Pitt in order to intercept 500 British troops marching to the fort under Colonel Bouquet. On August 5, these two forces met at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet's force suffered heavy casualties, but they fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 20, bringing the siege to an end. His victory at Bushy Run was celebrated in the British colonies; church bells rang through the night in Philadelphia, and King George praised him.For celebration and praise, see Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 196. This victory was soon followed by a costly defeat. Fort Niagara was one of the most important western forts, but at least 300 Senecas, Ottawas, and Ojibwas attacked a supply train along the Niagara Falls portage on September 14, 1763. Two companies were sent from Fort Niagara to rescue the supply train, but the Indians defeated them. 102 soldiers and teamsters were killed and 9 wounded in these actions, which colonists dubbed the \\"Devil's Hole Massacre\\", the deadliest engagement for British soldiers during the war.Peckham, Indian Uprising, 224‚Äì25; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 210‚Äì11; Dowd, War under Heaven, 137. Paxton Boys Massacre of the Indians at Lancaster by the Paxton Boys in 1763, lithograph published in Events in Indian History (John Wimer, 1841) The violence and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their government was not doing enough to protect them. This discontentment was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group known as the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards the Indians who lived in small enclaves in the midst of Pennsylvania settlements. A group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village of Conestoga on December 14, 1763 because they heard that an Indian war party had been seen there; they killed the six Susquehannocks whom they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but the Paxton Boys broke into the jail on December 27 and killed most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them.Nester, Haughty Conquerors, 173. The Paxton Boys then set their sights on other Indians living within eastern Pennsylvania, many of whom fled to Philadelphia for protection. Several hundred Paxtonians marched on Philadelphia in January 1764, where the presence of British troops and Philadelphia militia prevented them from committing more violence. Benjamin Franklin had helped organize the local militia, and he negotiated with the Paxton leaders and brought an end to the immediate crisis. Franklin published a scathing indictment of the Paxton Boys. \\"If an Indian injures me,\\" he asked, \\"does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all Indians?\\"Franklin quoted in Nester, Haughty Conquerors, 176. One leader of the Paxton Boys was Lazarus Stewart who was killed in the Battle of Wyoming of 1778. British response, 1764‚Äì1766 Indian raids on frontier settlements escalated in the spring and summer of 1764. The hardest hit colony that year was Virginia, where more raids occurred on July 26, when four Delaware Indians murdered and scalped a school teacher and ten children in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Incidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania Assembly to reintroduce the scalp bounties offered during the French and Indian War, which paid money for every Indian killed above the age of 10, including women.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 222‚Äì24; Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", 194. The Board of Trade held General Amherst responsible for the uprising and recalled him to London in August 1763; they replaced him with Major General Thomas Gage. In 1764, Gage sent two expeditions into the west to crush the rebellion, rescue prisoners, and arrest the Indians responsible for the war. According to historian Fred Anderson, Amherst had designed Gage's campaign, and it prolonged the war for more than a year because it focused on punishing the Indians rather than ending the war. Gage's one significant departure from Amherst's plan was to allow William Johnson to conduct a peace treaty at Niagara, giving those Indians an opportunity to \\"bury the hatchet\\".Anderson, Crucible of War, 553, 617‚Äì20. Fort Niagara treaty Bouquet's negotiations are depicted in this 1765 engraving based on a painting by Benjamin West. The Indian orator holds a belt of wampum, essential for diplomacy in the Eastern Woodlands. From July to August 1764, Johnson negotiated a treaty at Fort Niagara with about 2,000 Indians in attendance, primarily Iroquois. Most Iroquois had stayed out of the war, but Senecas from the Genesee River valley had taken up arms against the British, and Johnson worked to bring them back into the Covenant Chain alliance. As restitution for the Devil's Hole ambush, the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British. Johnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Indians. This Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the Susquehanna Valley, but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired.For Niagara treaty, see McConnell, A Country Between, 197‚Äì99; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 219‚Äì20, 228; Dowd, War under Heaven, 151‚Äì53. Two expeditions The British secured the area around Fort Niagara then launched two military expeditions into the west. The first was led by Colonel John Bradstreet to travel by boat across Lake Erie and reinforce Detroit. Bradstreet was to subdue the Indians around Detroit before marching south into the Ohio Country. The second expedition was commanded by Colonel Bouquet to march west from Fort Pitt and form a second front in the Ohio Country. Bradstreet set out from Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 soldiers and a large contingent of Indian allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt that he did not have enough troops to subdue enemy Indians by force. Strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Presque Isle on August 12, and he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Indians led by Guyasuta. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct; the Ohio Indians did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war.For Bradstreet along Lake Erie, see White, Middle Ground, 291‚Äì92; McConnell, A Country Between, 199‚Äì200; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 228‚Äì29; Dowd, War under Heaven, 155‚Äì58. Dowd writes that Bradstreet's Indian escort numbered \\"some six hundred\\" (p. 155), while Dixon gives it as \\"more than 250\\" (p. 228). Bradstreet continued westward, as yet unaware that his unauthorized diplomacy was angering his superiors. He reached Fort Detroit on August 26, where he negotiated another treaty. He chopped up a peace belt that the Ottawa leader had sent to the meeting in an attempt to discredit Pontiac, who was not present. According to historian Richard White, \\"such an act, roughly equivalent to a European ambassador's urinating on a proposed treaty, had shocked and offended the gathered Indians.\\" Bradstreet also claimed that the Indians had accepted British sovereignty as a result of his negotiations, but Johnson believed that this had not been fully explained to the Indians and that further councils would be needed. Bradstreet had successfully reinforced and reoccupied British forts in the region, but his diplomacy proved to be controversial and inconclusive.For Bradstreet at Detroit, see White, Middle Ground, 297‚Äì98; McConnell, A Country Between, 199‚Äì200; Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 227‚Äì32; Dowd, War under Heaven, 153‚Äì62. Colonel Bouquet was delayed in Pennsylvania while mustering the militia, but he finally set out from Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, within striking distance of a number of Indian villages. Treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, so the Ohio Indians were isolated and ready to make peace, with some exceptions. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Indians return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Indian families. Not all of the captives were present, so the Indians were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Indians agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.For Bouquet expedition, see Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 233‚Äì41; McConnell, A Country Between, 201‚Äì05; Dowd, War under Heaven, 162‚Äì65. Treaty with Pontiac Although the military conflict essentially ended with the 1764 expeditions,Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 242. Native Americans still called for resistance in the Illinois Country, where British troops had yet to take possession of Fort de Chartres from the French. A Shawnee war chief named Charlot Kask√© emerged as the most strident anti-British leader in the region, temporarily surpassing Pontiac in influence. Kask√© traveled as far south as New Orleans in an effort to enlist French aid against the British.White, Middle Ground, 300‚Äì01; Dowd, War under Heaven, 217‚Äì19; Middleton, Pontiac's War, 183‚Äì99 In 1765, the British decided that the occupation of the Illinois Country could only be accomplished by diplomatic means. As Gage commented to one of his officers, he was determined to have \\"none our enemy\\" among the Indian peoples, and that included Pontiac, to whom he now sent a wampum belt suggesting peace talks. Pontiac had by now become less militant after hearing of Bouquet's truce with the Ohio country Native Americans.Middleton, Pontiac's War, 189; White, Middle Ground, 302 Johnson's deputy, George Croghan, accordingly travelled to the Illinois country in the summer of 1765, and although he was injured along the way in an attack by Kickapoos and Mascoutens, he managed to meet and negotiate with Pontiac. While Charlot Kask√© wanted to burn Croghan at the stake,White, Middle Ground, 305, note 70. Pontiac urged moderation and agreed to travel to New York, where he made a formal treaty with William Johnson at Fort Ontario on July 25, 1766. It was hardly a surrender: no lands were ceded, no prisoners returned, and no hostages were taken.Dowd, War under Heaven, 253‚Äì54. Rather than accept British sovereignty, Kask√© left British territory by crossing the Mississippi River with other French and Native refugees.Calloway, Scratch of a Pen, 76, 150. Aftermath captives had been adopted into Native families, their forced return often resulted in emotional scenes, as depicted in this engraving based on a painting by Benjamin West. The total loss of life resulting from Pontiac's War is unknown. About 400 British soldiers were killed in action and perhaps 50 were captured and tortured to death.Peckham, Indian Uprising, 239. Nester (\\"Haughty Conquerors\\", 280) lists 500 killed, an apparent misprint since his source is Peckham. George Croghan estimated that 2,000 settlers had been killed or captured, a figure sometimes repeated as 2,000 settlers killed.For works which report 2,000 killed (rather than killed and captured), see Jennings, Empire of Fortune, 446; Nester, \\"Haughty Conquerors\\", vii, 172. Nester later (p. 279) revises this number down to about 450 killed. Dowd argues that Croghan's widely reported estimate \\"cannot be taken seriously\\" because it was a \\"wild guess\\" made while Croghan was far away in London; Dowd, War under Heaven, 142. The violence compelled approximately 4,000 settlers from Pennsylvania and Virginia to flee their homes.Dowd, War under Heaven, 275. Native American losses went mostly unrecorded. Pontiac's War has traditionally been portrayed as a defeat for the Native Americans,Peckham, Indian Uprising, 322. but scholars now usually view it as a military stalemate: while the Native Americans had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer the Native Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 242‚Äì43; White, Middle Ground, 289; McConnell, \\"Introduction\\", xv. The Native Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the Native Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.White, Middle Ground, 305‚Äì09; Calloway, Scratch of a Pen, 76; Richter, Facing East, 210. Relations between British colonists and Native Americans, which had been severely strained during the French and Indian War, reached a new low during Pontiac's Rebellion.Calloway, Scratch of a Pen, 77. According to historian David Dixon, \\"Pontiac's War was unprecedented for its awful violence, as both sides seemed intoxicated with genocidal fanaticism.\\"Dixon, Never Come to Peace, xiii. Historian Daniel Richter characterizes the Native attempt to drive out the British, and the effort of the Paxton Boys to eliminate Native Americans from their midst, as parallel examples of ethnic cleansing.Richter, Facing East, 190‚Äì91. People on both sides of the conflict had come to the conclusion that colonists and Native Americans were inherently different and could not live with each other. According to Richter, the war saw the emergence of \\"the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other.\\"Richter, Facing East, 208. The British government also came to the conclusion that colonists and Native Americans must be kept apart. On October 7, 1763, the Crown issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, an effort to reorganize British North America after the Treaty of Paris. The Proclamation, already in the works when Pontiac's War erupted, was hurriedly issued after news of the uprising reached London. Officials drew a boundary line between the British colonies along the seaboard, and Native American lands west of the Allegheny Ridge (i.e., the Eastern Divide), creating a vast 'Indian Reserve' that stretched from the Alleghenies to the Mississippi River and from Florida to Quebec. It thus confirmed the antebellum demarcation that had been set by the Treaty of Easton in 1758. By forbidding colonists from trespassing on Native lands, the British government hoped to avoid more conflicts like Pontiac's Rebellion. \\"The Royal Proclamation,\\" writes historian Colin Calloway, \\"reflected the notion that segregation not interaction should characterize Indian-white relations.\\"Calloway, Scratch of a Pen, 92. The effects of Pontiac's War were long-lasting. Because the Proclamation officially recognized that indigenous people had certain rights to the lands they occupied, it has been called the Native Americans' \\"Bill of Rights\\", and still informs the relationship between the Canadian government and First Nations.Calloway, Scratch of a Pen, 96‚Äì98. For British colonists and land speculators, however, the Proclamation seemed to deny them the fruits of victory‚Äîwestern lands‚Äîthat had been won in the war with France. The resentment which this created undermined colonial attachment to the Empire, contributing to the coming of the American Revolution.Dixon, Never Come to Peace, 246. According to Colin Calloway, \\"Pontiac's Revolt was not the last American war for independence‚ÄîAmerican colonists launched a rather more successful effort a dozen years later, prompted in part by the measures the British government took to try to prevent another war like Pontiac's.\\"Calloway, Scratch of a Pen, 91. For Native Americans, Pontiac's War demonstrated the possibilities of pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo- American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages,Hinderaker, Elusive Empires, 156. the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, and was the first war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans.For first extensive war, see Steele, Warpaths, 234. For first war not to be complete Native defeat, see Steele, Warpaths, 247. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.Dowd, Spirited Resistance, 42‚Äì43, 91‚Äì93; Dowd, War under Heaven, 264‚Äì66.

Shepherd's Historical Atlas. Marwan ibn Muhammad ibn Marwan ibn al-Hakam (; 691 ‚Äì 6 August 750), also called Marwan II, was the fourteenth and last caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate, ruling from 744 until he was killed in 750. Much of his reign was dominated by the Third Muslim Civil War, and he was the last Umayyad ruler to rule the united Caliphate before the Abbasid Revolution toppled the Umayyad dynasty. Family Marwan ibn Muhammad was a member of the Marwanid household of the Umayyad Caliphate. His mother was a most likely a Kurd who was taken captive by Marwans father, Muhammad ibn Marwan, who was the son of the fourth Umayyad Caliph Marwan I (), by a woman named Zaynab, and hence half-brother to fifth Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ().Zetterst√©en (1993), p. 408Donner (2014), p. 110 Reign In A.H. 114 (732‚Äì733) Caliph Hisham appointed Marwan governor of Armenia and Azerbaijan. In A.H. 117 (735‚Äì736) Marwan invaded Georgia, devastated it and then took three fortresses of the Alans and made peace with Tumanshah. In A.H. 121 he launched further raids and obtained tribute. In A.H. 126, on hearing news of the plot to overthrow al-Walid II, Marwan wrote to his relatives from Armenia strongly discouraging this. He urged them to harmoniously preserve the stability and well-being of the Umayyad house. When Yazid III persisted in overthrowing al-Walid II, Marwan at first opposed him, then rendered allegiance to him. On Yazid's early death, Marwan renewed his ambitions, ignored Yazid's named successor Ibrahim and became caliph. Ibrahim initially hid, then requested Marwan give him assurances of personal safety. This Marwan granted and Ibrahim even accompanied the new caliph to Hisham's residence of Rusafah. Marwan named his two sons Ubaydillah and Abdullah heirs. He appointed governors and proceeded to assert his authority by force. However, anti-Umayyad feeling was very prevalent, especially in Iran and Iraq. The Abbasids had gained much support. As such, Marwan's reign as caliph was almost entirely devoted to trying to keep the Umayyad empire together. Marwan took Emesa (Homs) after a bitter ten- month siege. Al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shaybani led a Kharijite rebellion. He defeated the Syrian forces and took Kufa. Sulayman ibn Hisham turned against Marwan, but suffered a severe defeat. The Kharijites advanced on Mosul and were defeated. Sulayman joined them. Al-Dahhak's successor al-Khaybari was initially successful in pushing back Marwan's centre and even took the caliph's camp and sat on his carpet. However, he and those with him fell in fighting in the camp. Shayban succeeded him. Marwan pursued him and Sulayman to Mosul and besieged them there for six months. Then, reinforced, the caliph drove them out. Shayban fled to Bahrayn where he was killed; Sulayman sailed to India. In Khurasan there was internal discord with the Umayyad governor Nasr ibn Sayyar facing opposition from al-Harith and al-Kirmani. They also fought each other. In addition Abbasid envoys arrived. There had long been religious fervour and a kind of messianic expectation of Abbasid ascendency. During Ramadan 747 (May 16‚ÄìJune 14), they unfurled the standards of their revolt. Nasr sent his retainer Yazid against them. Yazid, however, was bested, taken and held captive. He was impressed by the Abbasids and when released told Nasr he wanted to join them, but his obligations to Nasr brought him back. Fighting continued throughout Khurasan with the Abbasids gaining increasing ascendency. Finally, Nasr fell sick and died at Rayy on November 9, 748 at the age of eighty-five. Marwan campaign in Egypt in 749 to quell the Bashmuric Revolt and secure his rear, but his campaign was a failure. The Abbasids, meanwhile, achieved success in the Hijaz. Marwan suffered a decisive defeat by Abu al-'Abbas al-Saffah on the banks of the Great Zab called Battle of the Zab. At this battle alone, over 300 members of the Umayyad family died. Marwan fled, leaving Damascus, Jordan and Palestine and reaching Egypt, where he was caught and killed on August 6, 750. His heirs Ubaydallah and Abdallah escaped to modern Eritrea. Ubaydallah died in fighting there. Marwan's death signalled the end of Umayyad fortunes in the East, and was followed by the mass-killing of Umayyads by the Abbasids. Almost the entire Umayyad dynasty was killed, except for the talented prince Abd ar-Rahman who escaped to Spain and founded an Umayyad dynasty there. In Egypt, Marian's tongue was fed to a cat.

The focus of this article is not just the literature of Catalonia, but literature written in Catalan from anywhere, so that it includes writers from the Valencian Community, Balearic Islands and other territories where Catalan or its variants are spoken. The Catalan literary tradition is extensive, starting in the early Middle Ages. A Romantic revivalist movement of the 19th century, Renaixen√ßa, classified Catalan literature in periods. The centuries long chapter known as Decad√®ncia that followed the golden age of Valencian literature, was perceived as extremely poor and lacking literary works of quality. Further attempts to explain why this happened (see History of Catalonia) have motivated new critical studies of the period, and nowadays a revalorisation of this early modern age is taking place. Catalan literature reemerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries, to experience troubled times from the start of the Spanish Civil War on. Many intellectuals were forced into exile and Catalan culture was repressed. However, this repression began to temper after the end of World War II. Many measures were introduced soon to protect and promote the Catalan language, such as the creation of official contests to award the best literary works in Catalan. Middle Ages=Origins Catalan, a Romance language, evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages, when it became a separate language from Latin. Literary use of the Catalan language is generally said to have started with the religious text known as Homilies d'Organy√†, written either in late 11th or early 12th century, though the earlier Can√ß√≥ de Santa Fe, from 1054-76, may be Catalan or Occitan. Another early Catalan poem is the mid-13th century Augats, sey√≥s qui credets D√©u lo Payre, a planctus Mariae (lament of Mary). Ramon Llull (13th century), one of the major medieval Majorcan writers in the Catalan language is not only saluted for starting a Catalan literary tradition clearly separated from the Occitan-speaking world of the time, but also credited with enriching the language with his coining of a large number of words, and his philosophy. See Llibre de Meravelles (including the famed Llibre de les b√®sties) and Blanquerna (including Llibre d'Amic e Amat) for more details on his works. Les quatre grans cr√≤niques These four major literary works are chronicles written between the 13th and 14th centuries narrating the deeds of the monarchs and leading figures of the Crown of Aragon. They are the following: *Cr√≤nica de Jaume I, also known as \\"The book of deeds\\" (see External links) *Cr√≤nica de Bernat Desclot, also known as \\"Book of the king, Peter of Aragon\\". *Cr√≤nica de Ramon Muntaner *Cr√≤nica de Pere el Cerimoni√≥s Lyric poetry The first widespread vernacular writing in any Romance language was the lyric poetry of the troubadours, who composed in Occitan. Since Occitan and Catalan are often indistinguishable before the 14th century, it is not surprising that many Catalans composed in the Occitan poetic koin√©. The first Catalan troubadour (trobadors) may be Berenguier de Palazol, active around 1150, who wrote only can√ßons (love songs in the courtly tradition). Guerau III de Cabrera and Guillem de Bergued√†, active in the generation after, were noted exponents of the ensenhamen and sirventes genres respectively. During this early period Occitan literature was patronised by the rulers of Catalonia--not surprisingly considering their wide involvement in Occitanian politics and as Counts of Provence. Alfonso II patronised many composers, not just from Catalonia, and even wrote Occitan poetry himself. The tradition of royal troubadours continued with his descendants Peter III James II of Aragon, the anonymous known only as \\"Lo bord del rei d'Arago\\", and Frederick II of Sicily. The most prolific Catalan troubadour during the ascendancy of Occitan as language of literature, was Cerver√≠ de Girona, who left behind more than one hundred works. He was the most prolific troubadour of any nationality. In the early 13th century, Raimon Vidal, from Besal√∫, composed his poetic grammar, the Razos de trobar (\\"Purposes of Composition\\"). This was the earliest and perhaps most influential Occitan lyric treatise. The troubadour lyric followed the Catalans to Sicily later in the century, where Jaufre de Foixa composed a Regles de trobar (\\"Rules for Composing\\") modelled on Vidal's earlier work. A third Catalan treatise on the language of the troubadours and composing lyric poetry, the Mirall de trobar (\\"Mirror of Composition\\"), was written by a Majorcan, Berenguer d'Anoia. The first golden age of this language was developed in the Kingdom of Valencia around the 15th century under the variant of \\"Valenciano\\" . The Catalan language consolidated and clearly differentiated, even in lyrical poetry, from Occitan language. The prose is widely cultivated, with influences from Italian humanism. Authors as the humanist Bernat Metge the preacher Vincent Ferrer, Francesc Eiximenis or Anselm Turmeda write works now considered as classical models of Catalan prose. The narrative and the fiction are shown in novels as Hist√≤ria de Jacob Xalab√≠n, Paris i Viana or the chivalric roman Curial i G√ºelfa. In the 15th century the main centre of literary production is Valencia: the lyric poetry has outstanding Petrarchian poets: Jordi de Sant Jordi or Ausi√†s Marc, or the elaborate poetry and prose of Joan Ro√≠s de Corella. In fiction could be outlined Jaume Roig's Espill or Tirant lo Blanc. Tirant lo Blanc Written by the Valencian writer Joanot Martorell, this epic romance was among its time's most influential novels, and possibly the last major book in Catalan literature until the 19th century. Modern era=La Decad√®ncia The early modern period (late 15th-18th centuries), while extremely productive for Castilian writers of the Spanish Golden Age, was termed La Decad√®ncia by 19th century Catalan scholars and writers. This \\"decadent\\" period in Catalan literature came about because of a general decline in the use of the vernacular language and a lack of patronage among the nobility as Aragonese institutions declined. The Catalan-language decadence accompanied the rise of Catalan commercial influence in the Spanish Empire in which the use of Spanish language was essential after the dynastic union that resulted from the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1474. Today, this is seen as a romantic view made popular by writers and thinkers of the 19th century national awakening movement known as Renaixen√ßa. The presumed period of decadence is being contested with the appearance of recent cultural and literary studies showing that there were indeed literary works of note in the period. Renaixen√ßa √Ängel Guimer√† The first Romantics in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands chose Spanish as their language, and did not resort to using the Catalan language until a national awakening movement, kickstarted by Romantic nationalism, appeared. The foundation of the basis of the movement is most often credited to Bonaventura Carles Aribau with his Oda a la P√†tria. Renaixen√ßa or \\"rebirth\\". Literary Renaixen√ßa shares with European Romanticism most of its traits, but created a style of its own through its admiration of the Middle Ages and its will to embellish the language and the need to create a new common standard. Realism and naturalism deeply influenced later authors. Their most important adherents were indeed Jacint Verdaguer, who penned Catalonia's national epic, and √Ängel Guimer√†, whose plays were translated and performed around Europe. Modernisme Literary Catalan modernisme was the natural follow-up of Renaixen√ßa, still showing Romantic traits and influences while focusing on dark themes, such as violence or the dark side of life and nature. As for poetry, it closely followed the style of Parnassians and Symbolists. The movement was subdivided into authors in whose work prevailed darker decadentism themes, classed under the name Boh√®mia Negra, and those whose career embraced Aestheticism, known as participants of Boh√®mia Daurada or Boh√®mia Rosa. Santiago Rusi√±ol, Joan Maragall and Joan Puig i Ferreter were some of its most influential adherents. Noucentisme The cultural and political movement known as Noucentisme appeared in the early 20th century, a time of great economic growth in Catalonia, as a mostly conservative reaction against Modernisme and the Avantgarde, both in art and thought. Its Classicism was framed as a \\"return to beauty.\\" The love of elaborated form, along with its much sought perfection of language, was accused by modernistes of being excessively affected and artificial. Poetry was its preferred genre, as evidenced by Josep Carner or Carles Riba's masterpieces. Francoist Spain, exile and political transition After what seemed to be a period of hope and rapid growth, the Spanish Civil War and the establishment of Francoist Spain (starting in 1939) forced many Catalan leftist intellectuals into exile, as many of them faced political persecution. During the initial years of Francoist Spain the use of Catalan in the media became frowned upon. Publishing in Catalan never ceased completely, though, even though only a few notable authors like Salvador Espriu did publish in this language in the first years of Francoist Spain. Those initial political restrictions on publishing in Catalan relaxed over time. By the 1950s publishing in Catalan was no longer extraordinary; by the 1960s it had become possible without restrictions other than the ideological ones which applied to all of Spain. Some literary awards in Catalan had been established as early as 1947 (Premi Joanot Martorell). Also by the end of the 1940s well known authors such as Josep Maria de Sagarra were publishing again in Catalan (among others, El prestigi dels morts, 1946, L'Hereu i la forastera, 1949). Many other literary awards followed, like the Premi Carles de la Riba (1950), the Victor Catal√† (1953) or the Lletra d'Or (1956). Since 1951, the most remarkable literary contest in Catalonia at the time (the Premio Ciudad de Barcelona) accepted originals in Catalan. In 1962, Merc√® Rodoreda published The Time of the Doves, possibly the book which paved the way of modern Catalan literature, since it could enjoy wider recognition due to the new media and the spreading of literacy in this language. In 1963, Spain won an international song contest with a piece sung in Catalan. Later on that decade Josep Pla published what has been considered the masterpiece of the contemporary literature in Catalan, the seminal El Quadern Gris (1966). The Catalan cultural association √ímnium Cultural, which had been established in 1961, could begin its work in favour of Catalan literature by 1967 onwards. Salvador Espriu, who had published most of his works in Catalan, was a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1971. After the transition to democracy (1975‚Äì1978) and the restoration of the Catalan regional government Generalitat (1980), literary life and the editorial market have returned to normality and literary production in Catalan is being bolstered with a number of language policies intended to protect Catalan culture. Besides the aforementioned authors, other relevant 20th-century writers of the Francoist and democracy periods include Joan Brossa, Agust√≠ Bartra, Manuel de Pedrolo, Pere Calders or Quim Monz√≥, Jes√∫s Moncada or, in 21st century, Jaume Cabr√© or Albert S√°nchez Pi√±ol. The number of twenty-first century women writers increases like Dolors Miquel or N√∫ria Perpiny√†. Lists of Catalan-language writers and poetsNotesReferences *Comas, Antoni. La decad√®ncia.

In 2004, the previous two councils served over 11,000 youth in over 400 Boy Scout troops, Cub Scout packs, Venturing crews, and Explorer posts. In 2012, the Monterey Bay Area Council announced that after 89 years as a separate council, it had agreed to merge back into the Santa Clara County Council. , the council served 13,000 youth in four different counties. Organization The council is divided into districts: * Coyote Creek * Quicksilver * Pioneer * Polaris * Loma Prieta - Santa Cruz County, plus Royal Oaks and Aromas * San Benito - San Benito County, except Aromas * Santa Lucia - Monterey County, except Royal Oaks History The San Jose Council of the Boy Scouts of America was founded on August 20, 1920 by John Crummey (president of Bean Spray and Pump Company, later known as Food Machinery Corporation), Robert Bentley, Jr. (president of Muirson Label Company) and Archer Bowden (San Jose attorney). Bentley served as the first council president, Julius Rainwater was the first scout executive, and Edmund Richmond was the first council commissioner. In 1922, the council changed its name to Santa Clara County Council, and took over administration for all of Santa Clara County. The council was incorporated in 1923, and oversight of San Benito County was added the same year. Monterey and Santa Cruz counties were added in 1927. In 1933 San Benito, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties were split off to form the Monterey Bay Area Council. In 1939 the area around Palo Alto split off to form its own council, the now- defunct Stanford Area Council. That council, which had been one of the smaller BSA councils in the nation by area, merged with San Mateo County Council in the 1990s to form Pacific Skyline Council. Monterey Bay Area Council The Monterey Bay Area Council was formed in 1933, when San Benito, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties were split off from the Santa Clara County Council. The council grew and was given the land for Camp Pico Blanco in 1948 by William Randolph Hearst. After the separation, they shared borders on two sides. =Council merger= The Santa Clara Council had successfully balanced its budget from 2002 to 2012 and had attracted new membership every month for nearly four years. It was recognized by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America as a Centennial Quality Council every year from 2006 and 2010 and was a Gold level Journey to Excellence Council in 2011. The Monterey Bay Area Council was on ‚Äúconditional charters‚Äù during 2010 and 2011 and was given specific goals to balance its budget and increase its membership. The Council failed to reach those goals and in 2012 the national BSA gave the Monterey Bay Area Council a ‚Äútransitional charter‚Äù and instructed it to seek a merger. In July 2012, the Monterey Bay Area Council announced it would be merging with the Santa Clara County Council. The announcement attributed the merger in large part to more than a million dollars in debt accumulated by the Monterey Bay Area Council. Expenses included the construction of a fish ladder and a new dining lodge at Camp Pico Blanco. The Monterey Bay Area Council had also experienced continuous declining enrollment. In early 2012, the existing council board asked the Santa Clara County Council to operate the council while the merger was underway. The Santa Clara Council formed a committee to complete the merger and study which of the three camps it will continue to own‚ÄîCamp Pico Blanco, Camp Hi-Sierra, and Chesebrough Scout Reservation. In September 2012, the combined councils announced that over 75 names had been suggested by volunteers for the new council, and that from among these names they had chosen Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council as the combined council's name. The merger was finalized in December 2012. =Order of the Arrow = In the summer of 2007 the Esselen Lodge celebrated its 50th anniversary.Esselen Lodge #531 The Esselen Lodge has three chapters: Sit Caw Yu, which means White Bear Clan (Loma Prieta District); Yakiski Shanax, which means Thick Fog in Esselen (Santa Lucia District); and Quetzalcoatl, also known as the Q (San Benito District). Council camps The new council currently operates three camps and has operated several others in the past. As a result of the merger with the Monterey Bay Area Council, the Santa Clara Council studied which of the three camps it would continue to operate. , it is operating Camp Hi-Sierra, Chesebrough Scout Reservation, and Camp Pico Blanco. Camp Hi-Sierra Camp Hi-Sierra is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, minutes from the small town of Long Barn, California. This camp is at notably high altitude, with the majority of its buildings standing at approximately and the highest point of the mountain standing over a mile high at . The camp is used year-round with six weeks of Scouting camp during the summer. In the past it has played host to International Rendezvous, and is hosting one in the summer of 2020. During the 'off season' Camp Hi-Sierra is used for training sessions as well as council activities. =History= Camp Hi-Sierra was created in 1949 with land that the Santa Clara County Council bought within the Stanislaus National Forest. Before the camp was a Scout Reservation though it was inhabited by the Miwok Indians. When logging scions discovered the forest, they decided to start logging in the spot where the camp is now located. To this day, as one walks through camp, they can still see remnants of the logging industry such as parts of the old mill. Small- scale logging continues along the main camp road. The Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council maintains the camp as well and a full-time ranger lives in the camp throughout the year. He is the caretaker for all of Camp Hi-Sierra. =Location= This camp is located within the Stanislaus National Forest. Its official postal address is in nearby Long Barn, California, although it is about one mile southeast of Cold Springs, California. The turn-off is about 30 miles East of Sonora and nearly one mile West of Cold Springs Market on State Route 108. The tourist town of Pinecrest, California and its popular Pinecrest Lake are approximately five miles further East on Hwy 108. =Facilities= Buildings at Camp Hi-Sierra include a staff bunkhouse, dining hall, office, and other structures. The camp is bisected by the North Fork of the Tuolumne River. On the western side is Staff Hill, home to the camp staff during the summertime. Also, this side contains the camp office, health lodge, dining hall, flag meadow, and the ranger's home. On the southernmost end of the camp property is a small seasonal man-made lake. On the eastern side of camp is the Blackfoot Meadow, home to the baseball diamond. Directly across from Blackfoot Meadow is the archery range. Also near the meadow is the frisbee golfdisc golf course. Further south is the high adventure area; this includes the bike barn and rock climbing tower. Across from the climbing wall which was built in 2016 is the trading post, which was built in 2005. Next to the high adventure area is the Trail-to-First Class area and beyond that the Scoutcraft area. Opposite from Scoutcraft is the \\"livery\\", home of the craft shop. Behind this is the Nature area, formerly the High-Adventure Base. The log cabin has now been converted into the nature cabin, with space on the second floor for storage and a workspace, formerly a sleeping area. Across the road from the Nature area is Foxfire. On this fenced-in property, there is a tipi for Indian lore classes and a blacksmith shop with a coal forge and three anvils. This is home of the Mountain Man program, where scouts can learn blacksmithing, woodcarving, and tomahawk throwing. The eastern side of the river contains all of the scout camps, where 250-350 scouts can be housed in tents. High on the hill are the shooting range and chapel. Chesebrough Scout Reservation Chesebrough Scout Reservation, also called Camp Chesebrough is a Boy Scouts of America camp in the Santa Cruz Mountains of Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties, California. The camp is owned by the Memorial Foundation of the Santa Clara County Council, and is used year-round for troop campouts, Order of the Arrow events and Wood Badge trainings; and as a Cub Scouting day camp and a junior leadership resident camp during the summer. =History= The original of Chesebrough Scout Reservation in Santa Cruz County were donated to the original Santa Clara County Council by Paul and Nessie Chesebrough in 1977. Paul had inherited the camp and much of the surrounding area from his aunt Edith Van Antwerp in 1949. The Chesebroughs felt that the land should remain open and available for use by the people of California, so they donated much of it to the Mid-Peninsula Regional Open Space District, the Sempervirens Fund, and of course, the Boy Scouts. The Chesebroughs donated another adjoining the property in San Mateo County in 1983. The council wanted to use Chesebrough as an undeveloped wilderness camp, but the closing of Camp Stuart in Saratoga in 1990 forced the council to move many of the activities from that camp to Chesebrough, including the Cub Scout day camp, which required the construction of additional facilities. =Location= Chesebrough Scout Reservation straddles the Santa Cruz-San Mateo county border, and is located south of Saratoga on California State Route 9, and south of that road's intersection with California State Route 35, or Skyline Boulevard at Saratoga Gap. The Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail passes through the camp about from its Skyline terminus, in Castle Rock State Park. The camp is bordered by Saratoga Gap Open Space Preserve and Long Ridge Open Space Preserves of the Mid- Peninsula Regional Open Space District, and Castle Rock and Portola State Parks. =Facilities= Chesebrough Scout Reservation has about 8 campsites, each capable of holding at least 30 campers. In addition, the camp has a large modern kitchen, a 300-seat campfire amphitheater, BB gun and archery ranges, and of hiking trails. The trails connect to the Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail, giving access to Castle Rock State Park, Big Basin Redwoods State Park, and Cutter Scout Reservation.

The camp had a pool, dining room, multipurpose building, flush toilets, shower building, meeting lodge and many campsites. Bohlman Road, which was paved in the 1950s, divides the camp in two. One side served as a Cub Scout day camp, one of the largest in the United States, serving nearly 3000 Scouts each year. Camp Stuart's last summer of operation was in 1988. The Santa Clara County Council already owned two other camps, and decided to sell Camp Stuart to take advantage of rising land values. The camp was sold in 1989, shortly before several buildings were damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake. The county has not demolished or developed the camp, and has no funds or apparent plans for the area.Mardi Bennett (ed); Scouting in the Santa Clara Valley; 1990; Rosicrucian Press; San Jose, California; Order of the Arrow As a result of the merger, the two former council's OA chapters have merged from the former Santa Clara County Council's Miwok Lodge and the Monterey Bay Area Council's Esselen Lodge into the new Saklan Lodge.

It was the largest slave uprising in the British mainland colonies, with 25 colonists and 35 to 50 Africans killed. The uprising was led by native Africans who were likely from the Central African Kingdom of Kongo, as some of the rebels spoke Portuguese. Their leader, Jemmy, was a literate slave. In some reports, however, he is referred to as \\"Cato\\", and likely was held by the Cato, or Cater, family who lived near the Ashley River and north of the Stono River. He led 20 other enslaved Kongolese, who may have been former soldiers, in an armed march south from the Stono River (for which the rebellion is named). They were bound for Spanish Florida. This was due to a Spanish effort to destabilize British rule, where the Spanish had promised freedom and land at St. Augustine to slaves who escaped from the British colonies. Jemmy and his group recruited nearly 60 other slaves and killed more than 20 whites before being intercepted and defeated by the South Carolina militia near the Edisto River. A group of slaves escaped and traveled another before battling a week later with the militia. Most of the captured slaves were executed; the surviving few were sold to markets in the West Indies. In response to the rebellion, the South Carolina legislature passed the Negro Act of 1740, which restricted slave assembly, education, and movement. It also enacted a 10-year moratorium against importing African slaves, because they were considered more rebellious, and established penalties against slaveholders' harsh treatment of slaves. It required legislative approval for each act of manumission, which slaveholders had previously been able to arrange privately. This sharply reduced the rate of manumissions in the state.  Causes =Local factors Since 1708, the majority of the population of the South Carolina colony were enslaved Africans, as importation of laborers from Africa had increased in recent decades with labor demand for the expansion of cotton and rice cultivation as commodity export crops. Historian Ira Berlin has called this the Plantation Generation, noting that South Carolina had become a \\"slave society,\\" with slavery central to its economy. As planters had imported many slaves to satisfy the increased demand for labor, most slaves were native Africans.Patrick Riordan, \\"Finding Freedom in Florida: Native Peoples, African Americans, and Colonists, 1670‚Äì1816\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, Vol. 75, No. 1 (Summer, 1996), pp. 24‚Äì43. Many in South Carolina were from the Kingdom of Kongo, which had converted to Catholicism in the 15th century. Numerous slaves had first been held in the British West Indies, where they were considered to become 'seasoned' by working there under slavery, before being sold to South Carolina. With the increase in slaves, colonists tried to regulate their relations, but there was always negotiation in this process. Slaves resisted by running away, work slowdowns, and revolts. At the time, Georgia was still an all-white colony, without slavery. South Carolina worked with Georgia to strengthen patrols on land and in coastal areas to prevent fugitives from reaching Spanish Florida. In the Stono case, the slaves may have been inspired by several factors to mount their rebellion. Spanish Florida offered freedom to slaves escaped from British colonies; the Spanish had issued a proclamation and had agents spread the word in the British colonies about giving freedom and land to slaves who reached Florida. Tensions between England and Spain over territory in southern North America made slaves hopeful of reaching Spanish territory, particularly the free black community of Fort Mos√©, founded in 1738 outside St. Augustine. Stono was from the Florida line.Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America, Belknap Press, 1998, p. 73 A malaria epidemic had recently killed many whites in Charleston, weakening the power of slaveholders. Lastly, historians have suggested the slaves organized their revolt to take place on Sunday, when planters would be occupied in church and might be unarmed. The Security Act of 1739 (which required all white males to carry arms even to church on Sundays) had been passed in August of that year in response to earlier runaways and minor rebellions, but it had not fully taken effect. Local officials were authorized to mount penalties against white men who did not carry arms after 29 September.\\"The Stono Rebellion\\", Africans in America, PBS, accessed 10 April 2009. African background Jemmy, the leader of the revolt, was a literate slave described in an eyewitness account as \\"Angolan\\". Historian John K. Thornton has noted that, because of patterns of trade, he was more likely from the Kingdom of Kongo in west Central Africa, which had long had relations with Portuguese traders. His cohort of 20 slaves were also called \\"Angolan\\", and likely also Kongolese. The slaves were described as Catholic, and some spoke Portuguese, learned from the traders operating in the Kongo Empire at the time. The patterns of trade and the fact that the Kongo was a Catholic nation point to their origin there. The leaders of the Kingdom of Kongo had voluntarily converted to Catholicism in 1491, followed by their people; by the 18th century, the religion was a fundamental part of its citizens' identity. The nation had independent relations with Rome.John K. Thornton, \\"The African Roots of the Stono Rebellion\\", in A Question of Manhood, eds. Darlene Clark Hine and Earnestine Jenkins, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1999, pp. 116‚Äì117, 119, accessed 12 April 2009. The region had slavery prior to the introduction of Christianity to the royal court of Kongo, and it was regulated by the Kingdom. Slavery was still practiced as late as the 1870s. Portuguese was the language of trade as well as one of the languages of educated people in Kongo. The Portuguese- speaking slaves in South Carolina were more likely to have learned about offers of freedom by Spanish agents. They would also have been attracted to the Catholicism of Spanish Florida. In the early 18th century, Kongo had been undergoing civil wars, leading to more people being captured and sold into slavery, including trained soldiers. It is likely that Jemmy and his rebel cohort were such military men, as they fought hard against the militia when they were caught, and were able to kill 20 men. Events of the revolt On Wednesday, 9 September 1739, Jemmy gathered 22 enslaved Africans near the Stono River, southwest of Charleston. Mark M. Smith argues that taking action on the day after the Feast of the Nativity of Mary connected their Catholic past with present purpose, as did the religious symbols they used.Diane Mutti- Burke, \\"What the Stono Revolt Can Teach Us about History\\", review of Mark M. Smith, ed., Stono, History.net, Dec 2008, accessed 12 October 2008. The Africans marched down the roadway with a banner that read \\"Liberty!\\", and chanted the same word in unison. They attacked Hutchenson's store at the Stono River Bridge, killing two storekeepers and seizing weapons and ammunition. Raising a flag, the slaves proceeded south toward Spanish Florida, a well- known refuge for escapees. On the way, they gathered more recruits, sometimes reluctant ones, for a total of 81. They burned six plantations and killed 23 to 28 whites along the way. While on horseback, South Carolina's Lieutenant Governor William Bull and five of his friends came across the group; they quickly went off to warn other slaveholders. Rallying a militia of planters and minor slaveholders, the colonists traveled to confront Jemmy and his followers. The next day, the well-armed and mounted militia, numbering 19‚Äì99 men, caught up with the group of 76 slaves at the Edisto River. In the ensuing confrontation, 23 whites and 47 slaves were killed. While the slaves lost, they killed proportionately more whites than was the case in later rebellions. The colonists mounted the severed heads of the rebels on stakes along major roadways to serve as warning for other slaves who might consider revolt.\\"September 1739: Stono Rebellion in South Carolina\\" , History in the Heartland, Ohio Historical Society, accessed 9 September 2013. The lieutenant governor hired Chickasaw and Catawba Indians and other slaves to track down and capture the Africans who had escaped from the battle.\\"Report from William Bull re: Stono Rebellion\\", Africans in America, PBS, accessed 10 April 2009. A group of the slaves who escaped fought a pitched battle with a militia a week later approximately from the site of the first conflict. The colonists executed most of the rebellious slaves; they sold other slaves off to the markets of the West Indies. This excerpt is from George Cato who said this was passed down in his family. Aftermath Over the next two years, slave uprisings occurred independently in Georgia and South Carolina. Colonial officials believed these were inspired by the Stono Rebellion, but historians think the increasingly harsh conditions of slavery since the beginning of the 18th century under the rice and cotton cultures were sufficient cause. Planters decided to develop a slave population who were native-born, believing the workers were more content if they grew up enslaved. Attributing the rebellion to the recently imported Africans, planters decided to cut off the supply. They enacted a 10-year moratorium on slave importation through Charleston. When, a decade later, they opened the port to the international slave trade again, planters imported slaves from areas other than the Congo- Angolan region.\\"Margaret Washington on the impact of the Stono Rebellion\\", Africans in America, PBS, accessed 11 April 2009. In addition, the legislature passed the Negro Act of 1740 to tighten controls: it required a ratio of one white to ten blacks on any plantation. It prohibited slaves from growing their own food, assembling in groups, earning money, or learning to read. In the uncertain world of the colony, several of the law's provisions were based on the assumption that whites could effectively judge black character; for instance, whites were empowered to examine blacks who were traveling outside a plantation without passes, and to take action.Robert Olwell and Alan Tully, Cultures and Identities in Colonial British America, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006, p. 37. The legislature also worked to improve conditions in slavery in order to avoid problems; it established penalties for masters who demanded excessive work or who brutally punished slaves. These provisions were difficult to enforce, as the law did not allow slave testimony against whites. They also started a school to teach slaves Christian doctrine.Claudia E. Sutherland, \\"Stono Rebellion (1739)\\", Black Past, accessed 10 April 2009. At the same time, the legislature tried to prevent slaves from being manumitted, as the representatives thought that the presence of free blacks in the colony made slaves restless. It required slaveholders to apply to the legislature for permission for each case of manumission; formerly, manumissions could be arranged privately. South Carolina kept these restrictions against manumission until slavery was abolished after the American Civil War. The legislature's action related to manumissions likely reduced the chances that planters would free the mixed-race children born of their (or their sons') liaisons with enslaved women, as they did not want to subject their sexual lives to public scrutiny.Edward Ball, Slaves in the Family, New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998, p. 187 Such relationships across ethnic and power lines continued, as documented in numerous contemporary sources, including Mary Chesnut in her published diary and Fanny Kemble in her journal, published in 1863, as well as subsequent histories. For instance, by 1860 the 200 students at Wilberforce University in Ohio, a school established for people of color, were mostly mixed-race children of white wealthy southern planter fathers, who had the money to pay for their education.James T. Campbell, Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 259‚Äì260, accessed 13 January 2009. African-American oral histories and genetic genealogy also attest to white paternity in multiple generations. Legacy The Hutchinson's warehouse site, where the revolt began, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. and A South Carolina Historical Marker has also been erected at the site. The text of the marker reads: > The Stono Rebellion (1739) The rebels were joined by 40 to 60 more during > their 15-mile march. They killed at least 20 whites, but spared others.

Audiences usually applaud after a performance, such as a musical concert, speech, or play, as a sign of enjoyment and approval. Clapping nowadays is very popular and in most countries audience members clap their hands at random to produce a constant noise. It tends to synchronize naturally to a weak degree; in Russia, Norway and many northern and eastern European countries synchronized clapping is more popular than random clapping. History The age of the custom of applauding is uncertain, but it is widespread among human cultures. The variety of its forms is limited only by the capacity for devising means of making a noise (e.g., stomping of feet or rapping of fists or hands on a table). Within each culture, however, it is usually subject to conventions. The ancient Romans had set rituals at public performances to express degrees of approval: snapping the finger and thumb, clapping with the flat or hollow palm, and waving the flap of the toga. Emperor Aurelian substituted the waving of napkins (orarium) that he had distributed to the Roman people for the toga flapping.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, page 843 In Roman theatre, at the close of the play, the chief actor called out \\"Valete et plaudite!\\", and the audience, guided by an unofficial choregos, chanted their approval antiphonally. This was often organized and paid for.B√∂ttiger, √úber das Applaudieren im Theater bei den Alten, Leipz., 1822 Similarly, a claque (French for \\"slapping\\") was an organized body of professional applauders in French theatres and opera houses who were paid by the performer(s) to create the illusion of an increased level of approval by the audience. In Christianity, customs of the theatre were adopted by the churches. Eusebius Church History, vii. 30 says that Paul of Samosata encouraged the congregation to indicate approval of his preaching by waving linen cloths (ŒøŒ∏ŒøŒΩŒ±ŒπœÇ), and in the 4th and 5th centuries applause of the rhetoric of popular preachers had become an established custom. Applause in church eventually fell out of fashion, however, and partly by the influence of the quasi-religious atmosphere of the performances of Richard Wagner's operas at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the reverential spirit that inspired this soon extended back to the theatre and the concert hall. Characteristics of an applause Characteristics of an applause An applause has three fundamental characteristics: *Strength: Intensity of the applause *Pace: Clap repetition speed *Length: Time the applause persists According to these characteristics, the applause can be classified into the following categories: Booing, Absence of applause, Weak, Collective, Intense, and Ovation.Nelson¬¥s Model Protocol and variations Well-recognized politicians, actors, and musicians often receive applause as soon as they first appear on stage, even before any performance activity has transpired. This accolade is given to indicate admiration for their past achievements, and is not a response to the performance the audience is attending. Applause during church services is traditionally regarded as taboo, in light of the sanctity of the proceedings; stress is on the aspect of worship rather than the personality of the individual preaching or singing during the service. This rule may be relaxed to permit applause in honor of the bride and groom when the newly married couple may turn to be greeted by the congregation following the exchange of vows. Applause may also be permitted at certain services in honor of a specific individual, such as the investiture of a new priest or minister. In less traditional congregations, particularly in contemporary, evangelical \\"megachurches\\", a more casual atmosphere exists and applause may be encountered as frequently as at any secular performance. Indiscriminate applause is widely considered a violation of classical music concert etiquette: Applause is discouraged between movements, reserved instead for the end of the entire work. There have been a number of attempts to further restrict applause in various circumstances, e.g., court theaters in Berlin prohibit applause during the performance and before the curtain call (although elsewhere in Germany this is felt to be beyond public tastes). By contrast, opera performances have traditionally been interrupted by applause at the end of an aria or certain other set pieces, and many opera scores reflect a break in the music at places where applause would typically occur. Regarding this practice as a distraction, Richard Wagner headed it off by eliminating breaks in the score within each act; the arias in his operas do not end in a \\"full stop\\" but flow into the next section of the music, until the end of the act is reached. Even then, in light of the quasi-religious atmosphere of the first act of Parsifal, it is traditional for the audience not to applaud at all at the end of that act, but file out of their seats in silence. In most performances, if spectators really enjoy a performance, mainly in classical performances, they may also accompany by throwing flowers onstage. On some occasions, applause occurs in the middle of an event. The President of the United States, in his State of the Union address, is often interrupted by applause; tracking the number and duration of such interruptions has become a trend on various television news channels. It is often customary for jazz performers to receive applause in the middle of a tune, after completing an improvisational solo. It is also typical to applaud at the end of a musical number in a musical theatre piece. Extended applause at the conclusion of an event, usually but not always resulting in a standing ovation, implies approval above and beyond ordinary measure, and compels the performer to return in acknowledgement and at times proceed to an encore. A golf clap is a form of quiet clapping, so-named because it is the preferred form of applause for golfers; louder forms of applause are discouraged at golf tournaments so as not to disturb other golfers, who may be in the process of attempting a shot. Golf claps are sometimes used at other events to heckle or to show sarcasm. Likewise, string musicians of an orchestra use the bobbing their bows in the air or gently tapping them on their instruments' strings as a substitute for applause. Wind section members will generally lightly stamp their feet or pat one hand on their leg to show approval to a conductor or soloist, while percussionists often rap drumsticks together. An even more subtle form of approval may be exhibited by a member of an orchestra during a formal rehearsal or performance when a colleague performs particularly well, usually a slight shuffle of the foot on the floor or hand on the knee. These subtle forms of applause may not be recognized as such by the audience. Outright applause by performers for other performers, although increasingly common, is traditionally regarded as gauche, self-congratulatory, and usurping of the audience's prerogative (and sole task in this respect) to provide accolades when they feel that the performance merits it. In some countries, applause may be used to indicate respect for a recently deceased person in some instances, such as at a funeral procession. A recent phenomenon in Britain and Israel, is the use of a minute's applause, which has come to replace the traditional minute's silence especially at football matches. However, in most countries, applause for a deceased person is still widely frowned upon and not recommended because it may be misinterpreted as rudeness or joy. In Deaf culture, Deaf audiences will use a more visually expressive variant of clapping. Instead of clapping their palms together, they raise their hands straight up with outstretched fingers and twist their wrists. However, in a situation more specific to hearing culture, the traditional clap is used. In German-speaking countries, it is customary for university students to rap their knuckles on the desks after each lecture., German Academic Exchange Service The same technique is used in German-speaking countries to express approval at meetings. In Jamaica people may bang lids and pot covers together during celebratory events such as a victory at the Olympic Games or the Miss World competitions. In legislative bodies In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, clapping is generally prohibited.Aaron Wherry, Why do our MPs clap for each other so much?, MacLean's (June 1, 2015).Brian Wheeler, Why are MPs banned from clapping?, BBC News (May 28, 2015). In the House of Commons of Canada, by contrast, clapping is customary and frequent. In air travel In various countries, airplane passengers often tend to applaud the landing upon completion of a flight and when they have felt the plane's wheels' touchdown and have run a short but satisfactory course down the runway. Here's why people clap when planes land. By Alex Orlov  June 27, 2017. Mic digital news Slow handclaps in film Another type of \\"slow handclap\\" is used as a dramatic device, often forming the conclusion of dramatic turning points in films. After some dramatic speech, one audience member claps slowly, then another, and then a few more, until the trickle of clapping gives way to roaring applause, often ending in a standing ovation. This is also referred to as a crescendo applause, named for the increasing level of volume it produces.

The Bay forms New England's largest estuary, which functions as an expansive natural harbor and includes a small archipelago. Small parts of it extend into Massachusetts. There are more than 30 islands in the Bay; the three largest ones are Aquidneck Island, Conanicut Island, and Prudence Island. Bodies of water that are part of Narragansett Bay include the Sakonnet River, Mount Hope Bay, and the southern, tidal part of the Taunton River. The bay opens on Rhode Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean; Block Island lies less than 20 miles (32 km) southwest of its opening. Narragansett Bay can be seen on NOAA Chart 13221.  Etymology  \\"Narragansett\\" is derived from the southern New England Algonquian word meaning \\"(people) of the small point of land\\". Geography Providence, Rhode Island, at the head of the Narragansett Bay Fall River, Massachusetts, at the northeast part of the Bay Narragansett Bay comprises an area of about . The watershed has seven river sub-drainage basins, including the Taunton, Pawtuxet, and Blackstone Rivers, and they provide freshwater input at approximately 2.1 billion gallons per day. River water inflow has a seasonal variability, with the highest flow in the spring and the minimum flow in early fall. The bay is a ria estuary (a drowned river valley) which is composed of the Sakonnet River valley, the East Passage river valley, and the West Passage river valley. The bathymetry varies greatly among the three passages, with the average depths of the East, West, and Sakonnet River passages being , , and respectively. Narragansett Bay is a ria that consists of a series of flooded river valleys formed of dropped crustal blocks in a horst and graben systemRobert L. McMaster, Jelle de Boer, and Barclay P. Collins, \\"Tectonic development of southern Narragansett Bay and offshore Rhode Island\\", Geology 8.10 (October 1980:496‚Äì500) (On-line abstract). that is slowly subsiding between a shifting fault system.The faults produce earthquakes upon occasion, according to the USGS: \\"Rhode Island Earthquake History\\" . Providence is Rhode Island's capital and largest city and sits at the northernmost arm of the bay. Many of Providence's suburbs are also on the bay, including Warwick and Cranston. Newport is located at the south end of Aquidneck Island on the ocean, and is the home of the United States Naval War College, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, and a major United States Navy training center. The city of Fall River, Massachusetts is located at the confluence of the Taunton River and Mount Hope Bay, which form the northeasternmost part of Narragansett Bay. The southwest side of the bay includes the seaside tourist towns of Narragansett and Wickford. Quonset Point, south of Warwick, gives its name to the Quonset hut. Roger Williams University is located in Bristol, Rhode Island overlooking the Bay. Oceanography=Tidal patterns Tides in the watershed are measured at Providence, Fall River, Quonset Point, Conimicut Light, Prudence Island, and Newport. In shallow water, sound waves are used to measure water height by precisely measuring their travel time. In deeper water, tides are measured with pressure-sensing tide gauges that are placed on the ocean floor to measure water height. Rose Island attributes its name to its rose shape at low tide. The bay's tides are semi-diurnal, meaning that the region experiences two high and low tides daily. The tides range in height from at the bay's mouth and at its head. Water depth varies about between high and low tide. The lunar, semi-diurnal M2 tide occurs at a period of 12.42 hours, with two tides occurring in the watershed every 24 hours and 50 minutes. The watershed's neap and spring tides occur every 14.8 days. In Narragansett bay, the tides show a distinct double-peak flood during high tide and single peak ebb during low tide. Water circulation patterns The movement of water within a system is its circulation. Estuaries are given a classification depending on the pattern of their circulations. The circulation classification can be well- mixed, partially mixed, salt wedge, or Fjord-type. For Narragansett, the circulation is mostly well-mixed; however, the Providence River does show some vertical stratification. Narragansett Bay circulation is made up of forces provided by the winds, tides, and changes in water density within the watershed. Its circulation is the result of the flow of fresh water at the head interacting with salt water at the point where the bay meets the open ocean. Residence time of water due to the circulation of Narragansett Bay is 10‚Äì40 days, with an average of 26 days. Tidal mixing is the dominant driver of circulation patterns in the bay, where currents can reach up to 2.5 feet per second. Non-tidal currents such as the flow of low salinity water at the surface out of the bay and high salinity deep water into the bay contribute to a current of about 0.33 feet per second. Winds also drive circulation patterns in the bay. In the winter, winds come from the northwest, helping move water towards the bay's mouth; in the summer, they are out of the southwest and move water towards the head of the bay. Wind-driven waves of over also help mix surface waters. Density-driven forces are the third factor affecting circulation. Fresh water inflow comes from natural sources such as atmospheric precipitation and inflow from the many rivers that feed into the watershed, and man-made sources such as water treatment plants. Fresh and saltwater mixing results in a salinity range in the bay of 24 parts per thousand (ppt) in the upper Providence River area to 32 ppt at the mouth of the bay. The bay's currents and circulation patterns greatly influence the sediment deposits within the region. The majority of the sediments within the bay are fine-grained material such as detritus, clay-silt, and sand-silt-clay. Scientists have been able to identify 11 types of sediment that range from course gravels to fine silts. The bay's currents deposit fine materials through the harbors of the lower and middle sections of the bay, and the coarse, heavy materials are deposited in the lower areas of the bay where the water velocities are higher. Early history The Charles Blaskowitz Chart of Narragansett Bay published July 22, 1777 at Charing Cross, London The first visit by Europeans to the bay was probably in the early 16th century. At the time, the area surrounding the bay was inhabited by two different Indian tribes: the Narragansetts occupied the west side of the bay, and the Wampanoags lived on the east side, occupying the land east to Cape Cod. It is accepted by most historians that first contact by Europeans was made by Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian explorer who entered the bay in his ship La Dauphine in 1524 after visiting New York Bay. Verrazzano called the bay Refugio, the \\"Refuge\\". It has several entrances, however, and historians can only speculate as to the exact route of his voyage and the location where he laid anchor, along with a corresponding uncertainty over which tribe made contact with him. Verrazzano reported that he found clearings and open forests suitable for travel \\"even by a large army\\".W. Conon, Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists and the Ecology of New England (New York) 1983. Dutch navigator Adriaen Block explored and mapped the bay in 1614, and nearby Block Island is named in his honor. The first permanent Colonial settlement was established in 1636 by Roger Williams, a former member of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was friends with Narragansett sachem Canonicus, who provided him with land on which to build Providence Plantations. Around the same time, the Dutch established a trading post approximately 12 miles (20 km) to the southwest which was under the authority of New Amsterdam in New York Bay. In 1643, Williams traveled to England and was granted a charter for the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. He also wrote a dictionary of the Narragansett language which was published in England that same year. The Gaspee Affair was an important naval event which moved the thirteen colonies toward the American Revolution. It occurred in Narragansett Bay in 1772 and involved the capture and burning of the British customs schooner Gaspee. The American victory contributed to the eventual start of the war at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts three years later. The event is celebrated in Pawtuxet Village as the Gaspee Days Celebration in June which includes burning the ship in effigy. Roger Williams and other early colonists named the islands Prudence, Patience, Hope, Despair, and Hog. To remember the names, colonial school children often recited the poem: \\"Patience, Prudence, Hope, and Despair. And the little Hog over there.\\" Water properties and phytoplankton distribution Narragansett Bay is divided by Conanicut Island into east and west passages. Its depth averages approximately 9.0 meters throughout the bay, but it is shallower in the west passage and deeper in the east.Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. 2009. An Ecological Profile of the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.K.B. Raposa and M.L. Schwartz (eds.), Rhode Island Sea Grant, Narragansett, R.I. 176pp. Narragansett Bay receives freshwater input from several sources, including rivers (approximately 80%), direct precipitation (13%), wastewater treatment facilities (9%), and unknown amounts from ground-water and combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The freshwater input varies greatly from season to season as it is highest in winter and lowest in summer, while CSOs increase dramatically following heavy rain. Water from these freshwater inputs mixes with sea water to form a salinity gradient ranging from 24 ppt at the mouth of the Providence River to 32 ppt at the mouth of the bay. Water temperatures range between -0.5 ¬∞C and 24 ¬∞C over the year. Salinity and temperature patterns measured throughout the bay indicate a range of mixed to stratified conditions Oviatt, C., Keller, A., & Reed, L. (2002).

Estuaries, 8(1), 2‚Äì14. https://doi.org/10.2307/1352116 Dissolved oxygen levels in Narragansett Bay are seasonal with lower levels in the summer and higher levels in the winter. This is due to warmer temperatures and higher biological demand for oxygen in the summer and the opposite in the winter. Narragansett Bay is also subject to periodic summer hypoxic events in the Northern half of the Bay, nearing anoxic conditions in some parts.Melrose, D. C., Oviatt, C. A., & Berman, M. S. (2007).

General trends in phytoplankton biomass across the bay are characterized by highest levels in the Providence River and lowest levels in Rhode Island Sound, correlating with the North to South nutrient concentration gradient in the bay (24). Near the Providence River, biomass levels are highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. In the east and west passages there are peaks in the spring and fall.Oviatt, C., Keller, A., & Reed, L.

The youngest fossil remains date to around 50,000 years ago. The first indigenous settlers of Australia might have encountered them and been a factor in their extinction. Taxonomy Illustration of the original dorsal and cervical vertebrae, 1859 The name Megalania prisca was coined in 1859 by Sir Richard Owen to mean \\"ancient great roamer\\"; the name was chosen \\"in reference to the terrestrial nature of the great Saurian\\". Owen used a modification of the Greek word ·º†ŒªŒ±ŒØŒΩœâ ƒìlain≈ç (\\"I roam\\"). The close similarity to the Latin word: lania (feminine form of \\"butcher\\") has resulted in numerous taxonomic and popular descriptions of Megalania mistranslating the name as \\"ancient giant butcher.\\" Owen introduced the genus Megalania to accommodate the species Megalania prisca. Its status as a valid genus remains controversial, with many authors preferring to consider it a junior synonym of Varanus, Cited in ) which encompasses all living monitor lizards. As the genera Megalania and Varanus are respectively feminine and masculine in gender, the specific names agree: prisca (feminine) and priscus (masculine). The genus Megalania is included as a synonym of Varanus by many researchers due to the relationships of the many Varanus species; M. prisca is closely related to other Australian monitors classified as Varanus, so excluding M. prisca from Varanus renders the latter genus an unnatural grouping. Ralph Molnar noted in 2004 that, even if every species of the genus Varanus were divided into groups currently designated as subgenera, V. priscus would still be classified in the genus Varanus, because this is the current subgenus name, as well as genus name, for all Australian monitors. Unless other Australian monitor species were each also classified their own exclusive genera, Megalania would not be a valid genus name. However, Molnar noted that \\"megalania\\" is suitable for use as a vernacular, rather than scientific name, for the species Varanus priscus. Phylogeny Several studies have attempted to establish the phylogenetic position of megalania within the Varanidae. An affinity with the perentie Varanus giganteus, Australia's largest living lizard, has been suggested based on skull-roof morphology. The most recent comprehensive study proposes a sister- taxon relationship with the large Indonesian Komodo dragon, Varanus komodoensis, based on neurocranial similarities, with the lace monitor as the closest living Australian relative. Conversely, the perentie is considered more closely related to Gould's monitor and the argus monitor. Size Two size estimations of Megalania compared to extant monitor lizards and a human The lack of complete or nearly complete fossil skeletons has made it difficult to determine the exact dimensions of Megalania. Early estimates placed the length of the largest individuals at , with a maximum weight of approximately . In 2002, Stephen Wroe considerably downsized Megalania, suggesting a maximum length of and a weight of with averages of and . decrying the earlier maximum length estimate of as exaggerations based on flawed methods. In 2009, however Wroe joined other researchers in raising the estimate to at least and . In a book published in 2004, Ralph Molnar determined a range of potential sizes for Megalania, made by scaling up from dorsal vertebrae, after he determined a relationship between dorsal vertebrae width and total body length. If it had a long, thin tail like the lace monitor (Varanus varius), then it would have reached a length of , while if its tail-to-body proportions were more similar to that of the Komodo dragon (V. komodoensis), then a length around is more likely. Taking the maximal length, he estimated a weight of , with a leaner being average. Palaeobiology Restoration Megalania is the largest terrestrial lizard known to have existed. Judging from its size, it would have fed mostly upon medium- to large-sized animals, including any of the giant marsupials such as Diprotodon, along with other reptiles and small mammals, as well as birds and their eggs and chicks. It had heavily built limbs and body and a large skull complete with a small crest between the eyes, and a jaw full of serrated, blade-like teeth. Some scientists regard with skepticism the contention that Megalania was the only, or even principal, predator of the Australian Pleistocene megafauna. They note that the \\"marsupial lion\\" (Thylacoleo carnifex) has been implicated with the butchery of very large Pleistocene mammals, while Megalania has not. In addition, they note that Megalania fossils are extremely uncommon, in contrast to T. carnifex with its wide distribution across Australian Pleistocene deposits. Quinkana, a genus of terrestrial crocodiles that grew up to 6 m and was present until around 40,000 years ago, has also been marked as another apex predator of Australian megafauna. If one were to reconstruct the ecosystems that existed before the arrival of the humans on Australia, introducing Komodo dragons to represent Megalania has been suggested to be desirable. A study published in 2009 using Wroe's earlier size estimates and an analysis of 18 closely related lizard species estimated a sprinting speed of . This speed is comparable to that of the extant freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnstoni). The scales of Megalania would possibly be similar to those of their extant relatives, possessing a honeycomb microstructure and both durable and resilient to water evaporation. Venom Hypothetical Megalania skull, at the Museum of Science, Boston Along with other varanid lizards, such as the Komodo dragon and the Nile monitor, Megalania belongs to the proposed clade Toxicofera, which contains all known reptile clades possessing toxin-secreting oral glands, as well as their close venomous and nonvenomous relatives, including Iguania, Anguimorpha, and snakes. Closely related varanids use a potent venom found in glands inside the jaw. The venom in these lizards have been shown to be a hemotoxin. The venom would act as an anticoagulant and would greatly increase the bleeding the prey received from its wounds. This would rapidly decrease the prey's blood pressure and lead to systemic shock. Being a member of Anguimorpha, Megalania may have been venomous and if so, would be the largest venomous vertebrate known.  Extinction  Recent paleontological analysis using accelerator mass spectrometry 14 C dating of known fossils shows Megalania to have been alive around the Pleistocene Epoch 50,000 years ago. An affiliate hypothesis to this dating is that anthropogenic extirpation was the cause of the downfall of Megalania and other Australian megafauna in the similar vein as to how a large factor of the extinction of the Northern Hemisphere's megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch was caused by early humans. In addition, a study, which examined the morphology of nine closely related extant varanid lizards and then allometrically scaled and compared them to V. priscus, found that the musculature of the limbs, posture, muscular mass, and possible muscular composition of the animal would most likely have been inefficient when attempting to outrun the early human settlers who colonized Australia during that time. This, in coordination with other megafauna that lived at that time such as Quinkana and Thylacoleo carnifex, and possible climate change, could have led to the species' extinction.

It forms the eastern extension of Block Island Sound and opens out the Atlantic Ocean between Block Island and Martha's Vineyard. Geography Geographically, Rhode Island Sound is the eastward extension of Block Island Sound. Northeast of Rhode Island Sound is Buzzards Bay. The Rhode Island Sound is approximately and has a maximum depth of . Average wave heights range from . Circulation and current strength are mostly impacted by the surrounding geology and not by wind strength. This causes the sea floor habitats in the Rhode Island Sound to be constantly changing. Sedimentary processes Studies conducted in 2006 by the Coastal Marine and Geology Program and the Long Island Sound Resource Center used digital terrain models to make topographical depictions of unknown glacial features and bedforms. Newfound glacial features include an ice-sculptured bedrock surface, residual stagnant- ice-contact deposits, a recessional moraine, and exposed glaciolacustrine sediments. Modern bedforms consist of fields of transverse sand waves, barchanoid waves, giant scour depressions, and pockmarks). Bedform asymmetry from multibeam bathymetric data indicate that net sediment transport is westward across the northern part of the study area near Fishers Island, and eastward across the southern part near Great Gull Island. Compared to the Block Island Sound, the Rhode Island Sound is more prone to stratification since water currents are less dynamic in this area. Flora and fauna=Algal and kelp growth Kelp population density is higher in the Rhode Island Sound compared to other temperate locations, particularly locations north of Rhode Island. However, even though annual kelp production is higher, the productivity of individual plants is lower due to lower biomass accumulation of fucoid algae. Studies conducted by Pilson, Asare, and Harlin between 1983 and 1985 illustrated that algal species such as Laminaria saccharina living in Rhode Island Sound waters have maximum nitrogen accumulation in their tissues, which directly correlates with maximum ambient inorganic nitrogen levels in tissues of other algal species as well. The cause of this is majorly impacted by large temporal fluctuations in the Rhode Island waters. Invasive species In 2008, research conducted by the University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography, shows that there is an increase in the abundance of a tunicate species, Didemnum. The species has been spotted in the Rhode Island Sound area since 2000, but has been rapidly increasing in numbers ever since. Two certain species of jellyfish are currently having a population explosion within these waters. Mnemiopsis leidyi, commonly known as sea walnut comb jellies, and the Lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata), are disrupting habitats with their invasive behavior in the Rhode Island Sound waters.

Her best remembered role is that of La Chilindrina, one of the main characters of the Televisa sitcom El Chavo del Ocho.Biographical Dictionary of Mexican Film Performers \\"N\\" and \\"O\\", Retrieved January 4, 2011. Early life De las Nieves was born in Santiago Ixcuintla, Nayarit. She is the youngest of the seven children of Estanislao G√≥mez Ocampo and Delfilia Rodr√≠guez Ocampo, who owned a women's clothing store. Career She made her film debut in the fantasy film Pulgarcito (1957), starring Mar√≠a Elena Marqu√©s, Jos√© El√≠as Moreno, and Ces√°reo Quezadas in the title role. At age 8, she became a voice actress; she provided the Spanish voices for characters such as Wednesday Addams from The Addams Family, Eddie Munster from The Munsters, Batgirl from Batman, and Invisible Woman from Fantastic Four. Her first telenovela was Estafa de amor (1961), starring Carmen Montejo and Amparo Rivelles. De las Nieves became famous as La Chilindrina in the Televisa sitcom El Chavo del Ocho. She was also the lead actress in El Chapul√≠n Colorado until 1973, when she left and Florinda Meza replaced her. She was a voice actress at Televisa, when Chespirito heard her talk. Thinking her voice was perfect for the Chilindrina character, he offered her a job at his new television program, and she accepted. Both El Chavo del Ocho and El Chapul√≠n Colorado became hits across Latin America, in New Zealand and the United States, as well as various other countries where the program was translated into local languages. The casts of Chavo and Chapul√≠n toured extensively whilst the series was on; after cancellation of the series' filming in Mexico, its actors continued travelling, and the series continued to be featured in many Latin American countries (as of 2014, it is still shown in the United States). In 1997, she was cast as the lead in Aqu√≠ est√° la Chilindrina, in which she lives in a convent with various nuns and orphan girls. It had big success. She played Dulce Amado, an elderly aunt, in the Telemundo telenovela Dame Chocolate (2007). In 2012, de las Nieves participated as a contestant in Univision's third season of Mira Qui√©n Baila. She has voiced Vanellope von Schweetz in the Spanish dub of Wreck-It Ralph (2012). Lawsuit Mar√≠a Antonieta de las Nieves was able to win a legal battle over Chespirito in 2003, one that gives her permission to act as La Chilindrina in public whenever she wants to, and grants her rights over the character she played. Chespirito owns the rights to most of the other characters of the shows he created, which led some of the actors like Rub√©n Aguirre (Profesor Jirafales) and Carlos Villagr√°n (Quico) to move to Argentina at separate points of their careers to revive the characters. In addition, because of the lawsuit, La Chilindrina is the only major character in the series that doesn't appear in the animated series El Chavo Animado and in its spin-off video game, El Chavo Kart.

The colonial authorities, in turn, demanded the Indians responsible for killing Stone and Norton, a promise not to interfere with colonial settlement in Connecticut, and 400 fathoms of wampum and the pelts of 40 beavers and 30 otters.http://environmentsandsocieties.ucdavis.edu/files/2011/11/Pastore- ES-11.6.20135.pdfPastore, Christopher. Between Land and Sea: Narragansett Bay and the Transformation of the New England Coast pp.1-5 The Niantics defending themselves on Block Island in the summer of 1637 In 1636, John Gallup came across the boat of trader John Oldham, a noted troublemaker. Oldham had flirted with impropriety since the day that he landed on American soil. Not long after arriving in Plymouth in 1623, he \\"grew very perverse and showed a spirit of great malignancy,\\" according to Plymouth Colony Governor William Bradford. He was later accused of religious subversion and responded with impertinence, hurling invective at his accusers and even drawing a knife on Captain Myles Standish. He was banished from Plymouth and fled to Massachusetts Bay, settling first in Nantasket, then Cape Ann, and finally Watertown, where he continued to indulge his penchant for mayhem. Despite his unsavory reputation, Massachusetts Bay sought his extensive knowledge of the New England coast when they asked him to retrieve a hefty ransom on the colony's behalf. It was on this mission that Oldham was murdered and dismembered. Massachusetts sent ninety men to Block Island in August under John Endicott on a punitive expedition for Oldham's murder with instructions to kill every Niantic warrior and capture the women and children, who would be valuable as slaves. The expedition was ordered by Massachusetts Governor Henry Vane to \\"massacre all of the Native men on the island\\". The English burned sixty wigwams and the corn fields. They also shot every dog, but the Niantics fled into the woods, and the soldiers only managed to kill fourteen of them. Deciding that this punishment was insufficient, Endicott and his men sailed over to Fort Saybrook before going after the Pequot village at the mouth of the Thames River to demand one thousand fathoms of wampum to pay for the murder. They took some Pequot children as hostages to insure peace, and these incidents are seen as the initial events that led to the Pequot War. Settlement Massachusetts Bay Colony claimed the island by conquest. In 1658, the colony sold the island to a group of men headed up by Endecott. In 1661, the Endecott group sold the island to a party of twelve settlers that later grew to sixteen (of whom only seven actually settled therehttps://www.blockislandtimes.com/article/week-block-islands-history- november-8-1660-goat-tale/29291) led by John Alcock, who are today memorialized at Settler's Rock, near Cow's Cove. In 1663, island settler Thomas Terry gave six acres of land at the island's largest fresh pond and its surrounding area to four \\"chief sachems\\". Their names were recorded as Ninnecunshus, Jaguante, Tunkawatten, and Senatick, but they were known by the colonists as Mr. Willeam, Repleave (Reprive), and Soconosh. This land was given to \\"them being the Cheife Sachems upon the Island there Heires & Assignes Forever to plant and Improve\\".[P.30 New Shoreham Town Book, No. 1, G. E. Burgess Transcription 1924.] This land was then known as the Indian Lands. The Sachems called the Fresh Pond Tonnotounknug.[P. 21, New Shoreham Town Book, No. 1, G. E. Burgess Transcriotion 1924, Pp. 30-31] In 1664, Indians on the island numbered somewhere from 1,200 to 1,500. By 1774, that number had been reduced to fifty-one. A Dutch map of 1685 clearly shows Block Island, indicated as Adriaen Blocks Eylant (\\"Adrian Block's Island\\"). In the late seventeenth century, an Englishwoman called New England's first woman doctor lived on Block Island. Her name was Sarah Sands n√©e Walker and she has also been suggested as a very early abolitionist. She married sea captain James Sands (one of the original sixteen, as recorded by Settler's Rock) in 1645 and had possibly six children, including a daughter named Mercy, born 1663. In 1699, Scottish sailor William Kidd visited Block Island, shortly before he was hanged for piracy. At Block Island, he was supplied by Mercy Sands (then Mrs. Raymond). The story has it that, for her hospitality, Kidd bade Mrs. Raymond to hold out her apron, into which he threw gold and jewels until it was full. After her husband Joshua Raymond died, Mercy moved with her family to what would become the Raymond-Bradford Homestead in northern New London, Connecticut (later Montville) where she bought much land. The Raymond family was thus said to have been \\"enriched by the apron\\". Mercy Sands died at Lyme in 1741.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/22103183/mercy- raymondhttp://historicbuildingsct.com/raymond-bradford-homestead-1710/ Block Island was incorporated by the Rhode Island general assembly in 1672, and the island government adopted the name \\"New Shoreham.\\" Since Colonial times Southeast Light is a Block Island landmark During the War of 1812, the island was briefly occupied by the British Navy under the command of Sir Thomas Hardy. British vessels included HMS Dispatch, HMS Terror, HMS Nimrod, HMS Pactolus, and HMS Ramillies. Hardy took the fleet to Block Island in search of food and to establish a strategic position at the mouth of Long Island Sound. The British were enraged to discover that nearly all Block Island livestock and food stores had been transferred to Stonington, Connecticut in advance of their arrival. On August 9, 1814, Hardy and his fleet departed Block Island for Stonington Harbor in part to lay claim to the Block Island food stores and livestock. Hardy's pre-dawn raid on August 10 was repulsed with damage to his fleet in a battle that has since become known as the Battle of Stonington. New London ferry The original North Lighthouse was built in 1829, but it was replaced in 1837 after the original was washed out to sea. The ocean claimed the replacement lighthouse also, and the lighthouse that can be seen today was constructed in 1867. Construction began on Block Island's Southeast Lighthouse a few years later in 1873. Block Island has no natural harbors; breakwaters were constructed in 1870 to form Old Harbor. New Harbor was created in 1895 when a channel was dug to connect the Great Salt Pond to the ocean through the northwestern side of the island. The Island Free Library was established in 1875 and is Block Island's only public library. Isaac Church was the Island's last recorded full-blooded Manisses Indian; he died in 1886 at age 100. He was survived by one son and one daughter whose descendants still reside in Rhode Island today. The landmark Isaac's Corner is named in honor of him, located at the intersection of Center Road, Lakeside Drive, and Cooneymus Road. Isaac is buried to the east of the four corners in the Historical Indian Burial Ground. In 2011, the Block Island Historical Society dedicated the Block Island Manissean Ancestral Stone. In attendance at the unveiling ceremony were descendants of the Manisses Indians, with Tiondra White Rapids Martinez, a direct descendant of Isaac Church, opening the ceremony in their native tongue. American Baptist-affiliated Harbor Church is perched high on a hill on the western side of New Shoreham. The building was reconstructed from the former Adrian Hotel and was included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as part of Old Harbor Historic District in New Shoreham. During World War II, several artillery spotters were located on the island to direct fire from the heavy gun batteries at Fort Greene in Point Judith which protected the entrance to Narragansett Bay. Lookout positions for the spotters were built to look like houses. The US government offered to evacuate the island, as it could not be effectively defended from enemy invasion, but the islanders chose to stay. Days before the war ended against Germany, the Battle of Point Judith took place seven miles to the northeast of the island. The island's airport was opened in 1950 and remains open today as a general aviation airport. In 1972, the Block Island Conservancy was founded. The Conservancy and other environmental organizations are responsible for protecting over 40% of the island from development.The Nature Conservancy in Rhode Island - Block Island ; The Nature Conservancy; retrieved on October 30, 2007 In 1974, Old Harbor Historic District was declared a National Register historic district. More information can be found in the following books concerning Block Island's old buildings, islanders, history, and ongoing efforts to conserve the land, together with a collection of 800 period photographs of the island spanning the 1870s to the 1980s and all by historian Robert M. Downie: *Block Island‚ÄîThe Sea *Block Island‚ÄîThe Land *The Block Island History of Photography, 2 volumes Climate Block Island's weather is greatly influenced by the surrounding ocean and prevailing winds that generally blow offshore. The climate is oceanic (K√∂ppen Cfb), a rarity on an east coast island in the northern hemisphere. The ocean stays cold during the spring and summer months, so Block Island stays cooler than the mainland during this period. July and August average in the mid- to upper-70s instead of low- to mid-80s that New York and southern New England experience. Block Island's record high temperature is on August 26 and 27, 1948 and the record low is on January 16, 1994. The lowest high temperature on record was on December 31, 1962 and January 8, 1968, and the highest low temperature on record was on August 2, 1979. Block Island stays warmer than the mainland during the fall and winter months when the ocean remains relatively warmer than the mainland. The hardiness zone is 7a.  Arts and culture =Annual events One of the most popular celebrations on the island is the Fourth of July Parade. Anybody can enter a float into the parade, as long as it coordinates with the theme of that respective year. For example, the theme in 2016 was sports and recreation. In addition to the parade, there is a fireworks display on the beach on the night of July 3. The parade is on the fourth and is judged by officials who give out prizes in three categories: family floats, company floats, and overall floats. They also give out one extra prize for the overall category which is the grand prize, consisting of $500. Every summer, the island hosts Block Island Race Week, a competitive, week-long sailboat race. On odd years, the event is held by the Storm Trysail Club, and on even years by the Block Island Race Week. Yachts compete in various classes, sailing courses in Block Island Sound and circumnavigating the island. Tourist attractions Harborside Inn is a restaurant and hotel on the south side of Block Island Southeast Lighthouse is located at the southeast corner of the island on the Mohegan Trail. The lighthouse was constructed in 1875Block Island South East Lighthouse National Historic Landmark Nomination; National Park Service Maritime Heritage Program; retrieved on October 23, 2007 and remains to this day an active US Coast Guard navigational aid. The lighthouse was moved in 1993, in danger of falling off the bluffs due to erosion. In addition to offering tours of the tower, the lighthouse has a museum that is open during the summer season.Daytripper's Guide: Block Island ; University of Rhode Island Sea Grant; retrieved on October 22, 2007 The Mohegan Bluffs are located a short distance to the west of Southeast Lighthouse. The bluffs are the site of a pre-colonial battle between the invading Mohegan, and the native Niantic in which the Mohegan were driven off the edge of the tall cliffs to their deaths on the beach below. A long staircase of over one hundred stairs leads to the bottom of these clay cliffs and looks out over the Atlantic. On clear days, Montauk, New York can be seen in the distance from the southern and western sides of the island. Boating is popular around Block Island Rodman's Hollow is a glacial outwash basin, near the southern shore of the island. The hollow has several walking trails. Horseback rides through Rodman's Hollow are also offered. North Lighthouse is located at Sandy Point on the northern tip of Block Island. The North Lighthouse warns boaters of a sandbar extending from this end of the island. The surrounding dunes are part of the Block Island National Wildlife Refuge, home to many species, including the piping plover and American burying beetle. A short walk away from the North Lighthouse lies the tip of the island, with ocean on both sides of a thin strip of land. The Block Island Historical Society Museum is located near the downtown area and contains a broad array of Block Island artifacts. is a U-boat wreck east of the island, lying in of water. Recreational divers frequently visit the wreck, though at least three have died there., page 194 The Block Island Wind Farm, the first offshore wind farm built in the United States, is located from south-east of the island. The five turbines, each high, commenced commercial operation in December 2016. The island has at least 40 restaurants, but most are closed outside of tourist season; mainland restaurants use New England Airlines to deliver food to the island. Parks and recreation Beach waves near the National Hotel on Block Island Crescent Beach on Block Island July, 2015 There are 17 miles of beach on Block Island. Crescent Beach can be viewed from the Pt. Judith Ferry and the New London Express Ferry on the way to the island. It contains five smaller beaches: Fred Benson Town Beach (popularly known as State Beach), Surf Beach, Scotch Beach, Rouse's Beach, and Mansion Beach, all of which are located on Corn Neck Road. North of Mansion Beach are Clayhead and Pots & Kettles. Clayhead is a set of cliffs which can be seen from the ferry in from Point Judith or New London. This area is rocky and contains iron-rich clay deposits, and is a popular area for shell and rock hunting. Cow Cove, Settler's Rock, and Sandy Point make up the northernmost point of Block Island where the North Lighthouse is located. Settler's Rock is located at Cow Cove, where the settlers landed and swam to shore bringing with them the island's first cows, which they pushed off the boats and forced ashore. Attached to the rock is a plaque naming the original settlers of Block Island. Coastguard Beach (or \\"the channel\\") is situated between the Great Salt Pond and the ocean on the north west side of the island. Ballard's Beach is on the south side of the Block Island Ferry Dock and jetty. Bluffs Beach (or Vail) is set at the bottom of Mohegan Bluffs. Block Island also hosts an office of The Nature Conservancy. The Conservancy named Block Island as one of its top 12 sites in the Western Hemisphere, and a large portion of the island is legally protected and set aside for conservation. Transportation Ferryboat Carol Jean departing Block Island in July 2015 New England Airlines Britten-Norman Islander at Block Island The island is connected year-round by a ferry to Point Judith, and in summer to New London, Connecticut, Orient Point, New York, Montauk, New York, and Newport, Rhode Island, with the latter service also offering an extended route to Fall River, Massachusetts. The traditional ferry takes about an hour to reach the island from Point Judith. A high-speed ferry on the same route takes 35 minutes, and another high-speed ferry from New London takes just over an hour. New England Airlines offers regularly scheduled 12-minute flights to Block Island State Airport from Westerly, Rhode Island. The island airport is officially called Block Island State (code: BID) and the terminal is about one mile from the town center. Incidents=Air crashes On August 26, 1995, a Cessna 185 seaplane carrying four people crashed while attempting to land in the waters off Old Harbor Beach, an area not normally used for seaplane landings. The plane cleared a dune but hit a power line, causing it to crash into a restaurant and hit a car at the island's only gas station. All four people on the plane perished, as well as a woman who was sitting in her car as it was being fueled. The restaurant was destroyed by the impact of the plane and resulting fire. On July 5, 2006, a plane carrying three people crashed ¬Ω mile west of the airport during bad weather. The aircraft had just taken off and was on its way to White Plains, New York. Shipwrecks The area around Block Island has been the site of numerous shipwrecks, including the Steamer Larchmont in 1907. The 1738 wreck of the Princess Augusta (also known as the Palatine ship) was later immortalized by John Greenleaf Whittier in his 1867 poem \\"The Wreck of the Palatine.\\" In 1877, the freighter Achilles struck a submerged rock off the island and ran aground. In 1992, the Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth 2 struck a submerged rock.British Admiralty. The Mariner's Handbook. 1999 edition, page 23.

Allegedly, Judith rendered great service and as a result the vessel was saved. In remembrance of this the crew called the point after her name.How Point Judith got its name; from notes found in the 1854 genealogy of the Greenleaf family. Note 98, pg. 110. According to Edmund Quincy's 1874 biography of his father Josiah Quincy, Point Judith was named after Judith Hull by her husband John Hull. During the American Revolution, the British controlled Narragansett Bay and raided and burned the farms on Point Judith and the surrounding areas in the late 1770s under Captain Wallace. During World War II, Fort Greene was built with 16-inch guns and others to control the approaches to Narragansett Bay. Point Judith is the site of the last sinking of an Allied ship in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. On May 5, 1945, at 05:40, the torpedoed the collier, , en route to Boston, She was within sight of the United States Coast Guard lighthouse station at Point Judith. The lookout at the lighthouse was just preparing to enter the sighting in his logbook when he heard the sound of the torpedo exploding as it hit the ship. Black Point sank within twenty-five minutes. Twelve lives were lost among her crew, while thirty-four survivors were rescued. The resulting United States Navy and Coast Guard hunt for the U-853 is now often referred to as the Battle of Point Judith. A United States Navy frigate, destroyers, destroyer escorts, and Coast Guard cutters converged on the waters off Point Judith. Attacks with depth charges and hedgehogs continued until the U-853's destruction was confirmed the next morning by two blimps which dropped a few bombs on the Germans. U-853 may have been the last U-boat to sink a ship during World War II, but she also became the second to last one to be sunk. Her wreck lies in 135 feet of water and is a popular, but dangerous destination for sport divers; at least three divers have been killed there. U-853 is recognized as a war grave with most of the 55 crew bodies remaining inside. In popular culture Jandek has a song of the same name.

The total land area is , which makes it the largest island in the bay. The 2000 United States Census reported its population as 60,870. Aquidneck Island is home to three towns, from north to south: Portsmouth, Middletown, and Newport. Etymology \\"Aquidneck\\" is derived from the Narragansett name for the island aquidnet.Henry Schoolcraft, The American Indians (1851) Roger Williams was an authority on the Narragansett language, but he stated that he never learned the word's meaning. It is unclear how it came to be known as Rhode Island, but the earliest known use of the name was in 1637 by Roger Williams, and it was officially applied to the island in 1644: \\"Aquethneck shall be henceforth called the Ile of Rods or Rhod-Island.\\" The name \\"Isle of Rodes\\" is used in a legal document as late as 1646.Office of the Secretary of State: A. Ralph Mollis: State Library Rhode Island Office of the Secretary of State, archived November 17, 2010, from the original In 1524, explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano noted the presence of an island near the mouth of Narragansett Bay which he likened to the Greek island of Rhodes. It is uncertain which island he was referring to, but the colonists who settled the area decided to refer to Aquidneck as Rhode Island. Another popular origin theory is based on the fact that Adriaen Block passed by Aquidneck Island during his 1614 expedition, described in a 1625 account of his travels as \\"an island of reddish appearance\\" (in 17th century Dutch een rodlich Eylande).Nieuwe Wereldt ofte Beschrijvinghe van West-Indien, uit veelerhande Schriften ende Aen-teekeningen van verscheyden Natien (Leiden, Bonaventure & Abraham Elseviers, 1625). An English translation of the relevant text: Documentary History of Rhode Island (1916) Dutch maps from as early as 1659 call it \\"Roode Eylant\\" or Red Island. Historians have theorized that it was named by the Dutch (possibly by Adriaen Block himself) for either the red autumn foliage or red clay on portions of the shore.Elisha Potter, 1835. The Early History of Narragansett. Collections of the Rhode-Island Historical Society, v3.Samuel G. Arnold, History of Rhode Island (1859). p. 70 In 1644, the settlements on Rhode Island (Portsmouth and Newport) united with Providence Plantations and Warwick to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations and, eventually, the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The entire state is now commonly referred to as Rhode Island, and the official name of Aquidneck Island is still \\"Rhode Island\\". The U.S. Board on Geographic Names addressed the issue in 1930 by using both names of the island on its maps. By 1964, the board decided that having two names was confusing, and \\"Rhode Island\\" was used exclusively as the official name. Attempts to change the official name to \\"Aquidneck Island\\" have been made as recently as 2004, but all of these have failed.USGS Feature Detail Report for: Rhode IslandMark Patinkin: According to the map, there is no Aquidneck Island History Colonists settled on Aquidneck Island in 1638 in the region that the Narragansetts called \\"Pocasset\\" (meaning \\"where the stream widens\\"), the northern part of Portsmouth. They engaged Roger Williams to negotiate the terms of their purchase from Narragansett sachem Miantonomi. These settlers included William Coddington, Anne and William Hutchinson, Philip Sherman, William Dyer, John Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, John Clarke, and Richard Maxson (Maggsen).Providence, RI: The Islands They bought the island for 40 fathoms of white wampum, 20 hoes, 10 coats for the resident Indians, and 5 more fathoms of wampum for the local sachem,Rhode Island Geography and Narragansett Sachems Canonicus and his nephew Miantonomi signed a deed for it. These first settlers founded Pocasset, but William Coddington chose Newport for a settlement the following spring (1639) because of its excellent harbor, and some of the settlers followed him there. The British army occupied Aquidneck Island during the American Revolution from 1776 to 1779. The Continental Army under command of Major General John Sullivan attempted to drive them out in the Battle of Rhode Island on August 29, 1778, but without success. Schools The island is home to Salve Regina University, the Newport campus of the Community College of Rhode Island, and International Yacht Restoration School. Naval Station Newport is located on Aquidneck Island and the adjacent Coasters Harbor Island. It is also home to two well known private boarding schools St. George's School in Middletown and Portsmouth Abbey School in Portsmouth. The island also contains numerous public and private primary and secondary schools as a part of the school systems of Newport, Middletown and Portsmouth. Bridges Mount Hope Bridge looking toward Aquidneck Island The Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge (1969) connects Aquidneck Island to Jamestown on nearby Conanicut Island in Narragansett Bay, and subsequently to the mainland on the western side of the bay. The Mount Hope Bridge (1929) is adjacent to Bristol Ferry and Common Fence Point and connects the northern side of Aquidneck Island in Portsmouth to the mainland at Bristol. The Sakonnet River Bridge (2012) in Portsmouth connects the northeastern side of the island to the mainland at Tiverton over the Sakonnet River, a narrow saltwater strait. It is a replacement for a bridge of the same name built in 1956.

It is connected on the east to Newport on Aquidneck Island via the Claiborne Pell Bridge, commonly known as the Newport Bridge, and on the west to North Kingstown on the mainland via the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge. The town of Jamestown comprises the entire island. The U.S. Census Bureau reported a land area of and a population of 5,622 in 2000. History Conanicut Island was a seasonal home to many American Indians. The largest Indian cemetery in New England is located on the island, and artifacts have been recovered from a site near the elementary school. The island is named for Chief Canonicus of the Narragansett tribe who maintained his royal residence on the island.Rhode Island Geography In 1636 or 1637, Dutch fur traders paid to use the island of Quentenis as a base for their activities. This island is located just west of Conanicut; it is now known as Dutch Island and is part of Jamestown. In 1638, the English colonists made arrangements to use Conanicut Island for grazing sheep, and Canonicus was one of the Narragansett sachems who gave consent. They named the island in his honor, and the Jamestown seal today includes the figure of a sheep. Conanicut Island was a part of the island territory included in a patent which the king granted to William Coddington in 1651.Bicknell, Thomas Williams. The History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. New York: The American Historical Society, Inc. (1920). Vol. 3, p. 1184. In 1657, a consortium of about 100 buyers purchased Conanicut, Dutch, and Gould Islands. They divided Conanicut into roughly a dozen large plots and reserved Dutch Island and parts of Conanicut for common use. Benedict Arnold was one of the purchasers, and he became governor of the colony of Rhode Island the same year. (Arnold was the great-grandfather of the Revolutionary War traitor.) The Indians and colonists lived side-by-side in relative peace for almost four decades. Conflicts eventually occurred in a number of places in southern New England, leading to what is known as King Philip's War. Life in the region was dominated by the colonists after 1676, although Conanicut Island remained a haven for many Indians. In 1725, a ferry was established between the island and Newport. Another ferry was established to South Kingstown in 1748.

Hope Bridge in the background The Prudence Island Schoolhouse, built in 1896 on the corner of Broadway and Mt. Pleasant Ave. Prudence Island is the third-largest island in Narragansett Bay in the state of Rhode Island and part of the town of Portsmouth, Rhode Island United States. It is located near the geographical center of the bay. It is defined by the United States Census Bureau as Block Group 3, Census Tract 401.03 of Newport County, Rhode Island. As of the 2000 census, the population was 88 people living on a land area of 14.43 km¬≤ (5.57 sq mi).Block Group 3, Census Tract 401.03, Newport people have to take a ferry every day to get off and that is not easy . United States Census Bureau History The Narragansett name for the island was Chibachuweset (or Chibachuwese), and the Narragansetts originally offered it for sale to John Oldham if he would settle there and set up a trading post. Oldham failed to meet the condition, so they sold the island to Roger Williams and John Winthrop in 1637, with each man retaining a one-half interest. Williams took the northern side of the island, and Winthrop took the southern side. Williams and Winthrop hoped to farm pigs on the island. Williams named it \\"Prudence\\" and shortly afterwards purchased and named nearby Patience Island and Hope Island. He sold his half interest in Prudence Island while in England on behalf of the colony, and Winthrop willed his land to his son Stephen.Letters of Roger Williams. 1632-1682. Now first collected, Oct. 28 1637, (Providence: Printed for the Narragansett Club, 1874) pg. 70 (accessed through The Library 0f Congress on July 19, 2009)Samuel Greene Arnold, History of the state of Rhode Island and Providence plantations Volume 1, (D. Appleton, 1859) pg. 105 In colonial times, the island was used mainly for farming. During the American Revolution, the British forces under Captain James Wallace raided Prudence Island for livestock and engaged in a skirmish with American forces, losing approximately a dozen soldiers. In the 20th century, farming began to decline and the island began to attract summer residents. In World War II, the Navy established an ammunition depot on the southernmost of the island. In 1972, the Navy turned the base over to the State of Rhode Island, leaving bunkers, roads, and a large deep-water pier. Several buildings and businesses that once stood on the island were destroyed by the 1938 New England hurricane and Hurricane Carol. As of 2018, the only business in operation on the island is a general store that doubles as the post office. The former naval base is now home to the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, while Farnham Farm is a national historic site. The island is served by ferry service to Bristol, Rhode Island. Parts of the 2012 film Moonrise Kingdom were filmed on the island and nearby Jamestown. Prudence Island is the location of Rhode Island's last one-room schoolhouse. It is operated by the Prudence Island School Foundation in cooperation with the Portsmouth school district and educates island children from kindergarten through fourth grade. The school has served the community on the island since 1896, with a six-year hiatus from 1982 to 1989. In 2019, three students were enrolled.  Summer colonies on Prudence Island  There are several different summer colonies on the island. These are in order from the south: * Prudence Park: on the west side of the island at the western end of Broadway. Development began in 1872 with the building of the Stone Wharf on the west side of the island which became a stop on the Fall River Line steamers running from Providence and Fall River to New York City. Most of the summer homes in this area of the island are fine examples of Victorian and Beaux-Arts architecture, in a similar style to those at Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard. The Stone Wharf was severely damaged and many houses were lost in the hurricane of 1938. * Bristol Colony: on the east side of the island at the eastern end of Broadway. * Sandy Point: on the eastern side of the island, along Narragansett Avenue. Site of Prudence Island Light and the Town Dock, and a former landing point for the ferry. * Homestead: plat of summer homes along the east coast of the island, north of Pier Road, to the north of the former Homestead Casino, which was lost in the hurricane of 1938, now the site of the island's post office, general store, and ferry landing. * Warnerville: directly north of the Homestead Plat, on Warner Avenue off Narragansett Avenue. * Boystown Fly-in-Ranch: a small private airport on the northern part of the island.

He was known for his humility and his greatheartedness in dealing with his patients, especially those suffering from leprosy. According to his wife Louisette, he dreamed of beautifying disfigured and suffering patients through his medical work. This aesthetic concern emerges frequently in his literary work, so much so that he was known as the \\"Poet of Beauty\\" amongst his contemporaries. In 1931, together with his friend ƒ†u≈º√® Bonnici, he founded the Gƒßaqda tal-Malti Universit√†, which is active to date, and started issuing the magazine Leƒßen il-Malti (\\"Voice of the Maltese\\"). Ru≈ºar Briffa died on 22 February 1963. His full biography was released in 1984 by Professor Oliver Friggieri. The Maltese town of Mosta contains a road named in his honour, Triq Ru≈ºar Briffa. Poetry Many of his poems were written on bits of papers cut from notebooks or on the inner part of a used packet of cigarettes. Others were written on papers instended for medical prescriptions, on paper-bags; in short, he would use anything that was at hand to capture his poem on paper. Although Briffa wrote very little, he was greatly appreciated by literary critics. These are some comments Briffa passed on poetry, as an individual interpretation and universal expression:  References  Category:Alumni of the University of Malta Category:Maltese poets Category:Male poets Category:Maltese male writers Category:1906 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Maltese dermatologists Category:20th-century poets Category:20th- century male writers Category:20th-century Maltese physicians Category:Maltese writers ","title":"Ru≈ºar Briffa"},{"id":"437513","text":"Old Hay Bay Church, c. 1908 Adolphustown is a geographic area located in Greater Napanee, Ontario, Canada, on the Adolphus Reach of the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Adolphustown is now part of the town of Greater Napanee. The rural character of the Adolphustown region remains largely undisturbed today and the area, with its picturesque lakefront location, remains popular for the cultivation of apples and strawberries. History Adolphustown was founded in 1784 by United Empire Loyalists. The original Loyalist Landing site is now the U.E.L. Heritage Centre & Park, a museum, public park, and family campground. The settlement was named for Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, seventh son of King George III. A number of Quakers settled in this area in 1784 and held their first Monthly Meetings in Canada here. The Old Hay Bay Church, built by United Empire Loyalist settlers in 1792 and the oldest Methodist building in Canada, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.Old Hay Bay Church, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada It is open during the summer. Glenora Ferry arriving in Adolphustown The settlement serves as the eastern terminus of the ferry crossing to Glenora, Ontario. The ferry is free for vehicles and pedestrians and links the western and eastern halves of one of the oldest colonial roads in the province, the Loyalist Parkway (Ontario Highway 33), at the point where the parkway is interrupted by the Bay of Quinte. This crossing appears to have been in use at least as early as 1802, when an extension of Asa Danforth Jr.'s pioneering road, from eastern Toronto through what is now Trenton, first reached the Bay of Quinte at Stone Mills (Glenora). By 1869, Adolphustown was a station on the Grand Trunk Railway with a population of 100 in the Township of Adolphustown, County of Lennox and shore of Bay of Quinte. The principal trade was in grain stock and cordwood. Land averaged from $30 to $40 per acre.The province of Ontario gazetteer and directory. H.

Originally a career officer and pilot in the United States Air Force, he resigned from the military in 1957 following the successful publication of his first novel, The Hunters. After a brief career in film writing and film directing, in 1979 Salter published the novel Solo Faces. He won numerous literary awards for his works, including belated recognition of works originally criticized at the time of their publication. Biography On June 10, 1925, Salter was born and named James Arnold Horowitz, the son of Mildred Scheff and George Horowitz. His father was a real estate broker and businessman, who had graduated from West Point in November 1918 as World War I was ending and served briefly in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Horowitz grew up in Manhattan, where he attended P.S.6, and the Horace Mann School ‚Äì his classmates included Julian Beck. While he intended to study at Stanford University or MIT, he entered West Point on July 15, 1942, at the urging of his father ‚Äì who had rejoined the Corps of Engineers in July 1941, in anticipation of war breaking out. (With others from his original Class of 1919, George Horowitz was called back to West Point after a month of duty to complete a post-graduate officer's course.) Like his father, Horowitz's time at West Point was shortened due to wartime class sizes being greatly increased and the curriculum drastically shortened. He graduated in 1945 after just three years, ranked 49th in general merit in his class of 852. He completed flight training during his first class year, with primary flight training at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and advanced training at Stewart Field, New York. On a cross-country navigation flight in May 1945, his flight became scattered and, low on fuel, he mistook a railroad trestle for a runway, crash-landing his T-6 Texan training craft into a house in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Possibly as a result, he was assigned to multi-engine training in B-25s until February 1946. He received his first unit assignment with the 6th Troop Carrier Squadron, stationed at Nielson Field, the Philippines; Naha Air Base, Okinawa; and Tachikawa Air Base, Japan. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant in January 1947. Horowitz was transferred in September 1947 to Hickam AFB, Hawaii, then entered post-graduate studies at Georgetown University in August 1948, receiving his master's degree in January 1950. He was assigned to the headquarters of Tactical Air Command at Langley AFB, Virginia, in March 1950, where he remained until volunteering for assignment in the Korean War. He arrived in Korea in February 1952 after transition training in the F-86 Sabre with the 75th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine. He was assigned to the 335th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, a renowned MiG-hunting unit. He flew more than 100 combat missions between February 12 and August 6, 1952 and was credited with a MiG-15 victory on July 4, 1952. Horowitz subsequently was stationed in Germany and France, promoted to major, and assigned to lead an aerial demonstration team; he became a squadron operations officer, in line to become a squadron commander. In his off-duty time, he wrote his first novel, The Hunters, publishing it in 1956 under the pen name \\"James Salter\\". The film rights to the novel allowed Salter to leave active duty with the US Air Force in 1957 to write full-time. He also legally changed his name to Salter. Having had served twelve years in the US Air Force, the last six as a fighter pilot, Salter found the transition to full-time writer difficult. The 1958 film adaptation, The Hunters starring Robert Mitchum, was honored with acclaim for its powerful performances, moving plot, and realistic portrayal of the Korean War. Although an excellent adaptation by Hollywood standards, it was very different from the original novel, which dealt with the slow self-destruction of a 31-year-old fighter pilot, who had once been thought a \\"hot shot\\" but who found only frustration in his first combat experience while others around him achieved glory, some of it perhaps invented. His 1961 novel The Arm of Flesh drew on his experiences flying with the 36th Fighter-Day Wing at Bitburg Air Base, Germany, between 1954 and 1957. An extensively-revised version of the novel was reissued in 2000 as Cassada. Salter however, later disdained both of his \\"Air Force\\" novels as products of youth \\"not meriting much attention.\\" After several years in the Air Force Reserve, he severed his military connection completely in 1961 by resigning his commission after his unit was called up to active duty for the Berlin Crisis. He moved back to New York with his family. Salter and his first wife Ann divorced in 1975, having had four children: Allan (born 1955, died 1980), Nina (born 1957), Claude and James (twins, born 1962). Starting in 1976 he lived with journalist and playwright Kay Eldredge. They had a son, Theo Salter, born in 1985, and Salter and Eldredge married in Paris in 1998., p. 132 Eldredge and Salter co-authored a book entitled Life Is Meals: A Food Lover's Book of Days, in 2006. Writing career Salter took up film writing, first as a writer of independent documentary films, winning a prize at the Venice Film Festival in collaboration with television writer Lane Slate (Team, Team, Team). He also wrote for Hollywood, although disdainful of it. His last script, commissioned and then rejected by Robert Redford, became his novel, Solo Faces. A widely acclaimed writer of modern American fiction, Salter was critical of his own work, having said that only his 1967 novel A Sport and a Pastime comes close to living up to his standards. Set in post-war France, A Sport and a Pastime is a piece of erotica involving an American student and a young Frenchwoman, told as flashbacks in the present tense by an unnamed narrator who barely knows the student, also yearns for the woman, and freely admits that most of his narration is fantasy. Many characters in Salter's short stories and novels reflect his passion for European culture and, in particular, for France, which he describes as a \\"secular holy land.\\" Salter's prose shows the apparent influence of both Ernest Hemingway and Henry Miller, but in interviews with his biographer, William Dowie, Salter states that he was most influenced by Andr√© Gide and Thomas Wolfe. His writing often is described by reviewers as \\"succinct\\" or \\"compressed\\", with short sentences and sentence fragments, and switching between first and third persons, as well as between the present and past tenses. His dialogue is attributed only when necessary to keep clear who is speaking, otherwise he allows the reader to draw inferences from tone and motivation. His 1997 memoir Burning the Days uses this prose style to chronicle the impact his experiences at West Point, in the Air Force, and as a celebrity pseudo-expatriate in Europe had on the way he viewed his life-style changes. Although it appears to celebrate numerous episodes of adultery, in fact, Salter is reflecting on what has transpired and the impressions of him it has left, just as does his poignant reminiscence on the death of his daughter. A line from The Hunters expresses these feelings: \\"They knew nothing of the past and its holiness.\\" Salter published a collection of short stories, Dusk and Other Stories in 1988. The collection received the PEN/Faulkner Award, and one of its stories (\\"Twenty Minutes\\") became the basis for the 1996 film Boys. He was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2000. In 2012, PEN/Faulkner Foundation selected him for the 25th PEN/Malamud Award saying that his works show the readers \\"how to work with fire, flame, the laser, all the forces of life at the service of creating sentences that spark and make stories burn\\". His final novel, All That Is, was published to excellent reviews in 2013. Salter's writings‚Äîincluding correspondence, manuscripts, and heavily revised typescript drafts for all of his published works including short stories and screenplays‚Äîare archived at the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas. In the fall of 2014 Salter became the first Kapnick Writer-in-Residence at the University of Virginia.Virginia.edu He died on June 19, 2015, in Sag Harbor, New York.

Michael Dirda of the Washington Post is reported to have said that with a single sentence, he could break one's heart. In an introduction to the final interview he gave before his death, Guernica described Salter as having \\"a good claim to being the greatest living American novelist.\\" Writer Vivian Gornick had an altogether different take on his most recent writing. In her review of All That Is for Bookforum, she wrote \\"Certainly, it is true that most writers have only one story in them.... Then again, it is also true that it is the writer's obligation to make the story tell more the third or fourth time around than it did the first. For this reviewer, Salter's work fails on this score. In his eighties he is telling the story almost exactly as he told it in his forties.\\" She also wrote that he was \\"so out of touch with the life we are actually living.\\"Gornick, Vivian, \\"The Lust Generation: James Salter's World of Taste, Flying, and Mythic Sex,\\" Bookforum, April/May 2013, p.22 Works=Novels * The Hunters (novel, 1957; revised and reissued, 1997) * The Arm of Flesh (novel, 1961; republished as Cassada, 2000) * A Sport and a Pastime (novel, 1967) * Light Years (novel, 1975) * Solo Faces (novel, 1979) * Burning the Days (memoir, 1997) * All That Is (novel, 2013) Screenplays * Downhill Racer (screenplay, 1969) * The Appointment (screenplay, 1969) * Three (screenplay, 1969; also directed) * Threshold (screenplay, 1981) Essays and Short Stories * Dusk and Other Stories (short stories, 1988; PEN/Faulkner Award 1989) * Last Night (short stories, 2005) * There and Then: The Travel Writing of James Salter (essays, 2005) * \\"My Lord You\\" and \\"Palm Court\\" (2006)Panmacmillan.com * \\"Odessa, Mon Amour\\" (2009) in Narrative Magazine * Collected Stories (2013) * \\"As Evening Falls\\" (2014) in Narrative Magazine * Don't Save Anything (2017) Other Works * Still Such (poetry, 1988) *\\"Passionate Falsehoods\\".

It was created by the amalgamation of the town of New Liskeard, the town of Haileybury, and the township of Dymond in 2004. The city had a total population of 9,920 in the Canada 2016 Census. Temiskaming Shores is Ontario's second-smallest city, in terms of population, after Dryden. Haileybury is the seat of Timiskaming District. Prior to the amalgamation of Temiskaming Shores, the region was commonly nicknamed The Tri-Towns, a designation that also encompassed the neighbouring town of Cobalt. Cobalt was also part of the original Temiskaming Shores amalgamation plan, but rejected the merger. The Tri-Towns designation may still be used on occasion, but has become significantly less common since the municipal amalgamation. In the Canada 2001 Census, the last Canadian census before the amalgamated city came into effect, New Liskeard had a population of 4,906,Statistics Canada 2001 Community Profiles: New Liskeard Haileybury had a population of 4,543,Statistics Canada 2001 Community Profiles: Haileybury and Dymond had a population of 1,181.Statistics Canada 2001 Community Profiles: Dymond Geography Riverside Drive Temiskaming Shores is located along the southern edge of the Clay Belt area, near the Quebec border on the shores of Lake Timiskaming's Wabi Bay. The separate township municipality of Harris separates the city from the Ontario-Quebec border. The nearest town on the Quebec side of the border is Notre-Dame-du-Nord. The city is located within the Timiskaming Graben, a smaller branch of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben. A large escarpment, known as Devil's Rock, is located near Haileybury. Communities The city includes the communities of New Liskeard, Haileybury, Dymond, and North Cobalt. Image:Haileybury ON.jpgHaileybury Image:New Liskeard Ontario.jpgNew Liskeard Image:North Cobalt ON.jpgNorth Cobalt History The Ottawa River, which drains into and out of Lake Timiskaming, has been a well-travelled route from the earliest times, and served as the initial point of access to the Temiskaming area. Native peoples travelled this route since the earliest times. Fort Temiscamingue was established in 1695 by French explorers. In 1794 George Gladman of the Hudson's Bay Company established Abitibi House on Lake Abitibi, to the north. In 1886, Alexander H. Telfer led a survey trip up Lake Timiskaming and gave a report to the Temiskaming Settlers' Association.\\"A. H. Telfer, Worth Travelling Miles to See: Diary of a Survey Trip to Lake Temiskaming 1886\\". By this time, the Quebec side of Lake Timiskaming was also being settled, and steamboats, the primary mode of transportation in the area, were ferrying new settlers into the area. Haileybury, 1915 Before more settlements could be established, the Quebec-Ontario boundary north of Lake Timiskaming had to be accurately surveyed. Earlier surveys by Quebec and Ontario resulted in a boundary dispute, so the Canadian government sent a survey team to resolve the issue in 1890. William Ogilvie, who had recently distinguished himself by accurately surveying the Canada - Alaska boundary, led the expedition. A benchmark near Mattawa was used to establish an accurate benchmark north of Lake Timiskaming, using astronomical methods. From the head of Lake Timiskaming, they proceeded north to James Bay, fixing accurate positions of the provincial boundary at regular intervals using geodesy data derived from star transits. Ogilvie's journal describe conditions in this area and the early settlers he met. His report on this expedition describes the details of this expedition.\\"Report of exploratory survey to Hudson's Bay, William Ogilvie 1891\\" William Murray (1840‚Äì1906) and Irvin Heard (1871‚Äì1956) were the first European settlers in the New Liskeard area, arriving in 1891. Some years later Crown Lands Agent John Armstrong was dispatched to the area to oversee formal land settlement. The settlers founded a prosperous agricultural center, taking advantage of the rich soil in the Little Claybelt region. New Liskeard was founded soon after settlers began to arrive in Dymond, and the two towns were soon incorporated, in 1903 and 1901, respectively. John Armstrong served as New Liskeard's first mayor. His descendants still live in the area today. New Liskeard was named after Liskeard in Cornwall, England. Old narrow gauge train at Haileybury, 1889 Haileybury was founded in 1889 by Charles Cobbold Farr, who named the newly founded town after the Haileybury and Imperial Service College, his former school in England. Haileybury was formally incorporated as a town in 1904. Farr encouraged settlement in the area, penning his own promotional pamphlet, entitled \\"The Lake Temiskamingue District\\", in an effort to attract new settlers to the region. Marketed to settlers as prime agricultural land, Haileybury had only a handful of residents until the arrival of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway in the early 1900s, and the subsequent discovery of large silver deposits in neighboring Cobalt in 1903. During the Cobalt Silver Rush, Haileybury became a 'bedroom community' that served the needs of the many miners and, most famously, many mine owners and managers. These mine managers and owners were responsible for the construction of the row of stately homes, nicknamed 'Millionaire's Row' that stretched along the waterfront on what is now Lakeshore Road, many of which still stand today. In 1909, the Haileybury Hockey Club played its first and only season in the NHA. The club was taken over and moved by Montreal's Club Antique-Canadien for the following season, and became the Montreal Canadiens. By 1912, Haileybury had been named the judicial seat for the Temiskaming Region, a title it retains to this day. The town of Haileybury annexed the neighbouring community of North Cobalt in 1971. Haileybury after its destruction in the Great Fire of 1922. The region was affected by the Great Fire of 1922, considered one of the worst disasters ever to befall the area. Haileybury suffered the worst damage, and approximately ninety percent of the town was destroyed, leaving only Millionaire's Row and a few other neighborhoods intact. The mass destruction is partially attributable to strong wind on the day of the fire. Approximately 3500 people were left homeless by the fire. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), with many retired street cars in its yards, sent many old car bodies to serve as houses during the reconstruction. Some of these cars remained for years, and one has recently been restored and is in the museum at Haileybury.Canadian Rail, No 479, November-December 2000. As well, the area was affected by the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake, which had its epicentre at Lac Kipawa in Quebec, approximately halfway between the Haileybury/New Liskeard area and North Bay. In more recent history, Dymond still functions largely as an agricultural centre, while the commercial and industrial interests in the area have mostly shifted operations to the former town of New Liskeard. Haileybury maintains its status as a judicial seat, and is also home to the new city hall. A strong link to agriculture means that Temiskaming Shores has largely avoided the boom-and- bust cycle typical of most mining- and forestry-dependent small towns in Northern Ontario. Temiskaming Shores has also become a popular retirement and recreational destination, with small retirement communities like the Bayport Village being developed in the former town of Haileybury. A building in Haileybury, built by area businessman Peter Grant as a combination home and office for his now-defunct company Grant Forest Products, was promoted as the largest house in Canada when Grant put it on the real estate market in 2010 for an asking price of $25 million.\\"Canada's largest home hits the market\\". The Globe and Mail, April 12, 2010. In 2013, Temiskaming Shores was the main filming location for the movie Skating to New York.Hollywood Reporter: Skating to New York, accessed February 2020. Amalgamation issues Initially, as none of the old municipal office buildings was large enough to accommodate the expanded municipal staff of a single city, all three remained in use to house different city departments. A new city hall, located on Farr Drive in Haileybury, was completed in 2007. Though now established as one legal city, Temiskaming Shores is not fully integrated geographically ‚Äî there exists a noticeable demarcation between New Liskeard/Dymond and Haileybury/North Cobalt. The downtown areas of New Liskeard and Haileybury are separated by 8 km-long Lakeshore Road. For most of its length, this road lacks sidewalks, which makes it quite impractical to travel through the city without using a motor vehicle. The STATO Trail, now completed, is intended to resolve this problem; the path runs along the waterfront by City Hall. City council has yet to approach Canada Post to have Temiskaming Shores recognized as a mailing address. Currently, mail is delivered to PO boxes and rural routes in the pre- amalgamation towns of New Liskeard (P0J 1P0), Haileybury (P0J 1K0), and North Cobalt (P0J 1R0).

The primary arterial route through Haileybury and New Liskeard also formerly held the business route designation Highway 11B. Temiskaming Shores and Cobalt share a small public transit system, Tri-Town Transit. The Ontario Northland bus service makes scheduled stops in Dymond and Haileybury. Shopping The city is the economic and service hub to a population of approximately 32,500 from small communities in the surrounding region. Professional services and large retailers continue to open in the community to service regional customers from both Ontario and Quebec. Timiskaming Square The city's one shopping mall, Timiskaming Square, is located in the Dymond area at 883303 Highway 65 (47.51 N, 79.67 W). Owned by Plaza REIT, it opened in 1977 and has 21 stores, anchored by Food Basics. The mall has 164,142 sq. ft. (15,249 m¬≤) of space. Its popularity in the 1980s contributed to the decline of the downtown businesses of Haileybury and to a lesser extent New Liskeard. Since then, large Walmart and Canadian Tire stores have been built nearby, resulting in a decline in mall business. As of July, 2019, the mall only had 6 stores and services left: Food Basics, Dollarama, The Source, Pet Valu, TD Canada Trust, and DriveTest.https://plaza.ca/timiskaming-square/ The supermarket in the mall had been a Loeb store until 2007, when a microburst damaged a large section of the roof and forced its temporary closure. The store was rebranded as Food Basics. Following Zellers' acquisition of Kmart Canada in 1998, the mall's Kmart was converted to a Zellers. Timiskaming Square already had a Zellers store, resulting in the mall having two Zellers anchor stores. This unusual setup continued until 2009, when one store was closed; Hart opened a new store in the former Zellers location, which has been subsequently closed. Many of the mall's customers are from Quebec, which is a short drive away on Highway 65. During the Sunday shopping debate, the shopping centre was cited as one of the primary reasons the local representative voted in favour of the bill.

An individual in a state of anergy often indicates that the immune system is unable to mount a normal immune response against a specific antigen, usually a self-antigen. Lymphocytes are said to be anergic when they fail to respond to their specific antigen. Anergy is one of three processes that induce tolerance, modifying the immune system to prevent self-destruction (the others being clonal deletion and immunoregulation). Mechanism This phenomenon was first described in B lymphocytes by Gustav Nossal and termed \\"clonal anergy.\\" The clones of B lymphocytes in this case can still be found alive in the circulation, but are ineffective at mounting immune responses. Later Ronald Schwartz and Marc Jenkins described a similar process operating in the T lymphocyte. Many viruses (HIV being the most extreme example) seem to exploit the immune system's use of tolerance induction to evade the immune system, though the suppression of specific antigens is done by fewer pathogens (notably Mycobacterium leprae). At the cellular level, \\"anergy\\" is the inability of an immune cell to mount a complete response against its target. In the immune system, circulating cells called lymphocytes form a primary army that defends the body against pathogenic viruses, bacteria and parasites. There are two major kinds of lymphocytes - the T lymphocyte and the B lymphocyte. Among the millions of lymphocytes in the human body, only a few actually are specific for any particular infectious agent. At the time of infection, these few cells must be recruited and allowed to multiply rapidly. This process ‚Äì called \\"clonal expansion\\" ‚Äì allows the body to quickly mobilise an army of clones, as and when required. Such immune response is anticipatory and its specificity is assured by pre-existing clones of lymphocytes, which expand in response to specific antigen (process called \\"clonal selection\\"). This specific clonal army then combats the pathogen until the body is free of the infection. Following clearance of the infection, the clones that are no longer needed die away naturally. However, a small number of the body's army of lymphocytes are able to react with proteins that are normally present in a healthy body. The clonal expansion of those cells can lead to autoimmune diseases, wherein the body attacks itself. In order to prevent this process, lymphocytes possess an intrinsic quality-control mechanism. This machinery shuts down the lymphocytes' ability to expand, if the trigger for the expansion turns out to be the body's own protein. T-cell anergy can arise when the T-cell does not receive appropriate co-stimulation in the presence of specific antigen recognition. B-cell anergy can be induced by exposure to soluble circulating antigen, and is often marked by a downregulation of surface IgM expression and partial blockade of intracellular signaling pathways. Molecular mechanism of anergy induction in T lymphocytes Stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) along with costimulatory receptors of a T lymphocyte triggers balanced activation of all the T-cell‚Äôs signalling pathways (full T-cell stimulation). In this case, beside other pathways, calcium dependent arm of a lymphocyte signalling is activated by TCR. This leads to an elevation of intracellular Ca+II concentration. Under this condition, calcium dependent phosphatase calcineurin removes phosphates from a transcriptional factor NFAT, which in turn translocates to the nucleus. Additionally, during full T-cell stimulation a costimulatory receptor CD28 activates PI3K or other pathways that eventually lead to increased nuclear levels of rel, NF-Œ∫B and AP-1 (transcription factors) much more than just by the TCR activation alone. AP-1, fos/jun heterodimer, further heterodimerizes with NFAT forming a transcriptional complex which promotes transcription of T-cell productive response associated genes. Those are for example IL-2 and its receptor. On the contrary, TCR signalling without costimulatory receptors sufficiently activates only the calcium arm of the signalling leading only to the activation of NFAT. However without the necessary induction of AP-1 by other pathways, activated NFAT is unable to form the transcriptional complex with AP-1, as it does during complete T-cell activation (productive response). In this case NFAT homodimerizes (complexes with itself), working as a transcriptional factor that induces anergy in the lymphocyte instead. NFAT homodimers are directly responsible for the expression of anergy associated genes such as ubiquitin ligase GRAIL or a protease caspase 3. Moreover, the expression levels of IL-2, but also for example TNFŒ± and IFNŒ≥, typical for productive response, are actively decreased in the anergized cell. Anergized cells tend to produce antiinflammatory IL-10 instead. There are 3 NFAT proteins in the T-cell, NFAT1, NFAT2 and NFAT4 and apparently are redundant to some extent. Thus when an antigen is properly presented to the T lymphocytes by an antigen presenting cell (APC), which displays the antigen on its MHC II complex and which activates T cell¬¥s costimulatory receptors, T lymphocytes undergo productive response. However, when T cells interacts with an antigen not presented by the APCs, that is very probably not the antigen that an immune response should be held against, the T cell undergoes anergy. It has also been shown that certain antigens properly presented by the APCs induce the T cell activation only weakly. This weak stimuli still activates NFAT sufficiently, however AP-1 is not, thereby the anergistic response takes place even with the costimulation. Strong stimulation of T-cells either by IL-2 or by TCR/costimulatory receptors can break the anergy. Clinical significance Anergy may be taken advantage of for therapeutic uses. The immune response to grafting of transplanted organs and tissues could be minimized without weakening the entire immune system‚Äî a side effect of immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporine. Anergy may also be used to induce activated lymphocytes to become unresponsive with autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Likewise, preventing anergy in response to a tumoral growth may help in anti-tumor responses. It might also be used for immunotherapeutic treatment of allergies. Dominant tolerance Dominant and recessive tolerance are forms of a peripheral tolerance (the other tolerance beside peripheral is a central tolerance). Where so called recessive tolerance is associated with anergized lymphocytes as described above, in the dominant form of tolerance, specialized T-reg cells which actively ablate the immune response are developed from the naive T lymphocyte. Similarly to recessive tolerance, unopposed NFAT signalling is also important for T-reg induction. In this case, the NFAT pathway activates another transcription factor - FOXP3 that is a marker of T-regs and participates in their genetic program. Testing The \\"Multitest M√©rieux\\" or \\"CMI Multitest\\" system (Multitest IMC, Istituto Merieux Italia, Rome, Italy) has been used as a general test of the level of cellular immunity. It is an intradermal test of skin reactivity (similar to tuberculin tests) in which a control (glycerol) is used with seven antigens of bacterial or fungal origin (tetanus toxoid, tuberculin, diphtheria, streptococcus, candida, trichophyton, and proteus). In this test reactions are categorized according to the number of antigens provoking a response and the summed extent of the skin response to all seven antigens. Here anergy is defined as a region of skin reactivity of 0‚Äì1 mm, hypoergy as a reaction of 2‚Äì9 mm in response to fewer than three antigens, normergic as a reaction of 10‚Äì39 mm or to three or more antigens, and hyperergy for a reaction of 40 mm or more. Experimental approaches to study anergy Various chemicals inducing/inhibiting described T cell signalling pathways can be used to study the anergy. The anergy in T cells can be induced by Ionomycin, the ionophore capable of raising intracellular concentration of calcium ions artificially. Conversely, Ca+II chelators such as EGTA can sequester Calcium ions making them unable to cause the anergy. Blocking of the pathway leading to the anergy can be also done by cyclosporin A, which is capable of inhibiting calcineurin - the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating of NFAT priming its activation. PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, along with ionomycin is used to induce full T cells activation by mimicking signals provided naturally by TCR/costimulatory receptors activation.

Within those novels he has the status of an authority, but he is sometimes referred to with amusement or scepticism. Like the 'mad poet' Navarth, he first appeared in the Demon Princes sequence but also is alluded to in a number of other unrelated stories. Unlike Navarth, the Baron never appears in person in these novels, but his monumental, many-volume work Life is frequently quoted. The lengthiest citations from it appear, with varying degrees of apparent relevance, as epigraphs to various chapters in the Demon Princes novels. (Vance characteristically makes use of substantial passages from imaginary writings, interviews or judicial transcripts as chapter-heading material, especially in that series.) Otherwise, the Baron and his work are occasionally referred to in passing or quoted by characters in the tales. Fictional (and always negative) reviews of Life also appear in The Killing Machine and The Face, usually dismissing it as snobbish, elitist and pretentious; one reviewer expresses a desire to thrash the Baron within an inch of his life before buying him a drink. In a footnote in Night Lamp Vance informs us, perhaps definitively, that the Baron‚Äôs great work Life consisted of twelve volumes (earlier novels suggest six or ten) and that it was in nature a ‚Äòphilosophical encyclopedia‚Äô. In the same passage Vance also asserts that towards the end of his life he ‚Äòwas excommunicated from the human race by the Assembly of Egalitarians. Baron Bodissey‚Äôs comment was succinct: \\"The point is moot\\". To this day the most erudite thinkers of the Gaean Reach ponder the significance of the remark‚Äô. Although Bodissey often expresses himself in pompous language, many of his dicta (a selection is given below) appear good sense, and it may be that he serves, at least occasionally, as a mouthpiece for Vance's personal opinions. An overly zealous cultural anthropologist and ethnologist named Kalikari Stone, Baron Bodissey, working on a grant from the Historical Institute of Naval Research on the planet Riverain, appears in Hayford Peirce's novel The Thirteenth Majestral (1989), a pastiche written in the manner of Jack Vance. He saves the book's protagonist from a dire end, although, to his dismayed surprise, at the cost of his own life.

He is widely recognised as one of the foremost Scottish poets of the 20th century. In 1999, Morgan was made the first Glasgow Poet Laureate. In 2004, he was named as the first Scottish national poet: The Scots Makar. Life and career Morgan was born in Glasgow and grew up in Rutherglen. His parents were Presbyterian. As a child he was not surrounded by books, nor did he have any literary acquaintances. Schoolmates labelled him a swot. He convinced his parents to finance his membership of several book clubs in Glasgow. The Faber Book of Modern Verse (1936) was a \\"revelation\\" to him, he later said. Morgan entered the University of Glasgow in 1937. It was at university that he studied French and Russian, while self-educating in \\"a good bit of Italian and German\\" as well. After interrupting his studies to serve in World War II as a non-combatant conscientious objector with the Royal Army Medical Corps, Morgan graduated in 1947 and became a lecturer at the University. He worked there until his retirement as a full professor in 1980. Morgan described 'CHANGE RULES!' as 'the supreme graffito', whose liberating double-take suggests both a lifelong commitment to formal experimentation and his radically democratic left-wing political perspectives. From traditional sonnet to blank verse, from epic seriousness to camp and ludic nonsense; and whether engaged in time-travelling space fantasies or exploring contemporary developments in physics and technology, the range of Morgan's voices is a defining attribute.See Colin Nicholson, Edwin Morgan: Inventions of Modernity (Manchester 2002) Morgan first outlined his sexuality in Nothing Not Giving Messages: Reflections on his Work and Life (1990). He had written many famous love poems, among them \\"Strawberries\\" and \\"The Unspoken\\", in which the love object was not gendered; this was partly because of legal problems at the time but also out of a desire to universalise them, as he made clear in an interview with Marshall Walker.Carcanet Press. At the opening of the Glasgow LGBT Centre in 1995, he read a poem he had written for the occasion, and presented it to the Centre as a gift. In 2002, he became the patron of Our Story Scotland. At the opening of the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh on 9 October 2004, Liz Lochhead read a poem written for the occasion by Morgan, titled \\"Poem for the Opening of the Scottish Parliament\\". She was announced as Morgan's successor as Scots Makar in January 2011. Near the end of his life, Morgan reached a new audience after collaborating with the Scottish band Idlewild on their album The Remote Part. In the closing moments of the album's final track \\"In Remote Part/ Scottish Fiction\\", he recites a poem, \\"Scottish Fiction\\", written specifically for the song. In 2007, Morgan contributed two poems to the compilation Ballads of the Book, for which a range of Scottish writers created poems to be made into songs by Scottish musicians. Morgan's songs \\"The Good Years\\" and \\"The Weight of Years\\" were performed by Karine Polwart and Idlewild respectively. Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney \\"[paid] formal homage\\" during a 2005 visit. In later life Morgan was cared for at a residential home as his health worsened. He published a collection in April 2010, months before his death, titled Dreams and Other Nightmares to mark his 90th birthday. Up until his death, he was the last survivor of the canonical 'Big Seven' (the others being Hugh MacDiarmid, Robert Garioch, Norman MacCaig, Iain Crichton Smith, George Mackay Brown, and Sorley MacLean). On 17 August 2010, Edwin Morgan died of pneumonia in Glasgow at the age of 90.Scotland's national poet Edwin Morgan dies aged 90, STV. The Scottish Poetry Library made the announcement in the morning. Tributes came from, among others, politicians Alex Salmond and Iain Gray, as well as Carol Ann Duffy, the UK Poet Laureate. Testamentary provisions First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond's leader's speech to the Scottish National Party Conference at Inverness on 22 October 2011 referred to Morgan's bequest of ¬£918,000 to the party in his will as \\"transformational\\". The next day it was announced that all of the bequest would be used for the party's independence referendum campaign. Morgan also left ¬£45,000 to a number of friends, former colleagues and charity organisations and set aside another ¬£1 million for the creation of the Edwin Morgan Poetry Award, an annual award scheme for young poets in Scotland. In 2012, The Edwin Morgan Trust was established to administer the generous Award which the poet wished to create from the earnings of a long and distinguished writing career. From April 27, 2020 The Edwin Morgan Trust will be celebrating the life and work of Edwin Morgan with a year long centenary programme. Poetry Poetry by Edwin Morgan inscribed on the pavement on Candleriggs, Glasgow. Morgan worked in a wide range of forms and styles, from the sonnet to concrete poetry. His Collected Poems appeared in 1990. He has also translated from a wide range of languages, including Russian, Hungarian, French, Italian, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Old English (Beowulf). Many of these are collected in Rites of Passage. Selected Translations (1976). His 1952 translation of Beowulf has become a standard translation in America. Morgan was also influenced by the American beat poets, with their simple, accessible ideas and language being prominent features in his work. His poetry may be studied as a Scottish Text for National 5 English. In 1968 Morgan wrote \\"Starlings In George Square\\". This poem could be read as a comment on society's reluctance to accept the integration of different races. Other people have also considered it to be about the Russian Revolution in which \\"Starling\\" could be a reference to \\"Stalin\\". Other notable poems include: * \\"The Death of Marilyn Monroe\\" (1962) - an outpouring of emotion after the death of a prominent and exceptional woman * \\"King Billy\\" (1968) - flashback of the gang warfare in Glasgow led by Billy Fullerton in the Thirties. * \\"Glasgow 5 March 1971\\" - robbery by two youths by pushing an unsuspecting couple through a shop window on Sauchiehall Street * \\"In the Snackbar\\" - concise description of an encounter with a disabled pensioner in a Glasgow restaurant. * \\"A Good Year for Death\\" (26 September 1977) - a description of five famous people from the world of popular culture who died in 1977 * \\"Poem for the Opening of the Scottish Parliament\\" - which was read by Liz Lochhead at the opening ceremony because he was too ill to read it in person.

He ruled over the Muslim provinces of North Africa (Ifriqiya), and directed the Islamic conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania (Spain, Portugal, Andorra and part of France). Background Various suggestions have been made as to his ancestry. Some say his father belonged to the Lakhmid clan of semi-nomads who lived east of the Euphrates and were allies of the Sassanians,Editor's note, p. 41 of the Spanish translation of Al-Bakri. while others claim he belonged to the Banu Bakr confederation.These conflicting accounts are mentioned by al-Baladhuri (p. 362 of English translation), Al-Bakri (p. 41 of Spanish translation). One account stated that Musa's father was taken captive after the fall of the Mesopotamian city of Ayn al-Tamr (633). According to this account, he was an Arab Christian who was one of a number being held hostage there. However, al- Baladhuri, relating the same events,English translation, p. 396-397. states he was an Arab of the Balƒ´ tribe, from Jabal al-Jalƒ´l in Syria.Hitti, on p. 397 of his translation of al-Baladhuri, states this is Mt. Galilee, presumably intending the reader to infer the place of that name near Jerusalem. But according to Yaqut, KitƒÅb mu'jam al-buldƒÅn, the name applies to mountains which extend up the coast of Syria to Homs and across to Damascus. As a slave, Musa's father entered the service of Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan (governor of Egypt and son of the caliph Marwan I) who gave him his freedom.al-Baladhuri, p. 397 of English translation; the same in other sources, although Al-Bakri (p. 41 of Spanish translation) says that some say he was liberated by Uthman. He returned to Syria where Musa was born at a place called Kafarmara or Kafarmathra.al-Baladhuri, p. 397 of English translation, and editor's note. The date of his birth has been given as 640.Al-Bakri, p. 42 of Spanish translation. Musa was made co-governor of Iraq by the caliph Abd al-Malik, together with the caliph's brother Bishr ibn Marwan. There was some quarrel over missing tax money, and Musa was given the choice: pay a huge fine, or pay with his head. His father's patron, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan, had a high opinion of Musa, and paid the ransom;Ibn Abd al-Hakam, p. 329 of the English translation, p. 203 of Torrey's Arabic text. he was later responsible for appointing Musa to be governor of Ifriqiya. Islamic conquest of Maghreb Hasan ibn al-Nu'man was sent to continue the Islamic conquest in North Africa all the way to Morocco. However, his policies were quite strict and he did not tolerate Berber traditions. He was relieved of his command for allowing continuing Byzantine attacks. Musa bin Nusayr was then sent to renew the attacks against the Berbers. But he did not impose Islam by force, rather, he respected Berber traditions and used diplomacy in subjugating them. This proved highly successful, as many Berbers converted to Islam and even entered his army as soldiers and officers, possibly including Tariq bin ZiyadIt is not completely certain that Tariq was a Berber. See the article on Tariq bin Ziyad for a list of the several possibilities. who would lead the later Islamic expedition in Iberia. Governor In 698 Musa was made the governor of Ifriqiya and was responsible for completing the conquest of North Africa and of the Balearic Islands and Sardinia. He was the first governor of Ifriqiya not to be subordinate to the governor of Egypt. He was the first Muslim general to take Tangiers and occupy it;al-Baladhuri, p. 362 of English translation. his troops also conquered the Sous, effectively taking control of all of the northern half of Morocco. He also had to deal with constant attacks from the Byzantine navy and he built a navy that would go on to conquer the islands of Ibiza, Majorca, and Menorca. Conquest of Al-Andalus (Note: Most of what follows in this section is to be found first in Ibn Abd al-Hakam, then repeated by others, e.g. the AkhbƒÅr majm≈´ øa, with more detail but little real variation.) Background Muslim and Christian sources quote that while Musa bin Nusayr was eager to cross the Straits of Gibraltar to Hispania, he determined to do so only when a Visigoth nobleman, Julian, Count of Ceuta, had encouraged him to invade Iberia, telling him of the people's sufferings and the injustice of their king, Roderic, while giving him cause for conquest by telling him of the riches that would be found, and of the many palaces, gardens and beauties of Hispania. Legend tells that Julian wished for the fall of the Visigothic kingdom because his daughter, Florinda la Cava, had been raped by Roderic. Invasion After a successful minor raid on the Spanish coast at Tarifa where the raiding force returned with a booty captured without any reported resistance, Musa decided to land a larger invasion force. Tariq bin Ziyad crossed the strait with approximately 7,000 Berbers and Arabs, and landed at Gibraltar (from Jebel Tariq, meaning Tariq's mountain in Arabic). The expedition's purpose must have been to conduct further raids and explore the territory. Tariq's army contained some guides supplied by Julian. Three weeks after his landing, the Muslims were faced with a superior Visigoth royal army of 100,000 troops under Roderic. The Muslims won the Battle of Guadalete, and the entire Visigoth nobility was all but exterminated at the battle. The Muslims then marched towards C√≥rdoba, bypassing several strong fortifications. The well-defended city fell, and Tariq established a garrison there consisting mainly of the city's Jews who welcomed the invaders, having been subjected to conversion from the Visigoths for centuries. Tariq then continued on his way to Toledo. Musa, learning of Tariq's successes, landed in Iberia with an army of 18,000 Berbers and Arabs. He planned to rendezvous with Tariq at Toledo, but first proceeded to take Seville, which Tariq had bypassed, and where Musa met stiff resistance, and succeeded after three months of siege. He then campaigned in the province of Lusitania, eliminating the remaining Gothic resistance there. His last destination before meeting Tariq was to subdue M√©rida, capital of Lusitania. After five months of siege and inconclusive fighting, a group of Ceutans pretended to be Christian reinforcements and managed to convince the guards into opening the gates. Once inside, the \\"reinforcements\\", nearly 700, overwhelmed the guards and managed to keep the gates open for the Muslims to enter the city and capture it. After M√©rida, Musa divided his forces, taking the majority with him to meet Tariq at Toledo where he would remain for winter. The remainder of his forces were led by his son 'Abd al-Aziz, who would return to Seville to deal with an uprising. 'Abd al-Aziz made short work of the rebellion. He then conducted several campaigns on the return journey in the territories of Lusitania. Coimbra and Santar√©m were captured in the spring of 714. 'Abd al-Aziz then campaigned in Murcia. The Duke of Murcia, Theodemir, or Tudmir as he was called by the Muslims, surrendered to 'Abd al-Aziz after several hard-fought engagements in April 713. The terms imposed on Theodemir declared that the duke would keep the citadel of Orihuela and several other settlements, including Alicante and Lorca on the Mediterranean, that his followers will not be killed, taken prisoner, forced into Islam, and that their churches will not be burned. It also demanded that Theodemir not encourage or support others to resist the Muslims, and that he and every citizen of his dominion pay an annual tax in money and other goods. Musa finally met up with Tariq where there was an argument over the latter's booty, which reportedly included a gold table covered with gems and other precious stones that had reputedly once belonged to Solomon.See the article on Tariq bin Ziyad for more details of the supposed disagreements, accounts of which vary considerably. Meanwhile, Musa's messenger, Mughith al-Rumi (the Roman) who had been sent to Caliph al-Walid I to inform him of the situation in Hispania, had returned. The Caliph requested Musa to withdraw and to report in person to Damascus. Musa chose to ignore this order temporarily, knowing that if he did not continue his advance, Visigoth resistance may increase and turn the tables against the Muslims. Having done so, he continued with Tariq to the north; Musa heading for Zaragoza, to which he lay siege, while Tariq continued to the provinces of Le√≥n and Castile, capturing the towns of Le√≥n and Astorga. Musa continued after taking Zaragoza to the north, taking Oviedo and reaching as far as the Bay of Biscay. The Islamic conquest of Iberia now complete, Musa proceeded to place governors and prefects throughout the newly conquered Al-Andalus, before returning to Damascus with most of the booty captured from the Jihad. Return to Damascus Both conquerors of Spain were therefore summoned by the caliph to Damascus. Tariq arrived first, according to some accounts. But then the caliph was taken ill. So the caliph's brother, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik became temporarily in charge, and asked Musa, who was arriving with a cavalcade of soldiers and spoils, to delay his grand entry into the city. He most certainly intended to claim the glories brought from the conquest for himself. But Musa dismissed this request, triumphantly entered Damascus anyway, and brought the booty before the ailing Al-Walid I, which brought Musa and Tariq unprecedented popularity amongst the people of Damascus. Al-Walid I then died a few days later and was succeeded by his brother Sulayman, who demanded that Musa deliver up all his spoils. When Musa complained, Sulayman stripped him of his rank and confiscated all the booty, including the table which had reputedly once belonged to Solomon. One of Musa's sons, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, married Egilona who was wife of Roderic. She asked 'Abd al-Aziz why his guests did not bow to him as they used to do in the presence of his father. It was reported that he began to force guests to bow to him. It was rumoured that he had secretly become a Christian, and a group of Arabs assassinated him, cut off his head and sent it to the caliph. Sulayman had Musa in his audience when the head arrived, and seeing whose it was, callously asked Musa if he recognized it. Musa maintained his dignity, saying he recognized it as belonging to someone who had always practiced the faith fervently, and cursed the men who had killed him.Ibn Abd al-Hakam, p. 212-213 of Arabic text, p. 51-52 of Spanish translation. Another son, Abd Allah, who had acted as governor of Ifriqiya after Musa, was executed on the orders of the caliph on suspicion of having had killed the man who had replaced him.Ibn Abd al-Hakam, p. 213-214 of Arabic text, p. 55-56 of Spanish translation. Death Musa died naturally while on the Hajj pilgrimage with Sulayman in about the year 715‚Äì716. Because of his disgrace, and the misfortunes of his sons, there was a tendency among medieval historians of the Maghreb to attribute his deeds (the conquest of Tangiers and the Sous) to Uqba ibn Nafi.see e.g. article by Ahmed Benabb√®s cited below which analyzes this tendency. Brunschvig, cited below, has stated that medieval historians could be divided into those for or against Musa. The Moroccan peak Jebel Musa is named for Musa bin Nusayr according to the 14th-century Berber Muslim geographer Ibn Battuta.H.T. Norris, Ibn Battutah's Andalusian Journey\\", The Geographical Journal, 1959. Al-Bakri in his al-Maslik wa al-Mamalik, mentions that Musa Ibn Nusayr was buried in Zaragoza. In legend Less than 200 years after his death, Musa ibn Nusayr became the subject of fantastic legends. These tales were first recorded in the late 9th or early 10th century by ibn al-Faqih, who wrote that Musa was ordered by the caliph to investigate reports of a strange city called al-Baht.Ibn al-Faqih al-HamadƒÅnƒ´, p. 108-112 of French translation. Musa marched from Qayrawan to the deserts of Spain and came upon a city that was surrounded by walls with no entrance. Those who attempted to look over the wall became entranced and jumped, laughing deliriously. Musa then proceeded to a nearby lake, which contained copper jars. When opened, a genie emerged from each one. A more extensive version of the same legend is recorded in \\"The City of Brass,\\" a tale in One Thousand and One Nights, in which Musa encounters many other marvels, such as a palace filled with jewels, whose only human occupant was the embalmed corpse of a beautiful woman, guarded by two robot warriors.The tale of \\"The City of Brass\\", in Burton's edition vol. 6 p. 86-121. The 17th-century historian Ibn Abi Dinar used Musa's decline in fortune as an object lesson in the vagaries of human existence, with some exaggerations: \\"Musa, who had conquered half the inhabited world, who had acquired so many riches, died in poverty, begging alms from passers-by, after having been abandoned by the last of his servants. Overcome by shame and misery, he wished for death, and God gave it to him. I only mention the details of Musa's death to give my contemporaries, who are poorly read, a striking example of the vicissitudes of human life\\".Ibn Abi Dinar, p. 60-61 of French translation. Probably the most extensive work to be inspired by the life of Musa is a section of the anonymous KitƒÅb al-imƒÅma w'as-siyƒÅsa, which contains a lengthy description of his deeds accompanied by many supposed speeches and sayings. Unlike many other authors, such as Ibn Abd al-Hakam, the work is entirely favourable to Musa.It has been suggested that this life of Musa originated with an Egyptian descendant of his son Marwan, in the 2nd half of the 9th century: M. Makki, \\"Egipto y los or√≠genes de la historiograf√≠a √°rabe-espa√±ola\\", Revista del Instituto Egipcio de Estudios Isl√°micos en Madrid, v. 5 157-248 (1957).

It is a subspecies of the cowpea, an Old World plant domesticated in Africa, and is sometimes simply called a cowpea. The common commercial variety is called the California Blackeye; it is pale-colored with a prominent black spot. The American South has countless varieties, many of them heirloom, that vary in size from the small lady peas to very large ones. The color of the eye may be black, brown, red, pink, or green. All the peas are green when freshly shelled and brown or buff when dried. A popular variation of the black-eyed pea is the purple hull pea; it is usually green with a prominent purple or pink spot. The currently accepted botanical name for the black-eyed pea is Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata, although previously it was classified in the genus Phaseolus. Vigna unguiculata subsp. dekindtiana is the wild relative and Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis is the related asparagus bean. Other beans of somewhat similar appearance, such as the frijol ojo de cabra (goat's-eye bean) of northern Mexico, are sometimes incorrectly called black-eyed peas, and vice versa. History The black eye pea is cultivated throughout the world. Most of the black-eyed pea cultivation occurred in the Southern United States as early as the 17th century in Virginia. The crop would also eventually prove popular in Texas. Throughout the South, the black-eyed pea is still a widely used ingredient in soul food and cuisines of the Southern United States. The planting of crops of black-eyed peas was promoted by George Washington Carver because, as a legume, it adds nitrogen to the soil and has high nutritional value. Black-eyed peas contain calcium (41 mg), folate (356 Œºg), protein (13.22 g), fiber (11.1 g) and vitamin A (26 IU), among other nutrients, with less than of food energy in a serving. Cultivation This heat-loving crop should be sown after all danger of frost has passed and the soil is warm. Seeds sown too early will rot before germination. Black-eyed peas are extremely drought tolerant, so excessive watering should be avoided. The crop is relatively free of pests and disease. Root-knot nematodes can be a problem, especially if crops are not rotated. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, fertilization can exclude nitrogen three weeks after germination. The blossom produces nectar plentifully, and large areas can be a source of honey. Because the bloom attracts a variety of pollinators, care must be taken in the application of insecticides to avoid label violations. After planting the pea, it should start to grow after 2‚Äì5 days. Lucky New Year food New Year's Day in Alabama: black-eyed peas, ham hock, and pepper sauce Southern United States In the Southern United States, eating black-eyed peas or Hoppin' John (a traditional soul food) on New Year's Day is thought to bring prosperity in the new year. \\"On New Year's Day, it gets the full Southern treatment, which usually means Hoppin' John ‚Äì a traditional soul food consisting of black-eyed peas cooked with ham hocks and spices, served over rice. In the South, eating black-eyed peas on New Year's is thought to bring prosperity\\" The peas are typically cooked with a pork product for flavoring (such as bacon, fatback, ham bones, or hog jowls) and diced onion, and served with a hot chili sauce or a pepper-flavored vinegar. The traditional meal also includes Cabbage, collard, turnip, or mustard greens, and ham. The peas, since they swell when cooked, symbolize prosperity; the greens symbolize money; the pork, because pigs root forward when foraging, represents positive motion. Cornbread, which represents gold, also often accompanies this meal. Several legends exist as to the origin of this custom. Two popular explanations for the South‚Äôs association with peas and good luck dates back to the American Civil War. The first is associated with General William T. Sherman‚Äôs march of the Union Army to the sea, during which they pillaged the Confederates' food supplies. Stories say peas and salted pork were said to have been left untouched, because of the belief that they were animal food unfit for human consumption. Southerners considered themselves lucky to be left with some supplies to help them survive the winter, and black-eyed peas evolved into a representation of good luck. One challenge to this legend is that General Sherman brought backup supplies with him including three days of animal feed and would have been unlikely to have left even animal feed untouched. In addition, the dates of the first average frost for Atlanta and Savannah, respectively, are November 13 and November 28. As Sherman's march was from November 15 to December 21, 1864, it is improbable, although possible, that the Union Army would have come across standing fields of black-eyed peas as relayed in most versions of the legend. In another Southern tradition, black- eyed peas were a symbol of emancipation for African-Americans who had previously been enslaved, and who after the Civil War were officially freed on New Years Day.

Culinary uses worldwide Several cups of ch√® ƒë·∫≠u tr·∫Øng, a Vietnamese dessert made with black-eyed peas Lobia curry, a black-eyed peas dish from India Africa and Middle East In Egypt, black-eyed peas are called lobia. Cooked with onions, garlic, meat, and tomato juice, and served with Egyptian rice with some pastina called shaerya mixed in, it makes the most famous rice dish in Egypt. In Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, lobya or green black-eyed-beans are cooked with onion, garlic, tomatoes, peeled and chopped, olive oil, salt and black pepper. In Nigeria in West Africa and the Caribbean, a traditional dish called akara is made of mashed black-eyed peas to which is added salt, onions and/or peppers. The mixture is then fried. In Nigeria, there‚Äôs also a pudding made from it called ‚Äòmoin-moin‚Äô where it is ground and mixed with seasoning as well as some plant proteins before it is steamed. This is served with various carbohydrate rich foods such as pap, rice or garri. Asia and the Pacific In Indonesia, black-eyed peas are called kacang tunggak or kacang tolo in the local language. They are commonly used in curry dishes such as sambal goreng, a kind of hot and spicy red curry dish, sayur brongkos, or sayur lodeh. The bean is commonly used across India. In North India, black-eyed peas are called lobia or rongi and cooked like daal, served with boiled rice. In Maharashtra, they are called chawli and made into a curry called chawli amti or chawli usal. In Karnataka they are called alsande kalu and used in the preparation of huli, a popular type of curry. In South Kanara district they are called as lathanay dha beeja and are cooked in spiced coconut paste to make a saucy curry or a dry coconut curry. In Tamil Nadu, they are called karamani or thattapayaru and used in various recipes, including being boiled and made into a salad-like sundal (often during the Ganesh Chaturthi and Navratri festivals). In Andhra Pradesh they are known by the name 'alasandalu' and are used for variety of recipes most popularly for 'vadas'. In Kerala, they are a part of the Sadhya dish, Olan. In Vietnam, black-eyed peas are used in a sweet dessert called ch√® ƒë·∫≠u tr·∫Øng (black-eyed peas and sticky rice with coconut milk). Europe In Cyprus ( œÜœÅŒ≠œÉŒ∫Œø ŒªŒøœÖŒ≤ŒØ) and Turkey (b√∂r√ºlce salatasƒ±), blanched black-eyed peas are eaten as salad with a dressing of olive oil, salt, lemon juice, onions and garlic. In Portugal, black-eyed peas are served with boiled cod and potatoes, with tuna, and in salads. The Americas ;North America \\"Hoppin' John\\", made of black-eyed peas or field peas, rice, and pork, is a traditional dish of parts of the Southern United States. Texas caviar, another traditional dish in the American South, is made from black- eyed peas marinated in vinaigrette-style dressing and chopped garlic. ;South America In Brazil's northeastern state of Bahia, especially in the city of Salvador, black-eyed peas are used in a traditional street food of Nigerian origin called akara. The beans are peeled and mashed, and the resulting paste is made into balls and deep fried in dend√™. Acaraj√© is typically served split in half and stuffed with vatap√°, caruru, diced green and red tomatoes, fried sun-dried shrimp and homemade hot sauce. In the northern part of Colombia, they are used to prepare a fritter called bu√±uelo. The beans are immersed in water for a few hours to loosen their skins and soften them. The skins are then removed either by hand or with the help of a manual grinder. Once the skins are removed, the bean is ground or blended, and eggs are added, which produces a soft mix. The mix is fried in hot oil. It makes a nutritious breakfast meal. In Guyana, South America, and Trinidad and Tobago, it is one of the most popular type of beans cooked with rice, the main one being red kidney beans, also referred to as red beans. It is also cooked as a snack or appetizer on its own. On New Year's Eve (referred to as Old Year's Night in Guyana and Suriname), families cook a traditional dish called cook-up rice. The dish comprises rice, black-eyed peas, and other peas and a variety of meats cooked in coconut milk and seasonings. According to tradition, cook-up rice should be the first thing consumed in the New Year for good luck. Cook-up rice is also made as an everyday dish.

Specifically excluded from epigraphy are the historical significance of an epigraph as a document and the artistic value of a literary composition. A person using the methods of epigraphy is called an epigrapher or epigraphist. For example, the Behistun inscription is an official document of the Achaemenid Empire engraved on native rock at a location in Iran. Epigraphists are responsible for reconstructing, translating, and dating the trilingual inscription and finding any relevant circumstances. It is the work of historians, however, to determine and interpret the events recorded by the inscription as document. Often, epigraphy and history are competences practised by the same person. An epigraph or epigram is any sort of text, from a single grapheme (such as marks on a pot that abbreviate the name of the merchant who shipped commodities in the pot) to a lengthy document (such as a treatise, a work of literature, or a hagiographic inscription). Epigraphy overlaps other competences such as numismatics or palaeography. When compared to books, most inscriptions are short. The media and the forms of the graphemes are diverse: engravings in stone or metal, scratches on rock, impressions in wax, embossing on cast metal, cameo or intaglio on precious stones, painting on ceramic or in fresco. Typically the material is durable, but the durability might be an accident of circumstance, such as the baking of a clay tablet in a conflagration. The study of ideographic inscriptions, that is inscriptions representing an idea or concept, may also be called ideography. The German equivalent Sinnbildforschung was a scientific discipline in the Third Reich, but was later dismissed as being highly ideological.Mees, Bernard Thomas, The Science of the Swastika, Budapest / New York 2008. Epigraphic research overlaps with the study of petroglyphs, which deals with specimens of pictographic, ideographic and logographic writing. The study of ancient handwriting, usually in ink, is a separate field, palaeography. Epigraphy also differs from iconography, as it is confines itself to meaningful symbols containing messages. Scope Epigraphy is a primary tool of archaeology when dealing with literate cultures. The US Library of Congress classifies epigraphy as one of the auxiliary sciences of history. Epigraphy also helps identify a forgery: epigraphic evidence formed part of the discussion concerning the James Ossuary. Arabesque epigraphy with various Maghrebi Arabic scripts in the Myrtle Court of the Alhambra. The character of the writing, the subject of epigraphy, is a matter quite separate from the nature of the text, which is studied in itself. Texts inscribed in stone are usually for public view and so they are essentially different from the written texts of each culture. Not all inscribed texts are public, however: in Mycenaean Greece the deciphered texts of \\"Linear B\\" were revealed to be largely used for economic and administrative record keeping. Informal inscribed texts are \\"graffiti\\" in its original sense. History The high medieval Pr√ºfening dedicatory inscription, composed in Latin and stamped in Roman square capitals The science of epigraphy has been developing steadily since the 16th century. Principles of epigraphy vary culture by culture, and the infant science in European hands concentrated on Latin inscriptions at first. Individual contributions have been made by epigraphers such as Georg Fabricius (1516‚Äì1571); Stefano Antonio Morcelli (1737‚Äì1822); Luigi Gaetano Marini (1742‚Äì1815); August Wilhelm Zumpt (1815‚Äì1877); Theodor Mommsen (1817‚Äì1903); Emil H√ºbner (1834‚Äì1901); Franz Cumont (1868‚Äì1947); Louis Robert (1904‚Äì1985). The Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, begun by Mommsen and other scholars, has been published in Berlin since 1863, with wartime interruptions. It is the largest and most extensive collection of Latin inscriptions. New fascicles are still produced as the recovery of inscriptions continues. The Corpus is arranged geographically: all inscriptions from Rome are contained in volume 6. This volume has the greatest number of inscriptions; volume 6, part 8, fascicle 3 was just recently published (2000). Specialists depend on such on-going series of volumes in which newly discovered inscriptions are published, often in Latin, not unlike the biologists' Zoological Record‚Äî the raw material of history. Greek epigraphy has unfolded in the hands of a different team, with different corpora. There are two. The first is Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum of which four volumes came out, again at Berlin, 1825-1877. This marked a first attempt at a comprehensive publication of Greek inscriptions copied from all over the Greek-speaking world. Only advanced students still consult it, for better editions of the texts have superseded it. The second, modern corpus is Inscriptiones Graecae arranged geographically under categories: decrees, catalogues, honorary titles, funeral inscriptions, various, all presented in Latin, to preserve the international neutrality of the field of classics. Other such series include the Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum (Etruscan inscriptions), Corpus Inscriptionum Crucesignatorum Terrae Sanctae (Crusaders' inscriptions), Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum (Celtic inscriptions), Corpus Inscriptionum Iranicarum (Iranian inscriptions), \\"Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia\\" and \\"Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period\\" (Sumerian and Akkadian inscriptions) and so forth. Egyptian hieroglyphs were solved using the Rosetta Stone, which was a multilingual stele in Classical Greek, Demotic Egyptian and Classical Egyptian hieroglyphs. The work was done by the French scholar, Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, and the British scientist Thomas Young. The interpretation of Maya hieroglyphs was lost as a result of the Spanish Conquest of Central America. However, recent work by Maya epigraphers and linguists has yielded a considerable amount of information on this complex writing system.

Done under supervision of Maximus legatus of II legion.) =Materials= Inscriptions were commonly incised on stone, marble, metal, terracotta, or wood (though this last material has hardly ever survived, except in Egypt). In Egypt and Mesopotamia hard stones were frequently used for the purpose, and the inscriptions are therefore well preserved and easy to read. In Greece the favourite material, especially in Athens, was white marble, which takes an admirably clear lettering, but is liable to weathering of the surface if exposed, and to wear if rebuilt into pavements or similar structures. Many other kinds of stone, both hard and soft, were often used, especially crystalline limestones, which do not easily take a smooth surface, and which, therefore, are often difficult to decipher, owing to accidental marks or roughness of the material. The metal most commonly used for inscriptions was bronze: flat tablets of this were often made for affixing to the walls of temples and other buildings. Occasionally such tablets were made of silver or gold; and inscriptions were often incised on vessels made of any of these metals. Inscriptions on metal were nearly always incised, not cast. An important class of inscriptions are the legends on coins; these were struck from the die. (cf. numismatics.) Clay was very extensively used for inscriptions in Mesopotamia and in Crete. In this case the symbols were incised or impressed on specially prepared tablets when the clay was soft, and it was subsequently hardened by fire. In Greece, many inscriptions on vases were painted before firing, in that case often having reference to the scenes represented, or incised after firing; potsherds (ostraka) were often used as a cheap writing material. Inscriptions were also often impressed from a mould upon wet clay before firing, in the case of tiles, amphora handles, etc., and in these cases often supply valuable information as to the buildings to which they belong or the place from which they took their origin. The tools used for making inscriptions varied with the material; most of them were some kind of chisel, usually with a square blade; early inscriptions were sometimes made on hard rock by successive blows with a punch or pointed hammer. Sometimes a circular punch was used for O or a letter of which O formed a part. =Styles of cutting= Early inscriptions, which are often amateur work, are frequently very irregular in their cutting. But in almost all examples of later work, the inscriptions are evidently cut by professionals, and there are definite styles and methods belonging to various places and periods. In Egypt, for instance, the hieroglyphs are carefully and delicately cut in early times, and in later periods become more careless and conventional. In Greece, the best work was done in the 5th and 4th centuries BC in Athens; the letters were all exact and regular in shape, with no adventitious ornaments, and were, especially in the 5th century, usually exactly aligned with the letters above and below, as well as those on each side. At that time all the strokes were made of equal thickness, but in the 4th century BC and later there came in the custom of holding the chisel obliquely to the surface, thus producing a wedge- shaped stroke. A similar custom in Mesopotamia gave rise to the so-called cuneiform system. On metal inscriptions in Greece this same effect appears earlier than stone or marble. In the 3rd century and later it becomes common to introduce apices or ornamental ends to the strokes, a custom which prevails to the present day in our ordinary capital letters. The custom of making different strokes and different parts of curves of varying thickness became common in Roman inscriptions, which developed a monumental style of their own, varying from period to period. Inscriptions can often be approximately dated by the style of the cutting as well as by the shapes of the letters; skill in doing this can only be acquired by a careful and minute study of originals and facsimiles. (cf. dating methodologies in archaeology.) Inscriptions vary greatly in size according to the position where they were intended to be read, their purpose, and the skill of the cutter. Some inscriptions are of great length, the longest, a statement of accounts of the temple at Delos, under Athenian administration, being nearly half as long as a book of Thucydides; and many other inscriptions approach this in length. Symbols and forms of writing Most of the forms of writing known to us originated in some system of picture-writing (cf. also pictography, which developed into a hieroglyphic system. Such systems appear to have originated independently in different parts of the world ‚Äî in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete, among the Hittites and in China and America. The evidence for all of these is mainly to be found in inscriptions. The development from Ideographs (or direct representation of an object or idea) to symbols of phonetic value, and so to syllabaries or alphabets, took place in many different systems to various degrees. But the first people to invent a completely alphabetic system of writing were the Phoenicians, from whom the Greeks borrowed (some scholars believe, but with no proving) it with certain modifications and improvements. From the Greeks was derived the Latin, and from the two all the alphabets of European peoples. It is still a matter of dispute whether the Phoenician was derived from the Egyptian. An inscription using cipher runes, the Elder Futhark, and the Younger Futhark, on the 9th-century R√∂k runestone in Sweden The hieroglyphic symbols naturally tended to be conventionalised and simplified for convenience of cutting, in accordance with the materials and tools employed. In many cases they developed from a pictorial to a linear form. It is possible that some of these linear forms may not be derived from hieroglyphs, but from purely conventional geometrical forms. such as widely used at all periods and places as owners' or masons' marks. The tendency of linear forms to become wedge- shaped is most conspicuous in cuneiform, but as has been noticed, the same tendency occurs in Greek inscriptions incised on bronze. In the north of Europe the Ogham inscriptions are alphabetic, and are apparently an independent invention on arbitrary lines, like the Morse code; but Runes, which were extensively used in the same region, are derived from the Greek or the Latin alphabets. In most alphabetic systems there are also found in inscriptions certain symbols which are not strictly alphabetic or phonetic in character. The commonest of these are the various systems of numerals that are used in different times and places. It is impossible here to give any full description of these different systems; but a brief account may be given of the principles underlying them. Most of them are based upon a decimal system, doubtless owing to the habit of counting on the fingers. In some cases the symbols are simple and obvious, as in the Cretan script, where circles (or rhombi), dots and lines are used for hundreds, tens and units, each being repeated as often as necessary; and a similar system for the lower denominations is used at Epidaurus in the 4th century BC. In Athens the usual system was to indicate each denomination by its initial, M for ŒúœçœÅŒπŒøŒπ (10,000), X for œáŒØŒªŒπŒøŒπ (1,000), H for ŒµŒ∫Œ±œÑœåŒΩ (100), Œî for Œ¥Œ≠Œ∫Œ± (10), œÄ for œÄŒµŒΩœÑŒµ (5) and I for units. The other Greek system followed that derived from the Phoenicians, using the letters of the alphabet in their conventional order from one to nine, 10 to 90 and 100 to 900; in this arrangement obsolete letters were retained in their original places so as to give the requisite number of 27 symbols. The Roman system of numerals ‚Äî M, D, C, L, X, V, I (for 1,000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1) is generally supposed to have arisen from the adaptation of those symbols in the Greek alphabet which the Romans did not want; an alternative theory is that it is simplified from a series of ideographs representing the spread hand, the fingers and so on. Ancient Greek boustrophedon inscription, Gortyn code, Crete, 5th century BC Apart from numerals, the use of initials in the place of complete words was not common in early times. It became, however, very frequent in Roman inscriptions, which sometimes are made up almost entirely of such abbreviations and can only be understood by those familiar with the formulae. A list of the commonest of these will be found under list of classical abbreviations. Compendia or monograms also occur in later Greek and Roman times, and become very common and very difficult to interpret in early Christian and Byzantine inscriptions. Some kind of punctuation is often found in inscriptions of all kinds. In Greek inscriptions a vertical line or a dot, or dots, sometimes indicates the separation between sentences or words, but words are seldom separated by spaces as in modern printing, so that the text is continuous and no division of words exists. This is particularly the case with Greek inscriptions of the best period. In Roman inscriptions it was usual to separate the words by dots. In certain inscriptions a cross (15px) was used to indicate the beginning of an inscription, especially when its direction was erratic. Christian inscriptions sometimes begin with a cross, which doubtless had a symbolic meaning; and a leaf or other device was often placed at the end. The direction of the writing varies greatly in different places and times. The letters or symbols may be arranged vertically below one another, and read from top to bottom, or horizontally, either from right to left or from left to right; they may also be arranged in a kind of pattern ‚Äî in which case their order may be indeterminate, or in a wandering or curved line, or left to right and right to left alternately (boustrophedon, or as an ox in ploughing). Most Semitic alphabets, including Phoenician, read from right to left; and the earliest Greek inscriptions follow the same direction. But the direction from left to right became regular in Greece after the 6th century BC, and consequently is adopted by the Romans and in all European systems. The individual letters or symbols usually face in the same direction as the writing, as a whole. Position or place Roman marble funeral stele with inscription: \\"CIL VI 23414: D(is) M(anibus) / M(arco) Ogulnio / Iusto filio / pientissimo / vix(it) ann(os) XV mens(es) II d(ies) XXII / M(arcus) Ogulnius / Iustus pater / et sibi fecit\\" - 1st century AD The position or place of inscriptions depends greatly upon their purpose or intention. When they have a direct relation to the sculptures, reliefs or paintings with which they are associated, they often form a kind of pattern to fill the background or vacant spaces between the figures; but sometimes, especially in Mesopotamian statues or reliefs, they are cut right across the figures without any regard to the artistic effect. In late Greek or Roman work it is usual to cut any inscription relative to a statue or relief upon the basis on which this is mounted; but short inscriptions such as dedications or artists' signatures are often placed in some inconspicuous position upon the work itself. In the case of painted vases, the inscriptions relative to the subject represented are usually painted; but dedications and other inscriptions are often incised after the vase has been fired. In Egypt, inscriptions were often inscribed or painted upon inner walls of tombs, whether they referred to religious belief or ritual, or to the honours and possessions of the deceased; they were intended for his benefit and convenience rather than for the information of others, so as to perpetuate his familiar surroundings, not to make him live in the memory of his successors. The information which we derive from such inscriptions is invaluable to us; but such was not the intention with which they were made. On the other hand, inscriptions which were intended to be seen by the public and to perpetuate a record of events, or to supply useful information, were usually placed in places of common resort, above all in temples and sacred precincts. Sometimes they were cut on convenient rock faces, sometimes upon the walls of temples or other buildings. Most frequently the slabs of marble (stelae), stone metal or other material upon which the inscriptions were incised were set up in convenient positions to be read, in any places of public resort. This was the method of publication of all laws, decrees and official notices, of treaties and contracts, of honours to officials or private citizens, of religious dedications and prescriptions of ritual. Inscribed tombstones were set up over graves, which were usually placed along the chief roads leading out of a town, the most familiar example being the sacred way from Athens to Eleusis. Inscriptions commemorative of victories or other great events were only in exceptional cases erected upon the spot; more often such memorials were set up in some great religious centre such as Delphi or Olympia. But boundary stones were necessarily placed on the line which they defined. Chief periods and nationalities thumb The study of inscriptions supplies an important contribution to the history of many lands and peoples. In some cases, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it forms almost the only source of information in the absence of literary records; in others, as in Greece and Rome, it offers a most valuable supplement and comment to what is otherwise recorded. Both Egyptian and Mesopotamian inscriptions go back to an extremely early date; it is at present uncertain which is the earlier, but both show, before 3500 BC and possibly much earlier, a complete, organised system of writing which implies many centuries of development behind it. The Egyptian hieroglyphic system, as used in inscriptions, continued without any essential change of character until Roman times, though various systems of hieratic modification were used at different times. On the famous Rosetta Stone, in the British Museum, which first gave the clue to the interpretation of Egyptian writing, hieroglyphic, hieratic and Greek versions of the same decree are given side by side. Its date is 195 BC. The Mesopotamian linear symbols developed mainly for technical reasons, into a wedge-shaped or cuneiform system, which was adopted in modified forms and applied to different languages through some thousands of years, Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian and Persian, until it was superseded, after the conquests of Alexander, by Greek. An independent hieroglyphic system, which also developed into various linear scripts, existed in Crete during the Middle and Late Minoan periods, from about 3000, probably, to the fall of Knossos, about 1500 BC. The Hittite hieroglyphs correspond to the period of the Hittite empire in northern Syria and Asia Minor from about 2000 to 800 BC; from it, according to one theory, arose the Cypriot syllabary, which continued in use until the 4th century BC or later. The earliest Phoenician inscriptions known date from about the 10th century BC, and the alphabet remained in use down to the 3rd century BC. Some believe this was modified and adopted by the Greeks at an uncertain date; the earliest Greek inscriptions are generally dated in the 7th century BC. In early times each Greek State had its own alphabet; but in the year 403 BC (the archonship of Eucleides) the Ionian alphabet, which is the one used now for Greek capital letters, was officially adopted by Athens, and soon became universal in Greece. From the various Greek alphabets the different local Italian alphabets, including the Etruscan, were derived with various modifications. The Roman alphabet was among these, being based on the alphabet of Caere, a Chalcidian colony. There are a few very early Roman inscriptions; but they do not become common until the 3rd century BC; from that time the letters took much the same forms as they preserve to the present day. The custom of putting inscriptions in Greek and in Latin on buildings and other monuments continued through medieval times, and is still customary, classical forms being frequently imitated. The latest dated inscription in the Greek Corpus records the building of a bridge in Sicily in AD 1121. The series of Byzantine inscriptions continues practically without interruption to the present day; and Latin retains its use as a universal language in religious, public and private inscriptions. Methods of dating It is often possible to date an inscription approximately by the style of the lettering, or even by the alphabet used. Thus at Athens the Ionic alphabet was adopted in place of the early Attic alphabet in the archonship of Eucleides, 403 BC, according to a decree proposed by Archinus. But the change was already in process in private inscriptions, and even in official documents Ionic forms are sometimes found earlier. Inscriptions are dated in various ways, mostly by giving the name of a king, magistrate or priest. In the case of kings, they only give an approximate date, unless the year of his reign is given also. But in the case of most independent cities, the date is given by the name of an annual magistrate, and thus the year is precisely indicated. At Athens, the name used was that of the Eponymous Archon, and as an almost complete list of these has been drawn up from inscriptions and other sources, this means of dating is quite satisfactory. The custom of dating by Olympiads, which is familiar to us from later Greek and Roman writers, was rarely used in early Greece, except in connection with athletic victories. Many inscriptions are dated from various local eras, often based upon historical events, such as the foundation of a town or festival, the organisation of a province, or even a visit of an emperor. The number of these eras in later times, especially in Asia Minor, becomes very bewildering. In Attic decrees, and some others, it was also usual to give the day of the month. In Greek inscription of the Roman period the year of the emperor is defined by the number of his consulate, or other indications or titles, as in the corresponding Latin inscriptions. In later times, the dating is commonly by \\"Indiction\\"; but as this only gives the number of the year within the 15-year period, but leaves that period undefined, such dating is very inconvenient except for merely temporary use. In the Eastern Empire the date from the creation of the world (5509 BC) is sometimes given; but the date of the Christian era is hardly ever used. Content Inscription on a Roman mosaic from excavations in the Appian Way, Rome. The Greek motto gn≈çthi sauton (\\"know thyself\\", nosce te ipsum) combines with the image to convey the famous warning: Respice post te; hominem te esse memento; memento mori (Look behind; remember that you are mortal; remember death) Purpose of inscriptions Inscriptions may be roughly divided into two main classes: those in which the inscription was subservient to the use or purpose of the object on which it was inscribed, or at any rate had a direct relation to that object ‚Äî for example, the name of the owner or the record of dedication to a god ‚Äî and those in which the inscription existed independently for its own sake, or for the sake of the information which it recorded, and the object on which it was inscribed was either made for the purpose, as a slab of marble or plate of bronze, or was made use of, as in the case of a convenient wall or the surface of a rock, or even a potsherd. The walls of buildings are often covered with such inscriptions, especially if they are in a conspicuous or convenient position, and so offer an obvious means of publicity. For us, accustomed as we are to a vast mass of books, newspapers and other printed or digital documents, it is difficult to realise the extensive use and great convenience assigned to inscriptions in ancient times. Not only were public announcements of all sorts, such as we should make known by advertisements or posters, thus placed before the public, but all kinds of records and enactments ‚Äî codes of law and political decrees; regulations for all matters, civil and religious; accounts and contracts, public and private; treaties between states; records of public and private benefactions and dedications, and all matters of administration; honours to the living and to the memory of the dead. Many of these were intended to preserve for all time the records which they contained; but others must have been of only temporary interest. It seems, therefore, the more remarkable that they should have been incised on permanent material such as bronze, marble or stone ‚Äî and incised in the first instance, with a care and perfection of technique which have led to their survival to the present day, so as to preserve for us invaluable evidence as to the life and institutions of the people who made them. Temporary and permanent value are therefore often combined in the same inscription. For instance, any Athenian citizen, visiting the Acropolis or the Agora, could satisfy themselves at first hand as to treaties or decrees of the people, public accounts or state income and expenditure. And at the same time these documents preserved for all time much history, both social and political. Relative inscriptions Bust of Periander bearing the inscription \\"Periander, son of Cypselus, Corinthian\\". Marble, Roman copy after a Greek original by Kresilas, 4th century Inscriptions having a direct relation to the object, or representation, on which they are inscribed, vary greatly in their contents. Those relating to picture or relief chronicles of the victories or exploits of kings, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, serve as a record of the events, and help to interpret the scenes. Such inscriptions are not common in Greek or Roman work; but frequently, especially in early Greek times, and on vases, the names of persons and even of objects are written beside them for the purpose of identification, and sometimes a speech issues from the mouth of the figure. On the carved wooden chest of Cypselus, of about 600 BC hexameter verses were written, curving about among figures, and giving a description of each scene. The bases of statues and reliefs often had inscriptions cut upon them for identification and record. This was particularly the case with honorary statues and tombstones. In other cases, where there is an evident relation between the artistic representation and the inscription, the figures are subordinate and seem merely to illustrate the text, as when a treaty between Athens and Samos has a relief at its head representing the goddess Athena and Hera clasping hands, as representatives of their respective cities. In other cases, the arms or device of a city is carved on an inscription, almost like a seal on a document. In all these cases the figures and the inscription are part of a common design, whether carried out by the same hand or not. But in the case of owners' marks or names cut on vases or other objects, or of the dedication of such objects, the inscription is not necessarily contemporary; it may indeed be misleading, as in the case, mentioned with disapproval by Cicero, of using again old Greek statues and placing new dedicatory inscriptions on them in Roman times, a sort of \\"recycling\\": for instance, one of the statues of Athenian knights of the 5th century BC placed at the entrance of the Acropolis, had a later inscription cut on its base to make it serve as an equestrian statue of Germanicus, probably in 18 AD when he visited Athens. In Egypt and Mesopotamia also it is not unusual to find the name of a later king of official cut upon an earlier work.For the Cicero reference cf. Independent inscriptions The majority of inscriptions are of independent value and interest, the object on which they are cut being either provided for the purpose or utilised as convenient and suitable. Such inscriptions may be classified as (a) Religious and (b) Political and Social. The distinction between the two is not always easy to draw; for in almost all ancient civilisations religion was a part of the established service of the State, and was under public control, or at least was closely bound up with political administration. It follows that many inscriptions relating to religious matters take the form of political decrees or state documents, and therefore might, especially as far as form is concerned, be included in either category; but it is usually possible to classify them according to their contents and intention. Greek inscriptions=Religious The ancient bronze Serpent Column at the Hippodrome of Constantinople. The Obelisk of Theodosius is seen in the background. =Temples, their foundation and administration= A temple was often a kind of religious corporation under the control of the State; and its accounts and details of administration were made public at frequent intervals, usually annually, by means of inscriptions, exhibited to public view in its precinct. Many such inscriptions have been found, and supply a great deal of information that can be obtained from no other source. Some great temples, such as that of Apollo on the island of Delos, held great amounts of property, both real and portable, the latter taking the form either of more or less precious offerings dedicated in the temple and its surrounding buildings, or of coined money. The inscriptions accordingly record gifts and acquisitions of landed property, leases and assignments, payments of rent and fines for default, loans and interest and many other business transactions suitable to a great landed proprietor or to a bank. They therefore throw much light upon the social and economic conditions of ancient life, such as are nowhere else recorded. Again, the lists of offerings dedicated in the temple and other buildings enable us to realise almost visually the appearance of their contents. These are described as being on the floor, on the walls, on shelves or in cases; they consisted of vases and other objects suitable for use in the temple service; ornaments and jewels; statuettes, mostly in gold and silver; weapons and tools; coined money; and bullion, mostly melted down from old offerings. The detailed care that was taken in this last case, to ensure that the full weight of these objects was preserved, whether made into a new vessel or not, is recorded in other inscriptions. These elaborate inventories were checked and revised by each successive board of administrators, and gave the best possible security against any robbery or peculation. In addition to such general lists, there are also innumerable records of various gifts and acquisitions, whether of land and houses, or of movable property of all sorts. Buildings and repairs are also recorded, sometimes by the State, sometimes by individuals, whose piety and generosity are suitably honoured. In form, these are often hardly to be distinguished from public works of a secular character, which must be mentioned later. The inscriptions on or belonging to special dedications are often of great historical interest ‚Äî there need only be quoted the inscription on the famous Serpent Column, once at Delphi and now in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, with the list of the Greek States which took part in the Persian War; and that relating to the Roman arms dedicated by Pyrrhus of Epirus at Dodona after his victories. Most of the great temples being of immemorial sanctity, it is hardly to be expected that any records of their foundation should be found in inscriptions. But on the other hand we have many accounts of the dedication of new temples, either by states or communities or by private individuals. In almost all such cases it was necessary to obtain sanction for the foundation from the State; thus the inscription often takes the form of a decree of the people authorising the foundation of the temple and often giving some privileges to the founder or founders. =Priests and other officials= Kom Aushim (Karanis), Faiyum, Egypt Inscriptions give much information as to priests and other religious officials. There are in the first place lists of priests, some of them covering long periods and even going back to mythical times; there are also lists of treasures and administrators, who were usually lay officials appointed for the purpose, either by election or by lot. The duties and privileges of priests are recorded in many inscriptions, and vary considerably from place to place. It is recorded, for instance, what portions of a victim at any sacrifice were to be received by the priest. In any important temple this must evidently have been far more than the priest or his family could consume, and accordingly it must have been sold, and so constituted a considerable source of income. Consequently, a priesthood was an office well paid and much sought after; and we actually find in later Greek times, especially in Asia Minor, that priesthoods were frequently sold, under proper guarantees and with due sureties as to the duties being carried out. Sometimes a fee to the priest had to be paid in cash; in some cases a priest or priestess was allowed to take up a collection on certain days. On the other hand, the duties of a priest are often recorded; he had to see to the cleaning and care of the temple and its contents, to provide flowers and garlands for decorations and to supply the regular daily service. Sacrifices on great occasions were usually provided by the State, as also were important repairs; but in some cases a priest undertook these on his own account, and was honoured accordingly ‚Äî for instance, by being allowed to inscribe his name in the restored temple. Besides priests, we find many other officials of various ranks attached to temples and recorded in inscriptions. Some of these, especially those who were concerned with buildings or constructions, or with the inventories of temple treasures and the accounts of administration, were lay officials appointed by the State, as in the case of political officers. But many others had specialised sacerdotal functions; for instance, in many places there were manteis or prophets, often of special families with hereditary skills in divination; at Eleusis we find records of the hierophant, the torch-bearer, and others who took part in the celebration of the mysteries. At Olympia, in later Greek times, we find a remarkable list of officials, that is: three priests, three libation pourers, two prophets, three custodians (of keys), a flute-player, an interpreter, a priest for the daily sacrifice, a secretary, a wine-pourer, three dancers at libations, a woodman (to supply wood for the sacrifices), and a steward and cook ‚Äî the last no sinecure, in view of the numerous sacrificial feasts. There were also many more menial offices in the service of temples which were carried out by slaves. Such slaves were often presented to the temple or acquired in some other way. There is a whole class of inscriptions, found on many sites, in which the sale of slaves to a temple or to the god of a temple is recorded. It is often difficult to know whether such slaves were intended for the service of a temple, or, on the other hand, such service was either purely formal or was not required at all, the sale to the temple being intended as fictitious, so as to enable a slave to acquire his own freedom and at the same time to secure the protection of the god in his free status. =Ritual= Votive relief for the cure of a bad leg, inscription from the shrine of Asclepius at Milos, √Ügean Sea. The ritual appropriate to different divinities and temples varied greatly from place to place; and it was, therefore, necessary or desirable to set up notices in all public places of worship for the information and guidance of worshippers. The commonest and most essential act of worship was sacrifice; an example of the simplest form of prescription is to be seen in the inscription on the relief from Thasos in the Louvre:‚Äî \\"To the Nymphs and to Apollo the leader of the Nymphs, the worshipper may, if he so choose, sacrifice a male and a female victim. It is not permissible to offer a sheep or a pig. No paean is sung. To the Graces it is not permissible to offer a goat or a pig.\\"Cf. Louvre Ma 696 (Sculpture), Relief Plaques from Thasos; see also classification on Poinikastas:\\"Thasos, inscriptions\\" - IG vol. xii.8 no. 358. It is to be noticed that this order of service contains a prohibition as well as a prescription. Such prohibitions are frequent, and often relate to the need of ceremonial purity in all worshippers entering a sacred precinct. They must for a certain time have abstained from certain prescribed means of pollution, varying from place to place. The officials are sometimes ordered to erect notices giving information on this point; for instance, at the precinct of Alectrona at Ialysus, it was prescribed that \\"no horse, ass, mule, nor any other animal with a bushy tail should enter, and that nobody should bring such animals in or wear shoes or any article produced from pigs. There is also a fine for driving in sheep.\\" Other precincts were protected in a more general manner from any invasion or violation. It was prohibited to cut wood or to remove earth and stones, or to drive any beasts into some precincts; the right of erecting booths was either restricted or denied altogether. Sometimes more detailed prescriptions are given for the whole organisation of a festival; thus, at Andania, in Messenia, the arrangements for the celebration of the local Eleusinia, the dress of the participants, the officials and policing, are very fully described. Similarly, in the Hall of the Iobacchi, at Athens, the order of proceedings, the officers and the characters in the sacred play, and various administrative details are ordered.Cf. An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy, Cambridge University Press - (undated, no author cited)Googlebook; see also Ancient Athens, Haskell House Publ., 1902 (no author cited) Googlebook When there is any doubt about any ritual or procedure, divination is often resorted to, and the results of such divination are recorded in inscriptions as a guidance for the future; it was also a common practice to consult Delphi or some other oracle in doubtful or difficult cases; there the exact method of procedure is sometimes recorded, as well as the response of the oracle. Forms of worship are often prescribed or recorded, especially hymns, which are sometimes inscribed together with their musical notation. The performance of songs or hymns and dances are also matters of constant reference, especially in connection with lyrical or musical contests; the victorious band or performer often dedicated the prize in honour of the god. A special form of contest was that in dramatic performances, of which many records have survived, both from Athens and from many other parts of the Greek world. The regulation of athletic festivals, and the records of victors in their contests, also form a numerous class of inscriptions. As regards mysteries, though there are numerous regulations affecting the arrangement of celebrations and the conduct of those participating, there is, as was to be expected, very little concerning the actual performances. Another interesting phase of Greek religion known to us mainly from inscriptions is offered by the shrines of healing. The most notable of these is the precinct of Asclepius at Epidaurus. Here have been found, on large slabs of inscription, compiled, in all probability, from earlier documents, lists of the cures effected by Apollo and Asclepius. The cures are of the most varied kinds, from painful diseases or surgical cases to a lost boy and a broken cup. The formula is in almost all cases the same: the consultant come to Epidaurus, sleeps in the abaton, has dreams or sees visions, and comes out whole. In later times, when such faith-healing had probably become less efficacious, elaborate prescriptions of diet and hygiene are recorded. A special form of prayer consists of curses, which were often buried in the ground, probably with the intent to reach the infernal gods. Such curses often give the reason for their being made, usually some injury done to the author of the curse; sometimes they devote the offender to the infernal gods. Salamis, dating from 363 BC =Private associations for religious purposes= Another elements in Greek religion which is known to us almost exclusively by means of inscriptions, is to be found in the religious associations that existed in many Greek cities, apart from the organisation of state religion, though sometimes recognised by it. These associations had each its own regulations, which were duly recorded in inscriptions; they varied greatly both in purpose and in character. Many of them had a definitely religious purpose, in the worship of certain gods; sometimes an alien community was given special permission to worship its own god or gods in its own way. Other associations were more social in character and served as clubs, or as burial societies. A remarkable feature about such associations is that the lists of members of many of them include the names of women and of slaves, thus contrasting with the civic basis of established religion in Greece, and anticipating a religion in which \\"there can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female.\\"Galatians 3:28 Political and socialCodes of law and regulations= Ancient writers state that the earliest laws of Athens were inscribed upon tablets of wood, put together in a pyramidal shape. These, owing to their material, have perished; but we have some very early codes of law preserved on stone, notably at Gortyna in Crete. Here an inscription of great length is incised on the slabs of a theatre-shaped structure in 12 columns of 50 lines each; it is mainly concerned with the law of inheritance, adoption, etc. Doubtless similar inscriptions were set up in many places in Greece. An interesting series of inscriptions deals with the conditions under which colonists were sent out from various cities, and the measures that were taken to secure their rights as citizens. A bronze tablet records in some detail the arrangements of this sort made when Locrians established a colony in Naupactus; another inscription relates to the Athenian colonisation of Salamis, in the 6th century BC. =Decrees of people and rulers, later of kings and emperors= A very large number of inscriptions are in the form of decrees of various cities and peoples, even when their subject matter suggests that they should be classified under other headings. Almost all legislative and many administrative measures take this form; often a decree prescribes how and where the inscription should be set up. The formulae and preambles of such decrees vary considerably from place to place, and from period to period. Those of Athens are by far the most exactly known, owing to the immense number that have been discovered; and they are so strictly stereotyped that can be classified with the precision of algebraic formulae, and often dated to within a few years by this test alone. Very full lists for this purpose have been drawn up by epigraphist Wilhelm Larfeld, in his work on the subject.Cf. his classic work (downloadable) Griechische Epigraphik (1914) at University of Toronto - Robarts Library, eBook. It is usual to record the year (by the name of the eponymous archon), the day of the month and of the prytany (or presiding commission according to tribes), various secretaries, the presiding officials and the proposer of the decree. It is also stated whether the resolution is passed by the senate (Boule) or the assembly of the people (Ecclesia), or both. The circumstances or the reason of the resolution are then given, and finally the decision itself. Some other cities followed Athens in the form of their decrees, with such local variations as were required; others were more independent in their development, and different magistracies or forms of government had various results. In the Hellenistic Age, and later, the forms of independent government were, to a great extent, kept up, though little real power remained with the people. On the other hand, it is common thing to find letters from kings, and later from Roman emperors, inscribed and set up in public places. =Public accounts, treasure lists, building inscriptions= It was customary to inscribe on stone all records of the receipt, custody and expenditure of public money or treasure, so that citizens could verify for themselves the safety and due control of the State in all financial matters. As in the case of temple accounts, it was usual for each temporary board of officials to render to their successors an account of their stewardship, and of the resources and treasures which they handed over. In all cases of public works, the expenditure was ordered by the State, and detailed reports were drawn up and inscribed on stone at intervals while the work was being carried out. In many cases there is a detailed specification of building work which makes it possible, not only to realise all the technical details and processes employed, but also the whole plan and structure of a building. A notable instance is the arsenal of Philon at the Peiraeus which has been completely reconstructed on paper by architects from the building specification.Built under the administration of Lycurgus, . E. A. Gardner, op.cit. p. 557, observes that it \\"is perhaps known to us more in detail than any other lost monument of antiquity.\\" It was to hold the rigging of the galleys; and was so contrived that all its contents were visible from a central hall, and so liable to the inspection of the Athenian democracy. Philon's arsenal was destroyed by the forces of Lucius Cornelius Sulla in the Roman conquest of Athens in 86 BC. In the case of the Erechtheum, we have not only a detailed report on the unfinished state of the building in 409 BC, but also accounts of the expenditure and payments to the workmen employed in finishing it. Similar accounts have been preserved of the building of the Parthenon, spread over 15 years; in the case of both the Parthenon and the Erechtheum, there are included the payments made to those who made the sculptures. Naval and military expenditure is also fully accounted for; among other information there are records of the galley-slips at the different harbours of the Piraeus, and of the ships of the Athenian navy, with their names and condition. In short, there is no department of state economy and financial administration that is not abundantly illustrated by the record of inscriptions. A set of records of high historical value are the \\"tribute lists\\", recording the quota paid to Athens by her subject allies during the 5th century BC. These throw much light on her relations with them at various periods.(Cf. Delian League). Stele with an ephebic list, Athens, 4th century BC =Ephebic inscriptions= An institution as to which our knowledge is mainly derived from inscriptions is the ephebic system at Athens. There are not only records of lists of ephebi and of their guardians and instructors, but also decrees in honour of their services, especially in taking their due part in religious and other ceremonies, and resolutions of the ephebi themselves in honour of their officials. It is possible to trace in the inscriptions, which range over several centuries, how what was originally a system of physical and military training for Athenian youths from age of 18 to 20, with outpost and police duties, was gradually transformed. In later times there were added to the instructors in military exercises others who gave lectures on what we should now call arts and science subjects; so that in the Hellenistic and Roman times, when youths from all parts of the civilised world flocked to Athens as an intellectual centre, the ephebic system became a kind of cosmopolitan university.Cf. =Treaties and political and commercial agreements; arbitration, etc.= In addition to inscriptions which are concerned with the internal affairs of various cities, there are many others recording treaties or other agreements of an international character between various cities and states. These were incised on bronze or stone, and set up in places of public resort in the cities concerned, or in common religious centres such as Olympia and Delphi. The simplest form of treaty is merely an alliance for a certain term of years, usually with some penalty for any breach of the conditions. Often an oath was prescribed, to be taken by representatives on each side; it was also not unusual to appeal to the god in whose temple the treaty was exhibited. In other cases a list of gods by whom the two parties must swear is prescribed. Commercial clauses were sometimes added to treaties of alliance, and commercial treaties are also found, agreeing as to the export and import of merchandise and other things. In later days, especially in the time of the Hellenistic kings, treaties tend to become more complicated and detailed in their provisions. Another series of records of great historical interest is concerned with arbitration between various states on various questions, mainly concerned with frontiers. In cases of dispute it was not uncommon for the two disputants to appoint a third party as arbitrator. Sometimes this third party was another State, sometimes a specified number of individuals. Thus, in a frontier dispute between Corinth and Epidaurus, 151 citizens of Megara were appointed by name to arbitrate, and when the decision was disputed, 31 from among them revised and confirmed it. In all such cases it was the custom for a full record to be preserved on stone and set up in the places concerned. In this case the initiative in referring the matter to arbitration came from the Achaean League. =Proxenia decrees= A very large class of inscriptions deals with the institution of proxenia. According to this a citizen of any State might be appointed proxenos of another State; his duties would then be to offer help and hospitality to any citizen of that other State who might be visiting his city, and to assist him in any dispute or in securing his legal rights. The office has been compared to the modern appointment of consuls, with the essential difference that the proxenos is always a citizen of the state in which he resides, not of that whose citizens and interests he assists. The decrees upon this matter frequently record the appointment of a proxenos, and the conferring on him of certain benefits and privileges in return for his services; they also contain resolutions of thanks from the city served by the proxenos, and record honours consequently conferred upon him.Cf. =Honours and privileges given to individuals= This class of inscription is in form not unlike the last, except that honours recorded are given for all sorts of services, private and public, to the State and to individuals. A frequent addition is an invitation to dine in the Prytaneum at Athens. Some are inscribed on the bases of statues set up to the recipient. In early times these inscriptions are usually brief and simple. The bust of Pericles on the Acropolis held nothing but the names of Pericles himself and of the sculptor Kresilas. Later it became usual to give, in some detail, the reasons for the honours awarded; and in Hellenistic and Roman times, these became more and more detailed and fulsome in laudatory detail. =Signatures of artists= Black-figure dinos with stand, Attic, c. 570 BC. Signed by Sophilos: Œ£ŒüŒ¶ŒôŒõŒüŒ£ [...] ŒúŒïŒìŒ°ŒëŒ¶Œ£ŒïŒù, \\"Sophilos drew me\\" These inscriptions are of special interest as throwing much light upon the history of art. The artist's name was usually, especially in earlier times, carved upon the base of the pedestal of a statue, and consequently was easily separated from it if the statue was carried off or destroyed. A case where both statue and pedestal are preserved is offered by the Victory, signed on its pedestal by Paeonius at Olympia. Occasionally, and more frequently in later times, the artist's signature was carved upon some portion of the statue itself. But in later copies of well-known works, it has to be considered whether the name is that of the original artist or of the copyist who reproduced his work. (see for example, the statue of Hercules/Heracles below) A special class of artists' signatures is offered by the names signed by Attic and other vase painters upon their vases. These have been made the basis of a minute historical and stylistic study of the work of these painters, and unsigned vases also have been grouped with the signed ones, so as to make an exact and detailed record of this branch of Greek artistic production.Cf. int. al., ; =Historical records= The great majority of these fall into one of the classes already referred to. But there are some instances in which an inscription is set up merely as a record. For instance, a victor in athletic or other contests may set up a list of his victories. The most famous historical record is the autobiographical account of the deeds and administration of Augustus, which was reproduced and set up in many places; it is generally known as the Monumentum Ancyranum, because the most complete copy of it was found at Ancyra. The Marmor Parium at Oxford, found in Paros, is a chronological record of Greek history, probably made for educational purposes, and valuable as giving the traditional dates of events from the earliest time down.Cf. ; see also The Parian chronicle, or The chronicle of the Arundelian marbles; with a dissertation concerning its authenticity by Joseph Robertson 1788, from the Internet Archive. =Tombs and epitaphs= This is by far the most numerous class of inscriptions, both Greek and Latin. In early times there is often no record beyond the name of the deceased in Athens, often with the name of his father and his deme. Sometimes a word or two of conventional praise is added, such as \\"a good and wise man\\". Occasionally the circumstances of death are alluded to, especially if it took place in battle or at sea. Such epitaphs were frequently in metrical form, usually either hexameter or elegiacs. Many of them have been collected, and they form an interesting addition to the Greek anthology. In later times it becomes usual to give more elaborate praise of the deceased; but this is hardly ever so detailed and fulsome as on more modern tombstones. The age and other facts about the deceased are occasionally given, but not nearly so often as on Latin tombstones, which offer valuable statistical information in this respect.Cf. int. al. the interesting Epitaph of Seikilos by C. V. Palisca & J. P. Burkholder, 2006. Latin inscriptions Basilica of Aquileia, 4th-century mosaic with Latin inscription: IANUARI DEDEI DONO P * DCCCLXX (Januarius paid for 870 square feet of mosaic) Latin inscriptions may be classified on much the same lines as Greek; but certain broad distinctions may be drawn at the outset. They are generally more standardised as to form and as to content, not only in Rome and Italy, but also throughout the provinces of the Roman Empire. One of the chief difficulties in deciphering Latin Inscriptions lies in the very extensive use of initials and abbreviations. These are of great number and variety, and while some of them can be easily interpreted as belonging to well-known formulae, others offer considerable difficulty, especially to the inexperienced student.A mere list of such initials and abbreviations occupies 68 pages in Ren√© Cagnat's Cours d'√©pigraphie Latine (repr. 1923). A selection is included in Wikipedia's \\"List of classical abbreviations\\". Often the same initial may have many different meanings according to the context. Some common formulae such as V.S.L.M. (votum solvit libens merito), or H.M.H.N.S. (hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur) offer little difficulty, but there are many which are not so obvious and leave room for conjecture. Often the only way to determine the meaning is to search through a list of initials, such as those given by modern Latin epigraphists, until a formula is found which fits the context. Most of what has been said about Greek inscriptions applies to Roman also. The commonest materials in this case also are stone, marble and bronze; but a more extensive use is made of stamped bricks and tiles, which are often of historical value as identifying and dating a building or other construction. The same applies to leaden water pipes which frequently bear dates and names of officials. Terracotta lamps also frequently have their makers' names and other information stamped upon them. Arms, and especially shields, sometimes bear the name and corps of their owners. Leaden discs were also used to serve the same purpose as modern identification discs. Inscriptions are also found on sling bullets ‚Äî Roman as well as Greek; there are also numerous classes of tesserae or tickets of admission to theatres or other shows. As regards the contents of inscriptions, there must evidently be a considerable difference between records of a number of independent city states and an empire including almost all the civilised world; but municipalities maintained much of their independent traditions in Roman times, and consequently their inscriptions often follow the old formulas. The classification of Roman inscriptions may, therefore, follow the same lines as the Greek, except that certain categories are absent, and that some others, not found in Greek, are of considerable importance. ReligiousDedications and foundations of temples, etc.= Votive plaque for Victoria, set by Flavius Primus, curator of the Turma MaximiniIt reads: Victo(riae) Fl(avius) P/rimus cur(ator) / tur(mae) Maxi/mini. These are very numerous; and the custom of placing the name of the dedicator in a conspicuous place on the building was prevalent, especially in the case of dedications by emperors or officials, or by public bodies. Restoration or repair was often recorded in the same manner. In the case of small objects the dedication is usually simple in form; it usually contains the name of the god or other recipient and of the donor, and a common formula is D.D. (dedit, donavit) often with additions such as L.M. (libens merito). Such dedications are often the result of a vow, and V.S. (votum solvit) is therefore often added. Bequests made under the wills of rich citizens are frequently recorded by inscriptions; these might either be for religious or for social purposes. =Priests and officials= A priesthood was frequently a political office and consequently is mentioned along with political honours in the list of a man's distinctions. The priesthoods that a man had held are usually mentioned first in inscriptions before his civil offices and distinctions. Religious offices, as well as civil, were restricted to certain classes, the highest to those of senatorial rank, the next to those of equestrian status; many minor offices, both in Rome and in the provinces, are enumerated in their due order. =Regulations as to religion and cult= Among the most interesting of these is the ancient song and accompanying dance performed by the priests known as the Arval Brothers. This is, however, not in the form of a ritual prescription, but a detailed record of the due performance of the rite. An important class of documents is the series of calendars that have been found in Rome and in the various Italian towns. These give notice of religious festivals and anniversaries, and also of the days available for various purposes. =Colleges= The various colleges for religious purposes were very numerous. Many of them, both in Rome and Italy, and in provincial municipalities, were of the nature of priesthoods. Some were regarded as offices of high distinction and were open only to men of senatorial rank; among these were the Augurs, the Fetiales, the Salii; also the Sodales Divorum Augustorum in imperial times. The records of these colleges sometimes give no information beyond the names of members, but these are often of considerable interest. Haruspices and Luperci were of equestrian rank. Political and socialCodes of law and regulations= Our information as to these is not mainly drawn from inscriptions and, therefore, they need not here be considered. On the other hand, the word lex (law) is usually applied to all decrees of the senate or other bodies, whether of legislative or of administrative character. It is therefore, best to consider all together under the heading of public decrees. =Laws and plebiscites, senatus consulta, decrees of magistrates or later of emperors= A certain number of these dating from republican times are of considerable interest. One of the earliest relates to the prohibition of bacchanalian orgies in Italy; it takes the form of a message from the magistrates, stating the authority on which they acted. Laws all follow a fixed formula, according to the body which has passed them. First there is a statement that the legislative body was consulted by the appropriate magistrate in due form; then follows the text of the law; and finally the sanction, the statement that the law was passed. In decrees of the senate the formula differs somewhat. They begin with a preamble giving the names of the consulting magistrates, the place and conditions of the meeting; then comes the subject submitted for decision, ending with the formula QDERFP (quid de ea re fieri placeret); then comes the decision of the senate, opening with DERIC (de ea re ita censuerunt). C. is added at the end, to indicate that the decree was passed. In imperial times, the emperor sometimes addressed a speech to the senate, advising them to pass certain resolutions, or else, especially in later times, gave orders or instructions directly, either on his own initiative or in response to questions or references. The number and variety of such orders is such that no classification of them can be given here. One of the most famous is the edict of Diocletian, fixing the prices of all commodities. Copies of this in Greek as well as in Latin have been found in various parts of the Roman Empire.Cf. =Records of buildings, etc.= German inscription recording the building of Bozen-Bolzano's Parish Church (South Tyrol) by Hans Lutz of Schussenried, from the early 16th century (1501‚Äì1519) A very large number of inscriptions record the construction or repair of public buildings by private individuals, by magistrates, Roman or provincial, and by emperors. In addition to the dedication of temples, we find inscriptions recording the construction of aqueducts, roads, especially on milestones, baths, basilicas, porticos and many other works of public utility. In inscriptions of early period often nothing is given but the name of the person who built or restored the edifice and a statement that he had done so. But later it was usual to give more detail as to the motive of the building, the name of the emperor or a magistrate giving the date, the authority for the building and the names and distinctions of the builders; then follows a description of the building, the source of the expenditure (e.g., S.P., sua pecunia) and finally the appropriate verb for the work done, whether building, restoring, enlarging or otherwise improving. Other details are sometimes added, such as the name of the man under whose direction the work was done. =Military documents= Brick stamp with military record: \\"C(ohors) III BR(acaraugustanorum)\\", from Bavaria. These vary greatly in content, and are among the most important documents concerning the administration of the Roman Empire. \\"They are numerous and of all sorts ‚Äî tombstones of every degree, lists of soldiers' burial clubs, certificates of discharge from service, schedules of time-expired men, dedications of altars, records of building or of engineering works accomplished. The facts directly commemorated are rarely important.\\", \\"Roman Authority\\" in , et al. Authority and Archaeology, Sacred and Profane: Essays On the Relation of Monuments to Biblical and Classical Literature, Ulan Press (repr. 2012), p. 314. But when the information from hundreds of such inscriptions is collected together, \\"you can trace the whole policy of the Imperial Government in the matter of recruiting, to what extent and till what date legionaries were raised in Italy; what contingents for various branches of the service were drawn from the provinces, and which provinces provided most; how far provincials garrisoned their own countries, and which of them, like the British recruits, were sent as a measure of precaution to serve elsewhere; or, finally, at what epoch the empire grew weak enough to require the enlistment of barbarians from beyond its frontiers.\\" =Treaties and agreements= There were many treaties between Rome and other states in republican times; but we do not, as a rule, owe our knowledge of these to inscriptions, which are very rare in this earlier period. In imperial times, to which most Latin inscriptions belong, international relations were subject to the universal domination of Rome, and consequently the documents relating to them are concerned with reference to the central authority, and often take the form of orders from the emperor. =Proxeny= This custom belonged to Greece. What most nearly corresponded to it in Roman times was the adoption of some distinguished Roman as its patron, by a city or state. The relation was then recorded, usually on a bronze tablet placed in some conspicuous position in the town concerned. The patron probably also kept a copy in his house, or had a portable tablet which would ensure his recognition and reception. =Honorary= Honorary inscriptions are extremely common in all parts of the Roman world. Sometimes they are placed on the bases of statues, sometimes in documents set up to record some particular benefaction or the construction of some public work. The offices held by the person commemorated, and the distinctions conferred upon him are enumerated in a regularly established order (cursus honorum), either beginning with the lower and proceeding step by step to the higher, or in reverse order with the highest first. Religious and priestly offices are usually mentioned before civil and political ones. These might be exercised either in Rome itself, or in the various municipalities of the empire. There was also a distinction drawn between offices that might be held only by persons of senatorial rank, those that were assigned to persons of equestrian rank, and those of a less distinguished kind. It follows that when only a portion of an inscription has been found, it is often possible to restore the whole in accordance with the accepted order. =Signatures of artists= When these are attached to statues, it is sometimes doubtful whether the name is that of the man who actually made the statue, or of the master whose work it reproduces. Thus there are two well-known copies of a statue of Hercules by Lysippus, of which one is said to be the work of Lysippus, and the other states that it was made by Glycon (see images). Another kind of artist's or artificer's signature that is commoner in Roman times is to be found in the signatures of potters upon lamps and various kinds of vessels; they are usually impressed on the mould and stand out in relief on the terracotta or other material. These are of interest as giving much information as to the commercial spread of various kinds of handicrafts, and also as to the conditions under which they were manufactured. Columna Rostrata of Gaius Duilius (c. 260 BC) at the Museum of Roman Civilization. =Historical records= Many of these inscriptions might well be assigned to one of the categories already considered. But there are some which were expressly made to commemorate an important event, or to preserve a record. Among the most interesting is the inscription of the Columna Rostrata in Rome, which records the great naval victory of Gaius Duilius over the Carthaginians; this, however, is not the original, but a later and somewhat modified version. A document of high importance is a summary of the life and achievements of Augustus, already mentioned, and known as the Monumentum Ancyranum. The various sets of Fasti constituted a record of the names of consuls, and other magistrates or high officials, and also of the triumphs accorded to conquering generals. =Inscriptions on tombs= The tomb of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus, erected around 150 BC, contains an Old Latin inscription in Saturnian Metre. These are probably the most numerous of all classes of inscriptions; and though many of them are of no great individual interest, they convey, when taken collectively, much valuable information as to the distribution and transference of population, as to trades and professions, as to health and longevity, and as to many other conditions of ancient life. The most interesting early series is that on the tombs of the Scipios at Rome, recording, mostly in Saturnian Metre, the exploits and distinctions of the various members of that family.Cf. About the end of the republic and the beginning of the empire, it became customary to head a tombstone with the letters D.M. or D.M.S. (Dis Manibus sacrum), thus consecrating the tomb to the deceased as having become members of the body of ghosts or spirits of the dead. These are followed by the name of the deceased, usually with his father's name and his tribe, by his honours and distinctions, sometimes by a record of his age. The inscription often concludes with H.I. (Hic iacet), or some similar formula, and also, frequently, with a statement of boundaries and a prohibition of violation or further use ‚Äî for instance, H.M.H.N.S. (hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur, this monument is not to pass to the heir). The person who has erected the monument and his relation to the deceased are often stated; or if a man has prepared the tomb in his lifetime, this also may be stated, V.S.F. (vivus sibi fecit). But there is an immense variety in the information that either a man himself or his friend may wish to record. =Milestones and boundaries= Milestones (miliaria) have already been referred to, and may be regarded as records of the building of roads. Boundary stones (termini) are frequently found, both of public and private property. A well-known instance is offered by those set up by the commissioners called III. viri A.I.A. (agris iudicandis adsignandis) in the time of the Gracchi. Latin inscriptions are the meeting point of Roman history and several arts. These are arts of expression or composition, writing in the strictly physical sense, and design or arrangement. The history is Roman history in its largest sense, involving men and women in many of their affairs, such as life and death, government, law, religious worship ‚Äî all as illustrated above. The related fields one has to enter in order to fully appreciate the epigraphical study, are many: beside all aspects of Roman history, such more restricted but still large fields as ancient jewelry, Etruscology, Italic and Latin philology, ancient pottery, comparative palaeography, Roman nomenclature, Latin verse, lexicography (including inconsistencies of spelling, the early lack of a standard orthography), Roman architecture and prosopography, and the pronunciation of Greek as revealed by the rendering of Greek words in Latin inscriptions and of Latin words in Greek.Cf.

Early career S√§nger was born in the former mining town of Pre√ünitz (P≈ô√≠seƒçnice), near Chomutov in Bohemia, at that time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He studied civil engineering at the Technical Universities of Graz and Vienna. As a student, he came in contact with Hermann Oberth's book Die Rakete zu den Planetenr√§umen (\\"By Rocket into Planetary Space\\"), which inspired him to change from studying civil engineering to aeronautics. He also joined Germany's amateur rocket movement, the Verein f√ºr Raumschiffahrt (VfR ‚Äì \\"Society for Space Travel\\") which was centered on Oberth. In 1932 S√§nger became a member of the SS and was also a member of the NSDAP.Raketenspuren: Waffenschmiede und Milit√§rstandort Peenem√ºnde, by Volkhard Bode, Weltbild Verlag, 2009, S√§nger made rocket-powered flight the subject of his thesis, but it was rejected by the university as too fanciful. He was allowed to graduate when he submitted a far more mundane paper on the statics of wing trusses. S√§nger would later publish his rejected thesis under the title Raketenflugtechnik (\\"Rocket Flight Engineering\\") in 1933. In 1935 and 1936, he published articles on rocket-powered flight for the Austrian journal Flug (\\"Flight\\"). These attracted the attention of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM, or \\"Reich Aviation Ministry\\") which saw S√§nger's ideas as a potential way to accomplish the goal of building a bomber that could strike the United States from Germany (the Amerika Bomber project). The RLM gave him a research institute near Braunschweig and also built a liquid oxygen plant and a test stand for a 100 tonne thrust engine. At the time, S√§nger's hiring was opposed by Wernher von Braun, who felt that his own work was being duplicated and may have seen the Austrian and his work as a threat to his own dominance of the field.Neufeld, M.J. Von Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War. New York: Knopf, 2007. p 101. Sub-orbital bomber concept S√§nger agreed to lead a rocket development team in the L√ºneburger Heide region in 1936. He gradually conceived a rocket-powered sled that would launch a bomber with its own rocket engines that would climb to the fringe of space and then skip along the upper atmosphere ‚Äì not actually entering orbit, but able to cover vast distances in a series of sub-orbital hops. This remarkable design was called the Silbervogel (\\"Silverbird\\") and would have relied on its fuselage creating lift (as a lifting body) to carry it along its sub-orbital path. S√§nger was assisted in this design by mathematician Irene Bredt, whom he married in 1951.http://www.astronautix.com/b/bredt.html S√§nger also designed the rocket motors that the space-plane would use, which would need to generate 1 meganewton (225,000 lbf) of thrust. In this design, he was one of the first to suggest using the rocket's fuel as a way of cooling the engine, by circulating it around the rocket nozzle before burning it in the engine. By 1942, the Reich Air Ministry canceled this project along with other more ambitious and theoretical designs in favour of concentrating on proven technologies. S√§nger was sent to work for the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Segelflug (DFS, or \\"German Gliding Research Institute\\"). There he did important work on ramjet technology, working on projects such as the Skoda- Kauba Sk P.14 interceptor, until the end of World War II. Postwar Modell of concept S√§nger II at Technik Museum Speyer After the war ended, S√§nger worked for the French government and in 1949 founded the F√©d√©ration Astronautique. Whilst in France, he was the subject of a botched attempt by Soviet agents to win him over. Joseph Stalin had become intrigued by reports of the Silbervogel design and sent his son, Vasily, and scientist Grigori Tokaty to convince him to come to the Soviet Union, but they failed to do so. It has also been reported that Stalin instructed the NKVD to kidnap him. In 1951, he became the first President of the International Astronautical Federation. By 1954, S√§nger had returned to Germany and three years later was directing a jet propulsion research institute in Stuttgart. Between 1961 and 1963 he acted as a consultant for Junkers in designing a ramjet-powered space- plane that never left the drawing board. S√§nger's other theoretical innovations during this period were proposing means of using photons for interplanetary and interstellar spacecraft propulsion prefiguring the concept of laser propulsion and the solar sail. In 1960, he assisted the United Arab Republic in developing the Al-Zafir (missile). He died in Berlin. S√§nger's grave is located in the cemetery \\"Alter Friedhof\\" in Stuttgart-Vaihingen. His work on the Silbervogel would prove important to the X-15, X-20 Dyna-Soar, and ultimately Space Shuttle programs.

The resulting shear stress, , deforms the rectangle into a parallelogram. The area involved would be the top of the parallelogram. 'Shear stress, often denoted by ' (Greek: tau), is the component of stress coplanar with a material cross section. It arises from the shear force, the component of force vector parallel to the material cross section. Normal stress, on the other hand, arises from the force vector component perpendicular to the material cross section on which it acts. General shear stress The formula to calculate average shear stress is force per unit area.: : \\\\tau = {F \\\\over A}, where: : = the shear stress; : = the force applied; : = the cross- sectional area of material with area parallel to the applied force vector. Other forms=Pure Pure shear stress is related to pure shear strain, denoted , by the following equation: :\\\\tau = \\\\gamma G\\\\, where is the shear modulus of the isotropic material, given by : G = \\\\frac{E}{2(1+ u)}. Here is Young's modulus and is Poisson's ratio. Beam shear Beam shear is defined as the internal shear stress of a beam caused by the shear force applied to the beam. : \\\\tau = {fQ \\\\over Ib}, where : = total shear force at the location in question; : = statical moment of area; : = thickness (width) in the material perpendicular to the shear; : = Moment of Inertia of the entire cross sectional area. The beam shear formula is also known as Zhuravskii shear stress formula after Dmitrii Ivanovich Zhuravskii who derived it in 1855. Semi-monocoque shear Shear stresses within a semi-monocoque structure may be calculated by idealizing the cross-section of the structure into a set of stringers (carrying only axial loads) and webs (carrying only shear flows). Dividing the shear flow by the thickness of a given portion of the semi- monocoque structure yields the shear stress. Thus, the maximum shear stress will occur either in the web of maximum shear flow or minimum thickness Also constructions in soil can fail due to shear; e.g., the weight of an earth- filled dam or dike may cause the subsoil to collapse, like a small landslide. Impact shear The maximum shear stress created in a solid round bar subject to impact is given as the equation: :\\\\tau=\\\\sqrt {2UG \\\\over V}, where : = change in kinetic energy; : = shear modulus; : = volume of rod; and :; :; :; : = mass moment of inertia; : = angular speed. Shear stress in fluids Any real fluids (liquids and gases included) moving along a solid boundary will incur a shear stress at that boundary. The no-slip condition. dictates that the speed of the fluid at the boundary (relative to the boundary) is zero; although at some height from the boundary the flow speed must equal that of the fluid. The region between these two points is named the boundary layer. For all Newtonian fluids in laminar flow, the shear stress is proportional to the strain rate in the fluid, where the viscosity is the constant of proportionality. For non-Newtonian fluids, the viscosity is not constant. The shear stress is imparted onto the boundary as a result of this loss of velocity. For a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress at a surface element parallel to a flat plate at the point is given by: :\\\\tau (y) = \\\\mu \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y} where : is the dynamic viscosity of the flow; : is the flow velocity along the boundary; : is the height above the boundary. Specifically, the wall shear stress is defined as: :\\\\tau_\\\\mathrm{w} \\\\equiv \\\\tau(y=0)= \\\\mu \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right_{y = 0}~~. The Newton's constitutive law, for any general geometry (including the flat plate above mentioned), states that shear tensor (a second-order tensor) is proportional to the flow velocity gradient (the velocity is a vector, so its gradient is a second-order tensor): :\\\\mathbf \\\\tau(\\\\vec u) = \\\\mu abla \\\\vec u and the constant of proportionality is named dynamic viscosity. For an isotropic Newtonian flow it is a scalar, while for anisotropic Newtonian flows it can be a second-order tensor too. The fundamental aspect is that for a Newtonian fluid the dynamic viscosity is independent on flow velocity (i.e., the shear stress constitutive law is linear), while non-Newtonian flows this is not true, and one should allow for the modification: :\\\\mathbf \\\\tau(\\\\vec u) = \\\\mu(\\\\vec u) abla \\\\vec u The above formula is no longer the Newton's law but a generic tensorial identity: one could always find an expression of the viscosity as function of the flow velocity given any expression of the shear stress as function of the flow velocity. On the other hand, given a shear stress as function of the flow velocity, it represents a Newtonian flow only if it can be expressed as a constant for the gradient of the flow velocity. The constant one finds in this case is the dynamic viscosity of the flow. =Example= Considering a 2D space in cartesian coordinates (x,y) (the flow velocity components are respectively (u,v)), the shear stress matrix given by: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\tau_{xx} & \\\\tau_{xy} \\\\ \\\\tau_{yx} & \\\\tau_{yy} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\frac {\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -t \\\\frac {\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y} \\\\end{pmatrix} represents a Newtonian flow, in fact it can be expressed as: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\tau_{xx} & \\\\tau_{xy} \\\\ \\\\tau_{yx} & \\\\tau_{yy} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} x & 0 \\\\ 0 & -t \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac {\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} & \\\\frac {\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y} \\\\ \\\\frac {\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial x} & \\\\frac {\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y} \\\\end{pmatrix} , i.e., an anisotropic flow with the viscosity tensor: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mu_{xx} & \\\\mu_{xy} \\\\ \\\\mu_{yx} & \\\\mu_{yy} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} x & 0 \\\\ 0 & -t \\\\end{pmatrix} which is nonuniform (depends on space coordinates) and transient, but relevantly it is independent on the flow velocity: :\\\\mathbf \\\\mu(x,t) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} x & 0 \\\\ 0 & -t \\\\end{pmatrix} This flow is therefore newtonian. On the other hand, a flow in which the viscosity were: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mu_{xx} & \\\\mu_{xy} \\\\ \\\\mu_{yx} & \\\\mu_{yy} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac 1 u & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\frac 1 u \\\\end{pmatrix} is Nonnewtonian since the viscosity depends on flow velocity. This nonnewtonian flow is isotropic (the matrix is proportional to the identity matrix), so the viscosity is simply a scalar: :\\\\mu (u) = \\\\frac 1 u  Measurement with sensors =Diverging fringe shear stress sensor This relationship can be exploited to measure the wall shear stress. If a sensor could directly measure the gradient of the velocity profile at the wall, then multiplying by the dynamic viscosity would yield the shear stress. Such a sensor was demonstrated by A. A. Naqwi and W. C. Reynolds. The interference pattern generated by sending a beam of light through two parallel slits forms a network of linearly diverging fringes that seem to originate from the plane of the two slits (see double-slit experiment). As a particle in a fluid passes through the fringes, a receiver detects the reflection of the fringe pattern. The signal can be processed, and knowing the fringe angle, the height and velocity of the particle can be extrapolated. The measured value of wall velocity gradient is independent of the fluid properties and as a result does not require calibration. Recent advancements in the micro-optic fabrication technologies have made it possible to use integrated diffractive optical element to fabricate diverging fringe shear stress sensors usable both in air and liquid.{microS Shear Stress Sensor, MSE} Micro-pillar shear- stress sensor A further measurement technique is that of slender wall- mounted micro-pillars made of the flexible polymer PDMS, which bend in reaction to the applying drag forces in the vicinity of the wall. The sensor thereby belongs to the indirect measurement principles relying on the relationship between near-wall velocity gradients and the local wall-shear stress.

Life  Born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and brought up in the Portsmouth area, he was the only child of middle-aged parents, John and Molly Logue, who married late. He attended Roman Catholic schools, including St John's College, Portsmouth, Prior Park College, before going to Portsmouth Grammar School. On call-up, he enlisted in the Black Watch, and was posted to Palestine. He was court- martialled in 1945 over a scheme to sell stolen pay books, and sentenced to 16 months imprisonment, served partly in Acre Prison. He lived in Paris from 1951 to 1956, and was a friend of Alexander Trocchi. In 1958 he joined the first of the Aldermaston Marches, organised by the Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War. He was on the Committee of 100. He served a month in jail for refusing to be bound over not to continue with the 17 September 1961 Parliament Square sit-down.Peace News, 15 September 1961 He heard Bertrand Russell tell the Bow Street magistrate, \\"I came here to save your life. But, having heard what you have to say, I don't think the end justifies the means.\\"Prince Charming, A Memoir, C. Logue, p. 268 In Drake Hall open prison he and fellow protesters were set to work ‚Äì \\"Some wit allocated it\\" ‚Äì demolishing a munitions factory.Daily Telegraph, obituary, 6 December 2011 He was friends for many years with author and translator Austryn Wainhouse, with whom he carried on a lively correspondence for decades.Austryn Wainhouse Papers, Syracuse University.  Career  He was a playwright and screenwriter as well as a film actor. His screenplays were Savage Messiah and The End of Arthur's Marriage. He was a contributor to Private Eye magazine between 1962 and 1993, as well as writing for Alexander Trocchi's literary journal, Merlin. Logue won the 2005 Whitbread Poetry Award for Cold Calls. His early popularity was marked by the release of a loose adaptation of Pablo Neruda's Twenty Love Poems, later broadcast on BBC Radio's Third Programme at 10.05pm on Sunday 8th March 1959 with the poems, read by Logue himself, set to jazz by pianist Bill Le Sage and drummer Tony Kinsey and a band featuring Kenny Napper on bass, Ken Wray on trombone and Les Condon on trumpet.https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?order=asc&q;=RED+BIRD+DANCING+ON+IVORY#search A version of the performance was later released as a 7inch EP (extended play) record, Red Bird: Jazz and Poetry. One of his poems, Be Not Too Hard, was set to music by Donovan and heard in the film Poor Cow (1967), and was made popular by Joan Baez on her eponymous 1967 album, Joan. Another completely different song titled \\"Be Not Too Hard\\" based on the poem was performed by Manfred Mann's Earth Band on their 1974 album The Good Earth. The arrangement was written by Mick Rogers, who had Logue credited as a co-writer on the record sleeve. Another well-known and well-quoted poem by Logue was Come to the Edge, which is often attributed to Guillaume Apollinaire, but is in fact only dedicated to him. It was originally written for a poster advertising an Apollinaire exhibition at the ICA in 1961 or 1962, and was titled \\"Apollinaire Said\\", hence the misattribution.Quote‚Ä¶Unquote Newsletter, July 1995, p. 2 His last major work was an ongoing project to render Homer's Iliad into a modernist idiom. This work is published in a number of small books, usually equating to two or three books of the original text. (The volume, Homer: War Music, was shortlisted for the 2002 International Griffin Poetry Prize.) He published an autobiography, Prince Charming (1999). His lines tended to be short, pithy and frequently political, as in Song of Autobiography: He wrote the couplet that is sung at the beginning and end of the film A High Wind in Jamaica (1965), the screenplay for Savage Messiah (1972), a television version of Antigone (1962), and a short play for the TV series The Wednesday Play titled The End of Arthur's Marriage (1965), which was directed by Ken Loach. The latter film was generally light-hearted, but dealt with the pre-occupation in modern British society with ownership of property and with the treatment of animals by humans. He appeared in a number of films as an actor, most notably in the Ken Russell films The Devils (1971, as Cardinal Richelieu) and Prisoner of Honor (1991, as Fernand Labori), and as the spaghetti-eating fanatic in Terry Gilliam's Jabberwocky (1977). Logue wrote for the Olympia Press under the pseudonym Count Palmiro Vicarion, including a pornographic novel, Lust.  Family  He married biographer Rosemary Hill in 1985. Logue died on 2 December 2011, aged 85.

Its breeding ranges are located in the interior of deciduous and mixed coniferous forests in eastern North America. Over the cooler months, it migrates to islands in the Caribbean and Central America. It is very rarely found in western Europe, where it is considered to be a non-indigenous species. The black-throated blue warbler is sexually dimorphic; the adult male has a black face and cheeks, deep blue upperparts and white underparts, while the adult female is olive-brown above and light yellow below. Predominantly insectivorous, the black-throated blue warbler supplements its diet with berries and seeds in winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and the closeness of its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species for the study of warbler behavior in the wild. The black- throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue warbler requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining. Taxonomy and phylogeny The German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin described the black-throated blue warbler in 1789. Its species name is the Latin adjective caerulescens meaning \\"turning blue\\". The black-throated blue warbler is one of the New World warblers or wood-warblers in the family Parulidae. This species was originally placed under the genus Dendroica. It was recently adjusted to be a member of genus Setophaga along with all other members of the genus Dendroica, based on the findings from a recent phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA in 2010. The old genus Dendroica was then deleted. Within the genus, it appears to have no particularly close relatives. The species breeds in North America and winters in the Caribbean. Some studies have observed significant differences in terms of migratory behavior and plumage color between northern and southern populations within the breeding range. The northern population mainly winters in the western Caribbean (Cuba and Jamaica) while the southern population usually spends the winter on eastern islands (Hispaniola and Puerto Rico). Moreover, males in the southern population have darker plumage than those in the northern population. These differences have led biologists to consider them as separate subspecies. However, a recent study in the United States reveals no significant genetic differentiation between northern (samples from Michigan, New Hampshire and New York states) and southern populations (sample from North Carolina). The study results actually show a recent population expansion from a single glacial refugium, therefore the current populations are homogeneous in terms of genetics. The differentiation that is observed between the northern and southern populations should have occurred quite recently. Description Female foraging for termites at the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge Male at the Pinery Provincial Park The black-throated blue warbler measures in length and weighs . Wingspan ranges from 7.5-7.9 in (19-20 cm). This is a strongly sexually dimorphic bird. The adult male has white underparts with a black throat, face and flanks. The upperparts are deep blue. The immature male is similar, but with greener upperparts. The female has olive-brown upperparts and light yellow underparts with darker wings and tail, gray crown and brown patches on the cheek. Both sexes have a thin pointed bill and small white wing patches which are not always visible. Like many other warbler species, it has colorful plumage during the spring and summer. However, outside the breeding season its plumage is drab and less distinctive. In the fall, the black-throated blue warbler can be distinguished by its small white wing patches. Juveniles have brown upperparts with a creamy supercilium and brownish spots on the throat, the breast and the belly. The bird's song can be described as a buzzed ' with an upward inflection. Its call is a flat '. Distribution and habitat The black-throated blue warbler is a migratory species. It breeds in temperate mature deciduous forests or mixed coniferous-deciduous forest with a thick understory. The species is often found in hilly and mountainous regions in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. In late summer, it migrates to the tropical wooded and scrub habitats in the Greater Antilles for wintering. Along the migration route, the black-throated blue warbler can be observed in habitats such as parks and gardens. Its nesting site is more important than its foraging site in playing a role in determining the habitat of the black-throated blue warbler. The black-throated blue warbler is an open-nesting species, that nests very close to the ground so it has to choose a protected nesting site where the risk of predation is relatively low. Behavior=Feeding and foraging The black-throated blue warbler forages actively in low vegetation, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. It often forages in one area for a while before moving on to the next. It mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars, crane flies, and spiders. It may supplement its diet with seeds, berries, and fruit in the winter. Males and females prefer different foraging sites. While males usually hover among the higher shrub foliage between , females tend to forage at lower strata. The time within a breeding season influences where the males forage. When it is time to feed the fledglings, males come down to the same foraging strata as females. The black-throated blue warbler mostly forages in the understory instead of the canopy. The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors. The black-throated blue warbler more often hovers rather than gleans its prey because it is more difficult to glean among thick understory foliage. Breeding Typical nest site The black-throated blue warbler is a monogamous species. Its breeding season usually begins in May and ends in July. As a songbird, the male black-throated blue warbler attracts a female's attention by singing a soft melody. He then follows the female while she is foraging or searching for nesting sites. As soon as the female stops to rest, the male droops his wings slightly, stretches his head forward and up, opens his bill, and faces the female. The female also makes displays to the male by vibrating her wings. In response, the male mounts the female for 2‚Äì3 seconds and then flies off. A 1996, researchers showed that the black-throated blue warbler prefers to reside in hardwood forests with higher shrub densities where food is more abundant compared to lower shrub density plots. Within these high shrub density habitats, not only is there a higher density of warblers, but the population age average is also older, being composed of males and females who are at least two years of age. The black- throated blue warbler uses social cues in its evaluation and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it listens to the post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing at the beginning and the peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of reproductive success. Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites. =Extra-pair mating= Although the black-throated blue warbler is a socially monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and that the majority of the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony. Males engage in mate guarding during the period females are most vulnerable to successful extra pair copulations. They usually stay close to their social mate, singing slowly on the side and following the mate while she is foraging or searching for a nesting site. The guarding behavior, though, may conflict with males' pursuit of extra-pair fertilizations. It is not yet clear to what extent a male will prefer mate guarding over extra-pair fertilizations. Male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra-pair offspring in the brood, suggesting that mate guarding reduces extra-pair fertilization attempts. The extra-pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period. Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon: females may be able to manage extra-pair mating even while its social mate is guarding it, or females may reject extra-pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male guarding. Females who participate in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but they are likely to receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring. Sexual selection Males' differential recognition of local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) and the other in the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a \\"heterospecific\\" male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely to play a role in gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification. It has long been believed that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have a greater degree of directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage. Status and threats The black-throated blue warbler enjoys a large range and a big population. Its population trend is currently increasing. This species was ranked as Least Concern by the IUCN in 2012. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are threatening the black-throated blue warbler in its tropical wintering areas. A report in 2000 discussed the impact of global climate change on the population dynamics of the black-throated blue warbler by an observation from 1986 to 1998. In particular, the effect of El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was studied in relation to the survival, fecundity and recruitment of this migratory bird. It was found that El Ni√±o years (the warm South Pacific oceanic phase) were associated with lower adult survival rate in their wintering ground, Jamaica, lower fecundity in the breeding habitats in New Hampshire of the United States, and lower annual recruitment of yearlings and juveniles to both breeding and wintering grounds. All the three factors were relatively higher during La Ni√±a years (cold South Pacific Ocean) when the weather was wetter and the food availability was much more abundant. Long- term global warming can aggravate the ENSO effect, adding to the fluctuation of the black-throated blue warbler population.

Early life Skou was born in Lemvig, Denmark to a wealthy family. His father Magnus Martinus Skou was a timber and coal merchant. His mother Ane-Margrethe Skou took over the company after the death of his father. At the age of 15, Skou entered a boarding school in Haslev, Zealand. He graduated in medicine from the University of Copenhagen in 1944 and received his doctorate in 1954. He began working at the Aarhus University in 1947 and was appointed professor of biophysics in 1977. He retired from the Aarhus University in 1988, but kept offices at the Department of Physiology (today part of the Department of Biomedicine). Career In 1997 he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (together with Paul D. Boyer and John E. Walker) for his discovery of Na+,K+-ATPase, making him, at the time of his death, the last Danish Nobel laureate and the first at Aarhus University. Skou had taken a few years away from his clinical training in the early 1950s to study the action of local anaesthetics. He had discovered that a substance‚Äôs anaesthetic action was related to its ability to dissolve in a layer of the lipid part of the plasma membrane, the anaesthetic molecules affected the opening of sodium channels which he assumed to be protein. This, he argued, would affect the movement of sodium ions and make nerve cells inexcitable, thus causing anaesthesia. Skou thought that other types of membrane protein might also be affected by local anaesthetics dissolving in the lipid part of the membrane. He therefore had the idea of looking at an enzyme which was embedded in the membrane and finding out if its properties were affected by local anaesthetics. He looked at ATPase in crab nerves. The enzyme was there, but unfortunately its activity was very variable and he needed a highly active enzyme for his studies. Eventually he managed to discover that ATPase was most active when exposed to the right combination of sodium, potassium and magnesium ions. Only then did he realise that this enzyme might have something to do with the active movement of sodium and potassium across the plasma membrane. This idea had been postulated many years before, however, the mechanism was quite unknown. Skou published his findings. However, in his paper he was wary of identifying the enzyme with the active ion movement, so he left out the term ‚Äúsodium-potassium pump‚Äù from the title of his paper. Indeed, he seems to have realised the importance of his discovery only gradually, and he continued his studies on local anaesthetics. In 1958 Skou went to a conference in Vienna to describe his work on cholinesterase. There he met Robert Post (born 1920), who had been studying the pumping of sodium and potassium in red blood cells. Post had recently discovered that three sodium ions were pumped out of the cell for every two potassium ions pumped in, and in his research he had made use of a substance called ouabain (or g-strophanthin) which had recently been shown to inhibit the pump). Post had not read Skou‚Äôs paper, but he was excited when Skou told him about his work with ATPase. Post asked whether the enzyme was inhibited by ouabain. At this stage Skou was unaware that ouabain inhibited the pump, but he immediately telephoned his lab and arranged for the experiment to be done. Ouabain did indeed inhibit the enzyme, thus establishing a link between the enzyme and the sodium-potassium pump. Following the Nobel Prize, Skou gave several interviews recounting the story of his discoveries, and at age 94 was reported to still keep up with publications in his field. He died on 28 May 2018 in Aarhus, Denmark at the age of 99, less than five months shy of his 100th birthday.

The book is set in Europe ravaged by the Thirty Years' War. Its hero Ulrich von Bek is a mercenary and freethinker, who finds himself a damned soul in a castle owned by Lucifer. Much to his surprise, von Bek is charged by Lucifer with doing God's work, by finding the Holy Grail, the \\"cure for the world's pain,\\" that will also cure Lucifer's pain by reconciling him with God. Only through doing this can von Bek save his soul. After many adventures, von Bek eventually finds the Holy Grail, and discovers that it will set mankind on the path to self-redemption through rationality, without the help of God or the hindrance of Lucifer.

The microvessels include terminal arterioles, metarterioles, capillaries, and venules. Arterioles carry oxygenated blood to the capillaries, and blood flows out of the capillaries through venules into veins. In addition to these blood vessels, the microcirculation also includes lymphatic capillaries and collecting ducts. The main functions of the microcirculation are the delivery of oxygen and nutrients and the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2). It also serves to regulate blood flow and tissue perfusion thereby affecting blood pressure and responses to inflammation which can include edema (swelling). Most vessels of the microcirculation are lined by flattened cells of the endothelium and many of them are surrounded by contractile cells called pericytes. The endothelium provides a smooth surface for the flow of blood and regulates the movement of water and dissolved materials in the interstitial plasma between the blood and the tissues. The microcirculation contrasts with macrocirculation, which is the circulation of blood to and from the organs. Structure=Microvessels arteries, which follow into arterioles, and then narrow further into capillaries. After the tissue has been perfused, capillaries branch and widen to become venules and then widen more and connect to become veins, which return blood to the heart. Transmission electron microscope image of a capillary with a red blood cell within the pancreas. The capillary lining consists of long, thin endothelial cells, connected by tight junctions. The vessels on the arterial side of the microcirculation are called the arterioles, which are well innervated, are surrounded by smooth muscle cells, and are 10-100 Œºm in diameter. Arterioles carry the blood to the capillaries, which are not innervated, have no smooth muscle, and are about 5-8 Œºm in diameter. Blood flows out of the capillaries into the venules, which have little smooth muscle and are 10-200 Œºm. The blood flows from the venules into the veins. Metarterioles connect arterioles and capillaries. A tributary to the venules is known as a thoroughfare channel. The microcirculation has three major components: pre-capillary, capillary, and post-capillary. In the pre-capillary sector, arterioles, and precapillary sphincters participate. Their function is to regulate blood flow before it enters the capillaries and venules by the contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscle found on their walls. The second sector is the capillary sector, which is represented by the capillaries, where substance and gas exchange between blood and interstitial fluid takes place. Finally, the post-capillary sector is represented by the post-capillary venules, which are formed by a layer of endothelial cells that allow free movement of some substances.  Microanatomy  Most vessels of the microcirculation are lined by flattened cells of the endothelium and many of them are surrounded by contractile cells called pericytes. The endothelium provides a smooth surface for the flow of blood and regulates the movement of water and dissolved materials in the interstitial plasma between the blood and the tissues. The endothelium also produces molecules that discourage the blood from clotting unless there is a leak. Pericyte cells can contract and decrease the size of the arterioles and thereby regulate blood flow and blood pressure.  Function  In addition to these blood vessels, the microcirculation also includes lymphatic capillaries and collecting ducts. The main functions of the microcirculation are the delivery of oxygen and nutrients and the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2). It also serves to regulate blood flow and tissue perfusion thereby affecting blood pressure and responses to inflammation which can include edema (swelling). Regulation The regulation of tissue perfusion occurs in microcirculation. There, arterioles control the flow of blood to the capillaries. Arterioles contract and relax, varying their diameter and vascular tone, as the vascular smooth muscle responds to diverse stimuli. Distension of the vessels due to increased blood pressure is a fundamental stimulus for muscle contraction in arteriolar walls. As a consequence, microcirculation blood flow remains constant despite changes in systemic blood pressure. This mechanism is present in all tissues and organs of the human body. In addition, the nervous system participates in the regulation of microcirculation. The sympathetic nervous system activates the smaller arterioles, including terminals. Noradrenaline and adrenaline have effects on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Other hormones (catecholamine, renin-angiotensin, vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic peptide) circulate in the bloodstream and can have an effect on the microcirculation causing vasodilation or vasoconstriction. Many hormones and neuropeptides are released together with classical neurotransmitters. Arterioles respond to metabolic stimuli that are generated in the tissues. When tissue metabolism increases, catabolic products accumulate leading to vasodilation. The endothelium begins to control muscle tone and arteriolar blood flow tissue. Endothelial function in the circulation includes the activation and inactivation of circulating hormones and other plasma constituents. There are also synthesis and secretion of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor substances for modifying the width as necessary. Variations in the flow of blood that circulates by arterioles are capable of responses in endothelium. Capillary exchange The term capillary exchange refers to all exchanges at microcirculatory level, most of which occurs in the capillaries. Sites where material exchange occurs between the blood and tissues are the capillaries, which branch out to increase the swap area, minimize the diffusion distance as well as maximize the surface area and the exchange time. Approximately, seven percent of the body's blood is in the capillaries which continuously exchange substances with the liquid outside these blood vessels, called interstitial fluid. This dynamic displacement of materials between the interstitial fluid and the blood is named capillary exchange. These substances pass through capillaries through three different systems or mechanisms: diffusion, bulk flow, and transcytosis or vesicular transport. The liquid and solid exchanges that take place in the microvasculature particularly involve capillaries and post-capillary venules and collecting venules. Capillary walls allow the free flow of almost every substance in plasma. The plasma proteins are the only exception, as they are too big to pass through. The minimum number of un-absorbable plasma proteins that exit capillaries enter lymphatic circulation for returning later on to those blood vessels. Those proteins which leave capillaries use the first capillary exchange mechanism and the process of diffusion, which is caused by kinetic motion of molecules. =Regulation= These exchanges of substances are regulated by different mechanisms. These mechanisms work together and promote capillary exchange in the following way. First, molecules that diffuse are going to travel a short distance thanks to the capillary wall, the small diameter and the close proximity to each cell having a capillary. The short distance is important because the capillary diffusion rate decreases when the diffusion distance increases. Then, because of its large number (10-14 million capillaries), there is an incredible amount of surface area for exchange. However, this only has 5% of the total blood volume (250 ml 5000 ml). Finally, blood flows more slowly in the capillaries, given the extensive branching. =Diffusion= Diffusion is the first and most important mechanism that allows the flow of small molecules across capillaries. The process depends on the difference of gradients between the interstitium and blood, with molecules moving to low concentrated spaces from high concentrated ones. Glucose, amino acids, oxygen (O2) and other molecules exit capillaries by diffusion to reach the organism's tissues. Contrarily, carbon dioxide (CO2) and other wastes leave tissues and enter capillaries by the same process but in reverse. Diffusion through the capillary walls depends on the permeability of the endothelial cells forming the capillary walls, which may be continuous, discontinuous, and fenestrated. The Starling equation describes the roles of hydrostatic and osmotic pressures (the so-called Starling forces) in the movement of fluid across capillary endothelium. Lipids, which are transported by proteins, are too large to cross the capillary walls by diffusion, and have to rely on the other two methods. =Bulk flow= The second mechanism of capillary exchange is bulk flow. It is used by small, lipid-insoluble substances in order to cross. This movement depends on the physical characteristics of the capillaries. For example, continuous capillaries (tight structure) reduce bulk flow, fenestrated capillaries (perforated structure) increases bulk flow, and discontinuous capillaries (great intercellular gaps) enable bulk flow. In this case, the exchange of materials is determined by changes in pressure. When the flow of substances goes from the bloodstream or the capillary to the interstitial space or interstitium, the process is called filtration. This kind of movement is favored by blood hydrostatic pressure (BHP) and interstitial fluid osmotic pressure (IFOP). When substances move from the interstitial fluid to the blood in capillaries, the process is called reabsorption. The pressures that favor this movement are blood colloid osmotic pressure (BCOP) and interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (IFHP). Whether a substance is filtrated or reabsorbed depends on the net filtration pressure (NFP), which is the difference between hydrostatic (BHP and IFHP) and osmotic pressures (IFOP and BCOP). These pressures are known as the Starling forces. If the NFP is positive then there will be filtration, but if it is negative then reabsorption will occur. =Transcytosis= The third capillary exchange mechanism is transcytosis, also called vesicular transport. By this process, blood substances move across the endothelial cells that compose the capillary structure. Finally, these materials exit by exocytosis, the process by which vesicles go out from a cell to the interstitial space. Few substances cross by transcytosis: it is mainly used by large, lipid-insoluble molecules such as the insulin hormone. Once vesicles exit the capillaries, they go to the interstitium. Vesicles can go directly to a specific tissue or they can merge with other vesicles, so their contents are mixed. This intermixed material increases the functional capability of the vesicle.

He then worked as a teacher in various schools around the Cambridge area. During this period, he became acquainted with many of the poets who made up the Cambridge group, one of the key elements of the Revival. He left to take up a teaching post near Oxford in 1966. That same year, he set up the Grosseteste Press with his friend Tim Longville. The pair started a magazine, Grosseteste Review, two years later. Riley retired from teaching in 1970 and returned to Leeds to write full-time. In 1977, he was received into the Orthodox Church.

The town is overlooked by Ballymoyle Hill. It was founded by the Vikings in the ninth century. Arklow was the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the 1798 rebellion. Its proximity to Dublin led to it becoming a commuter town with a population of 13,163 as of the 2016 census. Arklow is at the mouth of the River Avoca, the longest river wholly within County Wicklow. The town is divided by the river, which is crossed by the Nineteen Arches Bridge, a stone arch bridge linking the southern or main part of the town with the northern part, called Ferrybank. The Nineteen Arches Bridge is the longest handmade stone bridge in Ireland, and a plaque on the south end of the bridge acknowledges this.  History  The town's English name derives from Arnkell's L√°g (Arnkell was a Viking leader; a \\"l√°g\\" (low) was an area of land). Its Irish name, Inbhear M√≥r or An tInbhear M√≥r, means the large estuary. It is also known in Irish as Inbhear D√©, from the River Avonmore's older name, Abhainn D√©. Historically it was a major seafaring town, with both the shipping and fishing industries using the port, with shipbuilding also being a major industry. After the arrival of the Anglo-Normans, their leader Theobald Walter, ancestor of the Earls of Ormonde, was granted the town and castle of Arklow by King Henry II. In 1264 the Dominicans were granted a large tract of land, which is now known as Abbeylands, and they built an abbey, which became known as the Priory of the True Cross or Holy Cross Abbey. Some time after 1416, the Manor of Arklow came into the control of the MacMurrough Kings of Leinster, possibly after the death of the 4th Earl of Ormonde in 1452. In 1525, Muiris Kavanagh (McMurrough, King of Leinster 1522‚Äì31) returned the manor and castle of Arklow and its lands to his nephew Piers Butler, the Earl of Ormonde. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, in September 1649, Oliver Cromwell arrived at Arklow on his way to Wexford and took the surrender of the town. In 1714, James Duke of Ormonde sold the Manor of Arklow to John Allen of Stillorgan, County Dublin. In 1750, Allen's eldest granddaughter, Elizabeth Allen, married John Proby, who was raised to the peerage in 1752 as Baron Carysfort of County Wicklow and came into possession of the Arklow Estate. On 9 June 1798, the town was the scene of one of the Battle of Arklow, one of the bloodiest battles of the 1798 rebellion, when a large force of Wexford rebels attacked the town in an attempt to spread the rising to Dublin but were repulsed by the entrenched British forces with huge slaughter.  Education  There are five primary schools located in the town, St. Joseph's Templerainey, St Micheal's and St Peter's Junior School, St. John's Senior National School, Carysfort National School and Gaelscoil an Inbhir Mh√≥ir. There are four secondary schools within the town, which are St. Mary's College, St.Kevin's C.B.S., Glenart College and Gaelchol√°iste na Mara.  Transport and communications  Avoca estuary and the Nineteen Arches bridge.  Road  The M11 from Dublin to Rosslare bypasses Arklow between junctions 20 and 21. A 16.5 km upgrade to the N11 between Arklow and Rathnew began in April 2014 and was completed in July 2015. This connected the then existing M11 Arklow Bypass with the existing M11 Rathnew/Ashford Bypass creating motorway from Dublin to Gorey. This project also included the construction of a service area on the M11 Northbound, just north of Gorey, with direct access from the M11 Southbound via an overpass.  Rail  Rail connections are provided by Iarnr√≥d √âireann along the Dublin-Rosslare railway line, including commuter and intercity services in and out of the capital. There is also a train to Dundalk available daily. Arklow railway station opened on 16 November 1863.  Bus  Bus √âireann provides several routes through Arklow, including the 2, 2X, 133 and 133X services. In addition, Wexford Bus operates several services linking Arklow with Dublin Airport.  Economy  Arklow port Quarrying at Arklow Rock Industry  In 1884, Charles Stewart Parnell rented Big Rock townland from his cousin William Proby, Earl of Carysfort, and commenced quarrying. Parnell was also a supporter of the Arklow harbour scheme. The Parnell quarries closed in the 1920s. In the early part of the 20th century, a large munitions factory, Kynoch, was established on the north side of the town. This factory employed several thousand workers during the First World War but closed shortly after it, all production being moved to South Africa. 17 workers were killed in an explosion at Kynoch in 1917. The town is also known for its pottery (which eventually closed after first being taken over by Noritake) and for its shipbuilding industry. In the 1960s, a state-owned fertiliser factory, Nitrogen √âireann Teoranta, later Irish Fertiliser Industries, was established on the outskirts of the town. This factory complex comprised a number of chemical plants and manufactured a range of fertilisers from basic raw materials. It closed in 2002. There is still an industrial base in Arklow, with Servier remaining as one of the manufacturing companies in Arklow. Allergan formerly had a plant locally, but this closed in 2009. In 2009, Elavon, a credit card processing company, purchased a new business site at Arklow Business Park.  Shipping and shipbuilding  The former national sail training vessel Asgard II was built by John Tyrrell & Son Ltd in Arklow. Another John Tyrrell & Son boat, Gipsy Moth III, was sailed to victory by Francis Chichester in the 1st Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race in 1960. His time of 40 and 1/2 days was 16 days faster than the previous record crossing. While now more focused on leisure traffic than commercial traffic, Arklow Harbour remains the headquarters of Arklow Shipping, numerically the largest shipping company in Ireland. This company maintains a fleet of 56 cargo ships and a division in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Retail Arklow services a large catchment area (including a number of surrounding towns and villages) and has approximately 32,000m¬≤ of retail space. As of 2018, approximately 20% of this retail space was vacant. Among the town's largest retail centres is the Bridgewater Shopping Centre, which opened in 2007 and was sold in 2016 for ‚Ç¨33.25 million.  Environment =Water quality As of 2007, the River Avoca was classified as \\"seriously polluted\\" by the Irish EPA as a result of the discharge of sewage directly into the river in addition to a long history of industrial pollution in the area from early mining operations and more recent chemical industries. In previous centuries, Arklow was renowned for oyster beds. Raw effluent from the town still travels through the drainage system built in the 1930s and 1940s, and enters the River Avoca untreated via several sewage outfall pipes along the river. A sewage treatment plant has long been proposed for the area, and was first awarded planning permission in 1993.Wicklow County Council Planning Enquiry This was challenged unsuccessfully to An Bord Plean√°la, however subsequently no funding arrived from government,Seanad √âireann ‚Äì Volume 160 ‚Äì 19 October, 1999 ‚Äì Adjournment Matter. ‚Äì Water and Sewerage Schemes and the planning permission lapsed. A further ten-year planning permission was granted in 1999.Wicklow County Council Planning Enquiry This too was unsuccessfully challenged to An Bord Plean√°la, with conditional planning approval given in 2005. As of 2019, planning permission was again confirmed for a \\"high-tech\\" waste water treatment facility. Services and development A recycling centre is located in one of the town's industrial estates. It is run by Wicklow County Council. A few kilometres into the Irish Sea is the Arklow Bank Wind Park. Opened in 2004, this wind farm is made up of a test of seven GE 3.6 MW machines, with 106m turbines.  Sports  The local Gaelic football club, Arklow Geraldines Ballymoney GAA, was founded in 1999 and is based at Pearse Park. Arklow Rock Parnells GAA club, founded in 1953, is primarily involved in hurling and camogie and plays at Parnell Park. The town's association football clubs include Arklow Town F.C. (founded in 1948), Arklow United F.C. (Ferndale Park), and Arklow Celtic F.C. (Celtic Park). Arklow Rugby Club plays its home games at The Oval, and Arklow Rowing Club is based on the town's South Quay. There is a 18 hole links golf course at Arklow Golf Club (founded 1927).  Culture  An aerial picture of Arklow The Seabreeze Festival is a three-day event in mid-July. The festival includes a number of live shows and events at various venues throughout the town, ending in a fireworks display. Arklow has been both the birthplace and place of residence for many artists such as George Campbell who was born there son of the self-taught artist Gretta Bowen.Kate Newman, Frederick George Campbell (1917 - 1979), Dictionary of Ulster Biography. Accessed 20 May 2020. Lilian Davidson drew sketches and painted scenes of the town and beaches. One such work, The Netter, Arklow depicts a scene of a man repairing a net by the harbourside with the harbour in the background; on the reserve-side of the painting is a sketch of children playing on the south beach. Music Arklow is the title setting for Van Morrison's 1974 song \\"Streets of Arklow\\", one of eight songs he wrote on a three-week vacation back to Ireland, and featured on his album Veedon Fleece. The \\"Battle of Arklow\\" is a hornpipe and non-traditional set dance tune, and is often played at feiseanna and other Irish dance competitions. Arklow is also the home town of pop group Moloko's lead singer R√≥is√≠n Murphy. The Arklow Silver Band were featured on the track Red Hill Mining Town by U2, on their 1987 album The Joshua Tree. The \\"Arklow Music Festival\\" is held in the town annually. It was established in 1970. The festival lasts a week and it involves people coming to compete from all around the country. They compete in solo forms and group forms. Politics and government In local government Arklow and the surrounding areas has six councillors on Wicklow County Council, representing the Arklow Municipal District. Arklow is part of the Wicklow constituency for national elections and referendums, and the South European Parliament constituency for European elections.

It is sometimes referred to colloquially as \\"popcorn tea\\" because a few grains of the rice pop during the roasting process and resemble popcorn, or as \\"people's tea\\", as the rice served as a filler and reduced the price of the tea, making it more available for poorer Japanese. Today all segments of society drink genmaicha. It was also used by people fasting for religious purposes or who found themselves to be between meals for long periods of time. The sugar and starch from the rice cause the tea to have a warm, full, nutty flavor. It is considered easy to drink and to make the stomach feel better. Tea steeped from genmaicha has a light yellow hue. Its flavor is mild and combines the fresh grassy flavor of green tea with the aroma of the roasted rice. Although this tea is based on green tea, the recommended way to brew this tea is different: the water should be at about 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C (176‚Äì185 ¬∞F), and a brewing time of 3‚Äì5 minutes is recommended, depending on desired strength. Genmaicha is also sold with matcha (powdered green tea) added to it. This product is called (lit. genmaicha with added powdered tea). Matcha-iri genmaicha has a similar flavor to plain genmaicha, but the flavor is often stronger and the color more green than light yellow. In South Korea, a very similar tea is called hyeonminokcha (; \\"brown rice green tea\\"), while the word hyeonmicha (), which is a cognate of genmaicha, refers to an infusion of roasted brown rice in boiling water.

Dependent variables receive this name because, in an experiment, their values are studied under the supposition or hypothesis that they depend, by some law or rule (e.g., by a mathematical function), on the values of other variables. Independent variables, in turn, are not seen as depending on any other variable in the scope of the experiment in question; thus, even if the existing dependency is invertible (e.g., by finding the inverse function when it exists), the nomenclature is kept if the inverse dependency is not the object of study in the experiment. In this sense, some common independent variables are time, space, density, mass, fluid flow rate, and previous values of some observed value of interest (e.g. human population size) to predict future values (the dependent variable). Of the two, it is always the dependent variable whose variation is being studied, by altering inputs, also known as regressors in a statistical context. In an experiment, any variable that the experimenter manipulates can be called an independent variable. Models and experiments test the effects that the independent variables have on the dependent variables. Sometimes, even if their influence is not of direct interest, independent variables may be included for other reasons, such as to account for their potential confounding effect. In single variable calculus, a function is typically graphed with the horizontal axis representing the independent variable and the vertical axis representing the dependent variable.Hastings, Nancy Baxter. Workshop calculus: guided exploration with review. Vol. 2. Springer Science & Business Media, 1998. p. 31 In this function, y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable. Mathematics In mathematics, a function is a rule for taking an input (in the simplest case, a number or set of numbers)Carlson, Robert. A concrete introduction to real analysis. CRC Press, 2006. p.183 and providing an output (which may also be a number). A symbol that stands for an arbitrary input is called an independent variable, while a symbol that stands for an arbitrary output is called a dependent variable.Stewart, James. Calculus. Cengage Learning, 2011. Section 1.1 The most common symbol for the input is , and the most common symbol for the output is ; the function itself is commonly written .Anton, Howard, Irl C. Bivens, and Stephen Davis. Calculus Single Variable. John Wiley & Sons, 2012. Section 0.1 It is possible to have multiple independent variables or multiple dependent variables. For instance, in multivariable calculus, one often encounters functions of the form , where is a dependent variable and and are independent variables.Larson, Ron, and Bruce Edwards. Calculus. Cengage Learning, 2009. Section 13.1 Functions with multiple outputs are often referred to as vector-valued functions. Statistics In an experiment, the variable manipulated by an experimenter is something that is proven to work called an independent variable.http://onlinestatbook.com/2/introduction/variables.html The dependent variable is the event expected to change when the independent variable is manipulated. Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. Random House, Inc. 2001. Page 534, 971. . In data mining tools (for multivariate statistics and machine learning), the dependent variable is assigned a role as ' (or in some tools as label attribute), while an independent variable may be assigned a role as regular variable.English Manual version 1.0 for RapidMiner 5.0, October 2013. Known values for the target variable are provided for the training data set and test data set, but should be predicted for other data. The target variable is used in supervised learning algorithms but not in unsupervised learning. Modeling In mathematical modeling, the dependent variable is studied to see if and how much it varies as the independent variables vary. In the simple stochastic linear model the term is the th value of the dependent variable and is the th value of the independent variable. The term is known as the \\"error\\" and contains the variability of the dependent variable not explained by the independent variable. With multiple independent variables, the model is , where is the number of independent variables. The linear regression model is now discussed. To use linear regression, a scatter plot of data is generated with as the independent variable and as the dependent variable. This is also called a bivariate dataset, . The simple linear regression model takes the form , for . In this case, are independent random variables. This occurs when the measurements do not influence each other. Through propagation of independence, the independence of implies independence of , even though each has a different expectation value. Each has an expectation value of 0 and a variance of . Expectation of Proof: :E[Y_i] = E[\\\\alpha + \\\\beta x_i + U_i] = \\\\alpha + \\\\beta x_i + E[U_i] = \\\\alpha + \\\\beta x_i. The line of best fit for the bivariate dataset takes the form and is called the regression line. and correspond to the intercept and slope, respectively. Simulation In simulation, the dependent variable is changed in response to changes in the independent variables. Statistics synonyms Depending on the context, an independent variable is sometimes called a \\"predictor variable\\", regressor, covariate, \\"manipulated variable\\", \\"explanatory variable\\", exposure variable (see reliability theory), \\"risk factor\\" (see medical statistics), \\"feature\\" (in machine learning and pattern recognition) or \\"input variable\\".Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. (entry for \\"independent variable\\")Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. (entry for \\"regression\\") In econometrics, the term \\"control variable\\" is usually used instead of \\"covariate\\". From the Economics community, the independent variables are also called exogenous. Depending on the context, a dependent variable is sometimes called a \\"response variable\\", \\"regressand\\", \\"criterion\\", \\"predicted variable\\", \\"measured variable\\", \\"explained variable\\", \\"experimental variable\\", \\"responding variable\\", \\"outcome variable\\", \\"output variable\\", \\"target\\" or \\"label\\".. In economics endogenous variables are usually referencing the target. \\"Explanatory variable\\" is preferred by some authors over \\"independent variable\\" when the quantities treated as independent variables may not be statistically independent or independently manipulable by the researcher.Everitt, B.S. (2002) Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, CUP. Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. If the independent variable is referred to as an \\"explanatory variable\\" then the term \\"response variable\\" is preferred by some authors for the dependent variable. \\"Explained variable\\" is preferred by some authors over \\"dependent variable\\" when the quantities treated as \\"dependent variables\\" may not be statistically dependent.Ash Narayan Sah (2009) Data Analysis Using Microsoft Excel, New Delhi. If the dependent variable is referred to as an \\"explained variable\\" then the term \\"predictor variable\\" is preferred by some authors for the independent variable. Variables may also be referred to by their form: continuous or categorical, which in turn may be binary/dichotomous, nominal categorical, and ordinal categorical, among others. An example is provided by the analysis of trend in sea level by . Here the dependent variable (and variable of most interest) was the annual mean sea level at a given location for which a series of yearly values were available. The primary independent variable was time. Use was made of a covariate consisting of yearly values of annual mean atmospheric pressure at sea level. The results showed that inclusion of the covariate allowed improved estimates of the trend against time to be obtained, compared to analyses which omitted the covariate. Other variables A variable may be thought to alter the dependent or independent variables, but may not actually be the focus of the experiment. So that the variable will be kept constant or monitored to try to minimize its effect on the experiment. Such variables may be designated as either a \\"controlled variable\\", \\"control variable\\", or \\"fixed variable\\". Extraneous variables, if included in a regression analysis as independent variables, may aid a researcher with accurate response parameter estimation, prediction, and goodness of fit, but are not of substantive interest to the hypothesis under examination. For example, in a study examining the effect of post-secondary education on lifetime earnings, some extraneous variables might be gender, ethnicity, social class, genetics, intelligence, age, and so forth. A variable is extraneous only when it can be assumed (or shown) to influence the dependent variable. If included in a regression, it can improve the fit of the model. If it is excluded from the regression and if it has a non-zero covariance with one or more of the independent variables of interest, its omission will bias the regression's result for the effect of that independent variable of interest. This effect is called confounding or omitted variable bias; in these situations, design changes and/or controlling for a variable statistical control is necessary. Extraneous variables are often classified into three types: #Subject variables, which are the characteristics of the individuals being studied that might affect their actions. These variables include age, gender, health status, mood, background, etc. #Blocking variables or experimental variables are characteristics of the persons conducting the experiment which might influence how a person behaves. Gender, the presence of racial discrimination, language, or other factors may qualify as such variables. #Situational variables are features of the environment in which the study or research was conducted, which have a bearing on the outcome of the experiment in a negative way. Included are the air temperature, level of activity, lighting, and the time of day. In modelling, variability that is not covered by the independent variable is designated by e_I and is known as the \\"residual\\", \\"side effect\\", \\"error\\", \\"unexplained share\\", \\"residual variable\\", \\"disturbance\\", or \\"tolerance\\". Examples * Effect of fertilizer on plant growths: : In a study measuring the influence of different quantities of fertilizer on plant growth, the independent variable would be the amount of fertilizer used. The dependent variable would be the growth in height or mass of the plant. The controlled variables would be the type of plant, the type of fertilizer, the amount of sunlight the plant gets, the size of the pots, etc. * Effect of drug dosage on symptom severity: : In a study of how different doses of a drug affect the severity of symptoms, a researcher could compare the frequency and intensity of symptoms when different doses are administered. Here the independent variable is the dose and the dependent variable is the frequency/intensity of symptoms. * Effect of temperature on pigmentation: : In measuring the amount of color removed from beetroot samples at different temperatures, temperature is the independent variable and amount of pigment removed is the dependent variable. *Effect of sugar added in a coffee: : The taste varies with the amount of sugar added in the coffee. Here, the sugar is the independent variable, while the taste is the dependent variable.

According to estimates by WHO and UNAIDS, 34.2 million people were infected with HIV at the end of 2011. That same year, some 2.5 million people became newly infected, and 1.7 million died of AIDS-related causes, including 230 000 children. More than two-thirds of new HIV infections are in sub-Saharan Africa. However, fewer than 20% of them are actually aware of the infection. Infection with HIV is determined by an HIV test.  Gender and diagnosis  Diagnosis and gender play corresponding roles in recognizing the lives of those infected with HIV/AIDS. Women have not been diagnosed as early as men because their symptoms were not as obvious and doctors were not as likely to search for the disease in them as they are for men. This has also been based on the fact that far more men than women participated in clinical trials and women were therefore under-represented. Barbara Ogur has pointed out that the stigma of illegal drug use, and multiple partners has also led to a lack of care and noticeability for women. Among the women who were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in the United States in 2009, 64% were Black, 18% were Mexican, 15% were White, and 1% were Native Alaskan or Native American. Far more women contract the disease via heterosexual contact than men.Women's Lives: Multicultural Perspective Chapter 5 As of April 2020, there have only been two reported cases of individuals being completely cured of this disease. The first case was Timothy Ray Brown surname \\"The Berlin Patient\\" who was cured in 2007. The second was Adam Castillejo who was cured in March 2020. Both of these patients were cured with stem cell transplants from a donor who was immune to AIDS due to a genetic mutation.  Organizations  Over the years of coping with the stigma and discrimination that accompany the diagnosis in most societies, a large number of support groups have been formed. In these groups, the term most often applied to people who are HIV-positive is \\"People Living With HIV/AIDS\\". This is often abbreviated as \\"PLWHA\\" or \\"PLHIV\\". Recently, \\"People Living Positively\\" has also been used. The largest and oldest of the worldwide networks of people infected with HIV is the Global Network of People Living With HIV/AIDS (GNP+), which has affiliate networks on every continent.  Testimony and relationship issues  For women who are HIV-positive and also in relationships, sexual expression and communication may become an issue of conflict. Their natural human desires of love, trust and intimacy might go unrecognized in programs such as ABC (Abstinence, Being faithful, Condom use) and as a member of the ICW (International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS) stated at the International AIDS conference in 2006 \\"we need to bring love back into the whole thing.\\" Each individual deals with an HIV diagnosis and their post-diagnosis sexual activity in different ways. Some individuals with HIV may decide to practice abstinence, while others may continue to have sex. An ICW member from Zimbabwe stated at a session in Toronto that her \\"relationship ended, and I spent the next four years celibate,\\" while an ICW member in the United Kingdom found that she preferred the use of condoms and \\"in some ways [HIV] has made me more assertive sexually.\\" It is vital to note that a positive diagnosis of the disease does not only affect illegal drug users or promiscuous individuals and that their basic sexual desires do not fade.Understanding Positive Women's Realities(2006) Emma Bell and Luisa Orza  Testing and rights  In Understanding Positive Women's Realities, Emma Bell and Luisa Orza argue HIV and sexual and reproductive health programmes and policies fail to recognize the complexity of HIV-positive people's lives and the context in which their sexual and reproductive choices are situated. Services do not prepare people for the consequences of a positive result of an HIV test. In many cases, service users are not taken into account and are forced to undergo an AIDS test without prior consent.  Understanding HIV-positive realities  The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Amnesty International, the Global Network of Sex Work Projects and the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS, have all condemned forced HIV testing actions as infringements on human rights and conflicting with proven public health measures that are successful in preventing HIV transmission. Sex workers in Malawi and Greece have been forced to undergo HIV testing and those who tested HIV-positive were criminalized. Stigmatizing measures discourage HIV-positive people from seeking voluntary and confidential counseling, testing and treatment. Stigma attached with the disease makes it particularly harder for children living with HIV and their caregivers. Caregiving goes beyond the child-caregiver dynamic, and is intertwined with the local community and the healthcare and support system structures. Movies such as Philadelphia (1993), which followed the story of a homosexual, HIV-positive lawyer played by Tom Hanks, helped counteract stigma towards HIV-victims and made the topic less taboo. As HIV advocate Gary Bell claims: \\"I remember there was quite a buzz about it. I think the good news was that it got people talking about HIV in a way that they really weren't, because HIV was always that thing we really didn't want to talk about.\\" According to Emma Bell and Luisa Orza in Understanding Positive Women's Realities, there is need for service providers to understand women's relationships impact on their ability to access treatment and other health services. In many cases, HIV-positive realities include husbands or partners who have not or are unwilling to be tested for HIV forcing their HIV- positive spouse into giving them their ARV dose.

He was sometimes known as \\"The Junk Man\\", but better known as \\"Steady Eddie\\", a nickname later given to Eddie Murray. He was born in New York City. Playing career A , left-hander, Lopat began his playing career in 1937. After seven minor league seasons, he made his major league pitching debut on April 30, 1944, playing for the Chicago White Sox. He was traded to the New York Yankees on February 24, 1948 for Aaron Robinson, Bill Wight, and Fred Bradley. From to he was the third of the \\"Big Three\\" of the Yankees' pitching staff, together with Allie Reynolds and Vic Raschi. He pitched in the All-Star Game in for the American League. In he led the AL in both earned-run average and won/lost percentage. On July 30, 1955, Lopat was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Jim McDonald and cash, finishing out the season and retiring. Over his 12-year AL career, Lopat won 166 games, losing 112 (.597) with an ERA of 3.21. He was also adept with the bat, compiling a .211 batting average with 5 home runs and 77 runs batted in during his career. Coaching career Lopat managed the Triple-A Richmond Virginians for the Yankees from 1956‚Äì58, then became a roving pitching coach in the Bombers' farm system in 1959. In , he served one season the Yankees' MLB pitching coach during Casey Stengel's final campaign as the club's manager. That year produced an American League pennant for the Yankees, but a defeat at the hands of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series. Lopat was not rehired by Stengel's successor, Ralph Houk, but he stayed in the league as pitching coach of the Minnesota Twins in and the Kansas City Athletics in . In Lopat was tapped to manage the Athletics and continued in this role until June 11, 1964.McGaha in, Lopat out His 1963 squad finished in eighth place, registering one more victory than it had in 1962. But his 1964 A's were playing only .327 baseball at 17‚Äì35 when he was replaced by Mel McGaha. His final major league managerial record was 90‚Äì124 (.421). Lopat remained with the Athletics as a senior front office aide to team owner Charlie Finley until the club moved to Oakland after the season. He then scouted for the Montreal Expos during their early years in Major League Baseball.

A Web cache system stores copies of documents passing through it; subsequent requests may be satisfied from the cache if certain conditions are met. A Web cache system can refer either to an appliance or to a computer program. Systems Web caches can be used in various systems (as viewed from the direction of delivery of Web content):  Forward position system (recipient or client-side)  A forward cache is a cache outside the Web server's network, e.g. on the client computer, in an ISP or within a corporate network. A network-aware forward cache is just like a forward cache but only caches heavily accessed items. A client, such as a Web browser, can also store Web content for reuse. For example, if the back button is pressed, the locally cached version of a page may be displayed instead of a new request being sent to the Web server. A Web proxy sitting between the client and the server can evaluate HTTP headers and choose whether to store Web content.  Reverse position system (content provider or web-server side)  A reverse cache sits in front of one or more Web servers and Web applications, accelerating requests from the Internet, reducing peak Web server load. A content delivery network (CDN) can retain copies of Web content at various points throughout a network. A search engine may also cache a website; it provides a way of retrieving information from websites that have recently gone down or a way of retrieving data more quickly than by clicking the direct link. Google, for instance, does so. Links to cached contents may be found in Google search results. Cache-control HTTP defines three basic mechanisms for controlling caches: freshness, validation, and invalidation. ; Freshness : allows a response to be used without re-checking it on the origin server, and can be controlled by both the server and the client. For example, the Expires response header gives a date when the document becomes stale, and the Cache-Control: max-age directive tells the cache how many seconds the response is fresh for. ; Validation : can be used to check whether a cached response is still good after it becomes stale. For example, if the response has a Last-Modified header, a cache can make a conditional request using the If-Modified-Since header to see if it has changed. The ETag (entity tag) mechanism also allows for both strong and weak validation. ; Invalidation : is usually a side effect of another request that passes through the cache. For example, if a URL associated with a cached response subsequently gets a POST, PUT or DELETE request, the cached response will be invalidated. Many CDNs and manufacturers of network equipment have replaced this standard HTTP cache control with dynamic caching. Legal issues In 1998, the DMCA added rules to the United States Code (17 U.S.C. ¬ß: 512) that relinquishes system operators from copyright liability for the purposes of caching.

It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read. Memcached is free and open-source software, licensed under the Revised BSD license. Memcached runs on Unix-like operating systems (Linux and OS X) and on Microsoft Windows. It depends on the libevent library. Memcached's APIs provide a very large hash table distributed across multiple machines. When the table is full, subsequent inserts cause older data to be purged in least recently used (LRU) order. Applications using Memcached typically layer requests and additions into RAM before falling back on a slower backing store, such as a database. Memcached has no internal mechanism to track misses which may happen. However, some third party utilities provide this functionality. Memcached was first developed by Brad Fitzpatrick for his website LiveJournal, on May 22, 2003.. Community.livejournal.com (2003-05-22). Retrieved on 2013-09-18.. Community.livejournal.com (2003-05-27). Retrieved on 2013-09-18. It was originally written in Perl, then later rewritten in C by Anatoly Vorobey, then employed by LiveJournal. Memcached is now used by many other systems, including YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Wikipedia, and Method Studios. Google App Engine, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, IBM Bluemix and Amazon Web Services also offer a Memcached service through an API. Software architecture The system uses a client‚Äìserver architecture. The servers maintain a key‚Äìvalue associative array; the clients populate this array and query it by key. Keys are up to 250 bytes long and values can be at most 1 megabyte in size. Clients use client- side libraries to contact the servers which, by default, expose their service at port 11211. Both TCP and UDP are supported. Each client knows all servers; the servers do not communicate with each other. If a client wishes to set or read the value corresponding to a certain key, the client's library first computes a hash of the key to determine which server to use. This gives a simple form of sharding and scalable shared-nothing architecture across the servers. The server computes a second hash of the key to determine where to store or read the corresponding value. The servers keep the values in RAM; if a server runs out of RAM, it discards the oldest values. Therefore, clients must treat Memcached as a transitory cache; they cannot assume that data stored in Memcached is still there when they need it. Other databases, such as MemcacheDB, Couchbase Server, provide persistent storage while maintaining Memcached protocol compatibility. If all client libraries use the same hashing algorithm to determine servers, then clients can read each other's cached data. A typical deployment has several servers and many clients. However, it is possible to use Memcached on a single computer, acting simultaneously as client and server. The size of its hash table is often very large. It is limited to available memory across all the servers in the cluster of servers in a data center. Where high-volume, wide-audience Web publishing requires it, this may stretch to many gigabytes. Memcached can be equally valuable for situations where either the number of requests for content is high, or the cost of generating a particular piece of content is high. Security Most deployments of Memcached are within trusted networks where clients may freely connect to any server. However, sometimes Memcached is deployed in untrusted networks or where administrators want to exercise control over the clients that are connecting. For this purpose Memcached can be compiled with optional SASL authentication support. The SASL support requires the binary protocol. A presentation at BlackHat USA 2010 revealed that a number of large public websites had left Memcached open to inspection, analysis, retrieval, and modification of data. Even within a trusted organisation, the flat trust model of memcached may have security implications. For efficient simplicity, all Memcached operations are treated equally. Clients with a valid need for access to low-security entries within the cache gain access to all entries within the cache, even when these are higher-security and that client has no justifiable need for them. If the cache key can be either predicted, guessed or found by exhaustive searching, its cache entry may be retrieved. Some attempt to isolate setting and reading data may be made in situations such as high volume web publishing. A farm of outward-facing content servers have read access to memcached containing published pages or page components, but no write access. Where new content is published (and is not yet in memcached), a request is instead sent to content generation servers that are not publicly accessible to create the content unit and add it to memcached. The content server then retries to retrieve it and serve it outwards. =Used as a DDoS attack vector= In February 2018, CloudFlare reported that misconfigured memcached servers were used to launch DDoS attacks in large scale. The memcached protocol over UDP has a huge amplification factor, of more than 51000. Victims of the DDoS attacks include GitHub, which was flooded with 1.35 Tbit/s peak incoming traffic. This issue was mitigated in Memcached version 1.5.6, which disabled UDP protocol by default. Example code Note that all functions described on this page are pseudocode only. Memcached calls and programming languages may vary based on the API used. Converting database or object creation queries to use Memcached is simple. Typically, when using straight database queries, example code would be as follows: function get_foo(int userid) data = db_select(\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE userid = ?\\", userid) return data After conversion to Memcached, the same call might look like the following function get_foo(int userid) /* first try the cache */ data = memcached_fetch(\\"userrow:\\" + userid) if not data /* not found : request database */ data = db_select(\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE userid = ?\\", userid) /* then store in cache until next get */ memcached_add(\\"userrow:\\" + userid, data) end return data The client would first check whether a Memcached value with the unique key \\"userrow:userid\\" exists, where userid is some number. If the result does not exist, it would select from the database as usual, and set the unique key using the Memcached API add function call. However, if only this API call were modified, the server would end up fetching incorrect data following any database update actions: the Memcached \\"view\\" of the data would become out of date. Therefore, in addition to creating an \\"add\\" call, an update call would also be needed using the Memcached set function. function update_foo(int userid, string dbUpdateString) /* first update database */ result = db_execute(dbUpdateString) if result /* database update successful : fetch data to be stored in cache */ data = db_select(\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE userid = ?\\", userid) /* the previous line could also look like data = createDataFromDBString(dbUpdateString) */ /* then store in cache until next get */ memcached_set(\\"userrow:\\" + userid, data) This call would update the currently cached data to match the new data in the database, assuming the database query succeeds. An alternative approach would be to invalidate the cache with the Memcached delete function, so that subsequent fetches result in a cache miss. Similar action would need to be taken when database records were deleted, to maintain either a correct or incomplete cache. An alternate cache- invalidation strategy is to store a random number in an agreed-upon cache entry and to incorporate this number into all keys that are used to store a particular kind of entry. To invalidate all such entries at once, change the random number. Existing entries (which were stored using the old number) will no longer be referenced and so will eventually expire or be recycled. function store_xyz_entry(int key, string value) /* Retrieve the random number - use zero if none exists yet. * The key-name used here is arbitrary. */ seed = memcached_fetch(\\":xyz_seed:\\") if not seed seed = 0 /* Build the key used to store the entry and store it. * The key-name used here is also arbitrary. Notice that the \\"seed\\" and the user's \\"key\\" * are stored as separate parts of the constructed hashKey string: \\":xyz_data:(seed):(key).\\" * This is not mandatory, but is recommended. */ string hashKey = sprintf(\\":xyz_data:%d:%d\\", seed, key) memcached_set(hashKey, value) /* \\"fetch_entry,\\" not shown, follows identical logic to the above. */ function invalidate_xyz_cache() existing_seed = memcached_fetch(\\":xyz_seed:\\") /* Coin a different random seed */ do seed = rand() until seed != existing_seed /* Now store it in the agreed-upon place. All future requests will use this number. * Therefore, all existing entries become un-referenced and will eventually expire. */ memcached_set(\\":xyz_seed:\\", seed) Usage *MySQL - directly supports the Memcached API as of version 5.6. *Oracle Coherence - directly supports the Memcached API as of version 12.1.3. *GigaSpaces XAP - support Memcached with high availability, transaction support See also * Amazon ElastiCache * Aerospike *Couchbase Server *Redis *Mnesia *MemcacheDB *Hazelcast *Cassandra *Tarantool * Ehcache ReferencesExternal links * Category:Free memory management software Category:Cross-platform software Category:Structured storage Category:2003 software Category:Database caching Category:Key-value databases Category:Software using the BSD license ","title":"Memcached"},{"id":"437721","text":"Harold Lloyd Jenkins (September 1, 1933 ‚Äì June 5, 1993), better known by his stage name Conway Twitty, was an American country music singer. He also had success in the rock and roll, R&B;, and pop genres. From 1971 to 1976, Twitty received a string of Country Music Association awards for duets with Loretta Lynn. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Life and career=Early life Twitty was born Harold Lloyd Jenkins on September 1, 1933, in Friars Point, in Coahoma County, in northwestern Mississippi. The Jenkins family were of Welsh descent. He was named by his great-uncle, after his favorite silent movie actor, Harold Lloyd. The Jenkins family moved to Helena, Arkansas, when Jenkins was 10 years old. In Helena, Jenkins formed his first singing group, the Phillips County Ramblers. Jenkins had his own local radio show every Saturday morning. He also played baseball, his second passion. He received an offer to play with the Philadelphia Phillies after high school, but he was drafted into the United States Army. He served in the Far East and organized a group called the Cimmerons to entertain his fellow soldiers.\\"Conway Twitty Magnolia Stater\\" (October 20, 1958). The Billboard. p. 58. Wayne Hause, a neighbor, suggested that Jenkins could make it in the music industry. Soon after hearing Elvis Presley's song \\"Mystery Train\\", Jenkins began writing rock and roll material. He went to the Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, and worked with Sam Phillips, the owner and founder, to get the \\"right\\" sound. Stage name Allegedly, in 1957, Jenkins decided that his real name was not memorable enough and sought a better show business name. In The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, Fred Bronson states that the singer was looking at a road map when he spotted Conway, Arkansas, and Twitty, Texas, and chose the name Conway Twitty. Pop and rock-and-roll success In 1958, using his new stage name, Twitty's fortunes improved while he was with MGM Records, and an Ohio radio station had an inspiration, refraining from playing \\"I'll Try\\" (an MGM single that went nowhere in terms of sales, radio play, and jukebox play), instead playing the B-side, \\"It's Only Make Believe\\", a song written between sets by Twitty and drummer Jack Nance when they were in Hamilton, Ontario, playing at the Flamingo Lounge. The record took nearly one year to reach and stay at the top spot on the Billboard pop music charts in the United States and number 1 in 21 other countries, becoming the first of nine top-40 hits for Twitty. It sold over four million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. That same year, country singer Tabby West of ABC-TV's Ozark Jubilee heard Twitty and booked him to appear on the show. When \\"It's Only Make Believe\\" was first released, because of vocal similarities, many listeners assumed that the song was actually recorded by Elvis Presley, using \\"Conway Twitty\\" as a pseudonym. Twitty would go on to enjoy rock-and-roll success with songs including \\"Danny Boy\\" (Pop number 10) and \\"Lonely Blue Boy\\" (Pop number 6). \\"Lonely Blue Boy\\", originally titled \\"Danny\\", was recorded by Presley for the film King Creole but was not used in the soundtrack. This song led to him naming his band the Lonely Blue Boys. They subsequently became the Twitty Birds. Country music career Twitty always wanted to record country music, and, beginning in 1965, he did just that. Disc jockeys on some country-music radio stations refused to play his first few country albums, because he was known as a rock- and-roll singer. However, he had his first top five country hit, \\"The Image of Me\\", in July 1968, followed by his first number one country song, \\"Next in Line\\", in November 1968. Few of his singles beginning in 1968 ranked below the top five. In 1970, Twitty recorded and released his biggest country hit, \\"Hello Darlin'\\", which spent four weeks at the top of the country chart and is one of Twitty's most recognized songs. In 1971, he released his first hit duet with Loretta Lynn, \\"After the Fire Is Gone\\". It was a success, and many more followed, including \\"Lead Me On\\" (1971), \\"Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man\\" (1973), \\"As Soon As I Hang Up the Phone\\" (1974), \\"Feelins'\\" (1975), \\"I Still Believe in Waltzes\\", \\"I Can't Love You Enough\\", and many others. Together, Conway and Loretta (as they were known in their act), won four consecutive Country Music Association awards for vocal duo (1972‚Äì75) and a host of other duo and duet awards from other organizations throughout the 1970s. In 1973, Twitty released \\"You've Never Been This Far Before\\", which was number 1 in country for three weeks that September and also reached number 22 on the pop charts. Some more conservative disc jockeys refused to play the song, believing that some of the lyrics were too sexually suggestive. In 1978, Twitty issued the single \\"The Grandest Lady of Them All\\" honoring the Grand Ole Opry. (Somewhat ironically, Twitty was never inducted into the Opry during his lifetime; he remains one of the most prominent Nashville country artists to have never been an Opry member.) The single reached the top 20, peaking at number 16, but it was well below expectations; it was the first time since 1967 that a single of his failed to reach the top ten, as some radio stations refused to play a song honoring the property of a competitor (broadcast by WSM-AM). Twitty soon renewed his image with a new hairstyle, changing from the slicked-back pompadour style to the curlier style he would keep for the rest of his life; by the late 1970s, Twitty had shifted his musical arrangements into a country pop style he would maintain for the rest of his career. His next 23 consecutive singles all made it into the top 10, with 13 peaking at number 1, including \\"Don't Take It Away\\", \\"I May Never Get to Heaven\\", \\"Happy Birthday Darlin'\\" and remakes of major pop hits such as \\"The Rose\\" and \\"Slow Hand\\" and \\"Tight Fittin' Jeans\\", a song written by Michael Huffman, released in June 1981 as the first single from the album Mr. T. The song was Twitty's 26th number one on the country chart. The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of 10 weeks on the country chart. In 1985, going by all weekly music trade charts, the song \\"Don't Call Him a Cowboy\\" became the 50th single of his career to achieve a number-1 ranking. He would have five more through 1990, giving him a total of 55 number 1 hits. George Strait matched the feat of 50 number-1 hits in 2002 with his single \\"She'll Leave You With a Smile\\" and then reached number 1 for the 56th time in 2007, when the single \\"Wrapped\\" hit the top on the Media Base 24/7 list. Throughout much of Twitty's country music career his recording home was Decca Records, later renamed MCA. He signed with the label in late 1965 but left in 1981, when it appeared MCA was marketing and promoting newer acts; management at the label had changed, in addition to other factors that brought on the decision. He joined Elektra/Asylum in 1982. That label's country music unit merged with sister label Warner Bros. Records in 1983. He stayed with Warner Bros. through early 1987 but then went back to MCA to finish his career. In 1993, shortly before he died, he recorded a new album, Final Touches. Baseball Twitty throwing out the first pitch at the first Nashville Sounds game on April 26, 1978 Twitty also played baseball, his second passion. He received an offer to play with the Philadelphia Phillies after high school, but he was drafted into the United States Army before he could sign the contract. Twitty joined the entrepreneur Larry Schmittou and other country musicians, such as Cal Smith and Jerry Reed in 1977 as investors in the Nashville Sounds, a Minor League Baseball team of the Double-A Southern League, which began playing in 1978. Twitty threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the team's inaugural home opener at Herschel Greer Stadium on April 26, 1978. Twitty would also host celebrity softball games for charity, frequently playing against a team put together by Barbara Mandrell. Twitty City Twitty lived for many years in Hendersonville, Tennessee, just north of Nashville, where he built a country music entertainment complex called Twitty City at a cost of over $3.5 million. Twitty and Twitty City were once featured on the TV series Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, and was also seen in the Nashville episode of the BBC series Entertainment USA, presented by Jonathan King. Opened in 1982, it was a popular tourist stop throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s; it was shut down in 1994 following a year-long tribute show called Final Touches, when fans and peers in the music business dropped by. The complex was auctioned off and bought by the Trinity Broadcasting Network. Personal life Twitty was married four times, to three different women. His first marriage, to Ellen Matthews, lasted from 1953 to 1954. They had married because Ellen was pregnant with his son, Michael. His second, and longest, marriage was to Temple \\"Mickey\\" Medley. They were married in 1956 and had three children: Kathy, Joni Lee, and Jimmy Twitty. The couple were divorced in early 1970, but they remarried quietly by the end of 1970. By 1984, after 28 years of marriage on and off, the stress of Twitty's frequent absences took its toll on Mickey, and she and Conway divorced for good. In 1987, Twitty married his 36-year-old office secretary, Delores \\"Dee\\" Henry. They were married until Twitty's death. Twitty made Oklahoma City his home during most of his recording career, from 1963‚Äì1972. He also lived in Norman, Oklahoma. Twitty performed at the Diamond Ballroom after its opening in 1964. Conway Twitty opened one of his Twitty Burger restaurants at 7200 S. Western Avenue, in Oklahoma City. In 1981, Twitty was exiting his tour bus when he slipped on the steps and fell, hitting his head against the steps. John Hughey, who was Twitty's steel guitar player, found him on the ground. Many people, including family members, said that Twitty underwent a change in personality after the accident. According to his daughter Joni, Twitty was not in a right state of mind for several months, saying in an interview that he had picked up a TV remote and began talking into it, thinking it was a phone. Twitty served on the board of directors of CMT (Country Music Television) from 1984 to 1988, after Music Village Group (Nyhl Henson, Gilbert Biggers, Hall Hardaway Jr. and Benny and Dean Jaggers) acquired CMTV from Glen Daniels. (Inheriting a copyright infringement suit from Viacom, owner of MTV, settled for an undisclosed sum.) The Music Village Group, built Music Village USA adjacent to Twitty City including a state-of-the-art 1776-seat theatre where CMT unlinked its 24-hour programming and produced live concerts. When Music Village and Twitty was sold in 1989 and CMT in 1990, Conway turned his attention to the burgeoning Branson market playing to sell out crowds. He had teamed up again with Nyhl Henson and his team including former quarterback turned architect who designed Branson's first Log Theatre, to anchor the 1400 Branson Hills development and new musical home of Conway Twitty. He inked the deal the day before his death in June 1993. Death On June 4, 1993, Twitty became ill while performing at the Jim Stafford Theatre in Branson, Missouri. He collapsed on his tour bus after the show and was rushed to a hospital. He was rushed into surgery but died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, in the early hours of the following morning at Cox South Hospital in Springfield, Missouri, at the age of 59. His last studio album, Final Touches, was released two months later. Four months after Twitty's death, George Jones included a cover version of \\"Hello Darlin'\\" on his album High-Tech Redneck. Twitty was buried at Sumner Memorial Gardens in Gallatin, Tennessee, in a red granite vault, under his birth name \\"Harold L. Jenkins\\". There are spaces reserved next to him for his wife and his son Michael. Posthumous releases Since his death, Twitty's son Michael and grandson Tre have been carrying on his musical legacy. His most recent appearance on the country charts was a duet with Anita Cochran, \\"(I Want to Hear) A Cheating Song\\" (2004), which was made possible by splicing Twitty's vocal from old recordings and even interviews, recorded over the years. As a result, Twitty's isolated vocal track was transferred to a digital multitrack and digitally reassembled into the new performance. Like the electronic duets of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves, Hank Williams and Hank Williams Jr. or Nat King Cole and Natalie Cole, Cochran added her vocal to backing tracks that had already been produced along with Twitty's reconstructed vocal. Currently, Bear Family Records offers a single-disc collection, Conway Rocks, featuring 30 songs, and The Rock 'n' Roll Years, a comprehensive eight-disc box set showcasing his complete early recordings as a rock artist.Who was/is Twitty, Conway? Bear Family Records. Material losses On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Conway Twitty among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Legal issues=Taxes Twitty's success in country music was a key factor in his winning a 1983 case, Harold L. Jenkins (a/k/a Conway Twitty) v. Commissioner in United States Tax Court. The Internal Revenue Service allowed Twitty to deduct from his taxes, as an \\"ordinary and necessary\\" business expense, payments that he had made to repay investors in a defunct fast-food chain called Twitty Burger; the chain disestablished in 1971. The general rule is that the payment of someone else's debts is not deductible. Twitty alleged that his primary motive was \\"protecting his personal business reputation.\\" The court opinion contained testimony from Twitty about his bond with country music fans. Estate Twitty married four times (twice to Mickey). His widow in 1993, Delores \\"Dee\\" Henry Jenkins, and his four grown children from the previous marriages, Michael, Joni, Kathy and Jimmy Jenkins, engaged in a public dispute over the estate. Twitty's will had not been updated to account for the fourth marriage, but Tennessee law reserves one third of any estate to the widow. After years of probate, the four children received the rights to Twitty's music, name and image. The rest of the estate went to public auction, where much of the property and memorabilia was sold after his widow rejected the appraised value. In 2008, controversy again erupted in his family when the four remaining children sued Sony/ATV Music Publishing over an agreement that Twitty and his family signed in 1990. The suit alleged that the terms of the agreement were not fully understood by the children, although they were all adults at the time. It sought to recover copyrights and royalty revenue that the document assigned to the company.

The patient is most often ill or injured and in need of treatment by a physician, nurse, psychologist, dentist, veterinarian, or other health care provider. Etymology The word patient originally meant 'one who suffers'. This English noun comes from the Latin word patiens, the present participle of the deponent verb, patior, meaning 'I am suffering,' and akin to the Greek verb œÄŒ¨œÉœáŒµŒπŒΩ (= paskhein, to suffer) and its cognate noun œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ (= pathos). Outpatients and inpatients Receptionist attending to an outpatient An outpatient (or out-patient) is a patient who attends the hospital with no plan to stay beyond the duration of the visit. Even if the patient will not be formally admitted with a note as an outpatient, their attendance are still registered, and the provider will usually give a note explaining the reason for the visit, tests or procedure/surgery, which should include the names and titles of the participating personnel, the patient's name and date of birth, signature of informed consent, estimated pre- and post-service time for a history and exam (before and after), any anesthesia, medications or future treatment plans needed, and estimated time of discharge absent any (further) complications. Treatment provided in this fashion is called ambulatory care. Sometimes surgery is performed without the need for a formal hospital admission or an overnight stay, and this is called outpatient surgery or \\"day surgery\\", which has many benefits including lowered healthcare cost, reducing the amount of medication prescribed and using the physician's or surgeon's time more efficiently. Outpatient surgery is suited best for more healthy patients undergoing minor or intermediate procedures (limited urologic, ophthalmologic, or ear, nose and throat procedures and procedures involving superficial skin and the extremities). More procedures are being performed in a surgeon's office, termed office-based surgery, rather than in a hospital-based operating room. An inpatient (or in-patient), on the other hand, is \\"admitted\\" to stay in the hospital overnight or for an indeterminate time, usually, several days or weeks, though in some extreme cases, such as with coma or persistent vegetative state, patients can stay in hospitals for years, sometimes until death. Treatment provided in this fashion is called inpatient care. The admission to the hospital involves the production of an admission note. The leaving of the hospital is officially termed discharge, and involves a corresponding discharge note. Misdiagnosis is the leading cause of medical error in outpatient facilities. When the U.S. Institute of Medicine‚Äôs groundbreaking 1999 report, To Err Is Human, found up to 98,000 hospital patients die from preventable medical errors in the U.S. each year, early efforts focused on inpatient safety. While patient safety efforts have focused on inpatient hospital settings for more than a decade, medical errors are even more likely to happen in a doctor‚Äôs office or outpatient clinic or center.  Day patient  A day patient or (day-patient) is a patient who is using the full range of services of a hospital or clinic but is not expected to stay the night. The term was originally used by psychiatric hospital services using of this patient type to care for people needing support to make the transition from in-patient to out-patient care. However, the term is now also heavily used for people attending hospitals for day surgery. Alternative terminology Because of concerns such as dignity, human rights and political correctness, the term \\"patient\\" is not always used to refer to a person receiving health care. Other terms that are sometimes used include health consumer, health care consumer, customer or client. However, such terminology may be offensive to those receiving public health care as it implies a business relationship. In veterinary medicine, the client is the owner or guardian of the patient. These may be used by governmental agencies, insurance companies, patient groups, or health care facilities. Individuals who use or have used psychiatric services may alternatively refer to themselves as consumers, users, or survivors. In nursing homes and assisted living facilities, the term resident is generally used in lieu of patient, but it is common for staff members at such a facility to use the term patient in reference to residents. Similarly, those receiving home health care are called clients. Patient-centered healthcare The doctor-patient relationship has sometimes been characterized as silencing the voice of patients. It is now widely agreed that putting patients at the centre of healthcare by trying to provide a consistent, informative and respectful service to patients will improve both outcomes and patient satisfaction. When patients are not at the centre of healthcare, when institutional procedures and targets eclipse local concerns, then patient neglect is possible. Incidents, such as the Stafford Hospital scandal, Winterbourne View hospital abuse scandal and the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014 have shown the dangers of prioritizing cost control over the patient experience. Investigations into these and other scandals have recommended that healthcare systems put patient experience at the center, and especially that patients themselves are heard loud and clear within health services. There are many reasons for why health services should listen more to patients. Patients spend more time in healthcare services than regulators or quality controllers, and can recognize problems such as service delays, poor hygiene, and poor conduct. Patients are particularly good at identifying soft problems, such as attitudes, communication, and 'caring neglect', that are difficult to capture with institutional monitoring. One important way in which patients can be placed at the centre of healthcare is for health services to be more open about patient complaints. Each year many hundreds of thousands of patients complain about the care they have received, and these complaints contain valuable information for any health services which want to learn about and improve patient experience.

Brought up in poverty in Sussex, England, Levett had an affinity for the underdog.Gordon Levett, 101squadron.com \\"Looking back, I have neither failed nor succeeded, the fate of most of us,\\" Levett reflected later, \\"but I shall leave the world a better place than when I entered it because I helped found the State of Israel.\\" Initially, Levett was regarded with deep suspicion. \\"Not only was he not a Jew, but Mr. Levett was particularly notable because he was British,\\" said The New York Times. \\"To most Israelis at that time, the recently lapsed British mandate in Palestine had been decidedly pro- Arab, and British Government policy was seen as anti-Zionist.\\" \\"Recruited in March 1948 by emissaries in Europe of the Haganah, the Jewish fighting force in Palestine, Mr. Levett was viewed with a healthy dose of suspicion,\\" noted the Times. \\"'In my last interview I was told, 'We're quite convinced that you are a British spy, but we're going to take you to see what you're up to,'\\" he recalled. In June Levett was given the task of flying Avia S-199 fighters, supplied by Czechoslovakia from the Czechoslovak Air Force airfield (code- named Etzion or Zebra by Israelis) near ≈Ωatec (seventy-five kilometers west of Prague) to Ekron airfield (formerly RAF Aqir) close to Rehovot now Tel Nof Israeli Air Force Base. The airfield near ≈Ωatec had been put at disposal of the Haganah by a new Czechoslovak foreign minister Vladim√≠r Clementis (a prominent Slovak member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia) and was under the command of Yehuda Ben Chorin. Operation Balak lasted three months, during which time Levett managed to airlift tons of arms, ammunition and personnel.Rothkirchen, 2006, p.287 During the first ferry flight of 15 aircraft, three were forced to land in Greece due to poor navigation, and were interned.Luttrell, Robert J., I flew for Israel, Flying Magazine, May 1949, p.59 After a defector revealed the existence of the base code-named \\"Zebra\\" in USA, and the US made a representation to the UN to have the base shut down, the operation shifted to the air base close to the Yugoslav town of Nik≈°iƒá.Luttrell, Robert J., I flew for Israel, Flying Magazine, May 1949, p.60 The name is a reference to the Balak, king of the Moabites, son of Zippor, whose name is mentioned in Numbers 22:2.

Its objective was to trap the Egyptian Army in the Gaza Strip. The operation started on 22 December 1948 and ended on 7 January 1949, after the British threatened to intervene. Horev is the name given in the Scriptures for Mount Sinai, where the Israelites encamped for a year (Exodus 3:1 and Psalms 106:19): in modern parlance it is called the Jebel Musa (\\"Mount of Moses\\" in Arabic). Objectives al Auja with roads to Rafah and el Arish The first objective of the offensive was the Egyptian army units defending al-Auja on the Palestinian-Egyptian border. From there the major thrust was to the Egyptian army bases at El-Arish. This would trap the majority of the Egyptian army in the Gaza Strip. The operation's commander was Yigal Alon. Five Israeli brigades were involved: The 8th Armoured Brigade commanded by Yitzhak Sadeh; the Negev Brigade; the Golani Brigade; the Harel Brigade; and the Alexandroni Brigade. Their task was to maintain the siege of the 4,000 strong Egyptian brigade at Faluja. The Egyptians had a further two brigades in the Gaza area, and one more brigade across the border near El-Arish.Herzog, Chaim (1982) The Arab-Israeli Wars. War and Peace in the Middle East. Arms and Armour Press. . Page 100. Campaign An Israeli machine gun post during Operation Horev On 22 December a battalion from the Golani brigade launched a diversionary attack on positions near the Gaza-Rafah road. In preparation for the offensive, the Israeli army had been able to clear a route through the desert, by-passing the defences on the Beersheba to al-Auja road. On 27 December 1948 the Armoured Brigade attacked al-Auja from this unexpected quarter. After 24 hours of fighting, the Egyptians surrendered in disarray. With this victory Alon realised that there were no Egyptian defences left west of el-Arish and was prepared to capture the entire Sinai peninsula. The Negev brigade followed the tanks of the 8th brigade across the Egyptian border on the night of 28 December and moved towards El-Arish. By 30 December 1948 they were on the outskirts of the town's airfield. At the same time units from the Harel brigade moved further west into Sinai. On 29 December the United Nations Security Council ordered a cease-fire.Hertzog, Page 100. Maps Pages 99, 101. Negev Brigade during Operation Horev Outcome Before he could complete his objective, Allon was instructed by the Israeli Prime Minister, David Ben- Gurion, to withdraw from Egypt immediately. The British Government had threatened to invoke the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Friendship and become directly involved. Under protest but at Ben-Gurion's insistence, the Israelis withdrew. On 3 January they launched an attack on the Egyptian defences at Rafah with the same objective of trapping the Egyptian army. After three days of fighting around Rafah, the Egyptian government announced on 6 January 1949, that they were willing to enter armistice negotiations. On the same day the Israeli Air Force shot down five RAF Spitfires on patrol in the area, killing two pilots and taking two more prisoner. The British moved reinforcements to Akaba. Despite protests from the army, Israel accepted the cease-fire on 7 January.Kimche. Page 262.Hertzog. Page 103. Ezer Weizman shot down one of the Spitfires. In the final Armistice Agreement al-Auja was made a de-militarized zone.

Since 2008, it is IUCN Red Listed as Least Concern as it accommodates to a broad range of habitats. It is widely distributed with large populations that in 2008 were thought unlikely to be declining. In Indonesia, it is threatened by poaching and illegal wildlife trade; buyers use it for the increasing production of kopi luwak, a form of coffee that involves ingestion and excretion of the beans by the animal. Asian palm civets are claimed to be the carrier that transmitted SARS from horseshoe bats to humans.  Characteristics  Gervais in Histoire naturelle des mammif√®res Close up of an Asian palm civet The Asian palm civet's long, stocky body is covered with coarse, shaggy hair that is usually greyish in colour. It has a white mask across the forehead, a small white patch under each eye, a white spot on each side of the nostrils, and a narrow dark line between the eyes. The muzzle, ears, lower legs, and distal half of the tail are black, with three rows of black markings on the body. Its head-to-body length is about with a long unringed tail. It weighs . Its anal scent glands emit a nauseating secretion as a chemical defense when threatened or upset. Distribution and habitat The Asian palm civet is native to India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Singapore, Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei Darussalam, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, the Philippines, and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Bawean, and Siberut. It was introduced to Irian Jaya, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku, and Sulawesi. Its presence in Papua New Guinea is uncertain. It usually inhabits primary forests, but also occurs at lower densities in secondary and selectively logged forest. It is also present in parks and suburban gardens with mature fruit trees, fig trees, and undisturbed vegetation. Its sharp claws allow climbing of trees and house gutters. In most parts of Sri Lanka, palm civets are considered a nuisance since they litter in ceilings and attics of common households, and make loud noises fighting and moving about at night.  Evolution  Palawan and Borneo specimens are genetically close, so the Asian palm civet on Palawan island might have dispersed from Borneo during the Pleistocene. It is possible that people later introduced Asian palm civet into other Philippines islands. Behaviour and ecology Asian palm civet in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand Asian palm civet with pups in an urban area at Baranagar, Kolkata, India The Asian palm civet is thought to lead a solitary lifestyle, except for brief periods during mating. It is both terrestrial and arboreal, showing a nocturnal activity pattern with peaks between late evening until after midnight. It is usually active between dawn and 4:00 in the morning, but less active during nights when the moon is brightest. Scent marking behaviour and olfactory response to various excretions such as urine, feces, and secretion of the perineal gland differs in males and females. Scent marking by dragging the perineal gland and leaving the secretion on the substrate was most commonly observed in animals of both sexes. The duration of the olfactory response varied and depended both on the sex and excretion type. The palm civet can distinguish animal species, sex, familiar and unfamiliar individuals by the odor of the perineal gland secretion. Feeding and diet The Asian palm civet is an omnivore feeding foremost on fruits such as berries and pulpy fruits. It thus helps to maintain tropical forest ecosystems via seed dispersal. It eats chiku, mango, rambutan, and coffee, but also small mammals and insects. It plays an important role in the natural regeneration of Pinanga kuhlii and P. zavana palms at Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park. It also feeds on palm flower sap, which when fermented becomes palm wine, a sweet liquor (\\"toddy\\"). Because of this habit, it is called the toddy cat.  Reproduction  Juvenile Asian palm civet Due to its solitary and nocturnal habits, little is known about its reproductive processes and behaviour. In March 2010, a pair of palm civets was observed when attempting to mate. The pair copulated on the tree branch for about five minutes. During that period, the male mounted the female 4‚Äì5 times. After each mounting, the pair separated for a few moments and repeated the same procedure. After completion of mating, the pair frolicked around for some time, moving from branch to branch on the tree. The animals separated after about six minutes and moved off to different branches and rested there. Threats=Hunting In some parts of its range Asian palm civets are hunted for bushmeat and the pet trade. In southern China it is extensively hunted and trapped. Dead individuals were found with local tribes where it is killed for its meat, in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, and Agra, Uttar Pradesh, between 1998 and 2003 in India. The oil extracted from small pieces of the meat kept in linseed oil in a closed earthen pot and regularly sunned, is used indigenously as a cure for scabies.  Kopi luwak coffee  Asian palm civet housed in a cage for the production of kopi luwak coffee Kopi luwak is coffee prepared using coffee beans that have been subjected to ingestion and fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract of the Asian palm civet, which is called luwak in Indonesia. Caffeine content in both Arabica and Robusta luwak coffee is lower than in unfermented coffee. Large deformation mechanical rheology testing revealed that civet coffee beans are harder and more brittle in nature than their control counterparts indicating that digestive juices enter into the beans and modify the micro-structural properties of these beans. Proteolytic enzymes cause substantial breakdown of storage proteins. Kopi luwak is traditionally made from the faeces of wild civets, however, due to it becoming a trendy drink, civets are being increasingly captured from the wild and fed coffee beans to mass-produce this blend. Many of these civets are housed in battery cage systems which have been criticised on animal welfare grounds. The impact of the demand for this fashionable coffee on wild palm civet populations is yet unknown but may constitute a significant threat. In Indonesia, the demand for Asian palm civets appears to be in violation of the quota set for pets.  Conservation  Paradoxurus hermaphroditus is listed on CITES Appendix III. There is a quota in place in Indonesia, precluding trade from certain areas, setting a cap on the number of civets that can be taken from the wild, and allowing only 10% of those removed from the wild to be sold domestically. This quota is largely ignored by hunters and traders and is not enforced by authorities.Shepherd, C. R. (2008). Civets in trade in Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia (1997‚Äì2001) with notes on legal protection . Small Carnivore Conservation 38: 34‚Äì36. This species has become popular as a pet in Indonesia in recent years, causing a rise in the numbers found in markets in Java and Bali. The majority of the animals sold as pets originate from the wild. The high numbers of animals seen, lack of adherence to the quota and lack of enforcement of the laws are causes for conservation concern.

Since its decline in popularity around 2011, it has seen a recent upsurge making it now the second most popular piercing amongst young women aged 18-25 in 2019. It remains unpopular amongst men. Standard tongue piercings, or one hole in the center of the tongue, is the most common and safest way to have the tongue pierced. History and culture thumb The tongue piercing is not gender specific - it was not created specifically for just a man or just a woman. Popular names for tongue piercing include tongue ring, which is a misnomer, as only rarely are rings worn in tongue piercings. There is a history of ritual tongue piercing in both Aztec and Maya cultures, with illustrations of priests piercing their tongue and then either drawing blood from it or passing through rough cords designed to inflict pain. There is no evidence of permanent or long term tongue piercing in Aztec culture, however; despite the practice of many other permanent body modifications, it was done to honor the gods. Piercing the tongue has a long history in religious and performance practices. Mesoamericans such as the Aztecs practiced this as well as other perforations as a part of offerings to their deities. Asian Spirit Mediums of the Far East practiced tongue piercing as an offering and proof of trance state.Elkin, A., \\"Aboriginal Men of High Degree: Initiation and Sorcery in the World's Oldest Tradition\\" From the turn of the 20th century, Western carnies borrowed many of their sideshow tricks from fakirs bringing to American and European audiences their first glimpses of tongue piercing. Permanent or long term piercing of the tongue is part of the resurgence of body piercing in contemporary society. The ready availability of high quality, surgical steel barbell style jewelry is associated with the emergence of this piercing in the 1980s. As with many piercing innovations, the origin of this piercing is associated with Gauntlet, the first professional body piercing studio in the United States, formerly located in Los Angeles, California. Tattoo Samy appeared in PFIQ (the first publication about body piercing) in issues #18 (1983) and #19 as the magazine‚Äôs first documented tongue piercing. Elayne Angel, the first person awarded the Master Piercer's certificate by Jim Ward, body piercing pioneer and founder of Gauntlet, helped popularize this type of piercing.  Jewelry  Straight barbells with either plastic or metal beads are commonly worn in tongue piercings. Tongues are pierced with straight barbell style jewelry. Because of the frequent movement of the tongue, jewellery size and comfort is especially important. Barbells that are too thin are prone to migration, causing discomfort and irritation. Tongue piercings can often be easily stretched to accommodate larger jewellery. The initial piercing is often at 14 g (1.6 mm), but to avoid one or two stretching steps it is possible to pierce immediately at 12 g (2.0 mm) or even 10 g (2.4 mm). Some people later choose to stretch their piercing to 12 g (2 mm), 10 g (2.4 mm), 8 g (3.2 mm) or 6 g (4.0 mm) to protect against possible migration and to have a more stable 'snug' fit. It is possible to stretch further to diameters beyond 10 mm. The beads at the end of the barbell can be made of many decorative materials. \\"No-see-um beads\\", flat beads matching the color of the tongue, are sometimes worn to conceal this piercing, often in places of employment. Using appropriate colored and styled jewellery, and taking care while talking/laughing, it is possible to conceal the piercing. Procedure Tongues usually swell for a short period of time after being pierced. Piercing The piercer will check the underside of the tongue for large blood vessels, sometimes with a bright light, and mark a safe placement for the piercing. The tongue is then clamped with forceps and pierced with a needle, usually from top to bottom with a piercing needle or from bottom to top with a cannula needle. Initial jewelry should always be considerably longer than will ultimately be required to allow for the swelling, which is common following the piercing. Within two days of getting the piercing the tongue can swell up to double its original size. This can lead to pain when speaking and eating, but this is not permanent. Piercers often recommend drinking cold beverages and sucking on crushed ice to help reduce the swelling. Some people find that taking Ibuprofen or similar anti- inflammatory drugs can greatly reduce the swelling associated with a tongue piercing. It is advisable not to drink alcohol, smoke or eat spicy food until the piercing is at least partially healed (around two weeks), and alcohol-free mouthwash should be used after eating or smoking. After the swelling calms down, a period of mild tongue and oral mucosa irritation can follow, sometimes discouraging the recently pierced person from keeping the piercing. Appropriate mouth washing, care during meals and some patience will usually be sufficient to come to a sufficiently healed state. After full healing the person is advised to replace the initial long barbell (to accommodate the initial swelling) with a shorter barbell. This second barbell is sometimes included in the price of the initial piercing procedure. It can be difficult for an inexperienced recently pierced person to replace the barbell with a shorter version, so often the help of the piercer is asked for. The second barbell is usually 2 mm ‚Äì 4 mm shorter than the initial barbell, but should be adapted to the individual anatomy. After this replacement a second (short) healing period is observed. In case of absence of irritation, the further stretching procedure can be started. Because of the tongue's exceptional healing ability, piercings can close very fast. Even completely healed holes can close up in a matter of hours, and larger-stretched holes can close in just a few days. The length of time for the hole to heal varies greatly from person to person ‚Äì some people with larger-stretched holes (greater than 4 g (5 mm)) can still fit jewelry (albeit smaller) in their piercing after months or even years. It is generally recommended to avoid piercing in bodies under development or in people not capable of taking care of a recent piercing. Placement of the tongue piercing \\"Venom\\" piercings: two tongue piercings placed horizontally The traditional placement for a tongue piercing is along the midline of the tongue, in the center of the mouth. It is often approximately or so back from the tip of the tongue. It is placed with the top a little further back than the bottom, which allows the top of the jewelry to lean slightly back, away from the teeth, and toward the higher part of the upper palate where there is more room in the mouth. It is also usually positioned just in front of the attachment of the lingual frenulum.Association of Professional Piercers (APP) A tongue frenulum piercing is a piercing through the frenulum underneath the tongue, known as the frenulum linguae, and commonly the tongue web piercing. \\"Venom bites\\" is the term given to two tongue piercings placed side by side on the tongue, which are considered to be more painful than a regular tongue piercing through the tongue's center. Although the term \\"angel bite\\" is sometimes referred to as two piercings in the tongue with one placed right in front of another, the term is much more common for two Monroe piercings on either side of the face. There is also the \\"snake-eyes\\" which is one curved bar going horizontally through the tip of the tongue, it is mostly painless other than a mild amount of pressure. It is possible to use a (stretched) tongue piercing as a first step to tongue splitting. Risks Documented complications of tongue piercings have included blood-borne infections causing brain and heart abscesses (with some deaths); hepatitis B and C, HIV, tuberculosis, and tetanus infections; swelling of the tongue causing airway obstruction, swallowing or choking on loose jewelry, damage to gums and broken teeth. Common complaints include pain, scars, excessive salivation and damage to tooth enamel.Go Ask Alice!, Columbia University‚Äôs Health Q&A; Internet Resource, \\"Pondering the pros and cons of tongue piercing\\".

The nearest village is Backwell, which lies south of Nailsea on the opposite side of the Bristol to Exeter railway line. Nailsea is a commuter town with a population of 15,630. The town was an industrial centre based on coal mining and glass manufacture, which have now been replaced by service industries. The surrounding North Somerset Levels has wildlife habitats including the Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake Local Nature Reserve. Nailsea is close to the M5 motorway and Bristol Airport, and its railway station, Nailsea & Backwell, has services operated by the Great Western Railway. Secondary education is provided by Nailsea School (rebuilt in 2009), and primary education by St Francis School, Grove Junior School, Kingshill School and Golden Valley. Churches include the 14th-century Holy Trinity Church and Christ Church, which was built in 1843. History Statue of a glassblower near the site of the glassworks The name of the town may be derived from the Old English for Naegl's island, although it has also been suggested it was spelt Naylsey in 1657. The parish of Nailsea was part of the Portbury Hundred. Little is known of the area occupied by Nailsea before the coal mining industry began, although it was used as a quarry in Roman times from which pennant sandstone was extracted. The Romans otherwise ignored Nailsea from 40‚Äì400 AD, but left a small villa near Jacklands Bridge. Nailsea's early economy relied on coal mining, which began as early as the 16th century. The earliest recorded date for coal mining in Nailsea was 1507 when coal was being transported to light fires at Yatton. By the late 1700s the town had a large number of pits. Around this time Nailsea was visited by the social reformer Hannah More who founded a Sunday school for the workers. The Elms Colliery,(Middle Engine Pit), one of the most complete examples of an 18th-century colliery left in England, is now in disrepair. It has been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage. Remains of the old pits, most of which had closed down by the late 19th century as mining capital migrated to the richer seams of South Wales, are still visible around the town. The coal mines attracted glass manufacturer John Robert Lucas, who in 1788 established the Nailsea Glassworks that became the fourth-largest of its kind in the United Kingdom, mostly producing low-grade bottle glass. The works closed down in 1873, but \\"Nailsea\\" glass (mostly made by glass workers at the end of their shift in Nailsea and at other glass works) is still sought after by collectors around the world. The site of the glass works has been covered by a Tesco supermarket car park, leaving it relatively accessible for future archaeological digs. Other parts of the site have been cleared and filled with sand to ensure that the remains of the old glass works are preserved. Plaque dedicated to the former inhabitants of Nowhere, at the site of the former hamlet Nowhere was a historical hamlet that existed on the west side of the town until 1967, until it was demolished for development. Nowhere Wood, a small residential woodland, is named after it. The 15th-century Nailsea Court, southwest of the town, is a Grade I listed building. Governance Nailsea was part of Long Ashton Rural District from 1894 to 1974. It is now within the North Somerset unitary authority, which covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super- Mare. Four electoral wards exist in Nailsea: *Nailsea Golden Valley *Nailsea West End *Nailsea Yeo *Nailsea Youngwood It is in the North Somerset constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Since the 1992 general election (UK) the constituency has been represented by Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. Geography Nailsea and Greater Bristol The Land Yeo river flows to the east of the town. The North Somerset Levels to the west have been drained and farmed by generations of farmers. Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors SSSI is a 129.4 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. The soils in the area include clays of the Allerton and Wentloog Series and peat soils of the Sedgemoor and Godney Series, which are drained by a network of large rhynes and smaller field ditches, which support exceptionally rich plant and invertebrate fauna communities. Exceptional populations of Coleoptera occur, amongst which are at least 12 nationally scarce species and 2 nationally rare species, including Britain‚Äôs largest water beetle the great silver water beetle (Hydrophilus piceus). There are several other local nature reserves. The Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake Local Nature Reserve, southeast of the town centre and close to the Nailsea and Backwell railway station, was constructed as a balancing pond in the mid-1970s, and has since become home to various wildfowl and dragonflies and a foraging area for bats. Bird species seen on the reserve include gadwall, shoveller, pochard, tufted duck, grey heron and mute swans. Nearby towns and villages include Backwell, Wraxall, Portishead, Clevedon, and Tickenham. Nailsea is from the centre of Bristol, and close to the tourist centres of Weston-super-Mare and Bath. It is by road from the port and service area at Avonmouth. Nailsea seen from Cadbury Camp Climate In common with the rest of South West England, Nailsea has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, although convective cloud sometimes forms inland and reduces the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by the Sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west. Economy Nailsea High Street Primary income often comes from employment in the service sector, including industries such as insurance and banking, defence related employment, retail and management.National Statistics: Nailsea East, emination/LeadTableView.do;?a=2&b;=5940319&c;=nailsea&d;=14&e;=9&g;=399910&i;=1001x1003x1004&m;=0&enc;=1&dsFamilyId;=27 Nailsea North and West Employment within Nailsea includes work in shops, schools, estate agents and banks. Larger businesses in Nailsea include General Electric, and Bristol Wessex Billing Services Ltd., the billing company jointly owned by Bristol Water and Wessex Water. Other businesses are situated at units in the town. Nailsea has three large industrial and business estates located at Southfield road, Blackfriars road and Coates Estate (former site of the local cider making industry). Nailsea's shopping area includes Somerset Square, Crown Glass Place, Colliers Walk, and a high street. There are four supermarket chains in the town (Tesco, Waitrose, Co-op and Iceland) and some national banks and estate agents. Coate's cider factory in Nailsea was first opened in 1788 and was bought by Showerings of Shepton Mallet in 1956. The brand was subsequently merged with Gaymers and absorbed by Matthew Clark Brands. Prior to Coates, there was Heath Brewery, owned by the Thatcher family, which was situated behind the former Friendship Inn. The site of the old factory is now called 'Coates Estate' and is home to a diverse range of both local and national businesses. Culture and community Nailsea has several pubs and used to have a small nightclub called Decades, formerly known as the AJ's Bar. There are dedicated youth clubs and two Scouting divisions, which organise the Nailsea Carnival and Mayfair respectively. Nailsea has theatre, musical and orchestral groups. Most are open to all ages and meet and perform regularly at different venues including The Scotch Horn Centre, Nailsea Methodist Church, The Mizzymead Centre, The Grove Recreation Centre, and Nailsea Little Theatre. Nailsea's outdoor recreational areas include the playing fields by the Grove Centre and the public park to the rear of the Scotch Horn Centre and Tesco. There are three children's play parks and smaller areas of green land in the town's housing estates. The Scotch Horn Park contains a skate park and children's play park. There are no cinemas in Nailsea, but The Curzon in nearby Clevedon has been operating since 1912. The adjacent village of Wraxall has a couple of tourist attractions. Noah's Ark Zoo Farm has displays of exotic, agricultural and domestic animals including rhinoceros, camels, monkeys, reptiles and most recently a giraffe. It offers hands-on experience with animals and a chance to learn about conservation. Tyntesfield, a 19th-century Victorian country house and grounds, was bought and opened up by the National Trust in 2002. An edition of the North Somerset Times is published as the Nailsea Times. Nailsea has a popular carnival annually which has been held since the 1960s, in which all of the local schools and Scouts participate. It also holds a very popular beer & cider festival also held annually, usually during the weekend on the second or third week of July at Nailsea and Backwell Rugby Football Club which started in 2004. The festival holds over 160 local brews every year.http://nbbeerciderfest.wix.com/nailseabeerfestival Transport Nailsea & Backwell railway station The principal road serving Nailsea is the B3130. It leads westwards to Clevedon, where the motorway network can be accessed at Junction 20 of the M5; eastwards it links with the A370 (for Bristol) and the A38 (for Bristol Airport). Another link to the A370 at Backwell offers a route south and west for traffic to other local towns such as Weston-super-Mare.

Education Nailsea School Secondary education in Nailsea is provided by Nailsea School, which attained Technology and Media Arts College specialist status before a ¬£28.8 million revamp in 2010. Nailsea has infants, junior, primary schools, and a music school, some of them including: Kings Hill C of E, Golden Valley, Hannah More Infants, St Francis Catholic School and Grove School. Ravenswood School caters for children with special needs and learning difficulties. There are also playgroups for children in the area who are too young for infants school. Religious sites Holy Trinity Church building and cemetery In the 2001 census 78% of Nailsea's respondents claimed Christianity as their religious preference; 16% claimed to have \\"no religious preference\\", the second largest group. All of the religious buildings are Christian in nature. Christ Church and the 14th-century Holy Trinity Church are Church of England parish churches. Christ Church was built in 1843 by George Gilbert Scott and William Bonython Moffatt and has been designated as a Grade II listed building. Holy Trinity features a tower with six Bells, a cemetery, and a community centre called \\"The Trinity Centre\\". It is Grade I listed. Nailsea Methodist Church was founded in 1789; the first building opened three years later. In 1914 a new chapel was opened on Silver Street, and a youth club was added in the 1960s. In early 1992 the old church was replaced with a larger, flexible, multi-purpose building and the youth club was refurbished and renamed the Wesley Centre after Methodism‚Äôs founder, John Wesley. There is also Nailsea Baptist Church, the Catholic Church of St Francis of Assisi, Southfield Church, the United Reformed Church and the Community Church. Sports Nailsea has four football clubs, AFC Nailsea, Selkirk United, Nailsea United FC and Nailsea Town F.C. The two clubs also organise junior football teams in the area, catering for under 8s to under 16s. Nailsea Cricket Club was formed in the mid-1850s and runs six sides across senior, junior, and women's cricket, covering an area of West Bristol and North Somerset. Nailsea also has a ladies hockey club, which was formed in 1924. The club has two league teams: a youth team and a veterans team. The Scotch Horn Centre provides both an aerobic exercise and a free weights gym, as well as squash courts, and room for other indoor sports. Nailsea does not have a public swimming pool despite a long-running campaign by the Nailsea Swimming Pool Interest Group to build one. Other leisure facilities in the area include a swimming pool in nearby Backwell and a golf club in Tickenham. Nailsea and Backwell Rugby Football Club's 1st XV play in level 8 of the RFU league system as of 2012, and the 2nd XV in Somerset 2 North (level 10). Notable people One of Nailsea's best known celebrities was Adge Cutler, the Somerset folk singer, whose backing band was The Wurzels. He worked at the Coates cider factory. The Wurzels' album Live at the Royal Oak was recorded at The Royal Oak, a public house on the High Street. Cutler is buried in Christ Church graveyard. Mervyn Kitchen was born in Nailsea in 1940. He became an English first-class cricketer. In his playing days he was a left-handed batsman for Somerset County Cricket Club, making 15,230 runs in his 354 first-class games. He topped the county averages in 1966 and 1968. He went on to umpire in 20 Test matches and 28 One Day Internationals before retiring in 2005. Another Somerset cricketer, Stephen Newton, was also born in Nailsea in 1853. The gymnast Charles Sederman, who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics, was born in Nailsea in 1881.

Definition  The probability density function for the random matrix X (n √ó p) that follows the matrix normal distribution \\\\mathcal{MN}_{n,p}(\\\\mathbf{M}, \\\\mathbf{U}, \\\\mathbf{V}) has the form: : p(\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{M}, \\\\mathbf{U}, \\\\mathbf{V}) = \\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{tr}\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{V}^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M})^{T} \\\\mathbf{U}^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M}) \\\\right] \\\\right)}{(2\\\\pi)^{np/2} \\\\mathbf{V}^{n/2} \\\\mathbf{U}^{p/2}} where \\\\mathrm{tr} denotes trace and M is n √ó p, U is n √ó n and V is p √ó p. The matrix normal is related to the multivariate normal distribution in the following way: :\\\\mathbf{X} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{MN}_{n\\\\times p}(\\\\mathbf{M}, \\\\mathbf{U}, \\\\mathbf{V}), if and only if :\\\\mathrm{vec}(\\\\mathbf{X}) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}_{np}(\\\\mathrm{vec}(\\\\mathbf{M}), \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{U}) where \\\\otimes denotes the Kronecker product and \\\\mathrm{vec}(\\\\mathbf{M}) denotes the vectorization of \\\\mathbf{M}. Proof The equivalence between the above matrix normal and multivariate normal density functions can be shown using several properties of the trace and Kronecker product, as follows. We start with the argument of the exponent of the matrix normal PDF: :\\\\begin{align} &\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;-\\\\frac12\\\\text{tr}\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{V}^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M})^{T} \\\\mathbf{U}^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M}) \\\\right]\\\\ &= -\\\\frac12\\\\text{vec}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\right)^T \\\\text{vec}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{U}^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M}) \\\\mathbf{V}^{-1}\\\\right) \\\\ &= -\\\\frac12\\\\text{vec}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\right)^T \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{V}^{-1}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{U}^{-1}\\\\right)\\\\text{vec}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\right) \\\\ &= -\\\\frac12\\\\left[\\\\text{vec}(\\\\mathbf{X}) - \\\\text{vec}(\\\\mathbf{M})\\\\right]^T \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{V}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{U}\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\left[\\\\text{vec}(\\\\mathbf{X}) - \\\\text{vec}(\\\\mathbf{M})\\\\right] \\\\end{align} which is the argument of the exponent of the multivariate normal PDF. The proof is completed by using the determinant property: \\\\mathbf{V}\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{U} = \\\\mathbf{V}^n \\\\mathbf{U}^p. Properties If \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{MN}_{n\\\\times p}(\\\\mathbf{M}, \\\\mathbf{U}, \\\\mathbf{V}), then we have the following properties: Expected values The mean, or expected value is: :E[\\\\mathbf{X}] = \\\\mathbf{M} and we have the following second-order expectations: :E[(\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M})(\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M})^{T}] = \\\\mathbf{U}\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\mathbf{V}) :E[(\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M})^{T} (\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M})] = \\\\mathbf{V}\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\mathbf{U}) where \\\\operatorname{tr} denotes trace. More generally, for appropriately dimensioned matrices A,B,C: :\\\\begin{align} E[\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{X}^{T}] &= \\\\mathbf{U}\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\mathbf{A}^T\\\\mathbf{V}) + \\\\mathbf{MAM}^T\\\\ E[\\\\mathbf{X}^T\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\mathbf{X}] &= \\\\mathbf{V}\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\mathbf{U}\\\\mathbf{B}^T) + \\\\mathbf{M}^T\\\\mathbf{BM}\\\\ E[\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\mathbf{X}] &= \\\\mathbf{V}\\\\mathbf{C}^T\\\\mathbf{U} + \\\\mathbf{MCM} \\\\end{align} Transformation Transpose transform: :\\\\mathbf{X}^T \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{MN}_{p\\\\times n}(\\\\mathbf{M}^T, \\\\mathbf{V}, \\\\mathbf{U}) Linear transform: let D (r-by-n), be of full rank r ‚â§ n and C (p-by-s), be of full rank s ‚â§ p, then: :\\\\mathbf{DXC}\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{MN}_{r\\\\times s}(\\\\mathbf{DMC}, \\\\mathbf{DUD}^T, \\\\mathbf{C}^T\\\\mathbf{VC}) Example Let's imagine a sample of n independent p-dimensional random variables identically distributed according to a multivariate normal distribution: :\\\\mathbf{Y}_i \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}_p({\\\\boldsymbol \\\\mu}, {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\Sigma}) \\\\text{ with } i \\\\in {1,\\\\ldots,n}. When defining the n √ó p matrix \\\\mathbf{X} for which the ith row is \\\\mathbf{Y}_i, we obtain: :\\\\mathbf{X} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{MN}_{n \\\\times p}(\\\\mathbf{M}, \\\\mathbf{U}, \\\\mathbf{V}) where each row of \\\\mathbf{M} is equal to {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\mu}, that is \\\\mathbf{M}=\\\\mathbf{1}_n \\\\times {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\mu}^T, \\\\mathbf{U} is the n √ó n identity matrix, that is the rows are independent, and \\\\mathbf{V} = {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\Sigma}. Maximum likelihood parameter estimation Given k matrices, each of size n √ó p, denoted \\\\mathbf{X}_1, \\\\mathbf{X}_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{X}_k, which we assume have been sampled i.i.d. from a matrix normal distribution, the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters can be obtained by maximizing: : \\\\prod_{i=1}^k \\\\mathcal{MN}_{n\\\\times p}(\\\\mathbf{X}_i\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{M},\\\\mathbf{U},\\\\mathbf{V}). The solution for the mean has a closed form, namely : \\\\mathbf{M} = \\\\frac{1}{k} \\\\sum_{i=1}^k\\\\mathbf{X}_i but the covariance parameters do not. However, these parameters can be iteratively maximized by zero-ing their gradients at: : \\\\mathbf{U} = \\\\frac{1}{kp} \\\\sum_{i=1}^k(\\\\mathbf{X}_i-\\\\mathbf{M})\\\\mathbf{V}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{X}_i-\\\\mathbf{M})^T and : \\\\mathbf{V} = \\\\frac{1}{kn} \\\\sum_{i=1}^k(\\\\mathbf{X}_i-\\\\mathbf{M})^T\\\\mathbf{U}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{X}_i-\\\\mathbf{M}), See for example and references therein. The covariance parameters are non- identifiable in the sense that for any scale factor, s>0, we have: : \\\\mathcal{MN}_{n\\\\times p}(\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{M},\\\\mathbf{U},\\\\mathbf{V}) = \\\\mathcal{MN}_{n\\\\times p}(\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{M},s\\\\mathbf{U},1/s\\\\mathbf{V}) . Drawing values from the distribution Sampling from the matrix normal distribution is a special case of the sampling procedure for the multivariate normal distribution. Let \\\\mathbf{X} be an n by p matrix of np independent samples from the standard normal distribution, so that : \\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{MN}_{n\\\\times p}(\\\\mathbf{0},\\\\mathbf{I},\\\\mathbf{I}). Then let : \\\\mathbf{Y}=\\\\mathbf{M}+\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{B}, so that : \\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{MN}_{n\\\\times p}(\\\\mathbf{M},\\\\mathbf{AA}^T,\\\\mathbf{B}^T\\\\mathbf{B}), where A and B can be chosen by Cholesky decomposition or a similar matrix square root operation. Relation to other distributions Dawid (1981) provides a discussion of the relation of the matrix-valued normal distribution to other distributions, including the Wishart distribution, Inverse Wishart distribution and matrix t-distribution, but uses different notation from that employed here.

He was a 10-time All-Star and 6-time World Series champion. In 1961, he won both the Cy Young Award and World Series Most Valuable Player Award. Ford led the American League (AL) in wins three times and in earned run average (ERA) twice. He is the Yankees franchise leader in career wins (236), shutouts (45), innings pitched (), and games started by a pitcher (438; tied with Andy Pettitte). Ford was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974. Ford signed with the Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1947 and made his major league debut in 1950. Following a two-year sojourn to serve in the United States Army during the Korean War, Ford returned to the Yankees in 1953 and pitched for them until retiring in 1967. During his tenure with the team, Ford set numerous World Series pitching records, including consecutive scoreless innings (), wins (10), games started (22), innings pitched (146), and strikeouts (94). The Yankees retired his uniform number 16 in 1974 and dedicated a plaque in his honor in Monument Park in 1987. Ford served as the Yankees pitching coach in 1964 while still a player and from 1974 to 1975 after retiring. He also served as the team's first base coach in 1968. In the wake of Yogi Berra's death in 2015, George Vecsey of The New York Times suggested that Ford was now \\"The Greatest Living Yankee\\". Ford died on October 8, 2020, at the age of 91. Early life Ford was born in Manhattan. At age five, he moved to the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, a few miles from the Triborough Bridge to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.Berkow, Ira. \\"ON BASEBALL; Ford Highlight Film Started Early\\", The New York Times, August 17, 2000. Accessed November 3, 2007. \\"Vivid in my memory is Stengel's shrug, palms up at his sides, gesturing in response to the mixture of cheers for Ford and boos for his removal. It was a display of sympathy for the kid from Astoria, Queens, who just a few years earlier was playing in street stickball games, and now under a national spotlight and World Series pressure had pitched so beautifully.\\" He attended public schools and graduated from the Manhattan High School of Aviation Trades. In 1951, Ford married Joan at St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Glen Cove, New York on Long Island. They lived in this city for a period during the 1950s. They had two sons and a daughter together. Professional baseball career= Early years  Ford was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1947 and played his entire career with them. While still in the minor leagues, he was nicknamed \\"Whitey\\" for his light blond hair.\\"They Came from Queens\\", Queens Tribune. Retrieved on November 4, 2007. \\"He once lived in Little Neck and attended Aviation High School.\\" Ford began his Major League Baseball career on July 1, 1950, with the Yankees. He won his first nine decisions before losing a game in relief. Ford received a handful of lower-ballot Most Valuable Player (MVP) votes despite throwing just 112 innings, and won the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award. Ford shooting a rifle in training for the military During the Korean War era, in 1951 and 1952, Ford served in the United States Army. He rejoined the Yankees for the 1953 season, and the Yankee \\"Big Three\\" pitching staff became a \\"Big Four\\", as Ford joined Allie Reynolds, Vic Raschi, and Eddie Lopat. Ford wore number 19 in his rookie season, but upon his return he changed to number 16, which he wore for the remainder of his career. Ford eventually went from the number-four pitcher on a great staff to the universally acclaimed number- one pitcher of the Yankees. He became known as the \\"Chairman of the Board\\" for his ability to remain calm and in command during high-pressure situations. He was also known as \\"Slick\\", a nickname given to him, Billy Martin, and Mickey Mantle by manager Casey Stengel, who called them Whiskey Slicks. Ford's guile was necessary because he did not have an overwhelming fastball, but being able to throw several other pitches very well gave him pinpoint control. Ford was an effective strikeout pitcher for his time, tying the then-AL record for six consecutive strikeouts in 1956, and again in 1958. Ford never threw a no- hitter, but he pitched two consecutive one-hit games in 1955 to tie a record held by several pitchers. Sal Maglie, star pitcher for the New York Giants, thought Ford had a similar style to his own, writing in 1958 that Ford had a \\"good curve, good control, [a] changeup, [and an] occasional sneaky fastball.\\" Ford in 1954 In 1955, Ford led the American League in complete games and games won; in 1956 in earned run average and winning percentage; in 1958, in earned run average; and in both 1961 and 1963, in games won and winning percentage. Ford won the Cy Young Award in 1961; he likely would have won the 1963 AL Cy Young, but this was before the institution of a separate award for each league, and Ford could not match Sandy Koufax's numbers for the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League (NL). Some of Ford's totals were depressed by Yankees' manager Casey Stengel, who viewed Ford as his top pitching asset and often reserved his ace left-hander for more formidable opponents such as the Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox. When Ralph Houk became the manager in 1961, he promised Ford that he would pitch every fourth day, regardless of the opponent; after exceeding 30 starts only once in his nine seasons under Stengel, Ford had 39 in 1961. Indeed 1961 was his first 20-win season, a career-best 25‚Äì4 record, and the Cy Young Award ensued, but Ford's season was overshadowed by the home run battle between Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. As a left-hander with an excellent pick-off move, Ford was also deft at keeping runners at their base: He set a record in 1961 by pitching 243 consecutive innings without allowing a stolen base. In May 1963, after pitching a shutout, Ford announced he had given up smoking. He said, \\"My doctor told me that whenever I think of smoking, I should think of a bus starting up and blowing the exhaust in my face.\\"Ford, Whitey. Slick: My Life In And Around Baseball, New York: William Morrow, 1987. Final years and retirement Ford ended his career in declining health. In August 1966, he underwent surgery to correct a circulatory problem in his throwing shoulder. In May 1967, Ford lasted just one inning in what would be his final start, and he announced his retirement at the end of the month at age 38. After retiring, Ford admitted in interviews to having occasionally doctored baseballs. Examples were the \\"mudball\\", used at home in Yankee Stadium. Yankee groundskeepers would wet down an area near the catcher's box where the Yankee catcher Elston Howard was positioned; pretending to lose balance, Howard would put down his hand with the ball and coat one side of the ball with mud and throw it to Ford. Ford sometimes used the diamond in his wedding ring to gouge the ball, but he was eventually caught by an umpire and warned to stop. Howard sharpened a buckle on his shinguard and used it to scuff the ball. Ford described his illicit behavior as a concession to age: > I didn't begin cheating until late in my career when I needed something to > help me survive. I didn't cheat when I won the twenty-five games in . I > don't want anybody to get any ideas and take my Cy Young Award away. And I > didn't cheat in when I won twenty-four games. Well, maybe a little. Ford admitted to doctoring the ball in the 1961 All Star Game at Candlestick Park to strike out Willie Mays. Ford and Mantle had accumulated $1,200 ($ today) in golf pro shop purchases as guests of Horace Stoneham at the Giants owner's country club. Stoneham promised to pay their tab if Ford could strike out Mays. \\"What was that all about?\\" Mays asked. \\"I'm sorry, Willie, but I had to throw you a spitter,\\" Ford replied. Career statistics Ford won 236 games for the New York Yankees (career 236‚Äì106), still a franchise record. Ford is tied with Dave Foutz for the fourth-best winning percentage in baseball history at .690. Ford's 2.75 earned run average is the third-lowest among starting pitchers whose careers began after the advent of the live-ball era in 1920. Only Clayton Kershaw (2.51) and Jacob deGrom (2.61) have a lower ERA. Ford's worst ERA in a single season was 3.24. Ford had 45 shutout victories in his career, including eight 1‚Äì0 wins. As a hitter, Ford posted a .173 batting average (177-for-1,023) with 91 runs, 3 home runs, 69 runs batted in (RBI), and 113 bases on balls. In 22 World Series games, he batted .082 (4-for-49) with 4 runs, 3 RBI, and 7 walks. Defensively, he recorded a .961 fielding percentage. World Series and All-Star Games During his MLB career, Ford had 10 World Series victories, more than any other pitcher. Ford also leads all starters in World Series losses (8) and starts (22), as well as innings, hits, walks, and strikeouts. In 1961, he broke Babe Ruth's World Series record of consecutive scoreless innings. The record eventually reached , although MLB rule-makers retroactively reduced the record to 33 innings since Ford did not complete a full inning before allowing the streak-ending run. It is still a World Series record, although Mariano Rivera broke it as a postseason record in 2000. Ford won the 1961 World Series MVP Award. He appeared on eight AL All-Star teams between 1954 and 1964. Honors and legacy Ford's plaque at Monument Park in Yankee Stadium In 1974, Ford and Mickey Mantle were both elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame; at that time, the Yankees retired his number 16. In 1987, the Yankees dedicated plaques for Monument Park at Yankee Stadium for Ford and Lefty Gomez. In 1999, Ford ranked 52nd on The Sporting News List of Baseball's Greatest Players. He was nominated that year for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 1994, a road in Mississauga, Ontario, was named Ford Road in his honor. The north-central area of Mississauga is known informally as \\"the baseball zone\\", as several streets in the area are named for Hall of Fame baseball players. In 2000, the ballfield overlooking the East River on 26th Avenue, between 1st and 2nd Streets in Astoria, Queens, was named Whitey Ford Field at a Yankee Stadium ceremony. Post-playing career Ford in 2010 Ford was the Yankees pitching coach during the 1964 season. In 1968, he served as the Yankees as first base coach, and in 1974 and 1975 as pitching coach. In 1977, Ford was part of the broadcast team for the first game in Toronto Blue Jays history.Stephen Brunt, Diamond Dreams: 20 Years of Blue Jays Baseball, p. 94, Penguin Books, In 2008, Ford threw the first pitch at the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In 2002, Ford opened \\"Whitey Ford's Cafe\\", a sports- themed restaurant and bar next to Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, New York.Details of Whitey Ford's Cafe from Yahoo! Local. A replica of the Yankee Stadium facade trimmed both the exterior and the bar, whose stools displayed uniform numbers of Yankee luminaries and widescreen TVs were installed throughout. The main dining area housed a panoramic display of Yankee Stadium from the 1950s, specifically a Chicago White Sox‚ÄìYankee game with Ford pitching and Mickey Mantle in center field; the Yanks were up 2‚Äì0. The servers were dressed in Yankees road uniforms, with Ford's No. 16 on the back.Peter M. Gianotti, Review of White Ford's Cafe from Newsday, October 13, 2002. It lasted less than a year before it closed down.Conversation with present owner of Gasho of Japan restaurant, former site of Whitey Ford's Cafe. During the 1950s, Ford lived for a period in Glen Cove, on the North Shore of Long Island. As of 2015, the 86-year-old Ford was splitting his time between his homes in Long Island and Florida. Ford died on October 8, 2020, at his home in Lake Success on Long Island at the age of 91, 13 days before his 92nd birthday, he was watching the Yankees play in Game 4 of the 2020 American League Division Series on television and was surrounded by his family. The cause of death was not immediately announced, but he had suffered from dementia for several years. When he died he was the second-oldest living member of the Hall of Fame, after Tommy Lasorda. Representation in other media * Ford and Mantle made cameo appearances on a 1984 episode of Remington Steele starring Pierce Brosnan. * In a 1997 episode of The Simpsons, \\"The Twisted World of Marge Simpson\\", an animated Ford tries to maintain order at a baseball game that is about to turn ugly, \\"pleading with the crowd for some kind of sanity\\". He is knocked unconscious by a barrage of pretzels. Homer suggests that the pretzels be rebranded \\"Whitey Whackers.\\" * In 1998, Grammy Award‚Äìwinning musician Everlast released a CD entitled Whitey Ford Sings the Blues, and assumed \\"Whitey Ford\\" as a nickname. * Ford was portrayed by Anthony Michael Hall in the HBO movie, 61* (2001), about Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle's 1961 quest to break Babe Ruth's single-season home run record. It was directed by Billy Crystal.

Description  Copper beech in autumn European beech shoot with nut cupules Fagus sylvatica is a large tree, capable of reaching heights of up to tall and trunk diameter, though more typically tall and up to trunk diameter. A 10-year-old sapling will stand about tall. It has a typical lifespan of 150‚Äì200 years, though sometimes up to 300 years. In cultivated forest stands trees are normally harvested at 80‚Äì120 years of age. 30 years are needed to attain full maturity (as compared to 40 for American beech). Like most trees, its form depends on the location: in forest areas, F. sylvatica grows to over , with branches being high up on the trunk. In open locations, it will become much shorter (typically ) and more massive. The leaves are alternate, simple, and entire or with a slightly crenate margin, 5‚Äì10 cm long and 3‚Äì7 cm broad, with 6‚Äì7 veins on each side of the leaf (7‚Äì10 veins in Fagus orientalis). When crenate, there is one point at each vein tip, never any points between the veins. The buds are long and slender, long and thick, but thicker (to ) where the buds include flower buds. The leaves of beech are often not abscissed (dropped) in the autumn and instead remain on the tree until the spring. This process is called marcescence. This particularly occurs when trees are saplings or when plants are clipped as a hedge (making beech hedges attractive screens, even in winter), but it also often continues to occur on the lower branches when the tree is mature. Small quantities of seeds may be produced around 10 years of age, but not a heavy crop until the tree is at least 30 years old. F. sylvatica male flowers are borne in the small catkins which are a hallmark of the Fagales order (beeches, chestnuts, oaks, walnuts, hickories, birches, and hornbeams). The female flowers produce beechnuts, small triangular nuts long and wide at the base; there are two nuts in each cupule, maturing in the autumn 5‚Äì6 months after pollination. Flower and seed production is particularly abundant in years following a hot, sunny and dry summer, though rarely for two years in a row.  Distribution and habitat  Museum of Toulouse The natural range extends from southern Sweden to northern Sicily, west to France, southern England, northern Portugal, central Spain, and east to northwest Turkey, where it intergrades with the oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), which replaces it further east. In the Balkans, it shows some hybridisation with oriental beech; these hybrid trees are named Fagus √ó taurica Popl. [Fagus moesiaca (Domin, Maly) Czecz.]. In the southern part of its range around the Mediterranean, it grows only in mountain forests, at altitude. Although often regarded as native in southern England, recent evidence suggests that F. sylvatica did not arrive in England until about 4000 BC, or 2,000 years after the English Channel formed after the ice ages; it could have been an early introduction by Stone age humans, who used the nuts for food.Harris, E. (2002) Goodbye to Beech? Farewell to Fagus? Quarterly Journal of Forestry 96 (2):97. The beech is classified as a native in the south of England and as a non-native in the north where it is often removed from 'native' woods.International foresters study Lake District's 'greener, friendlier forests' forestry.gov.uk Localised pollen records have been recorded in the North of England from the Iron Age by Sir Harry Godwin. Changing climatic conditions may put beech populations in southern England under increased stress and while it may not be possible to maintain the current levels of beech in some sites it is thought that conditions for beech in north-west England will remain favourable or even improve. It is often planted in Britain. Similarly, the nature of Norwegian beech populations is subject to debate. If native, they would represent the northern range of the species. However, molecular genetic analyses support the hypothesis that these populations represent intentional introduction from Denmark before and during the Viking Age. However, the beech in Vestfold and at Seim north of Bergen in Norway is now spreading naturally and regarded as native.B√∏k ‚Äì en kulturvekst? Though not demanding of its soil type, the European beech has several significant requirements: a humid atmosphere (precipitation well distributed throughout the year and frequent fogs) and well-drained soil (it cannot handle excessive stagnant water). It prefers moderately fertile ground, calcified or lightly acidic, therefore it is found more often on the side of a hill than at the bottom of a clayey basin. It tolerates rigorous winter cold, but is sensitive to spring frost. In Norway's oceanic climate planted trees grow well as far north as Trondheim. In Sweden, beech trees do not grow as far north as in Norway. A beech forest is very dark and few species of plant are able to survive there, where the sun barely reaches the ground. Young beeches prefer some shade and may grow poorly in full sunlight. In a clear-cut forest a European beech will germinate and then die of excessive dryness. Under oaks with sparse leaf cover it will quickly surpass them in height and, due to the beech's dense foliage, the oaks will die from lack of sunlight.  Ecology  The root system is shallow, even superficial, with large roots spreading out in all directions. European beech forms ectomycorrhizas with a range of fungi and with the species Ramaria flavosaponaria; these fungi are important in enhancing uptake of water and nutrients from the soil. In the woodlands of southern Britain, beech is dominant over oak and elm south of a line from about north Suffolk across to Cardigan. Oak are the dominant forest trees north of this line. One of the most beautiful European beech forests called Sonian Forest (For√™t de Soignes/Zoni√´nwoud) is found in the southeast of Brussels, Belgium. Beech is a dominant tree species in France and constitutes about 10% of French forests. The largest virgin forests made of beech trees are Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh () in Ukraine and Izvoarele Nerei ( in one forest body) in Semenic-Cheile Cara»ôului National Park, Romania. These habitats are home of Europe's largest predators (the brown bear, the grey wolf and the lynx). Many trees are older than 350 years in Izvoarele Nerei and even 500 years in Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh. Spring leaf budding by the European beech is triggered by a combination of day length and temperature. Bud break each year is from the middle of April to the beginning of May, often with remarkable precision (within a few days). It is more precise in the north of its range than the south, and at than at sea level. The European beech invests significantly in summer and autumn for the following spring. Conditions in summer, particularly good rainfall, determine the number of leaves included in the buds. In autumn, the tree builds the reserves that will sustain it into spring. Given good conditions, a bud can produce a shoot with ten or more leaves. The terminal bud emits a hormonal substance in the spring that halts the development of additional buds. This tendency, though very strong at the beginning of their existence, becomes weaker in older trees. It is only after the budding that root growth of the year begins. The first roots to appear are very thin (with a diameter of less than 0.5 mm). Later, after a wave of above ground growth, thicker roots grow in a steady fashion.  Cultivation  European beech is a very popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens in temperate regions of the world. In North America, they are preferred for this purpose over the native F. grandifolia, which despite its tolerance of warmer climates, is slower growing, taking an average of 10 years longer to attain maturity. The town of Brookline, Massachusetts has one of the largest, if not the largest, grove of European beech trees in the United States. The 2.5 acre public park, called 'The Longwood Mall', was planted sometime before 1850 qualifying it as the oldest stand of European beeches in the United States. It is frequently kept clipped to make attractive hedges. Since the early 19th century there have been numerous cultivars of European beech made by horticultural selection, often repeatedly; they include: * copper beech or purple beech (Fagus sylvatica purpurea) ‚Äì is a mutation of the european beech which was first noted in 1690 in the \\"Possenwald\\" forest near the town of Sondershausen in thuringia in Germany.

In the United States Charles Sprague Sargent noted the earliest appearance in a nurseryman's catalogue in 1820, but in 1859 \\"the finest copper beech in America... more than fifty feet high\\" was noted in the grounds of Thomas Ash, Esq., Throggs Neck, New York;Andrew Jackson Downing and Henry Winthrop Sargent, A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America 1859:150. it must have been more than forty years old at the time. * fern-leaf beech (Fagus sylvatica Heterophylla Group) ‚Äì leaves deeply serrated to thread-like * dwarf beech (Fagus sylvatica Tortuosa Group) ‚Äì distinctive twisted trunk and branches * weeping beech (Fagus sylvatica Pendula Group) ‚Äì branches pendulous * Dawyck beech (Fagus sylvatica 'Dawyck') ‚Äì fastigiate (columnar) growth ‚Äì occurs in green, gold and purple forms; named after Dawyck Botanic Garden in the Scottish Borders * golden beech (Fagus sylvatica 'Zlatia') ‚Äì leaves golden in spring Cultivars The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- *F. sylvatica *'Dawyck' *'Dawyck Gold' *'Dawyck Purple' *'Pendula' (weeping beech) *'Riversii' *F. sylvatica var. heterophylla 'Aspleniifolia'  Image gallery  File:Fagus sylvatica pendula, Harlow Carr.jpg'Pendula', Harlow Carr.

Its fine and short grain makes it an easy wood to work with, easy to soak, dye, varnish and glue. Steaming makes the wood even easier to machine. It has an excellent finish and is resistant to compression and splitting and it is stiff when flexed. Milling is sometimes difficult due to cracking. The density of the wood is 720 kg per cubic meter.Steamed Beech. Niche Timbers. Accessed 20-08-2009. It is particularly well suited for minor carpentry, particularly furniture. From chairs to parquetry (flooring) and staircases, the European beech can do almost anything other than heavy structural support, so long as it is not left outdoors. Its hardness make it ideal for making wooden mallets and workbench tops. The wood rots easily if it is not protected by a tar based on a distillate of its own bark (as used in railway sleepers). It is better for paper pulp than many other broadleaved trees though is only sometimes used for this, the high cellulose content can also be spun into modal, which is used as a textile akin to cotton. The code for its use in Europe is (from FAgus SYlvatica). Common beech is also considered one of the best firewoods for fireplaces.  Other uses  The nuts are eaten by humans and animals. Slightly toxic to humans if eaten in large quantities due to the tannins and alkaloids they contain, the nuts were nonetheless pressed to obtain an oil in 19th-century England that was used for cooking and in lamps. They were also ground to make flour, which could be eaten after the tannins were leached out by soaking.

Northern part of the province with the Limes Germanicus. Germania Superior (\\"Upper Germania\\") was an imperial province of the Roman Empire. It comprised an area of today's western Switzerland, the French Jura and Alsace regions, and southwestern Germany. Important cities were Besan√ßon (Vesontio), Strasbourg (Argentoratum), Wiesbaden (Aquae Mattiacae), and Germania Superior's capital, Mainz (Mogontiacum). It comprised the Middle Rhine, bordering on the Limes Germanicus, and on the Alpine province of Raetia to the south-east. Although it had been occupied militarily since the reign of Augustus, Germania Superior (along with Germania Inferior) was not made into an official province until c. 85 AD. Origin=Initial Roman involvement The terms, \\"Upper Germania\\" and \\"Lower Germania\\" do not appear in the Gallic Wars of Julius Caesar, yet he writes about reports that the people who lived in those regions were referred to as Germani locally, a term used for a tribe that the Romans called the Germani Cisrhenani, and that the name Germania seems to have been adopted to designate other indigenous tribes in the area. Lower Germania was occupied by the Belgae. Upper Germania was occupied by Gaulish tribes including the Helvetii, Sequani, Leuci, and Treveri, and, on the north bank of the middle Rhine, the remnant of the Germanic troops that had attempted to take Vesontio under Ariovistus, but who were defeated by Caesar in 58 BC. The Romans did not abandon this region at any time after then. During a 5-year period in the initial years of his reign (28‚Äì23 BC), as Cassius Dio tells us (53.12), Octavian Caesar assumed direct governorship of the major senatorial provinces on grounds that they were in danger of insurrection and he alone commanded the troops required to restore security. They were to be restored to the senate in 10 years under proconsuls elected by the senate. Among these independent provinces were upper Germania. Apparently it had become a province in the last years of the republic. Tacitus also mentions it as the province of Germania Superior in his Annales (3.41, 4.73, 13.53). Cassius Dio viewed the Germanic tribes as Celts, an impression given perhaps by Belgica, the name assigned to lower Germania at the time. Dio does not mention the border, but he views upper Germany as extending to the source of the Rhine. It is not clear if he was aware of the Upper Rhine in Switzerland, upstream from Lake Constance. Today we call the section of the Rhine running through upper Germania the middle Rhine. Limit of the empire Augustus had planned to incorporate all of central Germania in one province, Germania Magna. This plan was frustrated by the Germanic tribesmen at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Augustus decided to limit the empire at the Rhine-Danube border. Thereafter continual conflict prevailed along it, forcing the Romans to conduct punitive expeditions and fortify Germania Superior. By 12 BC, major bases existed at Xanten (Castra Vetera) and Mainz (Mogontiacum), from which Drusus operated. A system of forts gradually developed around these bases. In 69‚Äì70, all the Roman fortications along the Rhine and Danube were destroyed by Germanic insurrections and civil war between the legions. At the conclusion of this violent but brief social storm they were rebuilt more extensively than before, with a road connecting Mainz and Augsburg (Augusta Vindelicorum). Domitian went to war against the Chatti in 83‚Äì85, who were north of Frankfurt (in Hesse named after them). At this time the first line, or continuous fortified border, was constructed. It consisted of a cleared zone of observation, a palisade where practicable, wooden watchtowers and forts at the road crossings. The system reached maximum extent by 90. A Roman road went through the Odenwald and a network of secondary roads connected all the forts and towers. Germania Superior and Germania Inferior in the 3rd century. Defensive strategy The plan governing the development of the limes was relatively simple. From a strategic point of view, the Agri Decumates, or region between the Rhine and Danube, offers a bulge in the line between the Celts and the Germanics, which the Germanics had tried to exploit under Ariovistus. The bulge divided the densely populated Celtic settlements along the entire river system in two. Invading forces could move up under cover of the Black Forest. Roman defensive works therefore cut across the base of the bulge, denying the protected corridor and shortening the line. The key point was the shoulder of the bulge at Mogontiacum (Mainz) where the masse de manoevre or strategic reserves were located. The forts through the forest were relatively lightly defended and on that account were always being burned by the Alamanni. They gave advance notice, however. On being notified, the legions would strike out in preventative and punitive expeditions from Mainz or Strasburg, or Augsburg on the other side. The entire system could only succeed if heavy troop concentrations were kept at Mainz. Fixed defenses alone are not much of a defense, in either ancient or modern times. Other forces are required for attack. At best the fixed defenses serve to warn or delay until a counterattack can be launched. For more complete details on the development of the limes, or frontier, see under Limes Germanicus. In the subsequent peaceful years, the limes lost its temporary character. Vici, or communities, developed around the forts. By 150, the towers and the bases had been rebuilt in stone. The soldiers now lived in good stone barracks within walls decorated by frescoes. Germanic civilization had changed as well. Where Caesar had described burning the wretched brush hovels of the Suebi who had come to fight for Ariovistus, the Chatti and the Alamanni now lived in comfortable Romanized villages around the limes. Germania Superior was reestablished as an Imperial Roman province in 90, taking large amounts of territory from Gallia Lugdunensis. One of its first and most famous governors was the future Emperor Trajan, who ruled the province from 96 until his accession in 98. The Helvetii settlement area became part of the province of Germania Superior. End of the province Post 400, as Rome slowly was losing control over its northernmost provinces over a period of 50 years, the southern (Swiss) parts of Germania Superior were incorporated into the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum before they became part of Burgundy in the early 5th century. The northern parts became part of Alemannia.

It is formed from the fusion of a pair of small cranial bones at the very tip of the jaws of many animals, usually bearing teeth, but not always. They are connected to the maxilla and the nasals. While Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was not the first one to discover the incisive bone in humans, he was the first to prove its presence across mammals. Hence, the incisive bone is also known as Goethe's bone. In other animals the term premaxilla is more often used to refer to the incisive bone. Yet other terms include premaxillary bone, os premaxillare, intermaxillary bone, and os intermaxillare.  History  In 1573, Volcher Coiter was the first to illustrate the incisive suture in humans. Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet and F√©lix Vicq-d'Azyr were the first to describe the incisive bone as a separate bone within the skull in 1779 and 1780, respectively. In the 1790s, Goethe began studying zoology, and formed the impression that all animals are similar, being bodies composed of vertebrae and their permutations. The human skull is one example of a metamorphosed vertebra, and within it, the intermaxillary bone rests as evidence linking the species to other animals.

It includes only one species, Cryptomeria japonica (syn. Cupressus japonica L.f.). It used to be considered by some to be endemic to Japan (see remark below under 'Endemism'), where it is known as .This kanji for used for sugi is the same as used for the hanzi for shan, which is used for other species, for instance, shui shan, water fir, Metasequoia glyptostroboides. The tree is called Japanese cedar or Japanese redwood in English. Cone and seed Description Cryptomeria japonica: (left) shoot with mature cones and immature male cones at top; (centre) adult foliage shoot; (right) juvenile foliage shoot Cryptomeria is a very large evergreen tree, reaching up to tall and trunk diameter, with red-brown bark which peels in vertical strips. The leaves are arranged spirally, needle-like, long; and the seed cones globular, diameter with about 20‚Äì40 scales. It is superficially similar to the related giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), from which it can be differentiated by the longer leaves (under in the giant sequoia) and smaller cones ( in the giant sequoia), and the harder bark on the trunk (thick, soft and spongy in giant sequoia). Endemism Sugi has been cultivated in China for so long that it is frequently thought to be native there. Forms selected for ornament and timber production long ago in China have been described as a distinct variety Cryptomeria japonica var. sinensis (or even a distinct species, Cryptomeria fortunei), but they do not differ from the full range of variation found in the wild in Japan, and there is no definite evidence the species ever occurred wild in China. Genetic analysis of the most famous Chinese population, on Tianmu Mountain, containing trees estimated to be nearly 1000 years old, supports the hypothesis that the population originates from an introduction. However, the famed Japanese botanist and plant ecology expert Akira Miyawaki has proven since the 1970s that trees such as Japanese Cedar, Cypress and Larch Pine, i.e. including Cryptomeria, which were so far believed to be native to Japan, had in fact been progressively introduced into Japan over many centuries by foresters in order to produce timber. Akira Miyawaki calculated that only about 0.06% of contemporary Japanese forests are actual indigenous forests. Biology Cryptomeria grows in forests on deep, well- drained soils subject to warm, moist conditions, and it is fast-growing under these conditions. It is intolerant of poor soils and cold, drier climates. It is used as a food plant by the larvae of some moths of the genus Endoclita including E. auratus, E. punctimargo and E. undulifer. Sugi (and hinoki) pollen is a major cause of hay fever in Japan. Fossil record The earliest fossil record of Cryptomeria are descriptions based on vegetative organs of ‚Ä†Cryptomeria kamtschatica of the Late Eocene from Kamchatka, Russia and ‚Ä†Cryptomeria protojaponica and ‚Ä†Cryptomeria sichotensis from the Oligocene of Primorye, Russia. Several fossil leafy shots of ‚Ä†Cryptomeria yunnanensis have been described from Rupelian stage strata of the L√ºhe Basin in Yunnan, China. For the Neogene, Cryptomeria is well represented as seed cones, leafy shoots and wood in the fossil records of Europe and Japan. ‚Ä†Cryptomeria rhenana was described from the early Late Miocene to the Late Miocene of Rhein in Morsbach, Germany, from the Early and Middle Pliocene of Northern Italy, to the Middle Pliocene of Dunarobba, Italy and to the Early Pleistocene of Umbria, Italy. ‚Ä† Cryptomeria anglicawas described from the Late Miocene of La Cerdana, Spain, to the Late Middle Miocene of Brj√°nsl√¶kur, Iceland and from the Late Miocene to the early Pliocene of Derbyshire, England. ‚Ä†Cryptomeria miyataensis was described from the Late Miocene of Akita, Japan. Cryptomeria japonica was described from the Late Miocene of Georgia and from the Pliocene of Duab, Abkhazia. It has also been described from the Pliocene of Honshu, Japan, Late Pliocene of Osaka, Japan and from the Pleistocene of Kyushu, Japan. Cultivation=Timber Plank cut from Cryptomeria japonica Cryptomeria japonica timber is extremely fragrant, weather and insect resistant, soft, and with a low density. The timber is used for the making of staves, tubs, casks, furniture and other indoor applications. Easy to saw and season, it is favoured for light construction, boxes, veneers and plywood. Wood that has been buried turns dark green and is much valued. Resin from the tree contains cryptopimaric and phenolic acid. The wood is pleasantly scented, reddish-pink in colour, lightweight but strong, waterproof and resistant to decay. It is favoured in Japan for all types of construction work as well as interior panelling, etc. In Darjeeling district and Sikkim in India, where it is one of the most widely growing trees, C. japonica is called Dhuppi and is favoured for its light wood, extensively used in house building. =Mechanical properties= In dry air conditions, the initial density of Japanese cedar timber has been determined to be about 300‚Äì420 kg/m3. It displays a Young's modulus of 8017 MPa, 753 MPa and 275 MPa in the longitudinal, radial and tangential direction in relation to the wood fibers. Ornamental Cryptomeria japonica is extensively used in forestry plantations in Japan, China and the Azores islands, and is widely cultivated as an ornamental tree in other temperate areas, including Britain, Europe, North America and eastern Himalaya regions of Nepal and India. The cultivar 'Elegans' is notable for retaining juvenile foliage throughout its life, instead of developing normal adult foliage when one year old (see the picture with different shoots). It makes a small, shrubby tree tall. There are numerous dwarf cultivars that are widely used in rock gardens and for bonsai, including 'Tansu', 'Koshyi', 'Little Diamond', 'Yokohama' and 'Kilmacurragh.' The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017): * C. japonica 'Bandai-sugi' * C. japonica 'Elegans Compacta' * C. japonica 'Elegans Viridis' * C. japonica 'Globosa Nana' * C. japonica 'Golden Promise' * C. japonica 'Sekkan-sugi' * Cryptomeria japonica 'Spiralis' * C. japonica 'Vilmoriniana' Symbolism Sugi is the national tree of Japan, commonly planted around temples and shrines, with many hugely impressive trees planted centuries ago. Sargent (1894; The Forest Flora of Japan) recorded the instance of a daimy≈ç (feudal lord) who was too poor to donate a stone lantern at the funeral of the sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543‚Äì1616) at Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´, but requested instead to be allowed to plant an avenue of sugi, so that \\"future visitors might be protected from the heat of the sun\\". The offer was accepted; the Cedar Avenue of Nikk≈ç, which still exists, is over long, and \\"has not its equal in stately grandeur\\". is a large cryptomeria tree located on Yakushima, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in Japan. It is the oldest and largest among the old-growth cryptomeria trees on the island, and is estimated to be between 2,170 and 7,200 years old. Cryptomeria are often described and referred to in Japanese literature. For instance, cryptomeria forests and their workers, located on the mountains north of Kyoto, are featured in Yasunari Kawabata's famous book The Old Capital.

It is often used to describe a stable mental state or mood in those affected with bipolar disorder that is neither manic nor depressive, yet is distinguishable from healthy controls. Euthymia is also used to describe the ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù of other cyclical mood disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), borderline personality disorder (BPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). This state is the goal of psychiatric and psychological interventions. The word ‚Äúeuthymia‚Äù traces its roots to the Greek words ‚Äúeu‚Äù, meaning well, and ‚Äúthymo‚Äù, meaning soul or emotion. The word ‚Äúthymos‚Äù also had four additional meanings: life energy; feelings and passions; desires and inclinations; and thought or intelligence. Euthymia is also derived from a verb, ‚Äúeuthymeo‚Äù, that means both ‚ÄúI am happy, in good spirits‚Äù and ‚ÄúI make others happy, I reassure and encourage‚Äù. This is the basis on which the first formal definition of euthymia was built. Democritus said that the state of euthymia is when ‚Äúone is satisfied with what is present and available, taking little heed of people who are envied and admired and observing the lives of those who suffer and yet endure‚Äù. This was later amended in the translation given by the Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger in which euthymia means a state of internal calm and contentment. Seneca was also the first to link the state of euthymia to a learning process; in order to achieve it, one must be aware of psychological well-being. Seneca‚Äôs definition included a cache about detachment from current events. Later, the Greek biographer Plutarch removed this cache with his definition which focused more on learning from adverse events. In 1958, Marie Jodah gave a modern clinical definition of mental health in the terms of positive symptoms by outlining the criteria for mental health: ‚Äúautonomy (regulation of behavior from within), environmental mastery, satisfactory interactions with other people and the milieu, the individual‚Äôs style and degree of growth, development or self-actualization, the attitudes of an individual toward his/her own self‚Äù. In her definition she acknowledged the absence of disease as being necessary, but not enough, to constitute positive mental health, or euthymia. Carol Ryff (1989) was the first to develop a comprehensive scale that could assess euthymia: the Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being. The 84-item scale includes facets of self- acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth. It did not include a notion of resilience, which people in the field started working to add in the 2000s. Parathymia on the other hand, is related to pathological laughter (called ‚ÄúWitzelsucht‚Äù).

Boles≈Çaw had enjoyed the close friendship of the emperor Otto III and after his death supported one of Otto's followers, Eckard I, Margrave of Meissen for the position of Holy Roman Emperor, against the claims of Henry II. After both emperor Otto III and Eckard's death in 1002, Boles≈Çaw conquered Eckard's domain of Meissen, as well as the march of Lusatia. Once Henry secured his position within Germany, an agreement was reached which left Boles≈Çaw with Lusatia and Upper Lusatia while the Polish duke in turn recognized Henry as Holy Roman Emperor. Fighting soon resumed, however, after an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Boles≈Çaw‚Äîwhich he believed had been ordered by Henry, who denied the charge‚Äîoccurred soon after the peace was concluded. Boles≈Çaw took control of Bohemia, having previously acquired Moravia and Slovakia. In the ensuing struggle Boles≈Çaw allied himself with the Holy Roman Empire's noble opposition to Henry, while the emperor sought support among the Lutici, a Slavic pagan Polabian tribe. An intermediate peace was concluded in Merseburg in 1013 which preserved the territorial status quo, with Boles≈Çaw holding on to Moravia and Slovakia, while Jaromir was made the ruler of Bohemia (though he was soon deposed by his brother Oldrich). Boles≈Çaw however agreed to support the Emperor's Italian campaign. Open warfare continued when Boles≈Çaw I did not comply with this condition, and instead supported Henry II's Italian adversaries. Henry II was however unable to defeat Boles≈Çaw I, and agreed on a peace in Bautzen (1018) which left Duke of Poland in charge of the Lusatian march and Upper Lusatia. The two rulers also strengthened the dynastic bonds between them through Boles≈Çaw's marriage with Oda, first daughter of Margrave Eckard. The emperor also promised to aid Boles≈Çaw in his expedition against Ruthenia in the summer of 1018 with contingents of German and Hungarian troops which enabled the Polish ruler to capture Kiev and annex a part of Red Ruthenia. Prelude= Merseburg (1002)  Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor11th-century manuscript of St. Gregory's Moralia in Job (Bamberg State Library, Msc.Bibl.84) Boles≈Çaw I of Poland in a drawing by Jan Matejko After the death of emperor Otto III, Bavarian duke Henry IV and Meissen margrave Eckard (Ekkehard) I competed for succession.Bernhardt (1993), p. 41 When Eckard I was murdered on 30 April 1002 in P√∂hlde,R√∂ckelein (2006), p. 113 Polish duke Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry, who had supported Eckard's candidature, took over the Margraviate of Meissen and March Lusatia (Lower Lusatia), lands only recently conquered by Germans and still inhabited mostly by Slavs,Knefelkamp (2002), p. 123 probably with approval from Eckard's family.Reuter and McKitterick, p. 262 He took control of both Bautzen and Meissen, after the inhabitants themselves had forced the German troops to leave the city, while other German knights voluntarily recognized Boles≈Çaw's rule in the region. Meanwhile, Henry IV had consolidated his rule against rival candidates, and, as Henry II, was crowned king of Germany in June.Jasienica (2007), p. 79Knefelkamp (2002), p. 122 On 25 July 1002Schneidm√ºller (2003), p. 110 at a Hoftag (imperial meeting) held in Merseburg, the dispute was settled as follows: *Henry II gave the Lusatian march and the eastern part of the Meissen march (Milzenerland, Upper Lusatia) to Boles≈Çaw I as a fief, *Boles≈Çaw I had to return the truncated Margraviate of Meissen, *Boles≈Çaw I pledged allegiance to Henry II together with the Saxon nobles. When Boles≈Çaw I left Merseburg, he was ambushed, but due to the aid of Henry of Schweinfurt and Saxon duke Bernard (Bernhard) I, he was able to repulse the attack.Berger (2002), p. 224 Henry II did neither protect him, nor punish the assailants.  Pozna≈Ñ (1005)  In 1003, Boles≈Çaw I conquered the Duchy of Bohemia, imprisoned its P≈ôemyslid duke, Boleslaus III,Herbers & Neuhaus (2005), p. 56 and denied Henry II the oath of allegiance for the duchy. Henry II did not accept this,Schwarz (2006), p. 24 and was determined to contest the Polish claims to the Bohemian duchy. Boles≈Çaw I had further allied with the noble German opposition to Henry II. This alliance included Henry of Schweinfurt, his cousin Ernst as well as Henry II's brother Brun (Bruno), bishop of Augsburg, all of which fled to Boles≈Çaw's court when their rebellion against Henry II failed. While Boles≈Çaw I could draw upon the support of many secular Saxon nobles, Henry II could rely on the Saxon clergy. Also in 1003, Henry II allied with the pagan Lutici against Boles≈Çaw I, and in 1004 launched a campaign against the latter. In the course of this campaign, Henry II evicted Boles≈Çaw I from Bohemia and granted it to the P≈ôemyslid duke Jaromir in 1004, before he besieged and took Bautzen from Boles≈Çaw I's forces and incorporated it into the Duchy of Saxony.Berger (2002), p. 225 A few months later, together with Veleti and Czech allies, Henry II mounted another campaign. He crossed the Oder near Krosno and advanced into Greater Poland. Boles≈Çaw however avoided an open battle, harried the emperor's troops with guerrilla tactics and caused \\"great losses\\", according to contemporary German chroniclers. The fighting was concluded in 1005 when Tagino, Archbishop of Magdeburg mediated a peace near Pozna≈Ñ, as a result of which Poland had to give up Lusatia and Meissen but kept Slovakia and Moravia for the time being. The peace was temporary, as neither was Henry II ready to grant Boles≈Çaw I a more elevated status than the one of an ordinary vassal, nor did the latter abandon his desire for such a position or accept Henry II's power as immediate to God, as his self-perception was similar in this respect. Merseburg (1013) Despite the peace of Poznan, warfare between Boles≈Çaw I and Henry II continued between 1007 and 1013. In 1007, Boles≈Çaw I again took control of Lusatia with the fortress of Bautzen. A campaign led by Henry II in 1010 was unsuccessful. During this campaign, which started in Belgern, Henry II was struck by an illness at Jarina castle and returned with some of his bishops, while the remaining armies devastated the surrounding area. A Saxon campaign in 1012 was also unsuccessful. Henry II had mobilized the Saxon nobility to mount campaigns in his name, since he needed a peace agreement before 1013, when his coronation in Rome was scheduled. Thus, in 1013, Boles≈Çaw I and Henry II agreed on a peace in Merseburg: *Henry II again gave the Lusatian march and Upper Lusatia to Boles≈Çaw I as a fief, *Boles≈Çaw I again pledged allegiance to Henry II, *Boles≈Çaw I promised to support Henry II's campaign to Rome, *Henry II promised to support Boles≈Çaw I's campaign to Kiev with 500 knights.Keller (2001), p. 96 The treaty was confirmed by the marriage of Richeza, a niece of Otto III, to Mieszko II, a son of Boles≈Çaw I. During the ceremony Boles≈Çaw I carried the sword for Henry II. Boles≈Çaw I however did not aid Henry II in his Italian campaign,Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125 and refused to recognize that Lusatia and Upper Lusatia were his only as fiefs.Jasienica, p. 84 Instead, he supported Crescentian antipope Gregory VI and intrigued against Henry II in Italy, who had denied Gregory his support in P√∂hlde. Henry II started his Italian campaign in the fall of 1013, defeated the allies of the Crescentians and had pope Benedict VIII crown him Holy Roman Emperor in Rome on 14 February 1014. Bohemian duke Oldrich (Udalrich) meanwhile captured Boles≈Çaw I's son, Mieszko, and turned him over to Henry II, who however released him. Bautzen (1018)=Military operations and political background In July 1015, Henry II with his Lutician allies renewed the war against Boles≈Çaw I on the basis of the latter's failure to support him in Italy. The campaign started in Magdeburg, from where Henry II's army crossed through Lusatia to Krosno, where two other armies commanded by Bernard II of Saxony and Olrich (Udalrich) of Bohemia were supposed to join him. The plan failed however, as Boles≈Çaw's maneuvers prevented the two armies from joining up. During the fighting Margrave Gero, as well as two hundred other German knights were killed by Polish bowmen and Boles≈Çaw allowed the Bishop of Meissen, Eido, to recover the bodies for burial.Jasienica, p. 85 As a result of these setbacks Henry II withdrew. Subsequent negotiations with Boles≈Çaw I failed. In 1017, Henry II marched an army from Leitzkau to G≈Çog√≥w (Glogau), where Boles≈Çaw I awaited him, but chose not to besiege the city as it was too strongly fortified. Instead Henry besieged nearby Niemcza (Nemzi, Nimptsch), however, Polish reinforcements managed to enter the city on two occasions and the siege was without success. The contemporary German chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, generally ill- disposed towards Poles, on this occasion commented on the bravery and skill of the defenders, noting that they neither cheered when they were successful, nor lamented when they suffered a setback.Jasienica, p. 86 The inhabitants of the city also erected a cross on the wall which faced the pagan Lutician allies of the emperor. Eventually, due to an illness of part of his army Henry aborted the siege and withdrew, taking the route to Bohemia because the way back into Germany was blocked by Boleslaw's main forces, stationed at Wroc≈Çaw. During these campaigns, Henry II was confronted with the opposition of part of the Saxon nobility, including the House of Billung, who maintained good relations and were in part relatives of Boles≈Çaw I. In 1017, Henry II therefore addressed Boles≈Çaw I as \\"public enemy\\" (hostis publicus) and forbade further contacts with him. At the end of 1017, Polish troops invaded German land between the Mulde and Elbe rivers. The treaty On 30 January 1018, peace was made in Bautzen. Boles≈Çaw I kept the Lusatian march and Upper Lusatia (Milzenerland). Thietmar, the principal German chronicler of the time, did not give precise details as to the conditions on which Boles≈Çaw retained these lands. According to German historian Schneidmuller, he held them as an imperial fief. According to Polish historian Pawel Jasienica, the lands were held without any obligation towards the empire. The Cambridge Medieval History states that they were Boles≈Çaw's on \\"purely nominal terms of vassalage\\".Previte-orton, p. 451 The contemporary German chronicler Thietmar, who was generally ill-disposed towards Poles,Jasienica, p. ? commented on the peace with the words \\"non ut decuit sed sicut fieri potuit\\", meaning \\"not as it should have been but as was possible in the circumstances\\".Fleckenstein, p. 181Rosik and Wyszewski, p. 49 Both parties also exchanged hostages. Henry II did not attend, and did not renew the campaigns against Boles≈Çaw I thereafter. The peace was confirmed by the marriage of Oda of Meissen, daughter of Eckard I, to Boles≈Çaw I. It was Boles≈Çaw I's fourth marriage; Regelind, a daughter from his previous marriage with Emnilda of Lusatia, was already married to Oda's brother Herman (Hermann) I of Meissen. Henry also obliged himself to support Boles≈Çaw with three hundred knights in the Polish ruler's expedition to Kiev in the same year.

Lying within the Gryffe Valley and providing a crossing point for the River Gryffe, the village was initially formed around industries such as cotton and leather, reliant on the power of the river. In the 1860s the village was connected by rail, which significantly supported its development. Today it serves largely as a dormitory settlement for nearby Glasgow and Paisley although it maintains a commercial centre of its own and some light industry. It remains well-known for its leather production. History=Toponymy River Gryffe at Bridge of Weir, with former mill infrastructure visible. The name of Bridge of Weir () is first recorded in the early 18th century before a significant settlement was constructed in the area.https://www.scottish- places.info/towns/townfirst374.html The 'weir' is a reference to a salmon weir which used to be located on the Gryffe. An older name provided for the village is \\"Port o'Weir\\", implying a river crossing; this name remained in some use even after the current name had been adopted.W. Lyle, Bridge of Weir, , p.6-7 Early history Bridge of Weir was historically a rural area divided between the parishes of neighbouring Houston and Killellan and Kilbarchan on either side of the River Gryffe. Growing out of the lands of the 15th century Ranfurly Castle, the village emerged later than its neighbours among a number of small farms that occupied the area. The earliest economy of the village was centred on the Renfrewshire cotton industry. From the late 18th century, the River Gryffe was exploited to power cotton mills. The bridge at Bridge of Weir was constructed at Burngill around 1770 and was considerably upgraded and widened in 1892 to allow for two-way traffic. It was finally demolished in 1964, with a more modern structure created. The bridge owes its construction to being on the route between the significant towns of Greenock and Paisley, with a Great Road constructed between the two in 1794. Leather also emerged as a local product, with the village supporting three tanneries. The leather industry survives to this day, now on a single site, in the form of a highly successful, modern facility with five Queen's Awards for International Business. Later expansion The Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal provided an initial link for Renfrewshire industry to its wider urban centres. The former canal provided a route for the later expansion of the railway to nearby settlements. From 1864, the Bridge of Weir Railway provided a rail link to Johnstone through the Bridge of Weir railway station in the village. From 1869, the line was incorporated into the wider Greenock and Ayrshire Railway, extending to Kilmacolm and beyond to Greenock. This railway substantially altered the character of the village and contributed to its forthcoming affluence. The railway closed on 10 January 1983 and now forms part of the Clyde to Forth cycle route (National Cycle Route 75). Economy Bridge of Weir is surrounded by agricultural lands, with traditional industries being cotton milling and leather tanning. The earliest cotton mills were built in the late 18th and early 19th centuries on the banks on the River Gryffe. Today, the town's golf courses and fishing attract visitors and there the village has a commercial centre with retail stores, restaurants and public houses.https://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townfirst374.html Leather From the 18th century, the waulking mill was used in the production of leather with the Burngill Mill having been recorded in 1770. It was purchased by Andrew Muirhead in 1870 whose family had been in the leather industry in Glasgow for several generations. In 1905, Arthur Muirhead set up a further leather mill at the Laigh Mill (renamed the Clydesdale Works) and founded the Bridge of Weir Leather Company. Despite having several premises in the past, since the beginning of the 21st century, the company's business has been consolidated at the Lochar and Baltic Works.http://rlhf.info/wp- content/uploads/16-Bridge-of-Weir-Leather-Muirhead-2014.pdf The leather works continue to serve as a large employer in the area and trade their goods across the world. Some notable customers include: *In 1989, the benches of the British Parliament's House of Commons and House of Lords chambers in Westminster were reupholstered using Bridge of Weir leather.Renfrewshire Community Website - Bridge of Weir * Bridge of Weir leather has upholstered many famous ocean liners, including Cunard's Queens Mary, Elizabeth, Elizabeth 2 and Victoria. Azimut Yachts and Sunseeker are also customers of Bridge of Weir Tannery. *The Old Bailey, and many other notable public buildings around the world feature their leather. * Several major airlines, including British Airways (including the Concorde), Virgin, Cathay Pacific, KLM, Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Qantas * Automobile customers of Bridge of Weir leather are Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Saab, McLaren, Mercedes- Benz, Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover and Lincoln. Also some of Ford's Model T (that were UK built) were also upholstered with Bridge of Weir leather. Governance Bridge of Weir is part of the council area of Renfrewshire, as well the historic county of Renfrewshire which has wider boundaries and retains some official functions, for example as a registration county and lieutenancy area. For elections to Renfrewshire Council, Bridge of Weir is part of ward 10, named 'Bishopton, Bridge of Weir and Langbank', which elects three of Renfrewshire's forty councillors. The ward results in the most recent election are: Bridge of Weir also has one of Renfrewshire's twenty-seven community councils representing the village. Culture and community The former Ranfurly Hotel (left) and the Clydesdale Bank building from Ranfurly-St Machar's Churchyard Recreation Bisected by the River Gryffe, angling is available within the village. The river hosts brown trout, grayling and occasionally Atlantic salmon. Numerous outdoor pursuits are available at the nearby Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park. National Cycle Route 75 runs through the village. The village is also known for its golf history. At one point there were five golf courses in the vicinity; today there are two remaining: the Old Course Ranfurly and the Ranfurly Castle golf clubs. There was a thriving ice hockey team from around 1895 and in 1935 were Scottish National League Champions.

Born into a poor family, he was apprenticed as a carpenter but took to theft and burglary in 1723, with little more than a year of his training to complete. He was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but escaped four times from prison, making him a notorious public figure, and wildly popular with the poorer classes. Ultimately, he was caught, convicted, and hanged at Tyburn, ending his brief criminal career after less than two years. The inability of the notorious \\"Thief-Taker General\\" Jonathan Wild to control Sheppard, and injuries suffered by Wild at the hands of Sheppard's colleague Joseph \\"Blueskin\\" Blake led to Wild's downfall. Sheppard was as renowned for his attempts to escape from prison as he was for his crimes. An autobiographical \\"Narrative\\", thought to have been ghostwritten by Daniel Defoe, was sold at his execution,Compiled for Applebee's Original Weekly Journal, probably by Daniel Defoe, and endorsed by Sheppard at his hanging in November 1724. quickly followed by popular plays. The character of Macheath in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (1728) was based in part on Sheppard, keeping him in the limelight for over 100 years. He returned to the public consciousness around 1840, when William Harrison Ainsworth wrote a novel entitled Jack Sheppard, with illustrations by George Cruikshank. The popularity of his tale, and the fear that others would be drawn to emulate his behaviour, led the authorities to refuse to license any plays in London with \\"Jack Sheppard\\" in the title for forty years.  Early life  Sheppard was born in White's Row, in London's Spitalfields.Moore, p.31.Lynch, para.2. He was baptised on 5 March, the day after he was born, at St Dunstan's, Stepney, suggesting a fear of infant mortality by his parents, perhaps because the newborn was weak or sickly. His parents named him after an older brother, John, who had died before his birth. In life, he was better known as Jack, or even \\"Gentleman Jack\\" or \\"Jack the Lad\\". He had a second brother, Thomas, and a younger sister, Mary. Their father, a carpenter, died while Sheppard was young, and his sister died two years later. An engraving of Wych Street, from about 1870 Unable to support her family without her husband's income, Jack's mother sent him to Mr Garrett's School, a workhouse near St Helen's Bishopsgate, when he was six years old. Sheppard was sent out as a parish apprentice to a cane-chair maker, taking a settlement of 20 shillings, but his new master soon died. He was sent out to a second cane-chair maker, but Sheppard was treated badly.Moore, p.38. Finally, when Sheppard was 10, he went to work as a shop-boy for William Kneebone, a wool draper with a shop on the Strand.Moore, p.33. Sheppard's mother had been working for Kneebone since her husband's death. Kneebone taught Sheppard to read and write and apprenticed him to a carpenter, Owen Wood, in Wych Street, off Drury Lane in Covent Garden. Sheppard signed his seven-year indenture on 2 April 1717. By 1722, Sheppard was showing great promise as a carpenter. Aged 20, he was a small man, only 5'4\\" (1.63 m) and lightly built, but deceptively strong. He had a pale face with large, dark eyes, a wide mouth and a quick smile. Despite a slight stutter, his wit made him popular in the taverns of Drury Lane.Moore, p.96. He served five unblemished years of his apprenticeship but then began to be led into crime. Joseph Hayne, a button-moulder who owned a shop nearby, also ran a tavern named the Black Lion off Drury Lane, which he encouraged the local apprentices to frequent.Moore, p.98. The Black Lion was visited by criminals such as Joseph \\"Blueskin\\" Blake, Sheppard's future partner in crime, and self- proclaimed \\"Thief-Taker General\\" Jonathan Wild, secretly the linchpin of a criminal empire across London and later Sheppard's implacable enemy. According to Sheppard's autobiography, he had been an innocent until going to Hayne's tavern, but there began an attachment to strong drink and the affections of Elizabeth Lyon, a prostitute also known as Edgworth Bess (or Edgeworth Bess) from her place of birth at Edgeworth in Middlesex. In his History, Defoe records that Bess was \\"a main lodestone in attracting of him up to this Eminence of Guilt.\\"Defoe, History. Such, Sheppard claimed, was the source of his later ruin.Defoe's History reports that he called Edgworth Bess \\"the sole author of all his misfortunes\\" and said he \\"cared not what became of her\\". Peter Linebaugh offers a more romantic view: that Sheppard's sudden transformation was a liberation from the dull drudgery of indentured labour and that he progressed from pious servitude to self-confident rebellion and Levelling.Linebaugh, Ch.1. \\"The Common Discourse of the Whole Nation: Jack Sheppard and the Art of Escape\\", in The London Hanged, pp.7‚Äì42. On the comparison with the Levellers, see p.164.  Criminal career  Sheppard threw himself into a hedonistic whirl of drinking and whoring. Inevitably, his carpentry suffered, and he became disobedient to his master. With Lyon's encouragement, Sheppard took to crime in order to augment his legitimate wages. His first recorded theft was in Spring 1723, when he engaged in petty shoplifting, stealing two silver spoons while on an errand for his master to the Rummer Tavern in Charing Cross. Sheppard's misdeeds went undetected, and he moved on to larger crimes, often stealing goods from the houses where he was working. Finally, he quit the employ of his master on 2 August 1723, with less than two years of his apprenticeship left,Moore, p.99. although he continued to work as a journeyman carpenter.Lynch, para.7. He was not suspected of the crimes, and progressed to burglary, falling in with criminals in Jonathan Wild's gang. He moved to Fulham, living as husband and wife with Lyon at Parsons Green, before moving to Piccadilly. When Lyon was arrested and imprisoned at St Giles's Roundhouse, the beadle, a Mr Brown, refused to let Sheppard visit, so he broke in and took her away.Lynch, para.8.  Arrested and escaped twice  Sheppard was first arrested after a burglary he committed with his brother, Tom, and his mistress, Lyon, in Clare Market on 5 February 1724. Tom, also a carpenter, had already been convicted once for stealing tools from his master the previous autumn and burned in the hand. Tom was arrested again on 24 April 1724. Afraid that he would be hanged this time, Tom informed on Jack, and a warrant was issued for Jack's arrest.Lynch, para.11. Jonathan Wild was aware of Sheppard's thefts, as Sheppard had fenced some stolen goods through one of Wild's men, William Field. Wild asked another of his men, James Sykes (known as \\"Hell and Fury\\") to challenge Sheppard to a game of skittles at Redgate's public house near Seven Dials.Moore, p.100. Sykes betrayed Sheppard to a Mr Price, a constable from the parish of St Giles, to gather the usual ¬£40 reward for giving information leading to the conviction of a felon. The magistrate, Justice Parry, had Sheppard imprisoned overnight on the top floor of St Giles's Roundhouse pending further questioning, but Sheppard escaped within three hours by breaking through the timber ceiling and lowering himself to the ground with a rope fashioned from bedclothes.Moore, p.104. Still wearing irons, Sheppard coolly joined the crowd that had been attracted by the sounds of his breaking out. He distracted their attention by pointing to the shadows on the roof and shouting that he could see the escapee, and then swiftly departed. Jack used a rope of knotted bedclothes to lower Bess during their escape from the New Prison in Clerkenwell. On 19 May 1724, Sheppard was arrested for a second time, caught in the act of picking a pocket in Leicester Fields (near present-day Leicester Square). He was detained overnight in St Ann's Roundhouse in Soho and visited there the next day by Lyon; she was recognised as his wife and locked in a cell with him. They appeared before Justice Walters, who sent them to the New Prison in Clerkenwell, but they escaped from their cell, known as the Newgate Ward, within a matter of days. By 25 May, Whitsun Monday, Sheppard and Lyon had filed through their manacles; they removed a bar from the window and used their knotted bed-clothes to descend to ground level. Finding themselves in the yard of the neighbouring Bridewell, they clambered over the 22-foot-high (6.7 m) prison gate to freedom. This feat was widely publicised, not least because Sheppard was only a small man, and Lyon was a large, buxom woman.Moore, p.105.Defoe's History reports that she was \\"more corpulent than himself\\".  Third arrest, trial, and third escape  Sheppard's thieving abilities were admired by Jonathan Wild. Wild demanded that Sheppard surrender his stolen goods for Wild to fence, and so take the greater profits, but Sheppard refused. He began to work with Joseph \\"Blueskin\\" Blake, and they burgled Sheppard's former master, William Kneebone, on Sunday 12 July 1724. Wild could not permit Sheppard to continue outside his control and began to seek Sheppard's arrest.Moore, p.110. Unfortunately for Sheppard, his fence, William Field, was one of Wild's men. After Sheppard had a brief foray with Blueskin as highwaymen on the Hampstead Road on Sunday 19 July and Monday 20 July, Field informed on Sheppard to Wild. Wild believed Lyon would know Sheppard's whereabouts, so he plied her with drinks at a brandy shop near Temple Bar until she betrayed him. Sheppard was arrested a third time at Blueskin's mother's brandy shop in Rosemary Lane, east of the Tower of London (later renamed Royal Mint Street), on 23 July by Wild's henchman, Quilt Arnold.Moore, p.111. Sheppard was imprisoned in Newgate Prison pending his trial at the next Assize of oyer and terminer. He was prosecuted on three charges of theft at the Old Bailey, but was acquitted on the first two due to lack of evidence. Kneebone, Wild and Field gave evidence against him on the third charge, the burglary of Kneebone's house. He was convicted on 12 August, the case \\"being plainly prov'd\\", and sentenced to death.Trial summary on three charges of theft, 12 August 1724, where his name is incorrectly recorded as Joseph Sheppard. Retrieved 5 February 2007. On Monday 31 August, the very day when the death warrant arrived from the court in Windsor setting Friday 4 September as the date for his execution, Sheppard escaped. Having loosened an iron bar in a window used when talking to visitors, he was visited by Lyon and Poll Maggott, who distracted the guards while he removed the bar.Security was lax compared to that of later years. The guard-to-prisoner ratio at Newgate in 1724 was 1:90. Wives could stay overnight. Linebaugh, p.29. His slight build enabled him to climb through the resulting gap in the grille, and he was smuggled out of Newgate in women's clothing that his visitors had brought him.Moore, p.206. He took a coach to Blackfriars Stairs, a boat up the River Thames to the horse ferry in Westminster, near the warehouse where he hid his stolen goods, and made good his escape.  Fourth arrest and final escape  By this point, Sheppard was a hero to a segment of the population, being a cockney, non-violent, handsome and seemingly able to escape punishment for his crimes at will. He spent a few days out of London, visiting a friend's family in Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire, but was soon back in town.Moore, p.207. He evaded capture by Wild and his men but was arrested again on 9 September by a posse from Newgate as he hid out on Finchley Common,Moore, p.208. and returned to the condemned cell at Newgate. His fame had increased with each escape, and he was visited in prison by the great, the good and the curious. His plans to escape in September were thwarted twice when the guards found files and other tools in his cell, and he was transferred to a strong- room in Newgate known as the \\"Castle\\", clapped in leg irons, and chained to two metal staples in the floor to prevent further escape attempts.Norton, The Daily Journal for Thursday 17 September 1724. After demonstrating to his gaolers that these measures were insufficient, by showing them how he could use a small nail to unlock the horse padlock at will, he was bound more tightly and handcuffed. In his History, Defoe reports that Sheppard made light of his predicament, joking that \\"I am the Sheppard, and all the Gaolers in the Town are my Flock, and I cannot stir into the Country, but they are all at my Heels Baughing after me\\". Meanwhile, \\"Blueskin\\" Blake was arrested by Wild and his men on Friday 9 October, and Tom, Jack's brother, was transported for robbery on Saturday 10 October 1724.Moore, p.158. New court sessions began on Wednesday 14 October, and Blueskin was tried on Thursday 15 October, with Field and Wild again giving evidence. Their accounts were not consistent with the evidence that they gave at Sheppard's trial, but Blueskin was convicted anyway. Enraged, Blueskin attacked Wild in the courtroom, slashing his throat with a pocket-knife and causing an uproar.Moore, p.159. Wild was lucky to survive, and his grip over his criminal empire started to slip while he recuperated. Jack Sheppard in Newgate Prison before his fourth escape, from the frontispiece of the \\"Narrative\\" of his life, published by John Applebee in 1724. The label \\"A\\" marks the hole he made in the chimney during his escape. Taking advantage of the disturbance, which spread to Newgate Prison next door and continued into the night, Sheppard escaped for the fourth time. He unlocked his handcuffs and removed the chains. Still encumbered by his leg irons, he attempted to climb up the chimney, but his path was blocked by an iron bar set into the brickwork. He removed the bar and used it to break through the ceiling into the \\"Red Room\\" above the \\"Castle\\", a room which had last been used some seven years before to confine aristocratic Jacobite prisoners after the Battle of Preston. Still wearing his leg irons as night fell, he then broke through six barred doors into the prison chapel, then to the roof of Newgate, 60 feet (20 m) above the ground. He went back down to his cell to get a blanket, then back to the roof of the prison, and used the blanket to reach the roof of an adjacent house, owned by William Bird, a turner. He broke into Bird's house, and went down the stairs and out into the street at around midnight without disturbing the occupants. Escaping through the streets to the north and west, Sheppard hid in a cowshed in Tottenham (near modern Tottenham Court Road). Spotted by the barn's owner, Sheppard told him that he had escaped from Bridewell Prison, having been imprisoned there for failing to support a (nonexistent) bastard son. His leg irons remained in place for several days until he persuaded a passing shoemaker to accept the considerable sum of 20 shillings to bring a blacksmith's tools and help him remove them, telling him the same tale.Moore, p.162. His manacles and leg irons were later recovered in the rooms of Kate Cook, one of Sheppard's mistresses. This escape astonished everyone. Daniel Defoe, working as a journalist, wrote an account for John Applebee, The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard. In his History, Defoe reports the belief in Newgate that the Devil came in person to assist Sheppard's escape.  Final capture  Jack Sheppard, in Newgate Prison awaiting execution, in an engraving by George White from 1728, based on a painting by James Thornhill which has not survived. Note that Sheppard's hair is cropped and that he points toward the door.The closeness of the resemblance is praised in a poem published in the British Journal on 28 November 1724, which recites that \\"Thornhill, 'tis thine to gild with fame // Th' obscure, and raise the humble Name; // To make the form elude the Grave, // and Sheppard from oblivion save ... Appelles, Alexander drew, // Caesar is to Aurellius due, // Cromwell in Lilly's works doth shine, // and Sheppard, Thornhill, lives in thine.\\" Sheppard's final period of liberty lasted just two weeks. He disguised himself as a beggar and returned to the city. He broke into the Rawlins brothers' pawnbroker's shop in Drury Lane on the night of 29 October 1724, taking a black silk suit, a silver sword, rings, watches, a wig, and other items.Moore, p.164.Lynch, para.46. He dressed himself as a dandy gentleman and used the proceeds to spend a day and the following evening on the tiles with two mistresses. He was arrested a final time in the early morning on 1 November, blind drunk, \\"in a handsome Suit of Black, with a Diamond Ring and a carnelian ring on his Finger, and a fine Light Tye Peruke\\".The London Journal, 7 November 1724. Mullan, p.186. This time, Sheppard was placed in the Middle Stone Room, in the centre of Newgate next to the \\"Castle\\", where he could be observed at all times. He was also loaded with 300 pounds of iron weights. He was so celebrated that the gaolers charged high society visitors four shillings to see him, and the King's painter James Thornhill painted his portrait.The original has not survived, but this sketch attributed to Thornhill, and this mezzotint engraving by George White based on it, are held by the National Portrait Gallery. The Daily Journal records that the sketch was taken on Friday 13 September, by \\"an eminent painter\\". Retrieved 5 February 2007. Several prominent people sent a petition to King George I, begging for his sentence of death to be commuted to transportation. \\"The Concourse of People of tolerable Fashion to see him was exceeding Great, he was always Chearful and Pleasant to a Degree, as turning almost everything as was said onto a Jest and Banter.\\" To a Reverend Wagstaffe who visited him, he said, according to Defoe, \\"One file's worth all the Bibles in the World\\". Sheppard came before Mr Justice Powis in the Court of King's Bench at Westminster Hall on 10 November. He was offered the chance to have his sentence reduced by informing on his associates, but he scorned the offer, and the death sentence was confirmed.Moore, p.168. The next day, Blueskin was hanged, and Sheppard was moved to the condemned cell.  Execution  The following Monday, 16 November, Sheppard was taken to the gallows at Tyburn to be hanged. He planned one more escape, but his pen-knife, intended to cut the ropes binding him on the way to the gallows, was found by a prison warder shortly before he left Newgate for the last time.Moore, p.219. A joyous procession passed through the streets of London, with Sheppard's cart drawn along Holborn and Oxford Street accompanied by a mounted City Marshal and liveried Javelin Men. The occasion was as much as anything a celebration of Sheppard's life, attended by crowds of up to 200,000 (one third of London's population). The procession halted at the City of Oxford tavern on Oxford Street, where Sheppard drank a pint of sack.Moore, p.222. A carnival atmosphere pervaded Tyburn, where his \\"official\\" autobiography, published by Applebee and probably ghostwritten by Defoe, was on sale. Sheppard handed \\"a paper to someone as he mounted the scaffold\\",The Weekly Journal (Read's Journal), October 1724. Mullan, p.187. perhaps as a symbolic endorsement of the account in the \\"Narrative\\". His slight build had aided his previous prison escapes, but it condemned him to a slow death by strangulation from the hangman's noose. After hanging for the prescribed 15 minutes, his body was cut down. The crowd pressed forward to stop his body from being removed, fearing dissection; their actions inadvertently prevented Sheppard's friends from implementing a plan to take his body to a doctor in an attempt to revive him. His badly mauled remains were recovered later and buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields that evening.Moore, p.225.  Legacy  Poster for the play Jack Sheppard performed at the Royal Lyceum Theatre There was a spectacular public reaction to Sheppard's deeds. He was even cited (favourably) as an example in newspapers, pamphlets, broadsheets, and ballads were all devoted to his amazing exploits,Fiction was readily mixed with fact. Applebee's Journal had a letter from one \\"Betty Blueskin\\", supposed niece of Moll Flanders, telling of her life of crime and her passion for Jack Sheppard. Mullan, p.187. and his story was adapted for the stage almost immediately. Harlequin Sheppard, a pantomime by one John Thurmond (subtitled \\"A night scene in grotesque characters\\"), opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on Saturday 28 November, only two weeks after Sheppard's hanging.Norton, The Weekly Journal or Saturday's-Post for Saturday 5 December 1724. See also William Hogarth's print satirising the production: A Just View of the British Stage. In a famous contemporary sermon, a London preacher drew on Sheppard's popular escapes as a way of holding his congregation's attention: The account of his life remained well-known through the Newgate Calendar, and a three-act farce was published but never produced, but, mixed with songs, it became The Quaker's Opera, later performed at Bartholomew Fair.The Bloody Register, p.324. An imagined dialogue between Jack Sheppard and Julius Caesar was published in the British Journal on 4 December 1724, in which Sheppard favourably compares his virtues and exploits to those of Caesar.The Bloody Register, p.325‚Äì330. Perhaps the most prominent play based on Sheppard's life is John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (1728). Sheppard was the inspiration for the figure of Macheath; his nemesis, Peachum, is based on Jonathan Wild.Moore, p.227. The play was spectacularly popular, restoring the fortune that Gay had lost in the South Sea Bubble, and was produced regularly for over 100 years. An unperformed but published play The Prison-Breaker was turned into The Quaker's Opera (in imitation of The Beggar's Opera) and performed at Bartholomew Fair in 1725 and 1728. Two centuries later The Beggar's Opera was the basis for The Threepenny Opera of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill (1928). Sheppard's tale may have been an inspiration for William Hogarth's 1747 series of 12 engravings, Industry and Idleness, which shows the parallel descent of an apprentice, Tom Idle, into crime and eventually to the gallows, beside the rise of his fellow apprentice, Francis Goodchild, who marries his master's daughter and takes over his business, becoming wealthy as a result, eventually emulating Dick Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London.Moore, p.231. \\"The Last Scene\\" engraved by George Cruikshank in 1839 to illustrate William Harrison Ainsworth's serialised novel, Jack Sheppard. The captions read: \\"Jack Sheppard's Farewell to Mr Wood\\", \\"Blueskin cutting down Jack Sheppard\\", and \\"The body of Jack Sheppard carried off by the mob\\". Sheppard's tale was revived in the first half of the 19th century. A melodrama, Jack Sheppard, The Housebreaker, or London in 1724, by W. T. Moncrieff was published in 1825. More successful was William Harrison Ainsworth's third novel, entitled Jack Sheppard, which was originally published in Bentley's Miscellany from January 1839 with illustrations by George Cruikshank, overlapping with the final episodes of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist.Ainsworth, Jack Sheppard at Project Gutenberg. See also an analysis at The Literary Encyclopedia. Retrieved 5 February 2007. An archetypal Newgate novel, it generally remains close to the facts of Sheppard's life, but portrays him as a swashbuckling hero. Like Hogarth's prints, the novel pairs the descent of the \\"idle\\" apprentice into crime with the rise of a typical melodramatic character, Thames Darrell, a foundling of aristocratic birth who defeats his evil uncle to recover his fortune. Cruikshank's images perfectly complemented Ainsworth's tale‚ÄîThackeray wrote that \\"... Mr Cruickshank really created the tale, and that Mr Ainsworth, as it were, only put words to it.\\"Buckley, p.432, from Meisel, p.247‚Äì8. The novel quickly became very popular: it was published in book form later that year, before the serialised version was completed, and even outsold early editions of Oliver Twist.Buckley, p.426. Ainsworth's novel was adapted into a successful play by John Buckstone in October 1839 at the Adelphi Theatre starring (strangely enough) Mary Anne Keeley; indeed, it seems likely that Cruikshank's illustrations were deliberately created in a form that were informed by, and would be easy to repeat as, tableaux on stage. It has been described as the \\"exemplary climax\\" of \\"the pictorial novel dramatized pictorially\\".Buckley, p.438, quoting Meisel, p.265. The story generated a form of cultural mania, embellished by pamphlets, prints, cartoons, plays and souvenirs, not repeated until George du Maurier's Trilby in 1895. By early 1840, a cant song from Buckstone's play, \\"Nix My Dolly, Pals, Fake Away\\" was reported to be \\"deafening us in the streets\\".Reported in Buckley, p.427. Public alarm at the possibility that young people would emulate Sheppard's behaviour led the Lord Chamberlain to ban, at least in London, the licensing of any plays with \\"Jack Sheppard\\" in the title for forty years. The fear may not have been entirely unfounded: Courvousier, the valet of Lord William Russell, claimed in one of his several confessions that the book had inspired him to murder his master.Moore, p.229. Frank and Jesse James wrote letters to the Kansas City Star signed \\"Jack Sheppard\\".Linebaugh, p.7. Nevertheless, burlesques of the story were written after the ban was lifted, including a popular Gaiety Theatre, London piece called Little Jack Sheppard (1886) by Henry Pottinger Stephens and William Yardley, which starred Nellie Farren as Jack.Sugden The Sheppard story has been revived three times on film in the 20th century: The Hairbreadth Escape of Jack Sheppard (1900), Jack Sheppard (1923), and Where's Jack? (1969), a British costume drama directed by James Clavell with Tommy Steele in the title role. Jake Arnott features him in his 2017 novel The Fatal Tree. In Confessions of the Fox, a 2018 novel by Jordy Rosenberg, the Sheppard story was recontextualized as a queer narrative.Confessions of the Fox , Kirkus Reviews. In 1971 British glam rock band Chicory Tip paid tribute to Sheppard in Don't Hang Jack, the B-side to I Love Onions.I Love Onions The song, apparently sung from the viewpoint of a witness in the courtroom, describes Jack's daring exploits as a thief, and futilely begs the judge to spare Sheppard because he was loved by the women of the town, and idolised by the lads who \\"made him their king.\\" In Jordy Rosenberg's 2018 novel Confessions of the Fox, a 21st-century academic discovers a manuscript containing Sheppard's \\"confessions\\", which tell the story of his childhood and his love affair with Edgeworth Bess, and make the unlikely revelation that he was a transgender man. The reasons for the lasting legacy of Jack Sheppard's exploits in the popular imagination have been addressed by Peter Linebaugh, who suggests that Sheppard's legend was rooted in the prospect of excarceration, of escape from what Michel Foucault in Folie et d√©raison called the grand renfermement (Great Confinement), in which \\"unreasonable\\" members of the population were locked away and institutionalised.Linebaugh describes excarceration as \\"the growing propensity, skill and success of London working people in escaping from the newly created institutions that were designed to discipline people by closing them in.\\" The London Hanged, pp.7‚Äì42. Linebaugh further suggests that he laws levelled at Sheppard and similar working class criminals were a means of disciplining a potentially rebellious multitude into accepting increasingly harsh property laws, although crime has been punished in every era and even more straitly in the past.

She was the fourth Navy ship named after the city of Atlanta, Georgia. The ship was laid down on 25 January 1943 at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, launched on 6 February 1944, sponsored by Margaret Mitchell (author of Gone with the Wind, who also sponsored the previous ), and commissioned on 3 December 1944, Captain B. H. Colyear in command. Service history=World War II After commissioning the light cruiser got underway on 5 January 1945 for shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay and the Caribbean. Upon the completion of those exercises, Atlanta arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 14 February and then moved up the coast to Philadelphia. After a period in the navy yard there, she sailed on 27 March for the Pacific. She stopped at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and transited the Panama Canal before reaching Pearl Harbor on 18 April. From 19 April to 1 May, the ship conducted training exercises in Hawaiian waters. She then sailed to Ulithi and reported to Task Force 58 on 12 May. From 22‚Äì27 May, Atlanta served with the Fast Carrier Task Force operating south of Japan near Okinawa while the carriers' aircraft struck targets in the Ryukyu Islands and on Ky≈´sh≈´ to support forces fighting for Okinawa. Her task group broke up on 13 June, and Atlanta entered San Pedro Bay, Leyte, Philippines, on 14 June. Following two weeks of upkeep, she sailed on 1 July with Task Group 38.1 and once again protected the fast carriers launching strikes against targets in the Japanese home islands. During these operations, the cruiser took part in several shore bombardment missions against Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç. Atlanta was operating off the coast of Honsh≈´ when the Japanese surrendered on 15 August 1945. On 16 September, she entered Tokyo Bay and remained there through 29 September. Post-War With over 500 passengers on board, the cruiser sailed on 30 September for the United States. She paused en route at Guam before arriving in Seattle, Washington, on 24 October. The vessel then proceeded to the shipyard at Terminal Island, California, for an extensive overhaul. She was ready to return to sea on 3 January 1946 and got underway for Sasebo, Japan. From January through June, Atlanta operated among several Far Eastern ports which included Manila, Philippines; Tsingtao and Shanghai, China; Okinawa; Saipan; Nagasaki, Kagoshima, and Yokosuka, Japan. In June, she returned via Guam to the United States and arrived at San Pedro, California, on 27 June. Two days later, the cruiser entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for overhaul. On 8 October, she headed toward San Diego for sea trials. The cruiser remained in southern California waters until 23 February 1947, when she left for maneuvers off Hawaii. On 1 May, she departed Pearl Harbor with TF 38 for a visit to Australia. The ships stayed in Sydney through 27 May, then sailed for San Pedro, via the Coral Sea, Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Guam. She dropped anchor at San Pedro on 28 July. A series of maneuvers off the California coast ensued, Atlanta returned to Pearl Harbor on 28 September. She continued on to Yokosuka, Japan. After two days at anchor there, she sailed to Tsingtao, China. Other ports of call during the deployment were Hong Kong; Singapore; and Keelung, China. On 27 April 1948, the cruiser got underway and proceeded via Kwajalein and Pearl Harbor to San Diego. Following her arrival back in the United States on 19 May, Atlanta conducted exercises off San Diego. She paid a visit to Juneau, Alaska, from 29 June to 6 July. She then arrived at Seattle on 12 July to begin a major overhaul. The cruiser returned to San Diego for local maneuvers on 20 November. As converted as a weapons effects test ship in 1964 In early February 1949, the ship embarked naval reservists for a training cruise and operated between San Diego and San Francisco until 1 March, when she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard to commence deactivation. Atlanta was decommissioned on 1 July 1949 and placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1962, and she was earmarked for disposal. Operation \\"Sailor Hat\\". Detonation of the 500-ton TNT explosive charge for Shot \\"Bravo\\", first of a series of three test explosions on the southwestern tip of Kahoolawe Island, Hawaii, 6 February 1965 Atlantas career had not yet ended, however. She underwent an extensive modification at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. Reinstated on the Navy list as IX-304 on 15 May 1964, the vessel was converted to a target ship for studies of the effects of high energy air explosions on naval ships. The changes included cutting her hull down to the main deck level and erecting various experimental superstructures, designed for guided missile frigates and guided missile destroyers, on her deck. In these configurations she was subjected to explosions to determine whether or not the experimental structures could satisfactorily combine essential lightness with equally essential strength and blast resistance. These three tests were conducted off the coast of Kahoolawe, Hawaii, in early 1965, known as Operation Sailor Hat. Atlanta was damaged, but not sunk, by the experiments. She was laid up at Stockton, California, sometime late in 1965. Her name was again struck from the Register on 1 April 1970, and she was sunk during an explosive test off San Clemente Island on 1 October 1970.

Unlike the majority of founders of men's religious orders, and like his patron saint, Francis was never ordained a priest. Biography Francis was born in the town of Paola, which lies in the southern Italian Province of Cosenza, Calabria. In his youth he was educated by the Franciscan friars in Paola. His parents, having remained childless for some years after their marriage, had recourse to prayer and especially commended themselves to the intercession of Francis of Assisi, after whom they named their first-born son. Two other children were eventually born to them. When still in the cradle, Francis suffered from a swelling which endangered the sight of one of his eyes. His parents again had recourse to Francis of Assisi and made a vow that their son should pass an entire year wearing the \\"little habit\\" of St Francis in one of the friaries of his Order, a not-uncommon practice in the Middle Ages. The child subsequently recovered. At the age of 13, being admonished by a vision of a Franciscan friar, he entered a friary of the Franciscan Order to fulfill the vow made by his parents. At the completion of the year he went with his parents on a pilgrimage to Assisi, Rome, and other places of devotion. Returning to Paola, he selected a secluded cave on his father's estate and there lived in solitude; but later on he found an even-more secluded cave on the sea coast. Here he remained alone for about six years, giving himself to prayer and mortification.Foley O.F.M., Leonard, \\"St.Francis of Paola\\", Saint of the Day: Lives, Lessons, and Feasts (rev. Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media Minim Friars Saint Francis of Paola, painting by Jean Bourdichon, 1507. In 1435 two companions joined him in his retreat, and to accommodate them Francis caused three cells and a chapel to be built: in this way the new order was begun. By 1436, he and two followers began a movement that would become the foundation of the Hermits of Saint Francis of Assisi, which would later be renamed as the Minim friars. Their name refers to their role as the \\"least of all the faithful\\". Humility was to be the hallmark of the brothers as it had been in Francis' personal life. Abstinence from meat and other animal products became a \\"fourth vow\\" of his religious order, along with the traditional vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Francis instituted the continual, year- round observance of this diet in an effort to revive the tradition of fasting during Lent, which many Roman Catholics had ceased to practice by the 15th century. The rule of life adopted by Francis and his religious was one of extraordinary severity. He felt that heroic mortification was necessary as a means for spiritual growth. They were to seek to live unknown and hidden from the world. The number of his disciples gradually increased, and about 1454, with the permission of Pyrrhus, Archbishop of Cosenza, Francis built a large monastery and church. The building of this monastery was the occasion of a great outburst of enthusiasm and devotion on the part of the people towards Francis: even the nobles carried stones and joined in the work. Their devotion was increased by the many miracles which Francis wrought in answer to their prayers. In 1474 Pope Sixtus IV gave him permission to write a rule for his community, and to assume the title of Hermits of St. Francis: this rule was formally approved by Pope Alexander VI, who, however, changed their title into that of \\"Minims\\". After the approbation of the order, Francis founded several new monasteries in Calabria and Sicily. He also established monasteries of nuns, and a third order for people living in the world, after the example of Francis of Assisi. He was no respecter of persons based solely on their worldly rank or position. He rebuked the King of Naples for his ill-doing and in consequence suffered persecution. France When King Louis XI of France was in his last illness, he sent an embassy to Calabria to beg Francis to visit him. Francis refused to come until the pope ordered him to go. Embarking at Ostia, he landed in France, and cured many sick of the plague in Provence as he passed. He then went to the king at his residence, the Ch√¢teau de Plessis-lez-Tours (now within the village of La Riche), and was with him at his death. He became a tutor of the heir, Charles VIII, who kept him near the court and frequently consulted him.Royal and Republican Sovereignty in Early Modern Europe (Ragnhild Marie Hatton et al., eds.) Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 317 This king built a monastery for the Minims there near the chateau at Plessis and another at Rome on the Pincian Hill. Francis also influenced many in the French church, particularly Jan Standonck, who founded the Coll√®ge de Montaigu along what he thought were Minimist lines. The regard in which Charles VIII held him was shared by Louis XII, who succeeded to the French throne in 1498. Francis was now eager to return to Italy, but the king would not permit him, not wishing to lose his counsels and direction. Francis spent the last three months of his life in entire solitude, preparing for death. On Holy Thursday of 1507 he gathered his community around him and exhorted them especially to have mutual charity amongst themselves and to maintain the rigour of their life and in particular perpetual abstinence. The next day, Good Friday, he again called them together and gave them his last instructions and appointed a Vicar General. He then received the last rites and asked to have the Passion according to St. John read out to him, and whilst this was being read, he died on 2 April 1507, almost a week after his 91st birthday, in Plessis.

Francis followed a diet not only free from animal flesh, but also from all animal- derived foods, such as eggs and dairy products.Dr. Holly Roberts, Vegetarian Christian Saints, Anjeli Press, 2004, p. 146. One of the vows of the order he founded was the abstinence from meat, fish, eggs, butter, cheese and milk.F. L. Cross (ed.), The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, Oxford University Press, third edition, 1997, p. 1090.Cohn-Sherbok, Lavinia. (1998). Who's Who in Christianity. Routledge. p. 95.

Oxford University Press. p. 291. The two major movements in this order were humility and non-violence. The word \\"Minim\\" refers to living as the smallest or least, or embracing humility, simplicity, and plainness. The call to non-violence and absence of cruelty was expressed through not doing harm to any creature.\\"Our Founders\\", The Hermits of St. Francis Gift of prophecy It was believed that Francis was favored with the gift of prophecy. He apparently foretold to several persons, in the years 1447, 1448, and 1449, the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, which happened on 29 May 1453, under the command of Mahomet II, when Constantine Palaeologus, the last Christian emperor, was killed in battle.Butler, Rev. Alban, \\"St. Francis Of Paola, Confessor, Founder Of The Order Of Minims\\", The Lives or the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints, Vol. IV, D. & J. Sadlier, & Company, 1864 He also predicted the capture of Otranto by the Ottoman Turks in 1480, and its subsequent recovery by the King of Naples. Theodoor van Thulden painted a mystic episode that was said to have occurred over a century earlier. It depicts Francis of Paola, who was revered in France because he visited the country in 1482, at the bedside of Louise of Savoy to announce that she will give birth to the next king of France, the future Francis I. In 1515, King Louis XII died without a male heir and the throne went to Francis I, of the royal family's Valois-Angoul√™me branch. Louise of Savoy and her spouse, the Count of Angoul√™me, who is almost certainly the figure depicted to the left of the bed, decided to name the child Francis in honor of the saint.\\"Saint Francis of Paola Prophesying the Birth of a Son to Louise of Savoy\\", Louvre Legends According to a famous story, in the year 1464, he was refused passage by a boatman while trying to cross the Strait of Messina to Sicily. He reportedly laid his cloak on the water, tied one end to his staff as a sail, and sailed across the strait with his companions following in the boat.\\"The Vision of Saint Francis of Paola\\", The J.Paul Getty Museum The second of Franz Liszt's \\"Legendes\\" (for solo piano) describes this story in music. After his nephew died, the boy's mother‚ÄîFrancis' own sister‚Äîappealed to Francis for comfort, and filled his apartment with lamentations. After the Mass and divine office had been said for the repose of his soul, Francis ordered the corpse to be carried from the church into his cell, where he continued praying until, to her great astonishment, the boy's life was restored and Francis presented him to his mother in perfect health. The young man entered his order and is the celebrated Nicholas Alesso who afterwards followed his uncle into France, and was famous for sanctity and many great actions. 'Nzuddha, typical honey calabrian cake. There are several stories about his compassion for animals, and how he gave back life to animals that were killed to be eaten.Burns and Oates, The Church and Kindness to Animals, 1906, pp. 123-127. For example, a biographer writes: \\"Francis had a favorite trout that he called ‚ÄòAntonella‚Äô. One day, one of the priests, who provided religious services, saw the trout swimming about in his pool. To him it was just a delicious dish, so he caught it and took it home, tossing it into the frying pan. Francis missed ‚ÄòAntonella‚Äô and realized what had happened. He asked one of his followers to go to the priest to get it back. The priest, annoyed by this great concern for a mere fish, threw the cooked trout on the ground, shattering it into several pieces. The hermit sent by Francis gathered up the broken pieces in his hands and brought them back to Francis. Francis placed the pieces back in the pool and, looking up to Heaven and praying, said: ‚ÄòAntonella, in the name of Charity, return to life.‚Äô The trout immediately became whole and swam joyously around his pool as if nothing had happened. The friars and the workers who witnessed this miracle were deeply impressed by the miracle.\\" Francis also raised his pet lamb from the dead after it had been killed and eaten by workmen. \\"Being in need of food, the workmen caught and slaughtered Francis‚Äô pet lamb, Martinello, roasting it in their lime kiln. They were eating when Francis approached them, looking for the lamb. They told him they had eaten it, having no other food. He asked what they had done with the fleece and the bones. They told him they had thrown them into the furnace. Francis walked over to the furnace, looked into the fire and called ‚ÄòMartinello, come out!‚Äô The lamb jumped out, completely untouched, bleating happily on seeing his master.\\" Francis of Paola called the animals by their names even after their lives had ended. He apparently believed they continued to exist after their deaths.Simi & Segreti, St. Francis of Paola, Rockford, IL: Tan Books, 1977, p. 26. Legacy and veneration Pope Leo X canonized him in 1519. He is considered to be a patron saint of boatmen, mariners, and naval officers. His liturgical feast day is celebrated by the Roman Catholic Church on April 2nd, the day on which he died. In 1963, Pope John XXIII designated him as the patron saint of Calabria. Though his miracles were numerous, he was canonized for his humility and discernment in blending the contemplative life with the active one. The Order of Minims does not seem at any time to have been very extensive, but they had houses in many countries. The definitive rule was approved in 1506 by Pope Julius II, who also approved a rule for the nuns of the Order. A Third Order of their movement was also approved. The most noted member of this Order was the illustrious French bishop, Francis de Sales. Although the Minim order lost many of its monasteries in the 18th century during the French Revolution, it continues to exist, primarily in Italy. In 1562, a group of Protestant Huguenots in France broke open his tomb and found Francis' body incorrupt. They dragged it forth, burned it and scattered the bones, which were recovered by Catholic faithful and distributed as relics to various churches of his order. Devotion of the Thirteen Fridays Pope Clement XII, in the brief Coelestium Munerum Dispensatio of 2 December 1738, promulgated an indulgence to all the faithful who, upon 13 Fridays continuously preceding the Feast of St. Francis of Paola (2 April), or at any other time of the year, shall, in honor of Francis, visit a church of the Minims and pray there for the church. In this brief, mention is made of a devotion which originated with Francis himself, who, on each of 13 Fridays, used to recite 13 Pater Nosters (Our Fathers) and as many Ave Marias (Hail Marys), and this devotion he promulgated by word of mouth and by letter to his own devout followers, as an efficacious means of obtaining from God the graces they desired, provided they were for the greater good of their souls.

It is separated into three major basins and two associated watersheds for Lake George and the Ocklawaha River, all managed by the St. Johns River Water Management District. Although Florida was the location of the first permanent European settlement in what would become the United States, much of Florida remained an undeveloped frontier into the 20th century. With the growth of population, the St. Johns, like many Florida rivers, was altered to make way for agricultural and residential centers, suffering severe pollution and redirection that has diminished its ecosystem. The St. Johns, named one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998, was number 6 on a list of America's Ten Most Endangered Rivers in 2008.Ball, David (April 14, 2008).St. Johns River Makes 'Endangered' List, Jacksonville Financial and Daily Record, Retrieved on July 17, 2009. Restoration efforts are underway for the basins around the St. Johns as Florida's population continues to increase. Historically, a variety of people have lived on or near the St. Johns, including Paleo-indians, Archaic people, Timucua, Mocama, French, Spanish, and British colonists, Seminoles, slaves and freemen, Florida crackers, land developers, tourists and retirees. It has been the subject of William Bartram's journals, Harriet Beecher Stowe's letters home, and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' books. In the year 2000, 3.5 million people lived within the various watersheds that feed into the St. Johns River.Belleville, p. xxi.  Geography and ecology  Starting in Brevard County and meeting the Atlantic Ocean at Duval County, the St. Johns is Florida's primary commercial and recreational waterway. It flows north from its headwaters, originating in the direction of the Lake Wales Ridge, which is only slightly elevated at above sea level. Because of this low elevation drop, the river has a long backwater. It ebbs and flows with tides that pass through the barrier islands and up the channel.McCarthy, p. 2. Uniquely, it shares the same regional terrain as the parallel Kissimmee River, although the Kissimmee flows south.  Upper basin  The St. Johns River is separated into three basins and two associated watersheds managed by the St. Johns River Water Management District. Because the river flows in a northerly direction, the upper basin is located in the headwaters of the river at its southernmost point.\\"Fact Sheet: A Story of the St. Johns River: The Big Picture\\", St. Johns River Water Management District (May 3, 2007).The St. Johns is frequently cited as being a rare north-flowing river in North America (Benke & Chusing, p. 100; Randazzo, p. 12), though most rivers in Canada and in parts of the United States drain north (Verdin, K. L. (March 19, 2010). \\"A System for Topologically Coding Global Drainage Basins and Stream Networks\\" , ESRI; Gonzalez, M. A. (2003). \\"Continental Divides in North Dakota and North America\\", North Dakota Geological Survey Newsletter 30 (1), pp. 1‚Äì7; ). Indian River County is where the river begins as a network of marshes, at a point west of Vero Beach aptly named the St. Johns Marsh in central Florida. The St. Johns River is a blackwater stream, meaning that it is fed primarily by swamps and marshes lying beneath it; water seeps through the sandy soil and collects in a slight valley.Whitney, p. 216. The upper basin measures approximately ; the St. Johns transforms into a navigable waterway in Brevard County. The river touches on the borders of Osceola and Orange Counties, and flows through the southeast tip of Seminole County, transitioning into its middle basin a dozen miles (19 km) or so north of Titusville. The upper basin of the St. Johns was significantly lowered in the 1920s with the establishment of the Melbourne Tillman drainage project. This drained the St. Johns' headwaters eastward to the Indian River through canals dug across the Ten-Mile Ridge near Palm Bay. As of 2015, these past diversions are being partially reversed through the first phase of the Canal 1 Rediversion project. The river is at its narrowest and most unpredictable in this basin. Channel flows are not apparent and are usually unmarked. The most efficient way to travel on this part of the river is by airboat. Approximately 3,500 lakes lie within the overall St. Johns watershed; all are shallow, with maximum depths between .Benke and Cushing, p. 100.Belleville, p. 14. The river flows into many of the lakes, which further confuses navigation. Eight larger lakes and five smaller ones lie in the upper basin; one of the first is named Lake Hell 'n Blazes (sometimes polished to read as Lake Helen or Hellen Blazes),Cabell, p. 10. referencing oaths yelled by boatmen and fishermen in the early 19th century, frustrated when trying to navigate through floating islands of macrophytes, or muck and weeds, as the islands changed location with the creeping flow.McCarthy, pp. 5‚Äì6. Lakes Washington, Winder, and Poinsett‚Äî named for Joel Roberts Poinsett, a diplomat who brought the poinsettia to the United States‚Äî are located further along this stretch of the river. The northernmost points of the upper basin contain the Tosohatchee Wildlife Management Area, created in 1977 to assist with filtration of waters flowing into the larger St. Johns.McCarthy, pp. 10‚Äì11. Cypress trees in the Tosohatchee Wildlife Management Area showing dark water marks on the flared trunks, evidence of water level flux Wetlands in the upper and middle basin are fed by rainwater, trapped by the structure of the surrounding land. It is an oxygen- and nutrient-poor environment; what grows usually does so in peat which is created by centuries of decaying plant material.Whitney, pp. 128‚Äì130. Water levels fluctuate with the subtropical wet and dry seasons. Rain in central and north Florida occurs seasonally during summer and winter, but farther south rain in winter is rare.Whitney, p. 156. All plants in these basins must tolerate water fluctuation, both flooding and drought. Sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), cypress (Taxodium), and swamp tupelo (Nyssa biflora) trees often find great success in this region on raised land called hammocks. Trees that live in water for long periods usually have buttressed trunks, tangled, braided roots, or protrusions like cypress knees to obtain oxygen when under water, but the majority of plant life is aquatic. Wetland staples include the American white waterlily (Nymphaea odorata), pitcher plants, and Virginia iris (Iris virginica). In the southernmost points of the river, Cladium, or sawgrass, grows in vast swaths of wet prairie that at one time extended into the Everglades.Belleville, pp. 11‚Äì12. These wetland flora are remarkably successful in filtering pollutants that otherwise find their way into the river.Whitney, pp. 132‚Äì133.  Middle basin  Sanford shows a narrow channel with large areas of aquatic plants and wetlands. For the river passes through a basin fed primarily by springs and stormwater runoff. This basin, spreading throughout Orange, Lake, Volusia, and Seminole Counties, is home to the greater Orlando metropolitan area, where two million people live and major tourist attractions are located.The Middle St. Johns River Basin St. Johns River Water Management District Projects in Central Florida, St. Johns River Water Management District (February 2009). The topography of the middle basin varies between clearly distinguishable banks along the river and broad, shallow lakes. Two of the largest lakes in the middle basin are created by the river: Lake Harney and Lake Monroe. The shallow Lake Harney is fed by the long narrow Puzzle Lake; immediately north is the Econlockhatchee River, which joins to increase the volume of the St. Johns to where navigation becomes easier for larger boats. The river veers west, touching on Lake Jesup before it empties into Lake Monroe, passing the city of Sanford. It is at this point that the St. Johns' navigable waterway, dredged and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with channel markers maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard, begins. Lake Monroe, a large lake at with an average depth of , drains a surrounding watershed of .McCarthy, p. 20. Sanford has adapted to the lake by building some of its downtown area on the waterfront; citizens use boat transportation and Sanford's public dock to commute into town.McCarthy, p. 22. Optimally an deep channel about wide after leaving Lake Monroe, the St. Johns meets its most significant tributary in the middle basin, the spring-fed Wekiva River, discharging approximately a day into the St. Johns.Cabell, pp. 11‚Äì12. Near this confluence are the towns of DeBary and Deltona. Forests surrounding the Wekiva River are home to the largest black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus) population in Florida; several troops of Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) have adapted to live near the river as well. The monkeys' introduction to Florida is unclear; they were reportedly brought either to serve in backdrop scenes of Tarzan movies filmed around the Silver River in the 1930s, or to lend an air of authenticity to \\"jungle cruises\\" provided by an enterprising boat operator around the same time.McCarthy, p. 26.Hamaker, Elaine (January 6, 1989). \\"Silver Springs' Monkey Colony Will Remain\\", The Ocala Star-Banner, p. 2B.Belleville, pp. 71‚Äì72. St. Johns River near Blue Spring State Park showing more distinct banks and trees instead of marshes Of most vital importance to marshes are invertebrate animals, the foundation of food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations.Whitney, p. 158. Mosquitos, born in water, are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.Whitney, p. 159. Of vertebrates, numerous species of frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most of these animals are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin.The St. Johns River: Nominated as an American Heritage River , Environmental Protection Agency (Part 2).

The river turns north again as it rolls through a basin spreading across Putnam, Lake, and Marion Counties, and the western part of Volusia County. Slightly north of the Wekiva River is Blue Spring, the largest spring on the St. Johns, producing over a day.McCarthy, p. 28. Florida springs stay at an even temperature of throughout the year. Because of this, Blue Spring is the winter home for West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris), and they are protected within Blue Spring State Park. Manatees are large, slow-moving herbivorous aquatic mammals whose primary threats are human development and collisions with swiftly moving watercraft. Many parts of the St. Johns and its tributaries are no-wake zones to protect manatees from being critically or fatally injured by boat propellers.Florida Manatee Management Plan Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (December 2007).

Prior to the civil war, Pearson ran a successful health resort in Orange Springs. After the civil war Pearson's Orange Springs resort declined in popularity due to the increasing attention to nearby Silver Springs‚Äîthe source of the Silver River‚Äîat the turn of the 20th century, popularizing the Ocklawaha.

The river gave Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings access to the St. Johns from her homestead at Orange Lake. The region served as a major fishing attraction until a decline in water quality occurred in the 1940s, and since then further degradation of the river and its sources have occurred. In particular, Lake Apopka earned the designation of Florida's most polluted lake following a chemical spill in 1980 that dumped DDE in it.Marino, G.

The proliferation of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in central Florida is a major attraction for fishermen from all over the country. The St. Johns is home to 183 species of fish, 55 of which appear in the main stem of the river. One, the southern tessellated darter (Etheostoma olmstedi) is found only in the Ocklawaha.Whitney, p. 225. Some are marine species that either migrate upriver to spawn or have found spring-fed habitats that are high in salinity, such as a colony of Atlantic stingrays (Dasyatis sabina) that live in Lake Washington in the upper basin. Ocean worms, snails, and white-fingered mud crabs (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) have also been found far upriver where tidal influences are rare.Belleville, pp. 36‚Äì37. In contrast, American eels (Anguilla rostrata) live in the St. Johns and Ocklawaha and spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. After a year living in the ocean, many of them find their way back to the St. Johns to live, then, prompted by the phases of the moon, make the return journey to spawn and die.Belleville, pp. 92‚Äì93.  Lower basin  From the intersection of the Ocklawaha River, to the Atlantic Ocean, the St. Johns lies within the lower basin, draining a total area of in Putnam, St. Johns, Clay, and Duval Counties.

Both Palatka and Green Cove Springs have been popular tourist destinations in the past. Several smaller locations along the river sprang up around ferry landings, but when rail lines and then Interstate highways were constructed closer to the Atlantic Coast, many of the towns experienced significant economic decline, and ferry landings were forgotten.McCarthy, pp. 88‚Äì100. The final of the river's course runs through Jacksonville with a population of more than a million. Much of the economic base of Jacksonville depends on the river: of goods are shipped in and out of Jacksonville annually. Exports include paper, phosphate, fertilizers, and citrus, while major imports include oil, coffee, limestone, cars, and lumber.Bourgerie, Richard.

The Port of Jacksonville produces $1.38 billion in the local economy and supports 10,000 jobs. The U.S. Navy has two bases in the Jacksonville area: Naval Station Mayport, at the mouth of the river, serves as the second largest Atlantic Fleet operation and home port in the country. Naval Air Station Jacksonville is one of the service's largest air installations, home to two air wings and over 150 fixed-wing and rotary- wing aircraft, and the host for one of only two full-fledged Naval Hospitals remaining in Florida.

Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.Young, pp. 65‚Äì71. Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge.Whitney, pp. 303‚Äì304. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.Whitney, p. 310. Although freshwater invertebrates inhabiting and comprising algae and periphyton make the foundation of food webs in the middle and lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding on the bottom of the river and ocean floors.Whitney, pp. 313‚Äì319. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city.

Formation and hydrology  Florida platform (outer boundary) as it appeared the first time humans inhabited the peninsula  Geologic history  Lying within a coastal plain, the St. Johns River passes through an area that was at one time barrier islands, coastal dunes, and estuary marshes. The Florida Peninsula was created primarily by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a basement of igneous granite and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the Paleozoic era 542 to 251 million years ago. During the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by calcium carbonate and formations left by the evaporation of water called evaporites.Randazzo and Jones, pp. 13‚Äì25. What covers the peninsula is the result of simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather.Randazzo and Jones, pp. 1‚Äì3. As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into limestone; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by swales. As ocean water retreated, lagoons formed in the swales, which were further eroded by acidic water.Randazzo and Jones, p. 4. Barrier islands, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river. From its origins to approximately the area of Sanford, the St. Johns flows north.Randazzo and Jones, p. 12. It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles‚Äîwhich is referred to as the St. Johns River offset, but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west- flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late Tertiary or early Pleistocene era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the offset. Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by Pangaean rifting.Randazzo and Jones, p. 217.  Springs and aquifers  The hydrologic cycle in Florida, showing the Floridan aquifer and formation of springs and sinkholes All of Florida's abundant fresh water is the result of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers.Randazzo and Jones, p. 69. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible in the northern part of Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.Randazzo and Jones, p. 82. Acidic rainwater erodes the limestone and can form caverns. When the overlay of these caverns is particularly thin‚Äîless than ‚Äîsinkholes can form. Where the limestone or sand/clay overlay dissolves over the aquifer and the pressure of the water pushes out, springs form. The upper and middle basins of the St. Johns River are located in a portion of the peninsula where the aquifer system is thinly confined, meaning springs and sinkholes are abundant. Springs are measured in magnitude of how much water is discharged, which is dependent upon season and rainfall. The greatest discharge is from first magnitude springs that emit at least of water per second.

In summer months, the temperature ranges from , and between in the winter, although drops may occur in winter months to below freezing approximately a dozen times. Water temperatures in the river correlate to the air temperatures. The average range of water temperatures is between , rising in the summer months. Where the river widens between Palatka and Jacksonville, wind becomes a significant factor in navigation, and both whitecap waves and calm surface waters are common.Young, p. 71. Rain occurs more frequently in late summer and early fall. Tropical storms and nor'easters are common occurrences along the Atlantic coast of Florida; the St. Johns River lies between inland, so any storm striking the counties of Indian River north to Duval produces rain that is drained by the St. Johns River. Tropical Storm Fay in 2008 deposited of rain in a 5-day period, most of it located near Melbourne. The St. Johns near Geneva in Seminole County rose in four days, setting a record. The river near Sanford rose in 36 hours. Fay caused severe flooding in the middle basin due not only to the deluge but the flat slopes of the river.Quilian, Wylie, and Whitin, Bret (April 2009). \\"An Analysis of the Hydrologic and Hydraulic Factors During Flooding on the St. Johns River Caused by Tropical Storm Fay\\", National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

Flow rates and water quality  Fog on a calm St. Johns River at the Shands Bridge near Green Cove Springs The entire river lies within the nearly flat Pamlico terrace, giving it an overall gradient of per mile (km); it is one of the flattest major rivers on the continent. Its proximity to the ocean in the lower basin affects its rise and fall with tides and salinity. Tides regularly affect water levels as far south as Lake George; when combined with extreme winds, the river's tidal effects can extend to Lake Monroe away and have on occasion reached Lake Harney. Tides typically raise the river level about at Jacksonville, decreasing some to at Orange Park where the river widens, and increasing back to at Palatka as it narrows. As a result of tidal effects, discharge measurements in the lower basin are often inaccurate. However, the estimated rate of discharge between the Ocklawaha River and the center of Jacksonville ranges from per second. The nontidal discharge at the mouth at Mayport averages per second, but with tides it exceeds per second, and following heavy rains combined with tides can top per second. Farther upriver, the discharge rate ranges from per second near Lake Poinsett to per second near DeLand. The confluence of numerous springs, the Econlockhatchee River, and the Wekiva River causes the average discharge to increase by per second between Lake Harney and DeLand, representing the greatest annual average increase of streamflow along the St. Johns. As distance between the mouth of the St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the salinity in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35 parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2 ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40 ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9 ppt and falls again to 0.81 ppt at the Shands Bridge near Green Cove Springs.\\"Environmental Protection\\" (Power Point Presentation, slide 8), St. Johns River Water Management District, hosted at stjohnsriveralliance.com.

Dissolved oxygen in fresh water is measured to indicate the health of plant and animal life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5 mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of Christmas, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek. Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen. Like all blackwater streams in Florida, the color of most of the St. Johns is black, owing to the tannins in leaf litter and decaying aquatic plants. Spring fed streams, on the other hand, are remarkably clear and visibility is very high, even when the river bottom is dozens of feet below.Blue Spring, Volusia County: Minimum flow regime , St. Johns River Water Management District.

Human history = Pre-Columbian people  Humans arrived on the Florida Peninsula about 12,000 years ago when the ocean was about lower than today, and the peninsula was double its current size.Gannon, p. 1. These earliest people are called Paleo-Indians. They were primarily hunter‚Äìgatherers who followed large game, such as mastodons, horses, camels, and bison. Much of the land was far from water‚Äîmost fresh water was contained in glaciers and polar ice caps. As a result, Florida was an arid landscape with few trees, dominated by grasslands and scrub vegetation.Gannon, p. 2. An extremely rare Timucua owl totem, found buried in muck near Hontoon Island, on display at Fort Caroline National Memorial Around 9,000 years ago, the climate warmed, melting much of the polar ice caps and many glaciers, creating a wetter environment and submerging half the peninsular shelf. As Paleo-Indians now did not have to travel as far to find water, their camps became more permanent, turning into villages. With evidence of a wide variety of tools constructed around this time, archeologists note the transition into Archaic people. The Archaic people made tools from bone, animal teeth, and antlers. They wove fibers from plants such as cabbage palms and saw palmettos. A few burial sites have been excavated‚Äîincluding the Windover Archaeological Site in Brevard County near Titusville‚Äîthat provide evidence of burial rituals. Archaic peoples interred their dead in shallow peat marshes, which preserved much of the human tissue.Gannon, pp. 3‚Äì4. Further climate change between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago led to the Middle Archaic period; evidence suggests that human habitation near the St. Johns River first occurred during this era. Populations of indigenous people increased significantly at this time, and numerous settlements near the St. Johns have been recorded from this era; the banks of the St. Johns and its arteries are dotted with middens filled with thousands of shells, primarily those of Viviparus georgianus‚Äîa freshwater snail‚Äîand oysters.McCarthy, pp. 30‚Äì31.Miller, p. 68. The advent of regional types of pottery and stone tools made of flint or limestone marked further advancements around 500 BCE. The Archaic people transitioned into settled groups around Florida. From the central part of the state north, along the Atlantic Coast lived people in the St. Johns culture, named for the most significant nearby natural formation. Around 750 CE, the St. Johns culture learned to cultivate corn, adding to their diet of fish, game, and gourds. Archeologists and anthropologists date this agricultural advancement to coincide with a spread of archeological sites, suggesting that a population increase followed.Gannon, p. 6. When European explorers arrived in north Florida, they met the Timucua, numbering about 14,000, the largest group of indigenous people in the region.Tebeau, p. 16. The later Seminole people called the river Welaka or Ylacco. These forms may derive from the Creek wi-l√°ko, \\"big water\\", a compound usually applied to large rivers that run through lakes; the St. Johns forms and borders numerous lakes. Alternately, the Seminole name may derive from walaka (from wi-alaka, \\"water\\" and \\"coming\\"), perhaps a reference to the river's slow discharge and the tidal effects on it. The name is sometimes rendered as \\"Chain of Lakes\\" in English.Read, p. 39.Simpson, p. 130.Cabell, p. 4.  Colonial era  Replica of the French monument at Fort Caroline overlooking the St. Johns River Though the first European contact in Florida came in 1513 when Juan Ponce de Le√≥n arrived near Cape Canaveral, not until 1562 did Europeans settle the north Atlantic coast of the peninsula. Early Spanish explorers named the river Rio de Corientes (River of Currents). The St. Johns River became the first place colonized in the region and its first battleground: when French explorer Jean Ribault erected a monument south of the river's mouth to make the French presence known, it alarmed the Spanish who had been exploring the southern and western coast of the peninsula for decades.Gannon, pp. 41‚Äì46.Tebeau, pp. 29‚Äì35. Ribault was detained after he returned to Europe. In 1564, Ren√© Goulaine de Laudonni√®re arrived to build Fort Caroline at the mouth of the St. Johns River; they called the river Rivi√®re de Mai because they settled it on May 1.Gannon, p. 42. An artist named Jacques LeMoyne documented what he saw among the Timucuan people in 1564, portraying them as physically powerful and not lacking for provisions. Fort Caroline did not last long, though relations with the local Timucua and Mocamas were friendly. The colony was unable to support itself; some of the French deserted. Those who remained were killed in 1565 by the Spanish, led by Pedro Men√©ndez, when they marched north from St. Augustine and captured Fort Caroline. The river was renamed San Mateo by the Spanish in honor of the Apostle Matthew, whose feast was the following day. Capturing Fort Caroline allowed the Spanish to maintain control of the river. The French and Spanish continued to spar over who would control the natural resources and native peoples of the territory. The Timucua, who had initially befriended the French, were not encouraged to make the Spanish allies because of colonial governor Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s' abhorrence of French Protestantism and his view that the Timucuan beliefs were \\"Satanic\\".Gannon, p. 49. By 1573, the Timucua were in outright rebellion, testing the governor's patience and forcing Spanish settlers to abandon farms and garrisons in more interior parts of Florida; the Spanish could not persuade the Timucua to keep from attacking them.Gannon, p. 57. Over a hundred years later, missionaries had more success, setting up posts along the river. Spanish Franciscan missionaries gave the river its current name based on San Juan del Puerto (St. John of the Harbor), the mission established at the river's mouth following the demise of the French fort. The name first appeared on a Spanish map created between 1680 and 1700.Cabell, p. 8. The Timucua, as other groups of indigenous people in Florida, began to lose cohesion and numbers by the 18th century.In 1717, some of the groups were reorganized by the colonial governor; 248 Timucua were counted. The restructuring also included Yamasee, Mocama, Apalachee, and Guale: in total no more than 1,500 Indians remained in north Florida. Disease and violent conflicts with the Spanish and other tribes continued to decrease their numbers, and by 1763, 100 of the last remaining indigenous people of Florida chose to be relocated to Cuba with the Spanish. (Gannon, p. 94.) A tribe located in modern-day Georgia and Alabama called the Creeks assisted with this; in 1702, they joined with the Yamasee and attacked some of the Timucua, forcing them to seek protection from the Spanish who forced them into slavery.Gannon, p. 186. The Creeks began assimilating other people and spread farther south until they were known by 1765 as Seminoles by the British, a term adapted from cimarrones that meant \\"runaways\\" or \\"wild ones\\".Gannon, p. 183. The Seminoles employed a variety of languages from the peoples the Creeks had assimilated: Hitchiti, Muskogee, as well as Timucua. Between 1716 and 1767, the Seminoles gradually moved into Florida and began to break ties with the Creeks to become a cohesive tribe of their own.Gannon, p. 187. The St. Johns provided a natural boundary to separate European colonies on the east bank and indigenous lands west of the river.Miller, pp. 152‚Äì153. William Bartram's sketch of alligators on the St. Johns, created either in 1773 or 1774 After Florida came under the Kingdom of Great Britain's jurisdiction in 1763, Quaker father and son naturalists John and William Bartram explored the length of the river while visiting the southeastern United States from 1765 to 1766. They published journals describing their experiences and the plants and animals they observed. They were charged by King George III to find the source of the river they called the Picolata or San Juan, and measured its widths and depths, taking soil samples as they traveled southward.Bartram, John and Harper, Francis (December 1942). \\"Diary of a Journey through the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida from July 1, 1765, to April 10, 1766\\", Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series, 33, (1) pp. i-120. William returned to Florida from 1773 to 1777 and wrote another journal about his travels, while he collected plants and befriended the Seminoles who called him \\"Puc Puggy\\" (flower hunter).Belleville, p. 46. William's visit took him as far south as Blue Spring, where he remarked on the crystal clear views offered by the spring water: \\"The water is perfectly diaphanous, and here are continually a prodigious number and variety of fish; they appear as plain as though lying on a table before your eyes, although many feet deep in the water.\\"McCarthy, p. 32. Bartram's journals attracted the attention of such prominent Americans as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton.Cabell, p. 105. The success of these journals inspired other naturalists such as Andr√© Michaux to further explore the St. Johns, as he did in 1788, sailing from Palatka south to Lake Monroe, and gave names to some of the plants described by the Bartrams' journals. Michaux was followed by William Baldwin between 1811 and 1817. Subsequent explorers, including John James Audubon, have carried William's Travels Through North & South Carolina, Georgia, East & West Florida with them as a guide.Belleville, p. xiv. In 1795, Florida was transferred back to Spain which lured Americans with cheap land. A former loyalist to Britain who left South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, a planter and slave trader named Zephaniah Kingsley seized the opportunity and built a plantation named Laurel Grove near what is now Doctors Lake, close to the west bank of the St. Johns River, south of where Orange Park is today.Schafer, p. 21. Three years later, Kingsley took a trip to Cuba and purchased a 13-year-old Wolof girl named Anna Madgigine Jai. She became his common-law wife, and managed Laurel Grove while Kingsley traveled and conducted business.Schafer, pp. 23‚Äì27. The plantation grew citrus and sea island cotton (Gossypium barbadense). In 1814, they moved to a larger plantation on Fort George Island, where they lived for 25 years, and owned several other plantations and homesteads in what is today Jacksonville and another on Drayton Island at the north end of Lake George. Kingsley later married three other freed women in a polygamous relationship;May, Philip S. (January 1945). \\"Zephaniah Kingsley, Nonconformist\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly 23 (3), p. 145‚Äì159. Spanish- controlled Florida allowed interracial marriages, and white landowners such as James Erwin, George Clarke, Francisco S√°nchez, John Fraser, and Francis Richard, Jr.‚Äîearly settlers along the river‚Äîall were married to or in extramarital relationships with African women.Schafer, pp. 30‚Äì31.  Territorial Florida and statehood  Map of the lower St. Johns printed in 1876 The first years following Florida's annexation to the United States in 1821 were marked with violent conflicts between white settlers and Seminoles, whose bands often included runaway African slaves. The clashes between American and Seminole forces during the establishment of the Florida territory are reflected in the towns and landmarks along the St. Johns named for those who were directly involved. Even before Florida was under U.S. jurisdiction, Major General Andrew Jackson was responsible for removing the Alachua Seminoles west of the Suwannee River, either killing them or forcing them farther south towards Lake County, in 1818. Jackson's efforts became the First Seminole War, and were rewarded by the naming of a cattle crossing across a wide portion of the St. Johns near the Georgia border‚Äîpreviously named Cowford‚Äîto Jacksonville. The result of Jackson's offensive was the transfer of Florida to the U.S.Gannon, pp. 191‚Äì192.Lake Monroe on the St. Johns was named for President James Monroe, who persuaded the U.S. government to finance the First Seminole War. As American settlers trickled in to farms and homesteads in north and central Florida, they came into increased conflict with several Seminole bands for food and sometimes took the Seminoles as slaves. The Treaty of Moultrie Creek in 1823 placed Seminoles on a reservation near Lake Okeechobee, but further U.S. policy strongly encouraged them to leave Florida for Indian Territory in what would become Oklahoma. (Tebeau, p. 156.) by 1835, the Seminoles rebelled, inspired and led by Osceola, whose name is one of the most widely used for landmarks and structures in the state. (McCarthy, p. 17.) Lake Jesup's namesake is the American military leader in Florida, Major General Thomas Jesup, who captured Osceola in 1837. Lake Harney was named for Brigadier General William S. Harney, who led several raids against Seminoles in west and south Florida. (McCarthy, p. 12.) Following the Seminole Wars, a gradual increase in commerce and population occurred on the St. Johns, made possible by steamship travel. Steamboats heralded a heyday for the river, and before the advent of local railroads, they were the only way to reach interior portions of the state. They also afforded the citizens of Jacksonville a pastime to watch competing races.Cabell, pp. 237‚Äì250. By the 1860s, weekly trips between Jacksonville, Charleston, and Savannah were made to transport tourists, lumber, cotton, and citrus. The soil along the St. Johns was considered especially successful for producing sweeter oranges.Cabell, p. 242. Florida's involvement in the U.S. Civil War was limited compared to other Confederate states because it had a fraction of the populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida's role in the Civil War was the sinking of the , a Union paddle steamer used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces under the command of Capt. John Jackson Dickison captured, burned, and sank the USS Columbine, making her perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy.McCarthy, pp. 75‚Äì76.Cabell, pp. 213‚Äì215. The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sank a Union boat, the Maple Leaf, which struck a floating keg filled with explosives and settled into the muck near Julington Creek, south of Jacksonville. Part of the shipwreck was recovered in 1994, when it was discovered that many Civil War- era artifacts, including daguerreotypes and wooden matches, had been preserved in the river muck.McCarthy, pp. 111‚Äì112. Although the Spanish had colonized Florida for two centuries, the state remained the last part of the east coast of the United States to be developed and explored. Following the Civil War, the State of Florida was too far in debt to build roads and rail lines to further its progress. Florida Governor William Bloxham in 1881 appealed directly to a Pennsylvania-based industrialist named Hamilton Disston, initially to build canals to improve steamboat passage through the Caloosahatchee River, and later to drain lands in the central part of the state for agriculture. Disston was furthermore persuaded to purchase of land in central Florida for $1 million, which at the time was reported to be the largest purchase of land in human history. Disston was ultimately unsuccessful in his drainage attempts, but his investment sparked the tourist industry and made possible the efforts of railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to construct rail lines down the east coast of Florida, including a rail link between Sanford and Tampa. Disston was responsible for creating the towns of Kissimmee, St. Cloud, and several others on the west coast of Florida.Lemar, L. Stephan (January 1944). \\"Historico-Economic Aspects of Drainage in the Florida Everglades\\", Southern Economic Journal, 10 (3), pp. 197‚Äì211.Davis, T. Frederick (January 1939). \\"The Disston Land Purchase\\". The Florida Historical Quarterly, 17 (3): pp. 201‚Äì211. Stereoscopic view of Harriet Beecher Stowe's house in Mandarin A New York Times story reporting on Disston's progress in 1883 stated that before Disston's purchase and the subsequent development, the only places worth seeing in Florida were Jacksonville and St. Augustine, with perhaps an overnight trip on the St. Johns River to Palatka; by 1883 tourist attractions had extended south.\\"The Future of Florida\\", New York Times, (May 6, 1883), p. 3. More attention was paid to the St. Johns with the increasing population. Florida was portrayed as an exotic wonderland able to cure failing health with its water and citrus, and the region began to be highlighted in travel writings. To relieve his bronchitis, Ralph Waldo Emerson stayed briefly in St. Augustine, calling north Florida \\"a grotesque region\\" that was being swarmed by land speculators. Emerson poignantly disliked the public sale of slaves, adding to his overall distaste.Cabell, pp. 159‚Äì160. Following the Civil War, however, famed author Harriet Beecher Stowe lived near Jacksonville and traveled up the St. Johns, writing about it with affection: \\"The entrance of the St. Johns from the ocean is one of the most singular and impressive passages of scenery that we ever passed through: in fine weather the sight is magnificent.\\"Stowe, pp. 14‚Äì15. Her memoir Palmetto Leaves, published in 1873 as a series of her letters home, was very influential in luring northern residents to the state.Cabell, pp. 232‚Äì233. The results of introducing water hyacinths to Florida, sparking a state-led battle against the invasive plant One unforeseen aspect of more people coming to Florida proved to be an overwhelming problem. Water hyacinths, possibly introduced in 1884 by Mrs W. W. Fuller, who owned a winter home near Palatka, grow so densely that they are a serious invasive species. By the mid-1890s, the purple-flowered hyacinths had grown to reside in of the river and its arteries. The plants prevent the navigation of watercraft, fishing, and sunlight from reaching the depths of the river, affecting both plant and animal life. The government of Florida found the plants to be so vexing that it spent almost $600,000 between 1890 and 1930 in an unsuccessful bid to rid the creeks and rivers of north Florida of them.McCarthy, p. 4.Cabell, pp. 13‚Äì14.  Land boom  Progress of Fellsmere Farms in 1912 An Englishman named Nelson Fell, persuaded by Disston's advertisements to make his fortunes in Florida, arrived in the 1880s. An engineer by trade, Fell purchased near Lake Tohopekaliga to create a town named Narcoossee, which had a population of more than 200 English immigrants by 1888. A spate of poor luck and tense British-American relations followed, prompting Fell to spend some years investing in infrastructure in Siberia, but he returned in 1909 with ideas of developing wetlands in central Florida. He was further encouraged by the political promises of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward to drain the Everglades during his 1904 campaign. In 1910 Fell purchased of land for $1.35 an acre and started the Fellsmere Farms Company to drain the St. Johns Marsh in 1911 and send water into the Indian River Lagoon, promoting the engineered canals and other structures as wondrously efficient in providing land to build a massive metropolis.Belleville, p. 15. Some progress was made initially, including the establishment of the town of Fellsmere in which land was sold for $100 an acre, but sales lagged because of a scandal regarding land sale fraud and faulty draining reports from the Everglades. The company then found itself short of funds due to mismanagement. Torrential rains ruptured the newly constructed levees and dikes and forced the company by 1916 to go into receivership. Fell left Florida for Virginia in 1917.Patterson, Gordon (Summer, 1997). \\"Ditches and Dreams: Nelson Fell and the Rise of Fellsmere\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, 76 (1), pp. 1‚Äì20.Siewert, Walter A.

Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings used the St. Johns as a backdrop in her books South Moon Under and The Yearling, and several short stories. In 1933 she took a boat trip along the St. Johns with a friend. In the upper basin, she remarked on the difficulty of determining direction due to the river's ambiguous flow, and wrote in a chapter titled \\"Hyacinth Drift\\" in her memoir Cross Creek that she had the best luck in watching the way the hyacinths floated.Rawlings, pp. 354‚Äì370. Rawlings wrote, \\"If I could have, to hold forever, one brief place and time of beauty, I think I might choose the night on that high lonely bank above the St. Johns River.\\"Rawlings, p. 362.When Rawlings and her friend stopped in Sanford to purchase gasoline, a yacht owner offered to have his crew take her to town to buy it, but he was interrupted when his wife, resplendent in a \\"pink spectator sports costume\\", demanded he take her to church instead. As Rawlings left the dock at Sanford, her friend remarked, \\"The poor b‚Äî. I bet he'd give his silk shirt to go down the river with us instead of Pink Petticoats\\". (Rawlings, p. 366.) Florida in the 20th century experienced a massive migration into the state. Undeveloped land sold well and draining to reclaim wetlands has often gone unchecked, and often encouraged by government. The St. Johns headwaters decreased in size from to one between 1900 and 1972.Belleville, p. 4. Much of the land was reclaimed for urban use, but agricultural needs took their toll as fertilizers and runoff from cattle ranching washed into the St. Johns. Without wetlands to filter the pollutants, the chemicals stayed in the river and flushed into the Atlantic Ocean. Boaters destroyed the floating islands of muck and weeds in the upper basin with dynamite, causing the lakes to drain completely.Belleville, p. 21. A portion of the completed Cross Florida Barge Canal near Palatka What could have been the most serious human impact on nature in central Florida was the Cross Florida Barge Canal, an attempt to connect the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the state by channeling the Ocklawaha River, first authorized in 1933.Author and University of Florida professor Kevin McCarthy characterized the Cross Florida Barge Canal as \\"probably the single most dangerous threat to the water resources of the state in the twentieth century\\". (McCarthy, p. 76.) The canal was intended to be long, wide, and deep.Noll and Tegeder, pp. 21‚Äì22. Canal construction was top among the engineering priorities in the state, and by 1964 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction on the Cross Florida Barge Canal. Flood control was the primary impetus behind its construction, though the broader reasoning and feasibility of the project remained unclear. The Army Corps of Engineers was also constructing hundreds of miles of canals in the Everglades at the same time and by the 1960s was being accused of wasting tax money through its unnecessary construction projects.Noll and Tegeder, p. 29. In 1969 the Environmental Defense Fund filed suit in federal court to stop construction on the canal, citing irreparable harm that would be done to Florida waterways and the Floridan Aquifer, central and north Florida's fresh water source.Noll and Tegeder, pp. 34‚Äì35. A separate canal, the St. Johns-Indian River Barge Canal, was planned to link the river with the Intracoastal Waterway;\\"Need For Canal Is Stressed\\", Sarasota Herald-Tribune, September 21, 1963 the project never broke ground, and was canceled soon after the Cross Florida Barge Canal was suspended.\\"St. Johns-Indian River Canal Kaput\\", Daytona Beach Morning Journal, October 19, 1973  Restoration  Brevard and Indian River Counties When steamboats were superseded by the railroad, the river lost much of its significance to the state. The influx of immigrants to Florida settled primarily south of Orlando, adversely affecting the natural order of wetlands there.Belleville, pp. xxv‚Äìxxvi. Within the past 50 years, however, urban areas in the northern and central parts of the state have grown considerably. In the upper basin, population increased by 700 percent between 1950 and 2000, and is expected to rise another 1.5 million by 2020. Upper St. Johns River Watershed .

To assist with river cleanup and the associated funds for improving water quality in the St. Johns, Mayor John Delaney of Jacksonville waged a campaign to get it named as an American Heritage River, beginning in 1997.

Retrieved on July 19, 2009. The St. Johns River is under consideration as an additional water source to meet growing public water needs. In 2008, the river's Water Management District undertook a Water Supply Impact Study of the proposed water withdrawals and asked the National Research Council to review science aspects of the study as it progressed. This resulted in a series of four reports that assessed the impact of water withdrawal on river level and flow, reviewed potential impacts on wetland ecosystems, and presented overall perspectives on the Water Management District study.: Free National Research Council report PDF The National Research Council found that, overall, the District performed a competent job in relating predicted environmental responses, including their magnitude and general degree of uncertainty, to the proposed range of water withdrawals. However, the report noted that the District's final report should acknowledge such critical issues as include future sea-level rises, population growth, and urban development. Although the District predicted that changes in water management would increase water levels and flows that exceed the proposed surface water withdrawals, these predictions have high uncertainties. The report also noted concerns about the District's conclusion that the water withdrawals will have few deleterious ecological effects. This conclusion was based on the model findings that increased flows from upper basin projects and from changes in land use (increases in impervious areas) largely compensated for the impacts of water withdrawals on water flows and levels. Although the upper basin projects are positive insofar as they will return land to the basin (and water to the river), the same cannot be said about increased urban runoff, the poor quality of which is well known.

Headingley is the location of the Beckett Park campus of Leeds Beckett University and Headingley Stadium. The vast majority of the area sits in the Headingley and Hyde Park ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds North West parliamentary constituency. History The centre of Headingley The Original Oak, named after the Skyrack Oak which grew opposite.Wapentake. Terrace houses typical of the southern districts of Headingley. Headingley was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as Hedingelei or Hedingeleia when it was recorded that Ilbert de Lacy held 7 carucates (about 840 acres) of land. The name is thought to derive from Old English Head(d)inga 'of the descendants of Head(d)a' + lƒìah 'open ground', thus meaning \\"the clearing of Hedda's people\\".A. H. Smith, The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, English Place-Name Society, 30‚Äì37, 8 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961‚Äì63), IV 140. Headda has sometimes been identified with Saint H√¶dde. A stone coffin found near Beckett Park in 1995 suggests there may have been an earlier settlement in late Roman or post-Roman times. From Viking times, Headingley was the centre of the Skyrack wapentake or Siaraches, the \\"Shire oak\\". The name may refer to an oak tree that was a meeting place for settling legal disputes and raising armies. An ancient oak, said to be the Shire Oak, stood to the north of St Michael's Church until 1941, and gives its name to two public houses, the Original Oak and the Skyrack. During the 13th century William de Poiteven gave land in Headingley to Kirkstall Abbey, and in 1341 the remainder of the township of Headingley-cum-Burley was given to the monastery by the owner, John de Calverley. The shire oak in 1890. A map of 1711 shows Headingley as having a chapel, cottages and farmsteads scattered around a triangle of land formed by the merging of routes from north, west and south. Enclosed fields were situated around the settlement with a large tract of common land, Headingley Moor, to the north. In an 1801 census, Headingley's population was given as 300. An 1829 Act of Parliament enclosed Headingley Moor and the land was placed for sale. Around 30 workers' cottages encroached on the fringes of the moor before 1829. Land here was generally cheaper than that at Headingley Hill as it failed to attract the building of affluent villas. This brought about the building of smaller terraced housing around Moor Road and Cottage Road. In the mid 19th century, Far Headingley had begun to develop over what was largely unclaimed common land. Headingley was a village until the expansion of Leeds during the Industrial Revolution and became a popular suburb where the rich moved to escape the filth and pollution of the city. In 1840, Leeds Zoological and Botanical Gardens opened but despite the opening of the nearby Headingley railway station in 1849, the zoo was loss-making and closed in 1858. The bear pit survives on Cardigan Road. Meanwood Beck, to the east of the village, was a source of water for the early inhabitants and later provided a source of power for the Victorians of Leeds. The Leeds Tramway terminated at a depot at Far Headingley between 1875 and 1959. The trams improved the accessibility of Headingley from Leeds city centre, which facilitated growth and attracted affluent middle class inhabitants. The tramway perhaps ended Headingley's village status and made it into a suburb. With exception of Beckett Park and the surrounding area, most of Headingley had been developed by the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1911 census the population of Headingley was in excess of 46,000. Leeds Beckett University (formerly Leeds Metropolitan University) has a campus at Beckett Park in Headingley. Much of the housing around Kirkstall Lane is rented to students. The conversion of Leeds Polytechnic into a university and its subsequent growth brought about an increased student population. Headingley Stadium hosts England test matches and rugby league matches bringing many spectators to the area. The cricket ground has been enlarged to maintain its eligibility for test matches and in 2006 the eastern terraces on the rugby ground were replaced with the Carnegie stand. The winter shed cricket pavilion has been replaced with a new stand and media centre. University district The James Graham Building of Leeds Beckett University As Headingley is close to both the University of Leeds and Leeds Beckett University campuses, it has become a very popular student area. This has had both positive and negative consequences on the local population and environment. The biggest complaints against students (and increasingly, young professionals) relate to the use of multiple-occupancy houses which are prone to burglary, often neglected by landlords and occupants alike and are typically left unoccupied during university holidays. However, the student population has brought money into the area, improved public transport and, generally, made it a more desirable place to live for a portion of the population. Family areas still exist such as in Far Headingley or the Triangle near the Co-op on Cardigan Road. Sports Headingley Stadium cricket ground during an England game. The Carnegie Stand at Headingley Stadium rugby ground Professional Headingley is also known in sporting circles; its stadium is known as Headingley ‚Äì earlier spelt Headingly. The stadium is home to the Yorkshire County Cricket Club as well as the Leeds Rhinos rugby league and Yorkshire Carnegie rugby union clubs. For many decades the stadium remained largely unchanged. Since 2000, however, the cricket ground has been nearly entirely rebuilt in order to retain Test match status. The winter shed was demolished in 2008 and replaced by a new stand and media centre, giving the approach to the north entrance a distinctive and modern waymark. The rugby ground also saw development with the building of the Carnegie Stand which replaced the former Eastern Terraces. This was built with co-operation from Leeds Metropolitan University who retain lecture rooms in the building. Amateur Headingley also boasts an amateur association football team, Headingley AFC. The club nearly folded after losing its home ground, however in 2008, the club was offered a new ground by the University of Bradford, before moving to Weetwood Playing Fields, owned by the University of Leeds. They attracted media attention in January 2019 for featuring a shirt sponsor warning of the dangers of gambling. There is also two amateur cricket clubs (Headingley Bramhope CC & St. Chads CC) in Far Headingley. Politics Politically, almost all of Headingley is in the Leeds North West constituency. The current Member of Parliament (MP) is Alex Sobel (Labour Party) who succeeded Greg Mulholland (Liberal Democrat) in the 2017 general election. At a local government level, the ward of Headingley and Hyde Park has three Labour councillors, Al Garthwaite, Jonathan Pryor and Neil Walshaw. A small part of Headingley, specifically the area around Queenswood Drive, sits in the Kirkstall ward and the Leeds West constituency, where the current MP is Rachel Reeves of Labour. Amenities Brett's Fish Restaurant, North Lane Headingley railway station before redevelopmemt in 2019. The Headingley Taps, a pub on North Lane Headingley has two renowned fish and chip shops/fish restaurants which have been operating since the 1930s: Brett's, a 19th-century stone building on North Lane, and The Fisherman's Lodge (formerly Bryan's), a more modern building on Weetwood Lane. There are several pubs and bars plus extensive shopping areas. The pub Headingley Taps is so called because it was formerly a water pumping station. Other pubs and bars include the famous Original Oak, Skyrack, Head of Steam, Arcadia and Manahatta (formerly Arc). Close by in Far Headingley are in close proximity The New Inn, The Three Horseshoes and Woodies. In the Headingley Arndale Centre there is a Sainsbury's (formerly a Somerfield), a Wilko, a Boots the Chemist and several other chain shops as well as a small multi-storey car park. Headingley also has a small library on North Lane. There are many banks, building societies, restaurants, cafes and charity shops. Along Otley Road there is a large Oxfam bookshop. Until 2005, Headingley had two cinemas, 'The Lounge' and 'The Cottage Road Cinema' (usually referred to as 'Cottage Road'). The Lounge Cinema in the centre of Headingley has since closed and is being redeveloped as office and living accommodation, leaving only Cottage Road in Far Headingley. The area's Woolworths closed in the 1990s. Until the 1980s, the Arndale Centre boasted a bowling alley. The Arndale Centre began undergoing an external facelift in 2009. The nearest large supermarket is a Morrisons in Kirkstall, approximately a mile away from the centre of Headingley. There is a Premier Inn hotel above the Arndale Centre in the tallest building in Headingley, formerly an office block. Headingley is also famous for something called the Otley run, which is essentially a pub crawl starting at Woodies Ale House in Far Headingley and usually finishes at the Dry Dock near Leeds City Centre. Typically the Otley run is done in fancy dress. People Many famous writers, past and present, are connected with Headingley: Arthur Ransome, best known perhaps for the children's classic Swallows and Amazons, was born there, J. R. R. Tolkien the writer and author of The Lord of the Rings, lived there when he worked at the university, playwright Alan Bennett once lived over a butcher's shop (now a dry cleaner's) opposite the Three Horseshoes and TV writer Kay Mellor lives in Weetwood today. Many writers and poets who currently live in the area participate in the annual Headingley LitFest, which takes place each March, using venues like the Heart Centre, The New Headingley Club, various caf√©s and private houses. The tenth LitFest took place in 2017. Reviews of all talks and performances are online on the LitFest blog. In the time of Queen Victoria, Prince Alemayehu of Abyssinia, brought to England after the defeat of his father King Tewedros, died of pneumonia at an address in Hollin Lane, Far Headingley. Edward Baines, editor of the Leeds Mercury in the 19th century, had a grand house (since demolished) in Headingley. Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe committed two of his 20 attacks in Headingley. He killed 20-year-old Jacqueline Hill ‚Äì the last of the 13 women he killed ‚Äì in the area on 17 November 1980. On 24 September that year, he had also attacked Singapore born doctor Upadhya Bandara, 34, in the area, but she survived his assault. Sutcliffe was arrested within two months of Hill's murder and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for a total of 13 murders and seven attempted murders. Celebrate Headingley Celebrate Headingley is an annual series of events organised by Headingley Network, taking place for the ninth time in September 2009. It has been growing and developing since the first one in September 2001. The main intentions are to bring together members of a community which is often seen as beleaguered, to celebrate the diversity and strengths of the local population and to provide opportunities for residents to enjoy each other's company in a variety of social situations. Events include musical, literary, social and children's events, and local restaurants offer special deals. Headingley Development Trust Headingley street map HDT is a community benefit society, founded in 2005 by local residents, organisations and small businesses, with the aim of promoting and developing a sustainable, balanced community in Headingley. It is a community business that is self-financing and achieves it aims by delivering, brokering and supporting a range of initiatives that benefit the local community. HDT now has over 1,200 members, making it one of the largest Development Trusts of its kind in the UK. In 2018 it successfully raised over ¬£480,000 through a community share offer to create the Headingley Investment Fund (HIF) will enable it to further extend its work. HDT activities currently include: Headingley Enterprise and Arts Centre (HEART) opened in 2011 in the old Bennett Road primary school building which was completely refurbished and extended. It is to date Headingley's biggest ever community project. HEART accommodates rehearsal and meeting spaces and training rooms on the ground floor, a caf√© with outdoor and conservatory seating areas and Pulse a 'catalyst‚Äô business centre on the first floor particularly targeted at the arts and media industry. HEART is a true community business which runs without any grant support. The Headingley Greengrocer became HDT's latest venture when they stepped in to buy the business in April 2019 from RK Harris and Son who were retiring after running it for over 40 years.

The film was a success at the Hong Kong box office, earning two and a half times the amount of Yuen's and Chan's previous film, Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, which was also considered a successful film. It is an early example of the kung fu comedy genre, for which Jackie Chan became famous. The film popularised the Zui Quan (\\"drunken fist\\") fighting style. It was ranked number 3 on GamesRadar's list of 50 greatest kung fu movies of all time. It spawned an official sequel, Drunken Master II (1994), and several spin-offs. Background The film's protagonist Wong Fei-hung was a Chinese martial artist, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner and a revolutionary who lived towards the end of the Qing Dynasty. He became a Chinese folk hero and the subject of several Hong Kong television programmes and films. Beggar So, who plays a supporting role in the film, is also another character from Chinese folklore and one of the Ten Tigers of Canton. The Beggar So character is often cast as an associate of Wong Fei-hung or Wong's uncle. Plot The plot centers on a young and mischievous Wong Fei-hung (sometimes dubbed as \\"Freddie Wong\\"). Wong runs into a series of troubles. Firstly, he teaches an overbearing assistant martial arts teacher a lesson. Next, he makes advances on a woman to impress his friends, and is soundly thrashed by her older female guardian as a result; his shame is compounded when these two are later revealed to be his visiting aunt and cousin, whom he had not met before. Lastly, he beats up a hooligan who is the son of an influential man in town. His father decides to punish him for his behavior by making him train harder in martial arts. Wong's father arranges for Beggar So to train his son in martial arts. Beggar So has a reputation for crippling his students during training so Wong flees from home in an attempt to escape his punishment. Penniless, he stops at a restaurant and tries to con a fellow patron into offering him a free meal. As he was about to leave after his meal, he discovers that the man is actually the owner of the restaurant. He fights with the owner's lackeys in an attempt to escape. An old drunkard nearby is drawn into the fight and helps him escape. The drunkard turns out to be Beggar So, the Drunken Master. (Beggar So is known in some versions of the film as Sam Seed, So Hi or Su Hua-chi) Beggar So forces Wong into his brutal and rigorous training programme. Wong flees again to avoid the torturous training and runs into the notorious killer Yim Tit-sam (known in some versions as Thunderfoot or Thunderleg) by accident. Yim is known for his \\"Devil's Kick\\", a swift and deadly kicking style which has never been defeated. Wong provokes and challenges him to a fight and is soundly defeated and humiliated. He makes his way back to Beggar So and decides to commit himself to the Drunken Master's training program. The training resumes and soon Wong learns Beggar So's secret style of martial arts, a form of Drunken Boxing called \\"The Eight Drunken Immortals\\", named after the eight xian that the fighting style references. Wong masters seven of the eight styles with the exception of Drunken Miss Ho's as he feels that her style of fighting is too feminine. Meanwhile, Yim Tit-sam is contracted by a business rival to kill Wong's father. Wong's father fights with Yim and is defeated and injured by him. Wong and Beggar So arrive on the scene on time and Wong continues the fight with Yim. Beggar So promises not to interfere in the fight. Wong employs the new skills he has learned and outmatches Yim's kicking style. Yim then resorts to his secret technique, the Devil's Shadowless Hand, which is too fast for Wong to defeat. Wong confesses that he did not master the last style so Beggar So tells him to combine the seven styles and create his own version of the last style. Wong follows the instruction and discovers his own unique style of Drunken Miss Ho, which he uses to overcome the Shadowless Hand and finally defeat Yim. Cast *Jackie Chan as Wong Fei-hung / Freddy Wong (UK version) *Yuen Siu-Tin (or Simon Yuen) as Beggar So / Sam Seed *Hwang Jang Lee as Thunderleg Yen Tie Hsin / Thunderfoot *Dean Shek as Professor Kai-Hsin *Lam Kau as Wong Kei-Ying / Robert Wong (UK version) *Fung King-man as Mr. Lee Man-ho *Hsu Hsia as King of Bamboo Hsu Ching-tien *Linda Lin as Wong Fei-hung's aunt *Yuen Shun-yi as Chan Kwok-wai / Charlie Wei *Tong Jing as Wong Fei-hung's cousin *Tino Wong as Jerry Lee *Yuen Woo-Ping as Man with bucket of greens Fight scenes and martial arts A number of notable fights are featured in the film, almost all of them with strong elements of comedy‚Äîfrom the game of Keep Away with Wong Kei-ying's cocky, but incompetent, assistant kung fu instructor, to the novel \\"head-fu\\" fighting style used by one of his opponents. The film features the Hung Ga system of fighting, which was historically practiced by Wong Fei-hung and his father Wong Kei-ying, both of whom are major characters in the film. The animal styles of Snake, Crane, and Tiger performed in the film are derived wholly from the Hung Ga system and bear only a tangential relationship to the Fujian White Crane, Lama Pai (Tibetan White Crane), Black Tiger, and Snake systems of kung fu. Monkey style kung fu, popular in Southern Chinese martial arts performances, is also shown briefly. Numerous systems of kung fu include \\"Drunken Boxing\\" forms (e.g. Choi Lei Fut and Drunken Monkey), and the Taoist Eight Immortals are popular staples of Chinese culture and art. However, the \\"Eight Drunken Immortals\\" forms depicted in this film are likely the creation of director and choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and based on routines found in other systems. The primary villain in Drunken Master is played by Hwang Jang- lee, a Korean martial artist specialising in Taekwondo and known for his high- flying kicks, which are prominently displayed in the film. The systems of \\"Devil's Kick\\" and \\"Devil's Shadowless Hands\\" employed by Thunderleg are entirely fictitious. According to his book I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action, Chan nearly lost an eye after his brow ridge was injured. Theme song The theme song of Drunken Master is based on a Chinese folk song, \\"Under the General's Orders\\". Since Drunken Master, the theme song has been popularly associated with the folk hero Wong Fei-hung, who Jackie Chan plays in the film. It was later used in the 1983 film Winners and Sinners, starring Sammo Hung; it was played in a market scene whilst the Five Lucky Stars are watching two men demonstrating the beneficial effects of their medicines and their martial arts stances, in reference to Wong Fei-hung. \\"Under the General's Orders\\" later become the main theme song for the Once Upon a Time in China series starring Jet Li, who also plays Wong Fei-hung. Box office At the Hong Kong box office, Drunken Master earned an impressive 6,763,793 (). It was the second most popular film in Hong Kong in 1978. In Japan, where it released on 21 July 1979, it became one of the year's top ten highest-grossing films, earning (). In South Korea, it was the highest-grossing film of 1979, with 898,561 box admissions in Seoul City, equivalent to an estimated (). The film also broke records in Malaysia and Singapore. In Germany, where it was released as Sie nannten ihn Knochenbrecher (\\"They Called Him Bone Breaker\\") on 25 July 1980, it was the 41st highest-grossing film of the year, selling 584,312 tickets, equivalent to an estimated (US$2,063,606). Combined, the film grossed an estimated worldwide total of approximately , equivalent to adjusted for inflation. Sequels and spinoffs *Drunken Master II (1994) stars Jackie Chan, and is considered the only official sequel. Chan portrays the same character, Wong Fei-hung. The US release of the film in 2000 was entitled The Legend of Drunken Master. *Drunken Master was a spiritual successor to the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, which featured the same cast and director, but a different plot. *In 1979, Yuen Siu-Tin reprised the role of Beggar So in the film Dance of the Drunk Mantis, which is entitled Drunken Master Part 2 (not to be confused with Drunken Master II noted above) in some releases. The film, which was again directed by his son, Yuen Woo- Ping, does not feature Jackie Chan, focusing instead on the drunken beggar character rather than on Wong Fei-hung. It is therefore generally considered to be a spinoff rather than a true sequel. *Yuen played this same role again in the films Story of Drunken Master and World of the Drunken Master. *In 2010 Yuen Woo-ping returned to directing with True Legend, which could be called a prequel to Drunken Master as it explains why Beggar Su (played by Vincent Zhao) turns to drinking. Imitators As with many successful Hong Kong action films, several films were released in the wake of Drunken Master (and its sequel) that could be considered to trade on the fame of the original films. These had less in common with the original films than the spinoffs starring Yuen Siu-tien. They include: *5 Superfighters (aka The Drunken Fighter) (1978) *Drunken Swordsman (aka Drunken Dragon Strikes Back) (1979) *Drunken Arts and Crippled Fist (Featuring Li Yi Min) (1979) *Drunken Master, Slippery Snake (Starring Cliff Lok) (1979) *Shaolin Drunken Monkey (Starring Elton Chong) (1981) *The Shaolin Drunken Monk (starring Gordon Liu) (1982) *Drunken Tai Chi (directed by Yuen Woo-ping and starring Donnie Yen) (1984) *Revenge of the Drunken Master (1984), starring Johnny Chan, whose name allowed him to trade off his more successful namesake in other low-budget martial arts films including Golden Dragon, Silver Snake (1979) and The Eagles Killer (1978) *Drunken Master III (aka Drunken Master Killer) ‚Äì starring Andy Lau (1994) *The Little Drunken Masters (1995) Not all films that feature the Zui Quan \\"Drunken Fist\\" style (or variations on it) can be considered as imitators of the Drunken Master films. Films such as Drunken Monkey (2002) may feature a drunken style of kung fu, and in the case of The Forbidden Kingdom (2008), the same principal star, but they have a fundamentally different plot and sufficiently different title to separate them from Drunken Master. Home media *On 24 April 2000, Hong Kong Legends released a DVD in the United Kingdom. The image is cropped from 2:35:1 to 1:78:1 and has the Mandarin soundtrack with dubtitles. However, it has a number of additional features including a deleted scene and an interview with producer Ng See-yuen. *On 2 April 2002, Columbia Pictures released a DVD in the United States. Despite a 2:35:1 image and the inclusion of the original Cantonese track, the audio is incomplete in some sections (reverting to the English dub) and contains dubtitles. There's an audio commentary by Ric Meyers and Jeff Yang. *On 18 March 2004, HKVideo released a \\"Wong Fei Hung\\" DVD boxset in France containing this film (French title: \\"Le ma√Ætre chinois\\") and two others. It contains a full 2:35:1 image and the Cantonese soundtrack. However, it contains slightly poorer image quality and no English subtitles. *On 30 April 2004, Mei Ah Entertainment released a remastered DVD in Hong Kong (pictured right). It contains a 2:35:1 image, Cantonese Dolby Digital 5.1 track, original Cantonese Dolby Digital 2.0 mono track and Mandarin Dolby Digital 2.0 mono track. Subtitles include Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and English. The missing Cantonese for the opening has been re-dubbed in Cantonese and the other missing Cantonese scenes as extended footage in Mandarin due to trouble of re-dubbing with new voice actors. Many short lines missing Cantonese had been removed. Special features include Extended footage, accessed during the film by selecting the wine jug icon when it appears on the right top corner, Mastering the Drunken Master, a 35-second music video with clips of Jackie Chan practicing the 8 Drunken Gods from the film, film synopsis and cast & crew. *PanMedia released a bootleg DVD that contains the complete Cantonese track. Influence on popular culture *Manga author Akira Toriyama cited Drunken Master as one of his major inspirations for the Dragon Ball series of sh≈çnen manga and anime, along with Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon (1973) and the Chinese novel Journey to the West. Toriyama said that he would never have come up with Dragon Ball if he had not watched Drunken Master. The series pays homage to Drunken Master when the first tournament is held, where Kame-Sennin (Master Roshi) is disguised as \\"Jackie Chun\\" and he tries to use a Drunken Fist technique on Son Goku (Goku). *The PlayStation game Jackie Chan Stuntmaster includes a bonus level in which he wears his traditional Drunken Master dress and drinks wine while fighting. He even gives the Drunken Punch as his charge punch throughout the game. *In popular PC online game Guild Wars, there is a stance-skill called \\"Drunken Master\\" which temporarily increases movement and attack speed. This effect is doubled if character is drunk. *In The King of Fighters series, the character Chin Gentsai was modeled after Su Hua Chi. *Jamaican musicians Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, and The Revolutionaries recorded a reggae song called Drunken Master which was released in 1981 by Island on an album called Sly and Robbie Present Taxi. * In the Naruto series, one of the characters 'Rock Lee' is seen performing similar fighting styles after consuming alcohol. Known as the 'Drunken Fist' in the series' Japanese version and the 'Loopy Fist' in the English. *The Tekken video game series features a character named Lei Wu Long, a Hong Kong detective based on Jackie Chan's Police Story films. While the character was originally nicknamed Supercop after the film Police Story 3: Supercop Lei Wu Long uses 5 to 6+ stances which have all of Jackie Chan's signature film movies. Initially in the series it focused on the Snake style he created for Snake in The Eagles Shadow. In Street Fighter X Tekken released in 2012, Lei Wulong's \\"Ultimate Stance\\" is \\"Drunken Fist\\" based on his performance in the 1978 original and the 1994 sequel. *UK dubstep artist FuntCase used speech samples taken from the film in his song \\"Half drunk\\". *The hip-hop artist Hona Costello used the title and the starring actor's name Jackie Chan for his song, \\"Drunken Master\\". *The Dead or Alive video game franchise features a playable character named Brad Wong; a drunken wanderer introduced in Dead or Alive 3 who specializes in the zui quan fighting style, and was taught by a non-playable character named Chen. *The Mortal Kombat video game franchise introduced Bo' Rai Cho in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance; his name is a play on the word \\"borracho\\" (Spanish for \\"drunk\\"), and he is indeed usually depicted as intoxicated, and carrying a canister of alcohol. His fighting moves consist of drunken style fighting mixed with vulgar actions.

Until 1972, when it was replaced by Interstate Highways west of the Sacramento area, it extended (by way of Stockton, the Altamont Pass, and the Bay Bridge) to San Francisco, near the Pacific Ocean. The Interstates were constructed later and are mostly separate from this route. It generally serves a corridor south of I-70 and I-80 and north of I-64 and I-40. The route runs through mostly rural desert and mountains in the western United States, with the section through Nevada known as \\"The Loneliest Road in America\\". In the Midwest, US 50 heads through mostly rural areas of farms as well as a few large cities including Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; and Cincinnati, Ohio. The route continues into the eastern United States, where it passes through the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia before heading through Washington, D.C. From there, US 50 continues through Maryland as a high-speed road to Ocean City. Signs at each end give the length as , but the actual distance is slightly less, due to realignments since the former figure was measured in the early 1980s. US 50 passes through a total of 12 states; California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia. US 50 was created in 1926 as part of the original U.S. Highway system. The original route planned in 1925 ran from Wadsworth, Nevada, east to Annapolis, Maryland, along several auto trails including the Lincoln Highway, Midland Trail, and the National Old Trails Road. The final 1926 plan had US 50 running from Sacramento, California, east to Annapolis with a gap in west Utah that was bridged by running the route north via Salt Lake City before rerouting it to US 6 in the 1950s. US 50 was extended west from Sacramento to San Francisco in the 1930s, replacing US 48; this was reversed in 1964 when I-580 replaced much of the route between the two cities. In addition, US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City prior in 1949, replacing a portion of US 213\\\\. US 50 had two split configurations into US 50N and US 50S, one in Kansas and another in Ohio and West Virginia; both of these instances have been removed. Route description Mileage sign at the western terminus of US 50 Western U.S. US 50 in the Nevada desert US 50 begins as a major freeway at its junction with Interstate 80 in West Sacramento and continues into Sacramento. The portion of US 50 west of and including its interchange with California's State Highway 99 in Sacramento is also designated, but not signed as, Interstate 305. The signage along this portion of the highway indicates Business Loop I-80 and a portion of the way (2 miles/3.33 km) as California State Highway 99. From Sacramento, the highway heads eastward as the William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. Memorial Highway, continuing as a freeway to the Gold Country foothills, then following the American River up the Sierra Nevada as a conventional highway, until cresting the Sierras at Echo Summit and descending to Lake Tahoe, where the highway enters Nevada. In Nevada, the highway crosses a series of north‚Äìsouth running mountain ranges that break up the Nevada desert which are called Basin and Range. East of Carson City, the road enters the heart of the Great Basin, passing by few communities and minimal services, giving it the name \\"Loneliest Road in America\\" until reaching Utah. In Utah, US 50 also passes through desolate, remote areas with few inhabitants. After crossing the Confusion Range via Kings Canyon and the House Range, the road traverses the north shore of the endorheic Sevier Lake. In Holden, US 50 shortly overlaps Interstate 15 to cross the Pavant Range. The road begins a much longer overlap with Interstate 70 in Salina crossing the Wasatch Plateau and San Rafael Swell into Colorado. US 50 leaves I-70 upon entering the state and heads southeast through Grand Junction and into the southern part of Colorado. Once there, the road climbs to its highest elevation of over the Rocky Mountains and in Monarch Pass where it crosses the Continental Divide. After descending from the Rockies, US 50 passes by Royal Gorge near Ca√±on City then joins U.S. Route 400 in Granada and follows the Arkansas River into Kansas. Midwestern U.S. The Jefferson Barracks Bridge over the Mississippi River Upon entering Kansas, US 50, concurrent with US 400, runs along the Arkansas River to Dodge City where US 50 splits from US 400 and takes a more northerly course. US 50 continues to traverse the farmlands and small towns of the Great Plains mostly as a straight two-lane road until Emporia where it joins Interstate 35 and splits onto Interstate 435 to bypass the center of the Kansas City Area. In Missouri, US 50 leaves I-435 for Interstate 470 splitting at Lee's Summit. US 50 runs as a four-lane divided highway across the Western Plain to Sedalia where it continues as a two-lane road until reaching California, MO about 20 miles west of Jefferson City. The road continues as a four-lane divided highway into Jefferson City where it joins US 63 just south of the Missouri River Bridge. It continues 12 miles east of Jefferson City to the Osage River where US 63 splits off to the south. It then continues as a two-lane road as it traverses the northern sections of the Ozark Highlands east to Union where it begins an overlap with Interstate 44 which goes through Pacific. The routes separate in Sunset Hills where US 50 migrates southeast bypassing St Louis by joining Interstate 255 to cross Mississippi River into Illinois. In that state, US 50 switches to Interstate 64 before splitting onto its own alignment in eastern O'Fallon. It heads east through Trenton, Breese, Carlyle crossing the Kaskaskia River, Salem, Flora and Lawrenceville to the Wabash River along a corridor between Interstates 64 and 70. US 50 enters Indiana at the Wabash River, bypassing Vincennes and Washington and passing through Bedford, Seymour, and Versailles. It meets the Ohio River at Aurora, and soon crosses into Ohio, running through downtown Cincinnati via Fort Washington Way (Interstate 71). The route crosses southern Ohio via Hillsboro, Chillicothe, and Athens, joining the four-lane divided Corridor D (State Route 32) west of Athens. It meets the Ohio River around Belpre, and crosses the newer Blennerhassett Island Bridge (previously crossing the Parkersburg-Belpre Bridge) into greater Parkersburg, West Virginia.

Chesapeake Bay Bridge, carrying US 50/US 301 over the bay View west from the eastern terminus of US 50 in Ocean City, Maryland, with a sign listing the distance to Sacramento, California The portion of US 50 from Parkersburg, West Virginia to Winchester, Virginia follows the historic Northwestern Turnpike, which crosses the southern tip of Garrett County, Maryland. From Parkersburg to Interstate 79 east of Clarksburg, US 50 has been upgraded as part of the four-lane divided Corridor D. US 50 is a curving two-lane mountain road, east of Clarksburg through Grafton, a bit of Maryland, and Romney to Winchester. This portion of the road is so curvy that locals claim \\"you can meet yourself coming\\". The land flattens out after the route crosses the Blue Ridge Mountain east of Winchester, and it follows the old Little River Turnpike from Aldie to Fairfax City and the newer Arlington Boulevard to Rosslyn, where it crosses the District of Columbia line on the west shore of the Potomac River and joins Interstate 66 on the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge. Within the District, US 50 immediately exits the freeway onto Constitution Avenue along the north side of the National Mall and south of the White House. After turning north on 6th Street Northwest, it exits the city to the northeast on New York Avenue. Upon crossing into Maryland, it passes the south end of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and becomes the John Hanson Highway, a freeway to Annapolis. The portion of this highway east of the Capital Beltway (I-95/I-495) is also designated, but not signed as, Interstate 595, and U.S. Route 301 joins from the south at Bowie. The freeway continues beyond Annapolis as the Blue Star Memorial Highway which crosses the Chesapeake Bay on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and continues to Queenstown. There the Blue Star Highway continues northeast as US 301, while US 50 turns south, passing through Easton to Cambridge, and then east through Salisbury to Ocean City on the four-lane divided Ocean Gateway. US 50 ends near the Atlantic Ocean shore at Baltimore Avenue (Maryland Route 378 northbound); its westbound beginning is one block to the west, at Philadelphia Avenue (Maryland Route 528 southbound). History A \\"Loneliest Road in America\\" sign outside Austin, NV Before the creation of the Interstate Highway System after World War II, US 50 was a major east‚Äìwest route. Numbered highways in the United States follow a pattern of odd numbers for north‚Äìsouth routes and even numbers for east‚Äìwest routes, hence the designation of \\"50\\" for this route. In the preliminary report, approved by the Joint Board on Interstate Highways in late 1925, US 50 ran from Wadsworth, Nevada to Annapolis, Maryland, passing through Pueblo, Colorado; Kansas City, Missouri; Tipton, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; Cincinnati, Ohio, and Washington, D.C. The route did not directly replace any auto trail, instead combining portions of many into one continuous route. It followed the historic Northwestern Turnpike across West Virginia, and portions of other historic roads. Major auto trails followed, including the Midland Trail in part of Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and parts of Utah and Colorado. The National Old Trails Road (Old Santa Fe Trail) was designated in Kansas and eastern Colorado, and the Lincoln Highway was constructed in Nevada. In most states that had numbered their state highways, US 50 followed only one or two numbers across the state.The following routes were used, mostly shown on the 1926 Rand McNally: * Nevada: 2 * Utah: 8 (in the east half of the state; the west half was unnumbered) * Colorado: 6 * Kansas: state highways were not numbered prior to the U.S. Highway system * Missouri: 12, shown on Missouri State Highway Commission, Route Map Showing Designated Routes and Numbers, Approved September 19, 1922 * Illinois: 12 * Indiana: 4 and 5; by 1926, a short piece was 41, but this was originally part of 5, shown on the description of the 1917 Indiana State Highway Map at the Indiana University Bloomington Libraries * Ohio: mostly 26; it had been Main Market Route V in the 1910s, shown on 1914, 1915, and 1917 Ohio Transportation Maps * West Virginia: 1 * Virginia: 36; it had been 6 until the 1923 renumbering, shown in the route descriptions as defined by the General Assembly on January 31, 1918 * Maryland: state highways were not numbered prior to the U.S. Highway system One major controversy related to the preliminary route of US 50\\\\. The through route had been assigned to the Old Santa Fe Trail, while the spur U.S. Route 250 followed the competing New Santa Fe Trail to the south. As a compromise, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways approved a split configuration‚ÄîU.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S‚Äîin January. Another problem was in western Utah, where no improved road existed for US 50 to use. The final numbering plan, approved in November 1926, left a gap in US 50 between Ely, Nevada and Thistle, Utah. Finally, rather than ending US 50 at Wadsworth, where the Lincoln and Victory Highways merged, it was sent over the Lincoln Highway's Pioneer Branch, past the south side of Lake Tahoe, to Sacramento, California. The gap in Utah was soon bypassed by taking US 50 to the north, crossing the Great Salt Lake Desert with U.S. Route 40 to Salt Lake City, and using long portions of U.S. Route 93 in Nevada and U.S. Route 89 in Utah.Nevada Department of Highways, Road Map, 1932 U.S. Route 6 was marked along the direct, but still partially unimproved, route in 1937; it was finally paved in 1952, and US 50 was moved to it within a few years. Another straightening was made in 1976, when US 50 in central Utah was moved south onto the new extension of Interstate 70 at the request of the National Highway 50 Federation,Senate Committee on Public Works, Designating Highway US 50 as Part of the Interstate System, Nevada, 1970, p. 68: recommends that the road between Delta and Salina receive a single number a group dedicated to promoting US 50. Among other things, the group has unsuccessfully pushed for an extension of Interstate 70 west along US 50 to California. The north‚Äìsouth split in Kansas was eliminated in the late 1950s, with the south route‚Äîwhich was to be US 250‚Äîbecoming part of US 50, and most of US 50N becoming part of a new U.S. Route 56.KDOT Historic State Maps, 1956 and 1957‚Äì1958 Another split was located between Athens, Ohio and Ellenboro, West Virginia from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s, when US 50 went back to its original southern route; that U.S. Route 50N is now Ohio State Route 550 and part of West Virginia Route 16. At its west end, US 50 was extended south from Sacramento along U.S. Route 99 to Stockton and west to the San Francisco Bay Area, replacing U.S. Route 48, by the early 1930s. US 50 was officially cut back to Sacramento in the 1964 renumbering, replaced by Interstate 580,California Streets and Highways Code, 1963: \\"Route 50 is from Route 80 in Sacramento to the Nevada state line near Lake Tahoe via Placerville. (Repealed and added by Stats. 1963, Ch. 385.)\\" but remained on maps and signs for several more years. US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City, Maryland in 1949, three years prior to the opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952; this extension replaced Maryland Route 404 between Annapolis and Wye Mills and U.S. Route 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City. Prior to the bridge opening, US 50 used a ferry across the Chesapeake Bay between Sandy Point and Matapeake and followed present-day Maryland Route 8 between Matapeake and Stevensville before continuing east.

He was also the first Active Duty member of the U.S. military to die in a crash while on duty. He was killed while seated as a passenger in the Wright Flyer, on a demonstration flight piloted by Orville Wright. Biography Selfridge was born on February 8, 1882, in San Francisco, California. He was the grandson of Rear Admiral Thomas Oliver Selfridge Sr. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1903 and received his commission in the Artillery Corps. He was 31st in a class of 96; Douglas MacArthur was first. In 1907, when the Artillery Corps was separated into the Field Artillery and Coast Artillery Corps, Selfridge was assigned to the 5th Field Artillery Regiment and the following year to the 1st Field Artillery Regiment. Selfridge was stationed at the Presidio during the great San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906. His unit participated in search and rescue as well as cleanup operations. In 1907, he was assigned to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps at Fort Myer, Virginia, where he was later instructed in flying a dirigible. He was also the United States government representative to the Aerial Experiment Association, which was chaired by Alexander Graham Bell, and he became its first secretary. Selfridge took his first flight on December 6, 1907, on Bell's tetrahedral kite, the Cygnet, made of 3,393 winged cells. It took him 168 feet in the air above Bras d'Or Lake in Nova Scotia, Canada, and flew for seven minutes. This was the first recorded passenger flight of any heavier-than-air craft in Canada. He also flew a craft built by a Canadian engineer, Frederick W. Baldwin, which flew three feet off the ground for a distance of about 100 feet. \\"Red Wing\\" aeroplane Selfridge designed Red Wing, the Aerial Experiment Association's first powered aircraft. On March 12, 1908, the Red Wing, piloted by Frederick W. Baldwin, raced over the frozen surface of Keuka Lake near Hammondsport, New York, on runners and managed to fly 318 feet, 11 inches, before crashing. Red Wing was destroyed in a crash on its second flight on March 17, 1908, and only the engine could be salvaged. On May 19, 1908, Selfridge became the first US military officer to pilot a modern aircraft when he flew solo in AEA's newest craft, White Wing, traveling 100 feet on his first attempt and 200 feet on his second. Between May 19 and August 3, he made several flights at Hammondsport, culminating in a flight of one minute and thirty seconds at a height of 75 feet. The next day his final solo flight of fifty seconds covered a distance of 800 yards. Although not fully trained as a pilot, Selfridge was nevertheless the first U.S. military officer to fly any airplane unaccompanied. In August 1908, Selfridge was one of three pilots trained to fly the Army Dirigible Number One, purchased by the US Army from Thomas Scott Baldwin in July 1908; his training partners were Lieutenants Frank P. Lahm and Benjamin Foulois. The dirigible was scheduled to fly from Fort Omaha, Nebraska, to exhibitions at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia, Missouri, piloted by Foulois and Selfridge. However, the Army had tentatively agreed to purchase an airplane from the Wright Brothers and had scheduled the acceptance trials in September. Selfridge, with an interest in both heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air ships, obtained an appointment and traveled to Fort Myer, Virginia. Death Wreckage of the Wright Flyer that took the life of Tom Selfridge In September 1908, Orville Wright visited Fort Myer to demonstrate the 1908 Wright Military Flyer for the US Army Signal Corps division. On September 17, Selfridge arranged to be his passenger and Wright piloted the craft. On this occasion, the Flyer was carrying more weight than it had ever done before; the combined weight of the two men was approximately 320 lbs. The Flyer circled Fort Myer 4¬Ω times at a height of 150 feet. Halfway through the fifth circuit, at 5:14 in the afternoon, the right- hand propeller broke, losing thrust. This set up a vibration, causing the split propeller to hit a guide wire bracing the rear vertical rudder. The wire tore out of its fastening and shattered the propeller; the rudder swiveled to the horizontal and sent the Flyer into a nose-dive. Wright shut off the engine and managed to glide to about 75 feet, but the craft hit the ground nose first. Both men were thrown forward against the remaining wires and Selfridge struck one of the wooden uprights of the framework, fracturing the base of his skull. He underwent neurosurgery but died three hours later without regaining consciousness. Wright suffered severe injuries, including a broken left thigh, several broken ribs, and a damaged hip, and was hospitalized for seven weeks. Orville Wright later described the fatal accident in a letter to his brother, Wilbur Wright: Two photographs taken of the Flyer just prior to the flight, show that Selfridge was not wearing any headgear, while Wright was only wearing a cap. Following the crash, due to speculation that Selfridge would have survived had he worn headgear, first pilots of the US Army were instructed to wear large heavy headgear reminiscent of early football helmets. Thomas Selfridge was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Section 3 Gravesite 2158, adjacent to Fort Myer. Legacy Selfridge Air National Guard Base is named after him. The base is located in Harrison Township, Michigan, near Mt. Clemens, 22 miles NNE of Downtown Detroit, Michigan (from the US Port of Entry at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel). Though buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Selfridge is memorialized by a large cenotaph in Section XXXIV of West Point Cemetery. The damaged propeller of the Wright Flyer wrecked at Fort Myer can be viewed at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, Ohio. A gate between Arlington National Cemetery and Fort Myer, located approximately halfway between the two chapels on Fort Myer, is named \\"Selfridge Gate\\", in his honor.

Since unique elements have characteristic (signature) spectra, atomic spectroscopy, specifically the electromagnetic spectrum or mass spectrum, is applied for determination of elemental compositions. It can be divided by atomization source or by the type of spectroscopy used. In the latter case, the main division is between optical and mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry generally gives significantly better analytical performance, but is also significantly more complex. This complexity translates into higher purchase costs, higher operational costs, more operator training, and a greater number of components that can potentially fail. Because optical spectroscopy is often less expensive and has performance adequate for many tasks, it is far more common Atomic absorption spectrometers are one of the most commonly sold and used analytical devices. Optical spectroscopy  Electrons exist in energy levels (i.e. atomic orbitals) within an atom. Atomic orbitals are quantized, meaning they exist as defined values instead of being continuous (see: atomic orbitals). Electrons may move between orbitals, but in doing so they must absorb or emit energy equal to the energy difference between their atom's specific quantized orbital energy levels. In optical spectroscopy, energy absorbed to move an electron to a higher energy level (higher orbital) and/or the energy emitted as the electron moves to a lower energy level is absorbed or emitted in the form of photons (light particles). Because each element has a unique number of electrons, an atom will absorb/release energy in a pattern unique to its elemental identity (e.g. Ca, Na, etc.) and thus will absorb/emit photons in a correspondingly unique pattern. The type of atoms present in a sample, or the amount of atoms present in a sample can be deduced from measuring these changes in light wavelength and light intensity. Optical spectroscopy is further divided into atomic absorption spectroscopy and atomic emission spectroscopy. In atomic absorption spectroscopy, light of a predetermined wavelength is passed through a collection of atoms. If the wavelength of the source light has energy corresponding to the energy difference between two energy levels in the atoms, a portion of the light will be absorbed. The difference between the intensity of the light emitted from the source (e.g., lamp) and the light collected by the detector yields an absorbance value. This absorbance value can then be used to determine the concentration of a given element (or atoms) within the sample. The relationship between the concentration of atoms, the distance the light travels through the collection of atoms, and the portion of the light absorbed is given by the Beer‚ÄìLambert law. In atomic emission spectroscopy, the intensity of the emitted light is directly proportional to the concentration of atoms. Mass spectrometry Atomic mass spectrometry is similar to other types of mass spectrometry in that it consists of an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector. Atoms' identities are determined by their mass-to-charge ratio (via the mass analyzer) and their concentrations are determined by the number of ions detected. Although considerable research has gone into customizing mass spectrometers for atomic ion sources, it is the ion source that differs most from other forms of mass spectrometry. These ion sources must also atomize samples, or an atomization step must take place before ionization. Atomic ion sources are generally modifications of atomic optical spectroscopy atom sources. Ion and atom sources Sources can be adapted in many ways, but the lists below give the general uses of a number of sources. Of these, flames are the most common due to their low cost and their simplicity. Although significantly less common, inductively-coupled plasmas, especially when used with mass spectrometers, are recognized for their outstanding analytical performance and their versatility. For all atomic spectroscopy, a sample must be vaporized and atomized. For atomic mass spectrometry, a sample must also be ionized. Vaporization, atomization, and ionization are often, but not always, accomplished with a single source. Alternatively, one source may be used to vaporize a sample while another is used to atomize (and possibly ionize). An example of this is laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, where a laser is used to vaporize a solid sample and an inductively-coupled plasma is used to atomize the vapor. With the exception of flames and graphite furnaces, which are most commonly used for atomic absorption spectroscopy, most sources are used for atomic emission spectroscopy. Liquid-sampling sources include flames and sparks (atom source), inductively-coupled plasma (atom and ion source), graphite furnace (atom source), microwave plasma (atom and ion source), and direct-current plasma (atom and ion source). Solid-sampling sources include lasers (atom and vapor source), glow discharge (atom and ion source), arc (atom and ion source), spark (atom and ion source), and graphite furnace (atom and vapor source). Gas-sampling sources include flame (atom source), inductively-coupled plasma (atom and ion source), microwave plasma (atom and ion source), direct-current plasma (atom and ion source), and glow discharge (atom and ion source).

However in present-day sociology, a minority group refers to a category of people who experience relative disadvantage as compared to members of a dominant social group. Minority group membership is typically based on differences in observable characteristics or practices, such as: ethnicity (ethnic minority), race (racial minority), religion (religious minority), sexual orientation (sexual minority), or disability. Utilizing the framework of intersectionality, it is important to recognize that an individual may simultaneously hold membership in multiple minority groups (e.g. both a racial and religious minority). Likewise, individuals may also be part of a minority group in regard to some characteristics, but part of a dominant group in regard to others. The term \\"minority group\\" often occurs within the discourse of civil rights and collective rights, as members of minority groups are prone to differential treatment in the countries and societies in which they live. Minority group members often face discrimination in multiple areas of social life, including housing, employment, healthcare, and education, among others. While discrimination may be committed by individuals, it may also occur through structural inequalities, in which rights and opportunities are not equally accessible to all. The language of minority rights is often used to discuss laws designed to protect minority groups from discrimination and afford them equal social status to the dominant group.  Definitions = Sociological  Louis Wirth defined a minority group as \\"a group of people who, because of their physical or cultural characteristics, are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination\\". The political scientist and law professor, Gad Barzilai, has offered a theoretical definition of non-ruling communities that conceptualizes groups that do not rule and are excluded from resources of political power. Barzilai, G. Communities and Law: Politics and Cultures of Legal Identities. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. The definition includes both objective and subjective criteria: membership of a minority group is objectively ascribed by society, based on an individual's physical or behavioral characteristics; it is also subjectively applied by its members, who may use their status as the basis of group identity or solidarity. Thus, minority group status is categorical in nature: an individual who exhibits the physical or behavioral characteristics of a given minority group is accorded the status of that group and is subject to the same treatment as other members of that group. Joe Feagin, states that a minority group has five characteristics: (1) suffering discrimination and subordination, (2) physical and/or cultural traits that set them apart, and which are disapproved by the dominant group, (3) a shared sense of collective identity and common burdens, (4) socially shared rules about who belongs and who does not determine minority status, and (5) tendency to marry within the group. = Criticisms = There is a controversy with the use of the word minority, as it has a generic and an academic usage. Common usage of the term indicates a statistical minority; however, academics refer to power differences among groups rather than differences in population size among groups. The above criticism is based on the idea that a group can be considered minority even if it includes such a large number of people that it is numerically not a minority in society. Some sociologists have criticized the concept of \\"minority/majority\\", arguing this language excludes or neglects changing or unstable cultural identities, as well as cultural affiliations across national boundaries. As such, the term historically excluded groups (HEGs) is often similarly used to highlight the role of historical oppression and domination, and how this results in the under-representation of particular groups in various areas of social life.  Political  The term national minority is often used to discuss minority groups in international and national politics. All countries contain some degree of racial, ethnic, or linguistic diversity. In addition, minorities may also be immigrant, indigenous or landless nomadic communities. This often results in variations in language, culture, beliefs, practices, that set some groups apart from the dominant group. As these differences are usually perceived negatively by, this results in loss of social and political power for members of minority groups. There is no legal definition of national minorities in international law, though protection of minority groups is outlined by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. International criminal law can protect the rights of racial or ethnic minorities in a number of ways.Lyal S. Sunga (2004). International Criminal Law: Protection of Minority Rights, Beyond a One-Dimensional State: An Emerging Right to Autonomy? ed. Zelim Skurbaty. (2004) 255‚Äì275. The right to self-determination is a key issue. The Council of Europe regulates minority rights in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. In some places, subordinate ethnic groups may constitute a numerical majority, such as Blacks in South Africa under apartheid. In the United States, for example, non-Hispanic Whites constitute the majority (63.4%) and all other racial and ethnic groups (Mexican, African Americans, Asian Americans, American Indian, and Native Hawaiians) are classified as \\"minorities\\". If the non-Hispanic White population falls below 50% the group will only be the plurality, not the majority.  Examples of minority groups =Ethnic minorities There is inadequate evidence whether mass media targeting ethnic minorities are more effective in changing health behaviours such as smoking cessation, weight reduction and food habits when compared to mass media intended for the general population.  Involuntary minorities  Also known as \\"castelike minorities,\\" involuntary minorities are a term for people who were originally brought into any society against their will. In the United States, for instance, it includes but is not limited to Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, African Americans, and native-born Mexican Americans. For reasons of cultural differences, involuntary minorities may experience difficulties in school more than members of other (voluntary) minority groups. Social capital helps children engage with different age groups that share a common goal.  Voluntary minorities  Immigrants take on minority status in their new country, usually in hopes of a better future economically, educationally, and politically than in their homeland. Because of their focus on success, voluntary minorities are more likely to do better in school than other migrating minorities. Adapting to a very different culture and language make difficulties in the early stages of life in the new country. Voluntary immigrants do not experience a sense of divided identity as much as involuntary minorities and are often rich in social capital because of their educational ambitions. Major immigrant groups in the United States include Mexicans, Central and South Americans, Cubans, Africans, and Indians.  Gender and sexuality minorities  Pride events are held annually around the world for sexual minorities. In picture, people gathering at the Senate Square, Helsinki, right before the 2011 Helsinki Pride parade started. The term sexual minority is frequently used by public health researchers to recognize a wide variety of individuals who engage in same-sex sexual behavior, including those who do not identify under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. For example, men who have sex with men (MSM), but do not identify as gay. In addition, the term gender minorities can include many types of gender variant people, such as intersex people, transgender people, or non-binary individuals. However, the terms sexual and gender minority are often not preferred by LGBTQ+ people, as they represent clinical categories rather than individual identity. Though lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people have existed throughout human history, LGBTQ+ rights movements across many western countries led to the recognition of LGBTQ+ people as members of a minority group. LGBTQ+ people represent a numerical and social minority. They experience numerous social inequalities stemming from their group membership as LGBTQ+ people. These inequalities include social discrimination and isolation, unequal access to healthcare, employment, and housing, and experience negative mental and physical health outcomes due to these experiences.  People with disabilities  Leading up to the Human Rights Act 1998 in the UK, a rise in the awareness relating to how people with disabilities were being treated began. Many started to believe that they were being denied basic human rights. This act had a section that stated if authorities did not protect people with learning disabilities from others actions such as harm or neglect, then they could be prosecuted. The disability rights movement has contributed to an understanding of people with disabilities as a minority or a coalition of minorities who are disadvantaged by society, not just as people who are disadvantaged by their impairments. Advocates of disability rights emphasize the difference in physical or psychological functioning, rather than inferiority. For example, some people with autism argue for acceptance of neurodiversity, much as opponents of racism argue for acceptance of ethnic diversity. The deaf community is often regarded as a linguistic and cultural minority rather than a group with disabilities, and some deaf people do not see themselves as having a disability at all. Rather, they are disadvantaged by technologies and social institutions that are designed to cater for the dominant group. (See the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.)  Religious minorities  People belonging to religious minorities have a faith which is different from that held by the majority. Most countries of the world have religious minorities. It is now widely accepted in the west that people should have the freedom to choose their own religion, including not having any religion (atheism and/or agnosticism), and including the right to convert from one religion to another. However, in many countries this freedom is constricted. In Egypt, a new system of identity cardsSee \\"The Situation of the Bah√°'√≠ Community of Egypt\\" and \\"Religion Today: Bahais' struggle for recognition reveals a less tolerant face of Egypt\\", Bahai.org , DWB.sacbee.com requires all citizens to state their religion‚Äîand the only choices are Islam, Christianity, or Judaism (See Egyptian identification card controversy). Another example is the case of decreasing population of minorities in Pakistan, where they are being forcefully converted or killed.  Women as minorities  In most societies, numbers of men and women are not equal. Though women are not categorically a minority, the status of women as a subordinate group has led to many social scientists to study them as a minority group. Though women's legal rights and status vary widely across countries, women experience social inequalities relative to men in most societies. Women are often denied access to education, subject to violence, and lack access to the same economic opportunities as men.Women, U. N. (2018). Annual Report 2017‚Äì2018.  Law and government  In the politics of some countries, a \\"minority\\" is an ethnic group recognized by law, and having specified rights. Speakers of a legally recognized minority language, for instance, might have the right to education or communication with the government in their mother tongue. Countries with special provisions for minorities include Canada, China, Ethiopia, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Croatia, and the United Kingdom. The various minority groups in a country are often not given equal treatment. Some groups are too small or indistinct to obtain minority protections. For example, a member of a particularly small ethnic group might be forced to check \\"Other\\" on a checklist of different backgrounds and so might receive fewer privileges than a member of a more defined group. Many contemporary governments prefer to assume the people they rule all belong to the same nationality rather than separate ones based on ethnicity. The United States asks for race and ethnicity on its official census forms, which thus breaks up and organizes its population into sub-groups, primarily racial rather than national. Spain does not divide its nationals by ethnic group, although it does maintain an official notion of minority languages. Some especially significant or powerful minorities receive comprehensive protection and political representation. For example, the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the three constitutive nations, none of which constitutes a numerical majority (see nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina). However, other minorities such as Romani and Jews, are officially labelled \\"foreign\\" and are excluded from many of these protections. For example, they may be excluded from political positions, including the presidency.Opinion of the Council of Europe's Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, in particular paragraphs 37‚Äì43 There is debate over recognizing minority groups and their privileges. One viewFor example, J.A. Lindgren- Alves, member of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, speaking at the Committee's 67th Session (Summary Record of the 1724th Meeting, 23 August 2005, CERD/C/SR.1724) is that the application of special rights to minority groups may harm some countries, such as new states in Africa or Latin America not founded on the European nation-state model, since minority recognition may interfere with establishing a national identity. It may hamper the integration of the minority into mainstream society, perhaps leading to separatism or supremacism. In Canada, some feel that the failure of the dominant English-speaking majority to integrate French Canadians has provoked Quebec separatism. Others assert that minorities require specific protections to ensure that they are not marginalised: for example, bilingual education may be needed to allow linguistic minorities to fully integrate into the school system and compete equally in society. In this view, rights for minorities strengthen the nation-building project, as members of minorities see their interests well served, and willingly accept the legitimacy of the nation and their integration (not assimilation) within it.See  See also  * Dominant minority * Ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland * Ethnic penalty * Intangible cultural heritage * Interminority racism * List of active NGOs of national minorities * List of minority political parties * Middleman minority * Minority influence * Minority language * Minority (philosophy) * Minority religion * Minority Rights Group International * Model minority * Serge Moscovici * Social exclusion * Social stratification * Tokenism  References  External links  *Union of Minority Shareholders *ECMI - European Centre for Minority Issues *Minority language tool *What is a Minority Group? definitions from Dayton Law School. *From Paris to Cairo: Resistance of the Unacculturated *Minorities at Risk project at the University of Maryland *MINELRES - Minority Electronic Resources *European Academy Bozen/Bolzano (EURAC) *Eurominority - Stateless and national minorities portal *State of the World's Minorities, an annual report by Minority Rights Group International *American Psychological Association's Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs Category:Voting theory * Category:Human rights Category:Disability rights Category:Women's rights Category:Linguistic rights Category:Youth rights Category:Majority‚Äìminority relations ","title":"Minority group"},{"id":"437873","text":"Lul is a village in South Sudan.

Born into a wealthy ship-owning family, he is best known for founding the low-cost airline easyJet and the Stelmar shipping line with start-up funds provided by his father, Loucas. easyJet's foundation in 1995 marked the beginning of a series of ventures marketed under the \\"easy\\" brand, managed by easyGroup and chaired by Haji-Ioannou.  Early life  Stelios Haji-Ioannou was born in Athens on 14 February 1967, the second of three children of Nedi (n√©e Potsos) and Loucas Haji-Ioannou. He has an elder brother, Polys, and a younger sister, Clelia. Both of his siblings have a large stake in easyJet. His father's family originates from the village of Pedoulas high in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus, while his mother is from the village of Laneia at the foot of the mountains. After his secondary education in Athens, he studied Economics at the London School of Economics, graduating with a BSc in 1987. He went on to obtain an MSc in Shipping, Trade & Finance from Cass Business School. He was later awarded four honorary doctorates from Cass Business School, Liverpool John Moores University, Newcastle Business School, and Cranfield University.  Early career  A self-labelled \\"serial entrepreneur\\", Haji-Ioannou started working in 1988 for his father's already successful shipping business, Troodos Shipping Co Ltd. At 25, Haji-Ioannou received ¬£30 million from his father, that he used to set up his own shipping company, Stelmar Shipping. Haji-Ioannou floated the company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001. In 2005, Stelmar Shipping was sold to the OSG Group for approximately $1.3 billion.  Exonerated in shipping accident  In April 1991, a Troodos-owned VLCC oil tanker suffered a disaster that resulted in six deaths and spilt about 50,000 tons of crude oil into the sea, becoming arguably the Mediterranean's worst-ever ecological disaster. The tanker, M/T Haven, was an elderly vessel, formerly the Amoco Haven, sister ship of the ill-starred Amoco Cadiz that had foundered in 1978. Haji-Ioannou was accused of poor maintenance and charged in Italy with manslaughter, in addition to intimidating and attempting to bribe witnesses. Haji-Ioannou blamed the accident on an error by one of the surviving crew members. He and his father were acquitted by the jury. Subsequent civil demands for compensation were also dismissed by the courts.  The \\"easy\\" companies  Haji-Ioannou started easyJet in 1995 when he was 28 years old, running a service between Luton and Scotland. In 2000, easyJet PLC was partially floated on the London Stock Exchange. He and his family remain its largest single shareholders (34%) in the airline, capitalised at ¬£4.17bn as of 9 May 2019. Haji-Ioannou conducts business via his private investment vehicle, the easyGroup, which owns the 'easy' brand and licenses it to the various 'easy'-branded ventures, including the airline. Haji-Ioannou continues to extend his business interests, mainly in the field of travel and leisure by encouraging entrepreneurs to adopt the \\"easy\\" brand for their companies. easyJet PLC is one of Europe's largest airlines with a fleet of 323 aircraft carrying over 88.5m passengers annually (2018 figures). Other travel/leisure-related businesses include: * easyCar, which offers a peer2peer car sharing scheme as well as low cost car rental in 2,000 locations globally * easyBus, which offers low cost bus transportation between London/Paris/Geneva airports and their respective city centres * easyHotel, which offers low cost accommodation in city centres across Europe * easyFoodstore is a new concept, currently being trialled with a view to offering discounted, \\"white-label\\" groceries to low-income and benefit dependent groups. * easyGym which offers low cost, no-contract gym memberships at 16 locations in the UK and five in France, while looking to expand further inside the EU. * easyProperty which offers an online service to homeowners and prospective buyers as well landlords and tenants. * easyCruise was a low-cost cruise line started in 2004. It was sold in August 2009 to Greek ferry operator Hellenic Seaways for ¬£9 million and ran until it went defunct in 2010. * easyCoffee owns a number of self-service coffee machines including a cafe in Central London.  Fastjet  In September 2011 it was reported that Haji-Ioannou was working on Fastjet, a new low-cost airline serving routes within Africa, as part of a joint venture with Lonrho plc. The airline started operations on 29 November 2012 with Airbus A319 aircraft.  Battle with Ryanair  In 2009, Haji-Ioannou brought proceedings in London's High Court over Ryanair adverts which appeared in The Guardian, the Daily Telegraph and on Ryanair's website in January and February. The adverts featured a picture of Haji-Ioannou in the style of Pinocchio and referred to him as \\"easyJet's Mr Late Again\\". The case was eventually settled out of court, with Haji-Ioannou receiving an official apology from the airline and the sum of ¬£50,100, which Haji-Ioannou announced he would donate to his philanthropic foundation.  Disagreement with EasyJet  In 2010, Haji-Ioannou quit the board of EasyJet, in order to attempt to force the management of the company to abort their expansion plans. In an interview with Management Today, he said: 'EasyJet is seen as a huge success, which I'm happy about, because I own the brand. But easyJet is a publicly listed company. The share price has gone up and down as it's got bigger and things have happened ‚Äì but overall, really it's gone sideways.' He then went on to say: 'Basically, it's created no shareholder value for 10 years.' In 2013, Haji-Ioannou said he had become \\"increasingly concerned\\" at easyJet's expansion plans. He announced that he sold 200,000 easyJet shares in protest against plans to buy more planes, while his siblings have done the same with their shares. In April 2020, Haji-Ioannou publicly called for the removal of EasyJet PLC CEO Johan Lundgren and chairman John Barton over what he describes as a \\"deliberate mistake\\" in not terminating a ¬£4.5 billion order for 107 planes from Airbus. Personal life Haji-Ioannou has lived in Monaco since his family moved there when he was a teenager. In the 2006 Birthday Honours, Haji-Ioannou received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for \\"services to entrepreneurship\\". Haji-Ioannou was a member of the New Enterprise Council, a group set up to advise the Conservative Party on business policy. He stated at the time that this appointment did not reflect his political affiliations, adding, \\"I agreed to be included in the group of entrepreneurs because I was assured it will be non-partisan. [There is] not much difference between left and right any more.\\"Parties clash in corporate credentials battle MarketWatch, 15 November 2007 In an April 2010 letter to the Daily Telegraph, Haji-Ioannou joined 23 other UK business leaders, including Marks & Spencer's Stuart Rose and Next's Simon Wolfson, criticising the Brown government's plans to raise National Insurance contribution rates. The character of Omar Baba in the BBC comedy series Come Fly With Me is reportedly based on Haji-Ioannou. In 2018, he filed a infringement claim against Netflix over their show \\"Easy\\" in a UK court, saying that use of the name breaches its European trademarks.

Miller, BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names (Oxford UP, 1971), p. 15. is a village in the Blaby District in central Leicestershire, England, some five miles south of Leicester city centre. It has population of around 6,240 (2001 figures), falling slightly to 6,194 at the 2011 census, and its proximity to the city causes it to form part of the Leicester Urban Area. Its name probably came Old Norse Bl√°b√Ωr = \\"farmstead or village belonging to a man named Bl√°r\\" (where the -r is a case ending). There seems to have been a dense patch of Viking settlement in Leicestershire, although some records in the Blaby Library indicate the origin of the village's name was from the first vicar. Twinned with the village of Villers-sous-Saint-Leu in France. Buildings All Saints, the parish church While there are few buildings of outstanding historical or architectural interest, old Blaby is a conservation area. It contains some ancient and picturesque dwellings and has a charming 'olde worlde' feel. Old Blaby also contains The Baker's Arms, a thatched public house that dates back to 1484. The other public houses to be found in Blaby are The Fox & Tiger, The Bulls Head and The Black Horse. The Tom Thumb has been sold from Everards brewery and had planning permission granted to build 10 dwellings in its place. The Egyptian Queen has now been demolished. One of the two old schools in Blaby is Park (Parkwood) House; the other is in the surrounding area near the parish church. Parks To the south of the Bakers Arms stands Bouskell Park, with a 19th-century ice house and car parking. There are also Northfield Park, used for football, cricket, fetes and fairs, and Oakfield Park, located off Hospital Lane. Shops Most shops and amenities stand on the old A426 road between Leicester to the north and Lutterworth to the south. Fosse Park shopping centre and the M1 motorway and M69 motorway are just a few miles away. Surrounding area Blaby gives its name to the Blaby district and previously to the Parliamentary constituency that was held by former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson between 1974 and 1992. Between 1992 and 2015 its Member of Parliament was Andrew Robathan. In 2010 the constituency was renamed South Leicestershire. There was a railway station on the Birmingham to Peterborough Line, but it closed in 1968.

Created by Jim Shooter and Al Milgrom, the character first appeared in Secret Wars II #5 (November 1985). She then appeared as a member of X-Force and later as a member of Nextwave. She is mentally able to create variably-sized, yellow orbs of pure energy that explode with concussive and destructive force. Since her first appearance, Tabitha has used a number of different codenames, including Time Bomb, Boom- Boom, Boomer, and Meltdown. Tabitha is one of the mutants to have kept their powers after the 2005 \\"House of M\\" storyline. Publication history Created by Jim Shooter and Al Milgrom, the character first appeared in Secret Wars II #5 (November 1985), in which she and the Beyonder are the primary characters. She next appears as a main character in the 1987 limited series Fallen Angels. This led to her becoming a supporting character in the X-Factor series beginning with issue #11, which then led to a co-star role in the X-Terminators limited series. Following this series, she appeared in The New Mutants, initially guest-starring as a member of the X-Terminators, and eventually becoming a member of the titular group. The team then became X-Force and she remained a member of the team for most of the X-Force series. Sometime later, she appears as a member of Nextwave throughout the Nextwave series. Writer Warren Ellis said that he picked Boom-Boom to be in Nextwave because Boom-Boom is his favorite super hero name in the history of comics for its sheer oddness and silliness, and he loved it when she was in Uncanny X-Men when Joe Madureira was the artist. Despite the appearance of Nextwave characters in other Marvel titles, in 2006 Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada stated that Nextwave's setting was in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity.Gum, Wade (2006-07-01). \\"Heroes Con: Joe Quesada Panel\\", WizardUniverse.com (archived) However, Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe and Civil War: Battle Damage Report consistently place Nextwave's activities in mainstream continuity.

She is depicted as a rebellious but normal teenager and the daughter of divorced parents in her first appearance. Tabitha's mutant powers manifest at 13, and her parents immediately show their disgust, her father even beating her. She runs away from home, giving herself the alias \\"Time Bomb,\\" and meets the cosmic entity known as the Beyonder. He brings her to Charles Xavier, headmaster of the School for Gifted Youngsters, who ignores her to combat the Beyonder. Just before she can commit suicide over this second rejection, the Beyonder stops her, taking her with him on his cosmic trip. The Beyonder confronts the Celestials, and at her behest, returns Tabitha to Earth. She helps the Avengers ambush the Beyonder. She leaves the battlefield when she learns that the Beyonder felt betrayed by the actions of \\"his only friend.\\"Secret Wars II #5 Fallen Angels and X-Terminators Living on the streets, Tabitha becomes involved with Maurice \\"Tiger\\" Antonini and, after he threatens Tabitha and murders her friend Gina, she uses her powers to kill him.

In an effort to deal with the guilt from this incident, Tabitha travels home to visit her father. The two reconcile, but in a fight with Sebastian Shaw and Holocaust, her father is critically injured. With more guilt on her mind, Tabitha underwent a radical change, renaming herself \\"Meltdown,\\" designing a new costume and gaining better control of her powers along with a more brash and assertive attitude. This new attitude is displayed by Meltdown when she fights the Blob, threatening to kill him, and eventually having two time-bombs explode near his eardrums. With Cannonball spending his time with the X-Men, Tabitha grows closer to Sunspot and they begin a short-lived fling.X-Force #75 Cannonball finds out and is initially angry but reconciles with both his friends, rejoining X-Force in the process.X-Force #76 After an incident in which the High Evolutionary shut off all mutant powers, Tabitha and Cannonball come close to rekindling their relationship.X-Force #101 Peter Wisdom In the meantime, the sudden power loss really hit home for Cannonball, as to just how little they had been doing lately to help mutant-kind. He got back in touch with Pete Wisdom, and together they devised a plan for reactivating X-Force as a covert strike team. Meltdown, along with Warpath and Bedlam, agreed to enter into this new arrangement, and they took up residence in an abandoned Nevada Hulkbuster base for extensive retraining for martial combat and the use of their powers. In particular, Tabitha learned how to direct the explosive force of her power into streams of guided energy, and was also heavily trained in computer hacking and manipulating digital information. The revamped X-Force fought the shadow wars that other people couldn't even see, against the likes of meat-spore storm-troopers, mutagenic bioreactors and assassins who carried the mutant gene for murder. After she almost lost Sam to that last threat, Meltdown confessed she couldn't bear to see him die, and the two of them became lovers again. While most of their missions were successful, they weren't without their share of troubles - Wisdom was apparently killed on their first mission back in San Francisco since leaving, and on two separate occasions their enemies tried to kill them in massive explosions.X-Force #102 - #115 The team's undercover status turned out to be a weakness, though, for some new organization consisting of mutants that wanted to get rich and famous thought the name was up for grabs. After buying legal rights to use \\"X-Force\\" as their name, this group went public and soon became popular. When the original X-Force learned of this, they came out of hiding and confronted the new guys about the name and violating the original concept behind the team, it was already too late. Apparently, the original X-Force disbanded after this, retreating from their recent hardcore offensive stance on mutant issues. Sam and Tabitha also went their separate ways. Weapon X and the X-Force mini When Cable discovers hints regarding the existence of a revamped Weapon X program, one designed to use mutants to hunt down and intern other mutants, he creates an organization to investigate the program and the existence of its internment camp, Neverland. He dubs the organization the Underground, and invites Meltdown to join his elite group. Ultimately, Cable's Underground group is joined by Weapon X agent Brent Jackson, who hopes to stage a coup against the project's Director and has formed his own resistance group with fellow agents Washout, Marrow, Wild Child, and Sauron. Jackson betrays the Underground team however after the coup is successful and alters/wipes their memories of the events. Sometime thereafter, Cable learns of another threat to mutant-kind, the voracious creatures known as the Skornn, a creature that was going to threaten Earth. He gathers and reunites X-Force in order to deal with them. Meltdown is among the former members he recruits. While both Cannonball and Sunspot are also involved in the conflict, Tabitha's feelings for either weren't brought up. However, she reveals to have learned a new trick with her mutant powers when she channeled one of her time bombs through Shatterstar's blade straight into the chest of a seemingly unbeatable opponent. After the Skornn was also defeated, some of X-Force remains together, assisting Cable on Providence, an island nation he created. Afterwards, she helps them attack the headquarters of the Black Box, though the occupant turns out to be a robot. Tabitha is one of the few mutants who retain her powers after the events of M-Day. Nextwave Shortly afterwards, after an initial period of wild arrogance, Tabitha seems to mellow out and settle back into her earlier, more bubbly personality. She even develops a tendency to use chat room-like shorthand when speaking out loud, such as \\"OMG,\\" \\"ZOMG,\\" and \\"OH NOES!\\" She also begins to start saying \\"Tick, tick, tick-- BOOM!\\" when using her powers. Tabitha also grows her hair long and eschewed her codename and re-appears as a founding member of Nextwave, a new off-beat and more than slightly satirical super-hero team featured in an eponymous comic book series created by Warren Ellis and Stuart Immonen. The Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort, or H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the Beyond Corporation¬©) formed the team. Tabitha Smith's new team includes other second-string characters taken from Marvel limbo, including Monica Rambeau (formerly Captain Marvel, the leader of the Avengers), Elsa Bloodstone, Aaron Stack, and new character The Captain. Everything seemed on the up-and-up until Tabitha began snooping around, and discovered the marketing plan of the Beyond Corporation, H.A.T.E.'s financial backers. It turned out that Beyond Corp evolved out of the former terrorist cell known as S.I.L.E.N.T., and was planning to use H.A.T.E. and Nextwave to further its own sinister agendas. Tabitha brought the files she stole to the squad leader, Pulsar, and Nextwave hijacked a Shockwave Rider transport ship and defected from H.A.T.E. Tabitha and the others fought against their former employers, and defended the country from the unusual WMDs unleashed by the Beyond Corporation on the general populace; the first biological weapon was revealed to be Fin Fang Foom, a giant lizard which clambered from underground and proceeded to wreck the building site. After putting an end to the threat of Fin Fang Foom in Abscess, North Dakota, Nextwave moved on to Illinois. Tabitha manages to subdue Mac Mangel, a corrupt police officer who had been taken as a host by the Ultra Samurai Seed. The Ultra Samurai metallic shell disintegrates, leaving Mangel crushed. Upon learning that he was a police officer, Tabitha and Aaron began to beat Mangel before Rambeau intervened. The team were later attacked by The New Paramounts, a team consisting of Not Brand Echh characters including Forbush Man, The Inedible Bulk and Charlie America. Forbush Man attempted to use his mind control powers on Tabitha, but was shocked to find they didn't work on her as she apparently has no mind. Tabitha subsequently killed Forbush Man, saving her teammates. When they awoke, she explained \\"The little guy did something to your heads. I gave him the explodo because I am clever.\\" Not long after, they eventually exposed and destroyed the true mastermind behind S.I.L.E.N.T. Manifest Destiny Tabitha moves to San Francisco to help with the X-Men's new relocation plans, and resumes using the codename Boom-Boom. While shopping in San Francisco she confronts the mutant Nuwa.X-Men: Manifest Destiny #1 preview, Comic Book Resources Forced by the Beast to confront Nuwa through research, instead of strength alone, she discovers - using a thinly veiled parody of MySpace and FacebookRead About Comics ¬ª X-Men: Manifest Destiny #1 called FaceSpace - the true nature of Nuwa's sedation powers, then nullifies them by consuming large quantities of stimulants, namely the caffeine in an unspecified number of espressos. Kidnapping, death and salvation Tabitha is later kidnapped along with Surge and Hellion by the Leper Queen and her Sapien League. The Leper Queen attempts to inject her with a modified version of the Legacy Virus, a virus which had been cured years before that afflicted mostly mutants, when the members of X-Force arrive to try and save her, Surge and Hellion. After Cyclops refuses to wait long enough for Wolverine and Domino to kill the Leper Queen, they are sent through time to help Cable, leaving the Leper Queen and Tabitha all alone. The Leper Queen reveals to Tabitha that she had intended using X-Force to kill her, since Bastion will not let her commit suicide and that the plan was for Wolverine to kill her and rescue Tabby. The Leper Queen shoots Tabitha between the eyes, saying that X-Force \\"failed them both.\\"X-Force (vol. 3) #13 After X-Force's mission in the future is complete, X-23 emerges from the timestream seconds before the Leper Queen is about to kill Tabitha and shoots her in the head.X-Force Vol. 3 #17 With the Leper Queen dead and Boom-Boom saved, X-23 collapses in exhaustion just as a team of H.A.M.M.E.R. agents storm the building, providing Tabitha with medical care while taking X-23 into custody. The agents are given the order to take a genetic sample from Tabitha and then kill her, but one agent plans to rape her before killing her. She is saved from death yet again by Warpath, who kills the agents before they are able to defile her and takes her to the X-Force safehouse to see if she remembers anything else about her kidnapping.X-Force #18 Utopia Boom-Boom is later seen during the events of \\"Utopia,\\" amongst the mutants assembled in Nightcrawler's chapel as they all prepare to abandon San Francisco for the base that the X-Club has raised from the bottom of the ocean. She is among the first group of mutants teleported by Pixie to the new base.Dark Avengers #8 (2009) Boom-Boom was also one of the X-Men who defeated the invading Predator Xs who attacked Utopia. Boom-Boom, Iceman, and Colossus teamed up to defeat the first Predator.Uncanny X-Men #517 (2010) Cable and X-Force Boom-Boom returns in the Marvel NOW! series Cable and X-Force, aiding her old X-Force teammate Domino in her infiltration of a S.W.O.R.D. base.Cable and X-Force #6 Tabitha later appears as a member of the Utopians alongside Elixir, Karma, Madison Jeffries, Masque, and Random.All-New X-Men #40 Powers and abilities Tabitha Smith is a mutant who originally had the unusually strong ability to create variably-sized yellow orbs and spheres of pure plasma, fiery-like energy, which she calls her \\"time bombs\\". These \\"time bombs\\" explode with concussive force. She can produce marble-sized energized \\"bombs\\" which have little concussive impact and which she uses for playing pranks. She has produced \\"time bombs\\" ranging up to the size of beach balls, which are able to destroy durable objects including a Predator X,Uncanny X-Men #517 and a futuristic Nimrod.New Mutants v.3 #14 Tabitha can also control the amount of time before detonation. Finally, she can mentally muffle the sound of the detonation. She is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, coached in unarmed combat by Cable. She loves video games and is an accomplished thief, having been trained by the Vanisher. Under the direction of Pete Wisdom she learned to focus her power as streams of concussive force.First used in issue X-Force (1991) #102, and recap of training seen in issue X-Force (1991) #107 In Nextwave, her mutant abilities are summarized as \\"the mutant ability to blow things up and steal all your stuff\\". She also has access to technological support, such as jetpacks. She was apparently immune to Forbush Man's mind-warping abilities, because she supposedly had no mind to warp. Other versions=House of M Tabitha appears as a member of the NYPD strikeforce known as the Brotherhood.House of M: Avengers #2 Posing as Karolina Dean, she attacked and defeated the Wolfpack.House of M: Avengers #4 Marvel Zombies Tabitha is also shown in Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness #3 with her Nextwave team, all uninfected, in order to save Ash from a zombified Power Pack. The entire team is \\"humiliatingly and ruthlessly dispatched off panel\\" moments later. Rahne of Terra In the \\"heroic fantasy\\" universe visited by Wolfsbane and Wolverine in Rahne of Terra and Knight of Terra (though Tabitha does not appear in the latter in any form), Geshem is an otherdimensional realm of medieval magic. The land is ruled by Queen Rain, a counterpart of Wolfsbane, and that dimension's Tabitha is her most loyal and trusted maid. Rain confides in Tabitha with her deepest secrets.Wolverine: Rahne of Terra graphic novel (August 1991) X-Men: The End In X-Men: The End, a series set ten to fifteen years in the future, Meltdown is once again a member of X-Force along with Warpath, Domino, Shatterstar, Feral, and Rictor when the team meets their end. After their aircraft is shot out of the sky, (which X-Force barely survives), Meltdown is absorbed by the strange entity called Divinity, who uses Tabitha's powers against her teammates. Not much later, though, Divinity is killed by Apocalypse while Meltdown is still trapped inside him. X-Force: Shatterstar In the X-Force: Shatterstar miniseries, Tabitha is still known as Boomer and she is seen as a part of Cable's rebel forces against Spiral, in an alternate universe where Spiral has conquered and now rules Earth. On that Earth, Spiral has also killed most of that world's heroes and mutants. Together, the team eventually defeats Spiral. Tabitha also seems to have developed telepathic powers in this timeline. In other media=Television * Tabitha Smith appeared in the X-Men animated series. This version was a young child, along with Rusty, Whiz-Kid, and Skids. In the episode \\"No Mutant is an Island\\", she is among the mutant children that Cyclops' old friend Sarah takes care of, and Scott Summers has to rescue her and the other kids from Zebediah Killgrave. Killgrave brainwashes the four and uses them to storm the governor's mansion to make into a mind-controlled slave. * Tabitha Smith / Boom-Boom appears in X-Men: Evolution, voiced by Megan Leitch. Originally one of the New Mutants, Tabitha has a troubled past and a criminal father. Her father took advantage of her mutant abilities to commit crimes when she was younger. She eventually finds a home at the Xavier Institute, although her lack of discipline and mischievousness make her a troublesome guest. In \\"Bada-Bing Bada-Boom!\\", she's romantically flirting and bonding with Kurt Wagner, whom she sees as someone similar to her since they are both outcasts.X-Men: Evolution - Ep. 16 \\"Bada-Bing Bada-Boom!\\" Tabitha moves in with the Brotherhood of Mutants, saying that there are too many rules at the Xavier Institute. She often plays practical jokes on the boys (such as shaving off Blob's Mohawk while he slept) and abuses their hospitality, though little is done to stop her. At times she aids them, taking the unpopular Blob and Toad as her dates for the party in \\"Shadow Dance\\". Tabitha never takes up a villainous role and she is evicted upon Mystique's return.X-Men: Evolution - Ep. 29 \\"Day of Reckoning\\" Part One Her role in the series was significantly diminished afterward; she appears to rejoin the X-Men and appears mostly in the company of her best friend Magma from the New Mutants, appearing in several episodes afterwards with no serious loyalties.

Founded during the American Civil War as Fort Cass and Fort Whipple, the post merged in 2005 with the neighboring Marine Corps installation, Henderson Hall, and is today named Joint Base Myer‚ÄìHenderson Hall. History In 1861, the land that Fort Myer would eventually occupy was part of the Arlington estate, which Mary Anna Custis Lee, the wife of Robert E. Lee, owned and at which Lee resided when not stationed elsewhere (see Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial).Staff of the Fort Myer Post, p. 4 When the Civil War began, the Commonwealth of Virginia seceded from the United States, Lee resigned his commission, and he and his wife left the estate. The United States Government then confiscated the estate and began to use it as a burial ground for Union Army dead (see Arlington National Cemetery), to house freed slaves (Freedmen's Village),(1) .

Fort Craig and surrounding area including Fort Whipple and Fort Cass (1865) Fort Cass Fort Cass Historical Marker Shortly after the Union Army's rout at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) in late July 1861, the Army constructed in August 1861 a lunette (Fort Ramsay) on the future grounds of Fort Myer. One of the first fortifications built on the Arlington Line, the lunette was located at and near the present post's Forest Circle. Later renamed to Fort Cass, the lunette had a perimeter of and emplacements for 12 guns.(1) Cooling and Owen, pp. 104-105: Touring the Forts South of the Potomac: Fort Cass.

Nevins and officers in front of headquarters, Fort Whipple; mourning crepe drawn over doors and windows Battery No. 2 at Fort Whipple Following the Union Army's defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) in August 1862, the Army constructed Fort Whipple on the grounds of the former Arlington estate during the spring of 1863. The fort was located a short distance southeast of Fort Cass. The Army named the fort after Brevet Major General Amiel Weeks Whipple, who died in May 1863 of wounds received during the Battle of Chancellorsville.Staff of the Fort Myer Post, p. 6 The fort was considered to be one of the strongest fortifications erected for the defense of Washington during the Civil War.

(See: Official Records of the War > of the Rebellion) The Civil War ended in 1865. Fort Whipple, with its fortifications abandoned, then became the home of the Signal School of Instruction for Army and Navy Officers, established in 1869. Fort Myer On February 4, 1881, the Army post containing Fort Whipple was renamed Fort Myer as an honor to Brigadier General Albert J. Myer, who had commanded the newly established Signal School of Instruction for Army and Navy Officers from 1869 until he died in August 1880. Since then, the post has been a Signal Corps post, a showcase for the US Army's cavalry, and, since the 1940s, home to the Army's elite ceremonial units‚ÄîThe United States Army Band (\\"Pershing's Own\\") and the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (\\"The Old Guard\\"). The National Weather Service was originated there by General Albert J. Myer in 1870. Fort Myer was the site of the first flight of an aircraft at a military installation. Several exhibition flights by Orville Wright took place there in 1908 and 1909. On September 18, 1908 it became the location of the first aviation fatality, as Lt. Thomas Selfridge was killed when on a demonstration flight with Orville, at an altitude of about , a propeller split, sending the aircraft out of control. Selfridge suffered a concussion in the crash and later died, the first person to die in powered fixed-wing aircraft. Orville was badly injured, suffering broken ribs and a leg. Quarters One on Fort Myer, which was originally built as the garrison commander's quarters, has been the home of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army since 1908 when Major General J. Franklin Bell took up residence. It has been the home of every succeeding Chief of Staff, except for General John J. Pershing. The first radio telecommunications NAA was at Fort Myer in 1913. The US Navy built \\"The Three Sisters\\" which were three radio towers that established the first communication across the sea to Paris, France in 1915. Lee Boulevard addition to Fort Myer Reservation in 1929 During World War I, Fort Myer was a staging area for a large number of engineering, artillery, and chemical companies and regiments. The area of Fort Myer now occupied by Andrew Rader Health Clinic and the Commissary were made into a trench-system training grounds where French officers taught the Americans about trench warfare. General George S. Patton Jr., who was posted at Fort Myer four different times, started the charitable \\"Society Circus\\" after World War I. He ultimately was Post Commander and commanded the 3rd Cavalry Regiment that was stationed at Fort Myer from the 1920s to 1942 when the regiment was sent to Georgia to get mechanized. In late 2001, troops, deployed in response to the September 11th attacks, were bivouacked at Fort Myer. These troops were under Operation Noble Eagle.Operation Noble Eagle These included both active and National Guard Military Police units from around the nation. In 2005 the last remaining deployed responders were demobilized. Joint Base Myer‚ÄìHenderson Hall As a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission initiative to create more efficiency of efforts, the Army's Fort Myer and the Marines' Henderson Hall became the first Joint Base in the Department of Defense. Joint Base Myer‚ÄìHenderson Hall (JBMHH) consists of military installations at Fort Myer, Virginia, Crystal City, The Pentagon, Fort McNair, the District of Columbia, and Henderson Hall ‚Äì Headquarters Marine Corps, Virginia. These installations and departments serve over 150,000 active duty, DoD civilian, and retired military personnel in the region. Commemorative The fort was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1972, for its well-preserved concentration of cavalry facilities and officers' quarters, and for its importance in military aviation history. On September 1, 1970, the United States Postal Service issued its first day cover of a postcard celebrating the 100th anniversary of Weather Services at Fort Myer. A pamphlet and one book have been published about Fort Myer.(1) Staff of the Fort Myer Post.

Audio editing software can be implemented completely or partly as a library, as a computer application, as a web application, or as a loadable kernel module. Wave Editors are digital audio editors and there are many sources of software available to perform this function. Most can edit music, apply effects and filters, adjust stereo channels, etc. A digital audio workstation (DAW) consists of software to a great degree, and usually is composed of many distinct software suite components, giving access to them through a unified graphical user interface using GTK, Qt, or other library for the GUI widgets. For use with music Editors designed for use with music typically allow the user to do the following: *The ability to import and export various audio file formats for editing *Record audio from one or more inputs and store recordings in the computer's memory as digital audio *Edit the start time, stop time, and duration of any sound on the audio timeline *Fade into or out of a clip (e.g. an S-fade out during applause after a performance), or between clips (e.g. crossfading between takes) *Mix multiple sound sources/tracks, combine them at various volume levels and pan from channel to channel to one or more output tracks *Apply simple or advanced effects or filters, including compression, expansion, flanging, reverb, audio noise reduction, and equalization to change the audio *Playback sound (often after being mixed) that can be sent to one or more outputs, such as speakers, additional processors, or a recording medium *Conversion between different audio file formats, or between different sound quality levels Typically these tasks can be performed in a manner that is non- linear. Audio editors may process the audio data non-destructively in real- time, or destructively as an \\"off-line\\" process, or a hybrid with some real- time effects and some off-line effects. Comparison of destructive and real- time editing Destructive editing modifies the data of the original audio file, as opposed to just editing its playback parameters. Destructive editors are also known as \\"sample editors\\". Destructive editing applies edits and processing directly to the audio data, changing the data immediately. If, for example, part of a track is deleted, the \\"deleted\\" audio data is immediately removed from that part of the track. Real-time editing does not apply changes immediately, but applies edits and processing on the fly during playback. If, for example, part of a track is deleted, the \\"deleted\\" audio data is not actually removed from the track, but is hidden and will be skipped on playback. Advantages of destructive editing *In graphical editors, every change to the audio is usually visible immediately as the visible waveform is updated to match the audio data. *The number of effects that may be applied is virtually unlimited (though may be limited by disk space available for \\"undo\\" data). *Editing is usually precise down to exact sample intervals. *Effects may be applied to a precisely specified selected region. *Mixing down or exporting the edited audio is usually relatively quick as little additional processing is required. Limitations of destructive editing *Once an effect has been applied, it cannot usually be changed. This is usually mitigated by the ability to \\"undo\\" the last performed action. Typically a destructive audio editor will maintain many levels of \\"undo history\\" so that multiple actions may be undone in the reverse order that they were applied. *Edits can only be undone in the reverse order that they were applied (undoing the most recent edit first). Advantages of real-time editing *Effects can usually be adjusted during playback, or at any other time. *Edits may be undone or adjusted at any time in any order. *Multiple effects and edits may be 'stacked' so that they are applied to the audio as an effect chain. *A stack of effects may be changed so that effects are applied in a different order, or effects inserted or removed from the chain. *Some real-time editors support effect automation so that changes to effect parameters may be programmed to occur at specified times during audio playback. Limitations of real-time editing *The waveform does not usually show the effect of processing until the audio has been mixed-down or \\"bounced\\" (rendered) to another track. *The number of effects that may be applied is limited by the available processing power of the computer or editing hardware. In some editors this may be mitigated by \\"freezing\\" the track (applying the effect stack destructively). *It is not usually possible to have an effect only on part of a track. To apply a real-time effect to part of a track usually required that the effect is set to turn on at one point and turn off at another. *In multi-track editors, if audio is copied or moved from one track to another, the audio in the new track may sound different from how it sounded in the original track as there may be different real-time effects in each track. *In some applications, mixing down or exporting the edited audio may be slow as all effects and processing needs to be applied. For use with speech Editors designed for use in speech research add the ability to make measurements and perform acoustic analyses such as extracting and displaying a fundamental frequency contour or spectrogram. They typically lacks most or all of the effects that interest musicians.

They are among the smallest waterfowl in the world and are found in small to large waterbodies with good aquatic vegetation. They are usually seen in pairs or larger groups of pairs, roosting and nesting on trees near water. They are strong fliers and are known to disperse widely, especially in winter. Their breeding season coincides with the rains. Description Male in flight, the white band on the dark wing is broad. The green gloss on the upper wing coverts is distinctive. Small individuals of this species are the smallest waterfowl on earth, at as little as and . The goose-like bill is short and deep at the base. Males have a dark brown forehead and crown and a blackish green broad collar at the base of the neck. The sides of the head and neck are whitish. The back, wing coverts and scapulars are dark brown with green and purple gloss. The female has a duller cap and a brown line through the eye. The collar is replaced by spots and the face is flecked and neck finely vermiculated unlike the male. The non-breeding or eclipse male resembles the female except that it has the broader white wing band. In flight the male has dark wings with white flight feathers tipped in black. The female has dark wings and a white trailing edge to the secondaries and a few inner primaries. They have a red iris and black legs (greenish in breeding males) and bill. Downy chicks have white superciliary stripes that meet at the back of the head which is black. A short dark eye stripe is present on the whitish face. The upperside of the neck is grey. The mantle is grey brown and two white patches are present on the scapulars. The tail is dark grey to black. The underside is buff. Female in flight, the white trailing edge is restricted mainly to the secondaries. The hind toe is narrowly lobed. The nostril is small and oval and opens close to the base of the commissure of the bill.  Taxonomy and systematics  The cotton pygmy goose was first described and given a binomial name by Gmelin in 1789 who called it Anas coromandeliana. The French naturalist Buffon had called it Sarcelle de Coromandel. It was then placed under Cheniscus before being relatively stably placed in the genus Nettapus within the tribe Cairinini that includes other perching ducks. It is one of three species in the genus, noted for sexual dimorphism, and is the only species in which there is a marked difference in the non-breeding plumage of the males. Two subspecies are recognized. The nominate form is found in India, Asia extending east to New Guinea. The population in eastern Australia is placed in the subspecies albipennis (first described by Gould in 1842). It is marginally larger in dimensions. Distribution and habitat Female with dark eye-stripe, nominate population (Thailand) This species is widely distributed across Asia, its distribution extending to Australia. Population move in response to rain and water availability. Some populations disperse further in summer (and are found only seasonally, for instance in Afghanistan). Winter dispersal is also wide and individuals have been seen as far west as Arabia, and Jordan and they are regularly found on islands in the region such as the Maldives and the Andamans. They are found especially in lakes and ponds with emergent vegetation amid which they forage. They can be found even in small village ponds in South Asia. In Australia they are found mainly in lagoons. They are said to roost on trees. Behaviour and ecology Several pairs of the bird may forage in close proximity on a single waterbody. Large flocks form in winter and a flock of nearly 6000 was recorded at Chilka lake. This species feeds mainly at the surface of the water. Stomach analysis showed that they fed on small fishes Puntius, Mystus, Oryzias, molluscs, crustaceans, insect larvae as well as plant matter from species such as Ipomoea, Hydrilla and Ruppia. They do not dive or up-end and take to flight from the water surface without having to run or patter on the surface. They fly swiftly, often low over water, and are agile enough to escape falcons. Courtship displays are largely undocumented but a post-copulatory display involves the male arching neck, displaying the white neck feathers and the white wing patches. They pair up during the breeding season which is mainly during the rains (monsoons in June‚ÄìAugust India and January to March in Australia) and build their nests mainly in natural tree hollows, such as tree trunks. The males assist in locating nests but incubation is thought to be by the female alone which lays 6 to 12 ivory-colored eggs per clutch. The nest may as high as five metres from the ground and chicks leap off to follow their parents into water. Larger clutches have been recorded and are thought to be due to intraspecific brood-parasitism. Rock pythons have been recorded preying on cotton teal. Plasmodium circumflexum was found in their blood of a specimen examined in Bangladesh. Three species of parasitic cestode Hymenolepis smythi, H. fista and Retinometra fista are known from hosts of the species. The trematode Cyclocoelum sp. was recorded as a parasite in Queensland. Paramonostomum thapari was described from a cotton teal.  In culture  They were hunted with shotguns especially in British India, although they were not considered particularly good eating. Eggs were collected for food and the birds were sold in large numbers in the birds markets of Calcutta in the 19th century. Fishermen in the Sunderbans set up twenty-foot high nets and drove birds on the water toward the nets before alarming them and getting them to fly into the nets. Injured birds were noted to submerge and hide themselves with only the head or bill out of water. In Burma, birds have been recorded nesting within buildings. Sir Harcourt Butler noted a nest at a height of under the eaves of the roof of the residence of the governor in Rangoon. Hume noted that the numbers of migratory ducks sold in the Calcutta markets declined over ten years but not those of the cotton teal. He also noted their tameness, dabbling about within ten yards of a village washerman noisily thrashing clothes. The Sinhala name of or flower teal is based on the colours and possibly the habitat of lily-covered ponds. Many native names (such as lerreget-perreget) are onomatopoeic. The name \\"cotton teal\\" was used by Europeans near Bombay who noted that the bird had a lot of white feathers. They produce a low quacky call which has been likened to quacky duck, quacky duck or fixed bayonets (in British India). Samuel Tickell recorded a Kol name from Singhbum of Merom-derebet, merom being a goat and the call likened to a bleat.

He was the president of the American Museum of Natural History for 25 years. Early life and education Osborn in 1890 Henry Fairfield Osborn was born in Fairfield, Connecticut on August 8, 1857. He was the eldest son of prominent railroad tycoon William Henry Osborn and his wife, Virginia Reed (n√©e Sturges) Osborn. His younger brother was William Church Osborn, who served as president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and married philanthropist and social reformer Alice Clinton Hoadley Dodge, a daughter of William E. Dodge Jr. His maternal grandparents were Jonathan Sturges, a prominent New York businessman and arts patron who was a direct descendant of Jonathan Sturges, a U.S. Representative from Connecticut, and Mary Pemberton Cady, a direct descendant of prominent educator Ebenezer Pemberton. His maternal aunt Amelia Sturges, was the first wife of J. P. Morgan, but died of tuberculosis soon after their wedding. From 1873 to 1877, Osborn studied at Princeton University, obtaining a B.A. in geology and archaeology, where he was mentored by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. Two years later, Osborn took a special course of study in anatomy in the College of Physicians and Surgeons and Bellevue Medical School of New York under Dr. William H. Welch, and subsequently studied embryology and comparative anatomy under Thomas Huxley as well as Francis Maitland Balfour at Cambridge University, England.\\"After Twenty Years:The Record of the Class of 1877\\", Princeton University, 1877‚Äì1897, p. 72. Trenton, N. J. 189.\\"Henry Fairfield Osborn (1857‚Äì1935)\\", Hervey W. Shimer, Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vol. 72, No. 10, May, 1938, pp. 377‚Äì379. In 1880, Osborn obtained a Sc.D. in paleontology from Princeton, becoming a lecturer in Biology and Professor of Comparative Anatomy from the same university between 1883 and 1890. Career In 1891, Osborn was hired by Columbia University as a professor of zoology; simultaneously, he accepted a position at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, where he served as the curator of a newly formed Department of Vertebrate Paleontology. As a curator, he assembled a remarkable team of fossil hunters and preparators, including William King Gregory; Roy Chapman Andrews, a possible inspiration for the creation of the fictional archeologist Indiana Jones; and Charles R. Knight, who made murals of dinosaurs in their habitats and sculptures of the living creatures. On November 23, 1897 he was elected member of the Boone and Crockett Club, a wildlife conservation organization founded by Theodore Roosevelt and George Bird Grinnell. Thanks to his considerable family wealth and personal connections, he succeeded Morris K. Jesup as the president of the museum's Board of Trustees in 1908, serving until 1933, during which time he accumulated one of the finest fossil collections in the world.Biographical Memoir of Henry Fairfield Osborn, 1857-1935 by William K. Gregory Additionally, Osborn served as President of the New York Zoological Society from 1909 to 1925. Osborn (third from the right) with other officers of the paleontology section of the St Louis Congress Long a member of the US Geological Survey, Osborn became its senior vertebrate paleontologist in 1924. He led many fossil-hunting expeditions into the American Southwest, starting with his first to Colorado and Wyoming in 1877. Osborn conducted research on Tyrannosaurus brains by cutting open fossilized braincases with a diamond saw.\\"Introduction,\\" in Larsson (2001). Pg. 20. (Modern researchers use computed tomography scans and 3D reconstruction software to visualize the interior of dinosaur endocrania without damaging valuable specimens.)\\"Abstract,\\" in Larsson (2001). Pg. 19. He accumulated a number of prizes for his work in paleontology. In 1901, Osborn was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He described and named Ornitholestes in 1903, Tyrannosaurus rex and Albertosaurus in 1905, Pentaceratops in 1923, and Velociraptor in 1924. In 1929 Osborn was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. Despite his considerable scientific stature during the 1900s and 1910s, Osborn's scientific achievements have not held up well, for they were undermined by continuous efforts to bend scientific findings to fit his own racist and eugenist viewpoints. His legacy at the American Museum has proved more enduring. Biographer Ronald Rainger has described Osborn as \\"a first-rate science administrator and a third-rate scientist.\\"See Ronald Rainger, An Agenda for Antiquity: Henry Fairfield Osborn and Vertebrate Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, 1890‚Äì1935 (Tuscaloose, AB: University of Alabama, 1991). Indeed, Osborn's greatest contributions to science ultimately lay in his efforts to popularize it through visual means. At his urging, staff members at the American Museum of Natural History invested new energy in display, and the museum became one of the pre-eminent sites for exhibition in the early twentieth century as a result. The murals, habitat dioramas, and dinosaur mounts executed during his tenure at the museum attracted millions of visitors, and inspired other museums to imitate his innovations.On the American Museum's habitat dioramas, see http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/dioramas/; Karen Wonders. Habitat Dioramas, (Figura Nova Series 25: Acta Universitatis Uppsaliensis, 1993). But his decision to invest heavily in exhibition also alienated certain members of the scientific community and angered curators hoping to spend more time on their own research.Victoria Cain, \\"The Art of Authority: Exhibits, Exhibit Makers and the Contest for Scientific Status at the American Museum of Natural History, 1920‚Äì1940.\\" Science in Context 24, no. 2 (2011). Additionally, his efforts to imbue the museum's exhibits and educational programs with his own racist and eugenist beliefs disturbed many of his contemporaries and have marred his legacy.Donna Haraway, \\"Teddy Bear Patriarchy,\\" Primate Visions: Gender, Race and Nature in the World of Modern Science. (New York: Routledge, 1989). Also see Constance Clark, God ‚Äì or Gorilla: Images of Evolution in the Jazz Age.

Theories=Dawn Man Theory Osborn developed his own evolutionary theory of human origins called the \\"Dawn Man Theory\\". His theory was founded on the discovery of Piltdown Man (Eoanthropus) which was dated to the Late (Upper) Pliocene. Writing before Piltdown was exposed as a hoax, the Eoanthropus or \\"Dawn Man\\" Osborn maintained sprang from a common ancestor with the ape during the Oligocene period which he believed developed entirely separately during the Miocene (16 million years ago). Therefore, Osborn argued that all apes (Simia, following the pre-Darwinian classification of Linnaeus) had evolved entirely parallel to the ancestors of man (homo).\\"Recent Discoveries Relating to the Origin and Antiquity of Man\\", Henry Fairfield Osborn, Science, New Series, Vol. 65, No. 1690, May 20, 1927, pp. 481‚Äì488.\\"Man was Never an Ape\\", Popular Science, 1927, Aug 1927, Vol. 111, No. 2, p. 35.\\"The Hunt for the Dawn Monkey: Unearthing the Origins of Monkeys, Apes, and Humans\\", Christopher Beard, University of California Press, 2006.\\"Human evolution: an illustrated introduction\\", Roger Lewin, Wiley-Blackwell, 2005, p. 15. Osborn himself wrote: While believing in common ancestry between man and ape, Osborn denied that this ancestor was ape-like. The common ancestor between man and ape Osborn always maintained was more human than ape. Writing to Arthur Keith in 1927, he remarked \\"when our Oligocene ancestor is found it will not be an ape, but it will be surprisingly pro-human\\".Lewin, 1997, p. 56. His student William K. Gregory called Osborn's idiosyncratic view on man's origins as a form of \\"Parallel Evolution\\", but many creationists misinterpreted Osborn, greatly frustrating him, and believed he was asserting humankind had never evolved from a lower life form.Lewin, 1997, p. 57. Evolutionary views Osborn was originally a supporter of Edward Drinker Cope's neo-Lamarckism, however he later abandoned this view. Osborn became a proponent of organic selection, also known as the Baldwin effect.Levit, Georgy S; Olsson, Lennart. (2007). Evolution on Rails Mechanisms and Levels of Orthogenesis. In Volker Wissemann. Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology 11/2006. Universit√§tsverlag G√∂ttingen. pp. 107-108. Osborn was a believer in orthogenesis; he coined the term aristogenesis for his theory. His aristogenesis was based on a \\"physicochemical approach\\" to evolution. He believed that aristogenes operate as biomechanisms in the geneplasm of the organism. He also held the view that mutations and natural selection play no creative role in evolution and that aristogenesis was the origin of new novelty.Regal, Brian. (2002). Henry Fairfield Osborn: Race, and the Search for the Origins of Man. Ashgate. pp. 184-192. Osborn equated this struggle for evolutionary advancement with the striving for spiritual salvation, thereby combining his biological and spiritual viewpoints.Brian Regal, Henry Fairfield Osborn: Race and the Search for the Origins of Man (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002), xii. Race He advocated the common view of the time, namely that heredity is superior to influences from the environment. As an extension of this, he accepted that distinct races existed with fixed hereditary traits, and held the Nordic or Anglo-Saxon \\"race\\" to be highest. Osborn therefore supported eugenics to preserve \\"good\\" racial stock. Due to this, he endorsed Madison Grant's The Passing of the Great Race, writing both the second and fourth prefaces of the book, which argued for such views.The Passing of the Great Race, by Madison Grant, pp. vii-xiii The book was also largely influential on Adolf Hitler. Hitler called the book, ‚Äòhis bible‚Äô for it advocated a rigid system of selection through the elimination of those who are weak or unfit.Stefan K√ºhl. 2002. Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism. Oxford University Press, p. 85 Personal life Castle Rock in Garrison, New York, 2009. In June 1881, Osborn was married to writer Lucretia Thatcher Perry (1858‚Äì1930) at the military chapel on Governors Island. She was the daughter of Brigadier General Alexander James Perry and Josephine (n√©e Adams) Perry, and the granddaughter of Nathaniel Hazard Perry (brother of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and youngest son of Justice Christopher Raymond Perry). Lucretia's sister, Josephine Adams Perry, was the wife of banker Junius Spencer Morgan II. Together, Henry and Lucretia were the parents of: * Alexander Perry Osborn (1884‚Äì1951), a lawyer and banker who married Marie Cantrell (1903‚Äì1988). * Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr. (1887‚Äì1969), who married Marjorie Mary Lamond (1892‚Äì1989). * Gurdon Saltonstall Osborn (1895‚Äì1896), who died young. After his father's death in 1894, Osborn inherited his Rhenish style home, Castle Rock, in Garrison, New York in the Hudson Highlands, which his father had purchased in 1859, and where he concentrated on his philanthropy after his 1882 retirement. After his mother's death in 1902, the remainder of his parent's estate was equally divided between Henry and his brother William. Following an \\"illness of nearly a year\\", his wife died at their country home in August 1930. Osborn died suddenly on November 6, 1935 in his study at Castle Rock, overlooking the Hudson River.

Each school has several different types of teams that compete against other schools. These contests are organized by FFA advisors and local experts. The purpose of these competitions is to determine which team and individuals have the best ability to evaluate a particular animal or item as compared to an \\"official\\". The official placings and answers are set by an expert in the discipline. Officials are often from agricultural universities or USDA employees. One of the most popular competitions is Livestock Judging. This is where teams of four students judge a series of classes (usually of four animals each) and rank them based on criteria to choose the most superior animal (e.g. muscling, conformation). In Livestock judging, students only judge cattle, pigs and lambs; classes consist of animals in some cases from all over the region. Part of the contest is to give \\"reasons\\". This is basically a short persuasive speech in which the contestant explains their evaluation of the animals to an official for a score (0-50). Another popular competition is Horse judging. This is similar to livestock, but students only evaluate horses again in classes of four. They evaluate the animals based on criteria such as conformation, gait, and muscling. Reasons are also given in Horse judging. Meat judging is also popular and consists of teams of 4 students. Meat judging is based on several contest areas and only includes pork, beef and lamb. Contest areas include class placing (four similar cuts or carcasses of meat evaluated on muscle, fat and bone), identification (correctly identifying the type of cut and where it came from on the animal) and carcass grading (determining the quality and yield grading of a beef carcass). Each state has statewide competitions each year in which students compete for the state title in each contest area. Many of the state winners go on to compete in national competitions (some held at the National FFA convention). There are many other contest areas including: *Agricultural Mechanics *Agronomy *Wool *Land *Homesite *Pasture & Range *Horticulture *Wildlife *Floriculture *Farm Business Management *Landscape Design *Crops *Entomology *Dairy Foods *Forestry  Cultural references  In the 2004 comedy film, Napoleon Dynamite, the title character tastes defects in milk while competing in a Dairy Competition.

It is a large deciduous, broad-leaved tree, tolerant of wind and coastal exposure. It is native to Central Europe and Western Asia, from France eastwards to Ukraine, northern Turkey and the Caucasus and southwards in the mountains of northern Spain and Italy. The sycamore establishes itself easily from seed and was introduced to the British Isles by 1500, and is now naturalised there and in other parts of Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand where it may become an invasive species. The sycamore can grow to a height of about and the branches form a broad, rounded crown. The bark is grey, smooth when young and later flaking in irregular patches. The leaves grow on long leafstalks and are large and palmate, with five large radiating lobes. The flowers are greenish-yellow and hang in dangling flowerheads called panicles. They produce copious amounts of pollen and nectar that are attractive to insects. The winged seeds or samaras are borne in pairs and twirl to the ground when ripe. They germinate freely in the following spring. In its native range, the sycamore is associated with a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard-wearing, creamy- white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar.  Taxonomy and etymology  Acer pseudoplatanus was first described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum in 1753. It is the type species in the maple genus Acer. Many forms and varieties have been proposed, including natural varieties such as var. macrocarpum Spach, var. microcarpum Spach, and var. tomentosum Tausch, and forms such as f. erythrocarpum (Carri√®re) Pax, f. purpureum (Loudon) Rehder, and f. variegatum (Weston) Rehder. These are all now considered to be synonyms of Acer pseudoplatanus L. The specific name pseudoplatanus refers to the superficial similarity of the leaves and bark of the sycamore to those of plane trees in the genus Platanus, the prefix pseudo- (from Ancient Greek) meaning \\"false\\". However, the two genera are in different families that are only distantly related. Acer and Platanus differ in the position in which leaves are attached to the stem (alternate in Platanus, paired or opposite in Acer) and in their fruit, which are spherical clusters in Platanus and paired samaras (winged fruit) in Acer. The common name \\"sycamore\\" originally applied to the fig species Ficus sycomorus, the sycamore or sycomore referred to in the Bible, that is native to southwest Asia. Other common names for the tree include false plane-tree, great maple, Scottish maple, mount maple, mock-plane, or Celtic maple.  Description  Illustration of twigs, buds, leaves, flowers and fruits Acer pseudoplatanus can form a broad, domed crown Acer pseudoplatanus in early October in Lower Austria The sycamore is a large, broadleaved deciduous tree that reaches tall at maturity, the branches forming a broad, domed crown. The bark of young trees is smooth and grey but becomes rougher with age and breaks up into scales, exposing the pale-brown-to-pinkish inner bark. Sycamore shoot tip in winter with a green terminal bud and paired green lateral buds The buds are produced in opposite pairs, ovoid (approximately oval in shape) and pointed, with the bud scales (the modified leaves that enclose and protect the bud) green, edged in dark brown and with dark brown tips, . When the leaves are shed they leave horseshoe shaped marks called leaf scars on the stem. The leaves are opposite, large, long and broad, palmate with 5 pointed lobes that are coarsely toothed or serrated. They have a leathery texture with thick veins protruding on the underside. They are dark green in colour with a paler underside. Some cultivars have purple-tinged or yellowish leaves. The leaf stalk or petiole is long, is often tinged red with no stipules or leaf-like structures at the base. The monoecious (or bisexual) yellow-green flowers are produced after the leaves in early summer, in May or June in the British Isles, on pendulous panicles long with about 60‚Äì100 flowers on each stalk. The fruits are paired winged seeds or samaras, the seeds in diameter, each with a wing long developed as an extension of the ovary wall. The wings are held at about right angles to each other, distinguishing them from those of A. platanoides and A. campestre, in which the wings are almost opposite, and from those of A. saccharum, in which they are almost parallel. When shed, the wing of the samara catches the wind and rotates the fruit as it falls, slowing its descent and enabling the wind to disperse it further from the parent tree. The seeds are mature in autumn about four months after pollination. The sycamore is tetraploid (each cell having four sets of chromosomes, 2n=52), whereas A. campestre and A. platanoides are diploid (with 2 sets of chromosomes, 2n=26).  Botany  Sycamore trees produce their flowers in hanging branched clusters known as panicles that contain a variety of different flower types. Most are morphologically bisexual, with both male and female organs, but function as if they were unisexual. Some are both morphologically and functionally male, others morphologically bisexual but function as males, and still others are morphologically bisexual but function as females. All of the flower types can produce pollen, but the pollen from functionally female flowers does not germinate. All flowers produce nectar, the functionally female flowers producing it in greater volume and with a higher sugar content. Sycamore trees are very variable across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self- pollination, which is undesirable because it limits the genetic variation of the progeny and may depress their vigour. Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. On any one tree, one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates in different parts of the crown, and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks, so that cross-pollination is encouraged, although self-pollination may not be completely prevented. The sycamore may hybridise with other species in Acer section Acer, including with A. heldreichii where their natural ranges overlap and with A.velutinum. Intersectional hybrids with A. griseum (Acer section Trifoliata) are also known, in which the basal lobes of the leaf are reduced in size, making the leaves appear almost three-lobed (trifoliate).  Distribution  The sycamore is native to central and eastern Europe and western Asia. Its natural range includes Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, southern Russia, Spain, Switzerland and the former Yugoslavia. Reports of it occurring in eastern Turkey have been found to refer to A. heldreichii subsp. trautvetteri. It was probably introduced into Britain in the Tudor period by 1500 and was first recorded in the wild in 1632 in Kent. The date of its first introduction into Ireland is unclear, but the oldest specimen in Ireland is in County Cavan and dates from the seventeenth century. It was introduced into Sweden around 1770 with seeds obtained from Holland. The lack of old native names for it has been used to demonstrate its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487, but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least as far back as the Gaelic settlement at D√°l Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention. At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte, a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500. Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89.7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species. The sycamore has been introduced to suitable locations outside Europe as an attractive tree for park, street or garden. These include the United States, Canada, Australia (Victoria and Tasmania), Chile and New Zealand, Patagonia and the laurel forests of Madeira and the Azores. At the time of its introduction it was probably not appreciated that its prolific production of seeds might one day cause a problem to the landscape as it spread and out-competed native species. The tree is now considered to be an environmental weed in some parts of Australia (Yarra Ranges, Victoria) and also Mount Macedon, near Daylesford, parts of the Dandenong Ranges, where it is naturalised in the eucalypt forests. The sycamore is also scattered in north-eastern Tasmania and also at Taroona, near the Derwent River, in southern Hobart. It is considered to be an invasive species in New Zealand, Norway, and environmentally sensitive locations in the United Kingdom. In about 1870, the sycamore was introduced into the United States, and was planted in New York and New Jersey. It was later cultivated as a park or street tree in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. By the early part of the 21st century, it was naturalised in fourteen states (Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington, D.C.), and in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Ontario. The United States Department of Agriculture considers it an invasive species.  Ecology  tar spot In its native range, the sycamore is a natural component of birch (Betula sp.), beech (Fagus sp.) and fir (Abies sp.) forests. It readily invades disturbed habitats such as forest plantations, abandoned farmland and brownfield land, railway lines and roadsides verges, hedgerows, native and semi-natural woodland and, in New Zealand, high country tussock grassland. As an introduced, invasive species it may degrade the laurel forest in Madeira and Portugal and is a potential threat to the rare endemic Madeiran orchid, Dactylorhiza foliosa. It is tolerant of a wide range of soil types and pH, except heavy clay, and is at its best on nutrient-rich slightly calcareous soils. The roots of the sycamore form highly specific beneficial mycorrhizal associations with the fungus Glomus hoi which promotes phosphorus uptake from the soil. Sycamore mycorrhizas are of the internal arbuscular mycorrhizal type, in which the fungus grows within the tissues of the root and forms branched, tree-like structures within the cells of the root cortex. The larvae of a number of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the sycamore moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple. The tree may also be attacked by the horse chestnut scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap from the trunk and branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves. The sycamore gall mite Eriophyes macrorhynchus produces small red galls, similar to those of the nail gall mite Eriophyes tiliae, on leaves of sycamore and field maple, Acer campestris from April onwards. Another mite, Aceria pseudoplatani causes a 'sycamore felt gall' on the underside of leaves of both sycamore and Norway maple (Acer platanoides). The sycamore aphid Drepanosiphum platanoidis sucks sap from buds and foliage, producing large quantities of sticky honeydew that contaminate foliage, cars and garden furniture beneath. The sycamore is susceptible to sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown and the death of branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper‚Äôs disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.  Toxicity  Horses eating seeds or emergent seedlings of A. pseudoplatanus can suffer from an often fatal condition of atypical myopathy.  Cultivation  Bark on a mature tree Sycamore self-seeds very vigorously, the seeds germinating en masse in the spring so that there is little, or no, seed bank in the soil. It is readily propagated from seed in cultivation, but varieties cannot be relied on to breed true. Special cultivars such as A. pseudoplatanus 'Brilliantissimum' may be propagated by grafting. This variety is notable for the bright salmon-pink colour of the young foliage and is the only sycamore cultivar to have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. A rare weeping form with dangling branches, A. pseudoplatanus var. pendulum, was first sold by Knight & Perry's exotic nursery in Chelsea, England before 1850 when the name was published by W.H. Baxter in the Supplement to Loudon's Hortus Brittanicus, but no specimens of this cultivar are known to survive. The sycamore is noted for its tolerance of wind, urban pollution, salt spray, and low summer temperatures, which makes it a popular tree for planting in cities, along roads treated with salt in winter, and in coastal localities. It is cultivated and widely naturalised north of its native range in Northern Europe, notably in the British Isles and Scandinavia north to Troms√∏, Norway (seeds can ripen as far north as Vester√•len); Reykjav√≠k, Iceland; and T√≥rshavn on the Faroe Islands. It now occurs throughout the British Isles, having been introduced in the 16th century. Sycamores make new growth from the stump or roots if cut down and can therefore be coppiced to produce poles and other types of small timber. Its coppice stools grow comparatively rapidly, reaching up to in diameter in 450 years. It is grown as a species for medium to large bonsai in many areas of Europe where some fine specimens can be found.  Uses  Sycamore is planted in parks for ornamental purposes, and sometimes as a street tree, since its tolerance of air pollution makes it suitable for use in urban plantings. Because of its tolerance to wind, it has often been planted in coastal and exposed areas as a windbreak. It produces a hard-wearing, white or cream close-grained timber that turns golden with age. The wood can be worked and sawn in any direction and is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and parquetry. Because it is non-staining, is used for kitchen utensils, wooden spoons, bowls, rolling pins and chopping boards. In Scotland it has traditionally been used for making fine boxes, sometimes in association with contrasting, dark-coloured laburnum wood. Occasionally, trees produce wood with a wavy grain, greatly increasing the value for decorative veneers. The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630 kg per cubic metre. It is a traditional wood for use in making the backs, necks and scrolls of violins. The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore. Whistles can be made from straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated, and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall. The wood is used for fuel, being easy to saw and to split with an axe, producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt. In Scotland, sycamores were once a favoured tree for hangings, because their lower branches rarely broke under the strain. Both male and female flowers produce abundant nectar, which makes a fragrant, delicately flavoured and pale-coloured honey. The nectar and copious dull yellow ochre pollen are collected by honeybees as food sources. The sap rises vigorously in the spring and like that of sugar maple can be tapped to provide a refreshing drink, as a source of sugar and to make syrup or beer.  Notable specimens  The Martyrs' Tree, a sycamore at Tolpuddle in Dorset, England, is regarded by some as the birthplace of the British trades union movement.  Tolpuddle Martyrs' Tree  Under this sycamore tree at Tolpuddle in Dorset, England, six agricultural labourers, known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs, formed an early trades union in 1834. They were found to have breached the Unlawful Oaths Act 1797 and were transported to Australia. The subsequent public outcry led to their release and return. The tree now has a girth of 5.9 metres (19 feet, 4 inches) and a 2005 study dated the tree to 1680. The tree is cared for by the National Trust, who have pollarded the tree in 2002 and 2014.  Corstorphine Sycamore Tree  An ancient sycamore (sometimes described as a \\"plane\\") with distinctive yellow foliage formerly stood in the village of Corstorphine, now a suburb of Edinburgh, Scotland. The tree was reputedly planted in the 15th century and is named as the form Acer pseudoplatanus f. corstorphinense Schwer. Not only was it claimed to be the \\"largest sycamore in Scotland\\" but also the scene of James Lord Forrester's murder in 1679. The tree was blown down in a storm on Boxing Day 1998, but a replacement, grown from a cutting, now stands in the churchyard of Corstorphine Kirk. The tree is commemorated in the badge of the Corstorphine Bowling Club of Edinburgh, designed in 1950 to feature the Corstorphine sycamore tree and a single horn, and redesigned in 1991 for the club‚Äôs centenary.  Newbattle Abbey sycamore  The Newbattle Abbey sycamore near Dalkeith, planted in 1550, was the specimen with the earliest known planting date in Scotland. It had achieved a girth of and a height of by the time it was toppled by a gale in May 2006 at the age of 456 years.  Clonenagh Money Tree  Saint Fintan founded a monastery at Clonenagh in County Laois, Ireland, in the sixth century and it had a spring beside it. This was considered holy and was visited by pilgrims. In the nineteenth century, a Protestant land owner, annoyed at people visiting the site, filled the well in, whereupon the water started to flow into the hollow interior of a sycamore tree on the other side of the road. Filled with amazement, people hung rags on the tree and pressed coins into its trunk as votive offerings and it became known as the \\"Money Tree\\". Some years later, it fell down, but new shoots appeared from its base, and the water still welled up. It remains a place of veneration on St Fintan's day, February 17. Sycamore Gap Tree The Sycamore Gap Tree or Robin Hood Tree is a sycamore tree standing next to Hadrian's Wall near Crag Lough in Northumberland, England. It is located in a dramatic dip in the landscape and is a popular photographic subject, described as one of the most photographed trees in the country. It derives its alternative name from featuring in a prominent scene in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. The tree is a few hundred years old and once stood with others, but they have been removed over time, possibly to improve sightlines or for gamekeeping purposes.

It is native to much of continental Europe, Britain, southwest Asia from Turkey to the Caucasus, and north Africa in the Atlas Mountains. It has been widely planted, and is introduced outside its native range in Europe and areas of USA and Western Australia with suitable climate. Description It is a deciduous tree reaching tall, with a trunk up to in diameter, with finely fissured, often somewhat corky bark. The shoots are brown, with dark brown winter buds. The leaves are in opposite pairs, long (including the petiole) and broad, with five blunt, rounded lobes with a smooth margin. Usually monoecious, the flowers are produced in spring at the same time as the leaves open, yellow-green, in erect clusters across, and are insect-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged achenes aligned at 180¬∞, each achene is wide, flat, with a wing. The two varieties, not accepted as distinct by all authorities, are: *Acer campestre var. campestre - downy fruit *Acer campestre var. leiocarpum (Opiz) Wallr. (syn. A. campestre subsp. leiocarpum) - hairless fruit The closely related Acer miyabei replaces it in eastern Asia. Distribution The native range of field maple includes much of Europe, including Denmark, Poland and Belarus, England north to southern Scotland (where it is the only native maple), southwest Asia from Turkey to the Caucasus, and north Africa in the Atlas Mountains.Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins .Mitchell, A. F. (1974). A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe. Collins Euro+Med Plantbase Project: Acer campestre Flora of NW Europe: Acer campestreDen virtuella floran: Acer campestre distribution map In many areas, the original native range is obscured by widespread planting and introductions. In North America it is known as hedge maple and in Australia, it is sometimes called common maple.Department of Agriculture, Western Australia: Pests and Diseases Image Library In Nottinghamshire, England it was known locally as dog oak. Ecology Field maple is an intermediate species in the ecological succession of disturbed areas; it typically is not among the first trees to colonise a freshly disturbed area, but instead seeds in under the existing vegetation. It is very shade-tolerant during the initial stages of its life, but it has higher light requirements during its seed-bearing years. It exhibits rapid growth initially, but is eventually overtaken and replaced by other trees as the forest matures. It is most commonly found on neutral to alkaline soils, but more rarely on acidic soil. Diseases include a leaf spot fungus Didymosporina aceris, a mildew Uncinula bicornis, a canker Nectria galligena, and verticillium wilt Verticillium alboatrum. The leaves are also sometimes damaged by gall mites in the genus Aceria, and the aphid Periphyllus villosus. Cultivation The field maple is widely grown as an ornamental tree in parks and large gardens. The wood is white, hard and strong, and used for furniture, flooring, wood turning and musical instruments, though the small size of the tree and its relatively slow growth make it an unimportant wood. It has an OPALS rating of 7. It is locally naturalised in parts of the United States and more rarely in New Zealand.Trans. and Proc. Roy. Soc. New Zealand 36: 203-225 Plants naturalised in the County of Ashburton The hybrid maple Acer √ó zoeschense has A. campestre as one of its parents.

The dwarf cultivar 'Microphyllum' is especially useful in this regard. A. campestre bonsai have an appearance distinct from those selected from some other maples such as A. palmatum with more frilly, translucent, leaves. The shrubby habit and smallish leaves of A. campestre respond well to techniques encouraging ramification and leaf reduction.

Collins .Den Virtuella Floran: Tilia cordata (in Swedish; with maps T. platyphyllos (left) and T. cordata leaf comparison  Description  Tilia cordata is a deciduous tree growing to tall, diameter 1/3 to 1/2 the height, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter. The bark is smooth and grayish when young, firm with vertical ridges and horizontal fissures when older. The crown is rounded in a formal oval shape to pyramidal. Branching is upright and increases in density with age. The leaves are alternately arranged, rounded to triangular-ovate, 3-8 cm long and broad, mostly hairless (unlike the related Tilia platyphyllos) except for small tufts of brown hair in the leaf vein axils ‚Äì the leaves are distinctively heart-shaped. The buds are alternate, pointed egg shaped and have red scales. It has no terminal bud. The small yellow-green hermaphrodite flowers are produced in clusters of five to eleven in early summer with a leafy yellow-green subtending bract, have a rich, heavy scent; the trees are much visited by bees to the erect flowers which are held above the bract; this flower arrangement is distinctly different from that of the Common Lime Tilia √ó europaea where the flowers are held beneath the bract. The fruit is a dry nut-like drupe 6-7 mm long by 4 mm broad containing one, or sometimes two, brown seeds (infertile fruits are globose), downy at first becoming smooth at maturity, and (unlike T. platyphyllos and also T. √ó europaea) not ribbed but very thin and easily cracked open.Flora of NW Europe: Tilia cordata Ecology The trees favour good, loamy sites, but can also be found on sandy, infertile soils, and are not thought to be drought resistant. Dormant shoots of T. cordata can resist winter frost temperatures as low as ‚àí34 ¬∞C. In Britain T. cordata, traditionally caller pry, is considered an indicator of ancient woodland, and is becoming increasingly rare.Natural England internal website Owing to its rarity, a number of woods have been given SSSI status. Cocklode Wood, part of the Bardney Limewoods, is the best surviving spread of medieval small leaved limes in England.Woodland Trust The test-tube tree'‚Äô Broadleaf Anon Spring 2014 p7 Another site is Shrawley Wood in Worcestershire.Natural England Citation dated 12 May 1986 Small-leaved lime was once regarded as holy and good for carving.Woodland Trust Giant seed hunt to revitalize woods'‚Äô Broadleaf Anon Spring 2014 p9 Trees in northern England were found to have established when the climate was warmer and have adapted to the cooling climate. Paleobotanical analysis of tree pollen preserved in peat deposits demonstrates that T. cordata was present as a woodland tree in the southern Lake District c 3100 B.C. In spite of the late migration of T. cordata into the Lake District, pollen diagrams from many sites show rapid expansion so that, within a few centuries, it had become plentiful and even locally dominant in the southern valleys. Maximum values for Tilia from all pollen diagrams available for the north of England show a conspicuous concentration of high values in the southern Lake District. At several sites among the limestone hills on both sides of the estuary of the River Kent, the curves for Tilia, although beginning about 4800 to 4000 B.C. then achieve values of at least 10% within a few centuries. At Witherslack values of this magnitude persist for a depth of 3 m which represents about 4000 years. For much of this period Ulmus is approximately 10%, Quercus 20% and the remaining arboreal pollen is largely that of Alnus. For a shorter period Tilia exceeds Quercus and reaches a maximum of 30%. The (Witherslack) basin is about 200 m in width, so that with distance correction factors applied this indicates that the surrounding woodlands on well-drained soils contained Tilia, Quercus and Ulmus in the proportions 4 : 1 : 1. Modern mature woodland trees were estimated to have germinated between 1150 and 1300 AD, making them around 800 years old. Precise age determination is impossible as heartwood at the centre disintegrates and therefore rings cannot be counted, and other methods are used. Pests and diseases The tree is fairly disease-resistant, though a common problem is leaf scorch where planted on dry soils, however leaf scorch is not a long-term problem as the leaves are lost in the autumn. Pests include Japanese beetles, aphids, lace bugs and various species of moths. Cultivation and uses 15-year-old lime-tree, Haute-Savoie, France Tilia cordata is widely grown as an ornamental tree. It was much planted to form avenues in 17th and early 18th century landscape planning. A famous example is Unter den Linden in Berlin. It is also widely cultivated in North America as a substitute for the native Tilia americana (American linden or basswood) which has a larger leaf, coarser in texture; there it has been renamed \\"Little-leaf Linden\\". It is popular as both a shade tree with its dense canopy, an ornamental tree with its architectural shape and a street tree. In the US, Tilia cordata has been planted in Wellesley, MA; Modesto, CA; Chicago, IL; Indianapolis, IN; and Atlanta, GA as street trees. In Europe, there are espaliered trees owing to the ability to survive heavy pruning. Tilia cordata is an easy tree to train for bonsai when the training is not done all at once. Letting the tree recoup in between sessions over a period of several months creates a healthy, good-looking miniature tree. Prior to the advent of firearms, it was also commonly used for making shields (as referenced in Beowulf). Tilia cordata survives best in a soil pH range of 5.0 to 8.0. and in USDA Hardiness Zones 3‚Äì7. The tree prefers moist, well drained soil, but can survive flooding; it is not highly drought tolerant. It does not do well in soils with high salinity. Notable trees The Najevnik linden tree (), about 700 years old Tilia cordata, is the thickest tree in Slovenia. It is a place of cultural events, and every June a national meeting of Slovene politicians takes place under it.

Linden wood The white, finely-grained wood is not a structurally strong material but a classic choice for refined woodcarvings such as those by Grinling Gibbons for medieval altarpieces, such as the Altar of Veit Stoss. Linden wood was the prime choice for the carvings in St. Paul's Cathedral, Windsor Castle, and Chatsworth. It is also commonly used for lightweight projects such as carved spoons, light furniture, bee hives and honeycomb frames. Cultural significance Tilia cordata is the national tree of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, and of two national trees in Latvia.http://www.videsgidi.lv/faili/Latvijas_nacionalie_simboli_back.pdf The leaf of Tilia cordata is also considered a national symbol of Slovenia.

It thrives in wet locations where its association with the bacterium Frankia alni enables it to grow in poor quality soils. It is a medium size, short-lived tree growing to a height of up to 30 metres (100 ft). It has short-stalked rounded leaves and separate male and female flower in the form of catkins. The small, rounded fruits are cone-like and the seeds are dispersed by wind and water. The common alder provides food and shelter to wildlife, with a number of insects, lichens and fungi being completely dependent on the tree. It is a pioneer species, colonising vacant land and forming mixed forests as other trees appear in its wake. Eventually common alder dies out of woodlands because the seedlings need more light than is available on the forest floor. Its more usual habitat is forest edges, swamps and riverside corridors. The timber has been used in underwater foundations and for manufacture into paper and fibreboard, for smoking foods, for joinery, turnery and carving. Products of the tree have been used in ethnobotany, providing folk remedies for various ailments, and research has shown that extracts of the seeds are active against pathogenic bacteria. In the Midwestern United States, Alnus glutinosa is an invasive terrestrial plant soon to be legally banned in Indiana. Description Foliage Male inflorescence (left) and mature cone-like flowers (right) Alnus glutinosa is a tree that thrives in moist soils, and grows under favourable circumstances to a height of and exceptionally up to . Young trees have an upright habit of growth with a main axial stem but older trees develop an arched crown with crooked branches. The base of the trunk produces adventitious roots which grow down to the soil and may appear to be propping the trunk up. The bark of young trees is smooth, glossy and greenish-brown while in older trees it is dark grey and fissured. The branches are smooth and somewhat sticky, being scattered with resinous warts. The buds are purplish- brown and have short stalks. Both male and female catkins form in the autumn and remain dormant during the winter. The leaves of the common alder are short-stalked, rounded, up to long with a slightly wedge-shaped base and a wavy, serrated margin. They have a glossy dark green upper surface and paler green underside with rusty-brown hairs in the angles of the veins. As with some other trees growing near water, the common alder keeps its leaves longer than do trees in drier situations, and the leaves remain green late into the autumn. As the Latin name glutinosa implies, the buds and young leaves are sticky with a resinous gum.Flora of NW Europe: Alnus glutinosa The species is monoecious and the flowers are wind-pollinated; the slender cylindrical male catkins are pendulous, reddish in colour and long; the female flowers are upright, broad and green, with short stalks. During the autumn they become dark brown to black in colour, hard, somewhat woody, and superficially similar to small conifer cones. They last through the winter and the small winged seeds are mostly scattered the following spring. The seeds are flattened reddish-brown nuts edged with webbing filled with pockets of air. This enables them to float for about a month which allows the seed to disperse widely. Unlike some other species of tree, common alders do not produce shade leaves. The respiration rate of shaded foliage is the same as well-lit leaves but the rate of assimilation is lower. This means that as a tree in woodland grows taller, the lower branches die and soon decay, leaving a small crown and unbranched trunk. Taxonomy Alnus glutinosa was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, as one of two varieties of alder (the other being A. incana), which he regarded as a single species Betula alnus. In 1785, Jean- Baptiste Lamarck treated it as a full species under the name Betula glutinosa. Its present scientific name is due to Joseph Gaertner, who in 1791 accepted the separation of alders from birches, and transferred the species to Alnus. The epithet glutinosa means \\"sticky\\", referring particularly to the young shoots. Within the genus Alnus, the common alder is placed in subgenus Alnus as part of a closely related group of species including the grey alder, Alnus incana, with which it hybridizes to form the hybrid A. √ó hybrida. Distribution and habitat The common alder is native to almost the whole of continental Europe (except for both the extreme north and south) as well as the United Kingdom and Ireland. In Asia its range includes Turkey, Iran and Kazakhstan, and in Africa it is found in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. It is naturalised in the Azores. It has been introduced, either by accident or by intent, to Canada, the United States, Chile, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Its natural habitat is in moist ground near rivers, ponds and lakes but it can also grow in drier locations and sometimes occurs in mixed woodland and on forest edges. It tolerates a range of soil types and grows best at a pH of between 5.5 and 7.2. Because of its association with the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Frankia alni, it can grow in nutrient-poor soils where few other trees thrive. Ecological relationships Nodules on the roots caused by the bacterium Frankia alni Galls on the leaves caused by the mite Eriophyes inangulis The common alder is most noted for its symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Frankia alni, which forms nodules on the tree's roots. This bacterium absorbs nitrogen from the air and fixes it in a form available to the tree. In return, the bacterium receives carbon products produced by the tree through photosynthesis. This relationship, which improves the fertility of the soil, has established the common alder as an important pioneer species in ecological succession. The common alder is susceptible to Phytophthora alni, a recently evolved species of oomycete plant pathogen probably of hybrid origin. This is the causal agent of phytophthora disease of alder which is causing extensive mortality of the trees in some parts of Europe.Phytophthora Disease of Alder The symptoms of this infection include the death of roots and of patches of bark, dark spots near the base of the trunk, yellowing of leaves and in subsequent years, the death of branches and sometimes the whole tree. Taphrina alni is a fungal plant pathogen that causes alder tongue gall, a chemically induced distortion of female catkins. The gall develops on the maturing fruits and produces spores which are carried by the wind to other trees. This gall is believed to be harmless to the tree.Ellis, Hewett A. (2001). Cecidology. Vol.16, No.1. p. 24. Another, also harmless, gall is caused by a midge, Eriophyes inangulis, which sucks sap from the leaves forming pustules. The common alder is important to wildlife all year round and the seeds are a useful winter food for birds. Deer, sheep, hares and rabbits feed on the tree and it provides shelter for livestock in winter. It shades the water of rivers and streams, moderating the water temperature, and this benefits fish which also find safety among its exposed roots in times of flood. The common alder is the foodplant of the larvae of a number of different butterflies and moths and is associated with over 140 species of plant-eating insect. The tree is also a host to a variety of mosses and lichens which particularly flourish in the humid moist environment of streamside trees. Some common lichens found growing on the trunk and branches include tree lungwort (Lobaria pulmonaria), Menneguzzia terebrata and Stenocybe pullatula, the last of which is restricted to alders. Some 47 species of mycorrhizal fungi have been found growing in symbiosis with the common alder, both partners benefiting from an exchange of nutrients. As well as several species of Naucoria, these symbionts include Russula alnetorum, the milkcaps Lactarius obscuratus and Lactarius cyathula, and the alder roll-rim Paxillus filamentosus, all of which grow nowhere else except in association with alders. In spring, the catkin cup Ciboria amentacea grows on fallen alder catkins. As an introduced species, the common alder can affect the ecology of its new locality. It is a fast-growing tree and can quickly form dense woods where little light reaches the ground, and this may inhibit the growth of native plants. The presence of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria and the annual accumulation of leaf litter from the trees also alters the nutrient status of the soil. It also increases the availability of phosphorus in the ground, and the tree's dense network of roots can cause increased sedimentation in pools and waterways. It spreads easily by wind-borne seed, may be dispersed to a certain extent by birds and the woody fruits can float away from the parent tree. When the tree is felled, regrowth occurs from the stump, and logs and fallen branches can take root. A. glutinosa is classed as an environmental weed in New Zealand. Cultivation and uses Infrutescence and Achenes The common alder is used as a pioneer species and to stabilise river banks, to assist in flood control, to purify water in waterlogged soils and to moderate the temperature and nutrient status of water bodies. It can be grown by itself or in mixed species plantations, and the nitrogen-rich leaves falling to the ground enrich the soil and increase the production of such trees as walnut, Douglas fir and poplar on poor quality soils. Although the tree can live for up to 160 years, it is best felled for timber at 60 to 70 years before heart rot sets in. On marshy ground it is important as coppice-wood, being cut near the base to encourage the production of straight poles. It is capable of enduring clipping as well as marine climatic conditions and may be cultivated as a fast-growing windbreak. In woodland natural regeneration is not possible as the seeds need sufficient nutrients, water and light to germinate. Such conditions are rarely found at the forest floor and as the forest matures, the alder trees in it die out. The species is cultivated as a specimen tree in parks and gardens, and the cultivar 'Imperialis' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Timber The wood is soft, white when first cut, turning to pale red; the knots are attractively mottled. The timber is not used where strength is required in the construction industry, but is used for paper-making, the manufacture of fibreboard and the production of energy. Under water the wood is very durable and is used for deep foundations of buildings. The piles beneath the Rialto in Venice, and the foundations of several medieval cathedrals are made of alder. The Roman architect Vitruvius mentioned that the timber was used in the construction of the causeways across the Ravenna marshes. The wood is used in joinery, both as solid timber and as veneer, where its grain and colour are appreciated, and it takes dye well. As the wood is soft, flexible and somewhat light, it can be easily worked as well as split. It is valued in turnery and carving, in making furniture, window frames, clogs, toys, blocks, pencils and bowls. Tanning and dyeing The bark of the common alder has long been used in tanning and dyeing. The bark and twigs contain 16 to 20% tannic acid but their usefulness in tanning is limited by the strong accompanying colour they produce. Depending on the mordant and the methods used, various shades of brown, fawn, and yellowish-orange hues can be imparted to wool, cotton and silk. Alder bark can also be used with iron sulphate to create a black dye which can substitute for the use of sumach or galls. The Laplanders are said to chew the bark and use their saliva to dye leather. The shoots of the common alder produce a yellowish or cinnamon-coloured dye if cut early in the year. Other parts of the tree are also used in dyeing; the catkins can yield a green colour and the fresh-cut wood a pinkish-fawn colour. Other uses It is also the traditional wood that is burnt to produce smoked fish and other smoked foods, though in some areas other woods are now more often used. It supplies high quality charcoal. The leaves of this tree are sticky and if they are spread on the floor of a room, their adhesive surface is said to trap fleas. Chemical constituents of Alnus glutinosa include hirsutanonol, oregonin, genkwanin, rhododendrin {3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-l-methylpropyl-Œ≤-D-glucopyranoside} and glutinic acid (2,3-pentadienedioic acid). Health Pollen from the common alder, along with that from birch and hazel, is one of the main sources of tree pollen allergy. As the pollen is often present in the atmosphere at the same time as that of birch, hazel, hornbeam and oak, and they have similar physicochemical properties, it is difficult to separate out their individual effects. In central Europe, these tree pollens are the second most common cause of allergic conditions after grass pollen. The bark of common alder has traditionally been used as an astringent, a cathartic, a hemostatic, a febrifuge, a tonic and a restorative (a substance able to restore normal health). A decoction of the bark has been used to treat swelling, inflammation and rheumatism, as an emetic, and to treat pharyngitis and sore throat. Ground up bark has been used as an ingredient in toothpaste, and the inner bark can be boiled in vinegar to provide a skin wash for treating dermatitis, lice and scabies. The leaves have been used to reduce breast discomfort in nursing mothers and folk remedies advocate the use of the leaves against various forms of cancer. Alpine farmers are said to use the leaves to alleviate rheumatism by placing a heated bag full of leaves on the affected areas. Alder leaves are consumed by cows, sheep, goats and horses though pigs refuse to eat them. According to some people, consumption of alder leaves causes blackening of the tongue and is harmful to horses. In a research study, extracts from the seeds of the common alder have been found to be active against all the eight pathogenic bacteria against which they were tested, which included Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The only extract to have significant antioxidant activity was that extracted in methanol. All extracts were of low toxicity to brine shrimps. These results suggest that the seeds could be further investigated for use in the development of possible anti-MRSA drugs.

The band consists of vocalist Aaron Weiss, guitarists Michael Weiss and Brandon Beaver, bassist Greg Jehanian, and drummer Rickie Mazzotta. The band's music is generally dominated by spoken- word vocals and free-ranging drums, bass, and guitar.  History  The band was originally conceived as a side project. The Weiss brothers and former guitarist Christopher Kleinberg were playing together in another band called The Operation with former bassist Greg Jehanian (who released one album and one EP, 2001's There Is Hope for a Tree Cut Down & 1999's Invisible Man EP, on Takehold Records), but Aaron wanted to start another band to experiment with new sounds. With the help of Ricky Mazzotta, Ray Taddeo, and his brother Mike, Aaron formed what is now formally known as mewithoutYou. At first the band was a four piece, with Aaron Weiss on both bass and vocals. However, in only a few months Chris Kleinberg joined to play third guitar. The band released their first EP, I Never Said That I Was Brave, in 2001 and shortly thereafter signed to Tooth & Nail Records after a show at Cornerstone Festival the same year. Around this time Taddeo had moved on, and Daniel Pishock was recruited to be the first official and permanent bass player of the band. The Operation disbanded soon afterward, and mewithoutYou's debut full-length album, [A‚ÜíB] Life, was released in 2002. The band garnered more attention for their second release, 2004's Catch for Us the Foxes, which was produced by Brad Wood (Smashing Pumpkins, Sunny Day Real Estate). In December 2004 Pishock had made the decision to retire as the bassist to pursue a career in teaching and explore other musical ventures, and former Operation frontman, Greg Jehanian, was selected to replace him. In 2005, mewithoutYou won mtvU's \\"Left Field\\" award for most original artist for their song \\"January 1979.\\" Their third album, Brother, Sister, again produced by Wood, was released on September 26, 2006. In late 2007, guitarist Christopher Kleinberg left the band, to pursue a degree in medicine. Pete Syoum filled in for guitar in the fall of 2007, but later Kleinberg returned to play with the band on their 2008 Summer tour since school was not in session. Kleinberg also played some shows on their It's All Crazy! It's All False! It's All a Dream! It's Alright tour in June 2009. Aaron Weiss provides narration for the Forgive Durden album entitled, \\"Razia's Shadow: A Musical\\" which was released October 28, 2008. He also provides vocals for Norma Jean's \\"Memphis Will Be Laid to Waste\\" and Indie/Hip Hop project Bella Futuro's \\"70 X 7\\". In September 2008 the band finished recording the follow-up to Brother, Sister titled, It's All Crazy! It's All False! It's All a Dream! It's Alright. The title of the album is taken from parable 518 in the book 'The Golden Words of a Sufi Sheikh\\" by Bawa Muhaiyaddeen. In this he writes, \\"It's all false, It's all a dream, It's all crazy, It's all over, It's all right, Let's see what's next\\". This album is a departure from Weiss' trademark shouting and the band's rough grooves. The mile-a-minute rants, thick with lyrical angst, are traded for simpler melodies with lyrics about anthropomorphic food and animals. Similarly, the band has scaled back their edgier post-hardcore sound, at times trading riffs for chords and guitars for pianos and harp; a classical composer was called into their Fishtown, Philadelphia studio for various arrangements on several tracks. The album was produced by Dan Smith (Danielson, Sufjan Stevens) and Brian McTear and was mixed by Brad Wood. They toured in a 42-foot 1976 MC8 Charter bus that runs on vegetable oil. Before July 2009 the side of the bus read \\"Altus Bulldogs.\\" The bus has since been painted in a light beige and marked with paintings of flowers and vines by artist Salihah Moore.Synthesis Interview Jeremy Enigk and Aaron Weiss Catch Up as the World Waits, December 7, 2006 The bus broke down on June 3, 2016 while on tour in Canada. @mewithoutYou on Twitter: Been a lot of good years, adios nameless metal entity that made our band feasible with family and friends #sad In a June 2011 interview with Kick/Snare/Hat, drummer Rickie Mazzotta stated that mewithoutYou were writing for their fifth studio album. The band booked studio time at the end of July and through August. They also added Brandon Beaver of Buried Beds to play second guitar, as stated on their blog by Rickie Mazzotta. On August 10, 2011, Chris Kleinberg and wife Nikki had a baby girl, Jubilee Kleinberg.Announced at the 08-13-11 show in Philadelphia, around friends and family, after the naming ceremony held that day. Because of this, the August 13 show in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was one of the first local shows where Kleinberg did not join the band on stage since his departure in 2007. Later in August, Mazzotta stated in an interview that the band has parted ways with Tooth & Nail Records due to perceived restrictions placed on them by the label. They hinted at starting their own label as they prepared to release their fifth album. mewithoutYou leaves Tooth & Nail Other band members, however, expressed satisfaction with and gratitude and affection toward their old label, citing different reasons for ceasing to work with them: namely, having completed their contract, the declining relevance of record labels in the current music world, and simply the excitement to try something new. In February 2011, Alternative Press announced that the band's fifth album was due spring 2012, and was produced by Daniel Smith. Thirteen songs were recorded in the studio sessions, eleven planned for the album and two b-sides. On March 1, 2012 the band announced that their new album, titled Ten Stories, would be released on May 15, 2012. It was revealed that Hayley Williams of Paramore provided guest vocals on one new track, rumored to be \\"Fox's Dream of the Log Flume\\" and \\"All Circles\\". The album art, created by Vasily Kafanov, was revealed as a series of puzzle pieces through the band's Facebook page. On May 8, 2012 the band announced on their blog that a pre-release of Ten Stories could be streamed in its entirety on Spotify. In April 2014, the band announced that a Catch for Us the Foxes 10-year anniversary tour along the US west coast and south west followed by a second leg along the US east coast. In September 2014, the band announced a vinyl reissue of the album. In March 2015, the band announced that their 6th album will be released in the summer of 2015 on Run For Cover Records. In April 2015, the band announced that they would support their album, Pale Horses, with a mid-year tour and revealed the album would be released on June 16. On August 11, 2017 the band announced an [A‚ÜíB] Life 15th anniversary tour with Pianos Become the Teeth, Strawberry Girls and Slow Mass and also reissued the album on vinyl and cassette. On August 13, 2018, the band announced a new single, \\"Julia (or, 'Holy to the LORD' on the Bells of Horses)\\", from their seventh album. The single was released through Run For Cover Records. In an interview with Billboard the band confirmed that Will Yip would be returning to produce the new album. The album, Untitled, was released on October 5, 2018. In October 2019, mewithoutYou announced through their social media that 2020 would be their final year as an active band.  Lyrical themes  The Weiss brothers are of Jewish descent and their songs use Jewish, Muslim and Christian imagery to explore spiritual themes. The Weiss brothers were raised in a Sufi Muslim household: their mother had converted from the Episcopal church, and their father from Judaism. Due to the Christian imagery in some of Aaron Weiss' lyrics, they have been categorized as a Christian band, although in interview, A. Weiss has stated he doesn't think they are a Christian band. Their lyrics reflect a personal relationship with God, and are not evangelistic. Other lyrical themes explored include suffering and self-doubt. Many lyrics are taken from the Sufi poet Rumi including the song \\"The Cure for Pain\\" from [A‚ÜíB] Life and a line in the song \\"Seven Sisters\\" from Catch for Us the Foxes.Wikiquote:Rumi In the song \\"Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt\\" from their album [A‚ÜíB] Life, Aaron Weiss' lyrics are based on a poem from the metaphysical poet John Donne called \\"A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning\\". John Donne wrote the poem to his wife to explain that there is no need for dreading their physical separation or distance because their spiritual love will always keep them together. The lines of the song \\"thy firmness makes my circle just, and makes me end where I begun\\" are directly from John Donne's poem where the conceit is revealed as a compass (Stanza 9, ll. 35‚Äì36). The title of the song itself is a Kurt Vonnegut quote. The title of their second album Catch for Us the Foxes is taken directly from Song of Songs 2:15: \\"Catch for us the foxes, / the little foxes / that ruin the vineyards, / our vineyards that are in bloom\\" (New International Version). In a 2007 interview singer Aaron Weiss states that the title of their third album, Brother, Sister, comes from a verse in the Bhagavad Gita.Bhagavad Gita 11:19, \\"You are without beginning, middle, or end; you touch everything with your infinite power. The sun and moon are your eyes, and your mouth is fire; your radiance warms the cosmos.\\" Their fourth album, It's All Crazy! It's All False! It's All a Dream! It's Alright explores many of the teachings of Bawa Muhaiyaddeen. The Sufi teacher's story of \\"The Fox, the Crow, and the Cookie\\" from My Love You My Children: 101 Stories for Children is told as well as his story about the \\"King Beetle\\" from The Divine Luminous Wisdom that Dispels Darkness.M R Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, The Divine Luminous Wisdom: That Dispels the Darkness Other concepts from the teacher are explored in \\"Allah, Allah, Allah,\\" about seeing God in every blade of grass and in \\"Fig with a Bellyache\\" dealing with sexual temptation from The Divine Luminous Wisdom and The Golden Words of a Sufi Sheikh. Guitarist Mike Weiss has been quoted as saying that the themes of the album reflect a time in vocalist Aaron Weiss' life where he is \\"sort of revisiting [religion] and holding himself up to those teachings that there's no one religion that's going to be the only way to God [...],\\" reveals Weiss. \\"If you really want to just try to follow a path to God, I don't believe you need anything beyond [Jesus Christ], but it's just the idea that you're fixed on the only way and that everybody else is just completely misguided [...] that is a sort of obtuse attitude that can hurt your own spirit.\\"  Members  Current * Aaron Weiss ‚Äì lead vocals, guitar, accordion (2001‚Äìpresent) * Michael Weiss ‚Äì guitar, keyboards, vocals (2001‚Äìpresent) * Rickie Mazzotta ‚Äì drums (2001‚Äìpresent) * Greg Jehanian ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals (2004‚Äì2016, 2018‚Äìpresent) * Brandon Beaver ‚Äì guitar, vocals (2012‚Äìpresent) Former * Dominic Angelella ‚Äì bass, vocals (2016-2018) * Christopher Kleinberg ‚Äì guitar (2001-2006) * Daniel Pishock ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals, keyboards (2001-2004) * Ray Taddeo ‚Äì guitar (2001) Touring musicians * Brandon Beaver (2010-2012) * Kris Klein ‚Äì guitar (2011) * Christopher Kleinberg ‚Äì guitar (2008-2010) * Pete Syoum ‚Äì guitar (2007) * Stephen Smoker ‚Äì bass (2001) Additional musicians * Timbre ‚Äì harp * Lauryn Peacock ‚Äì piano * Matt Chapin ‚Äì trumpet * Derek Paquette ‚Äì trombone * Kim Tice ‚Äì accordion * Scottie Kruger ‚Äì vocals * Jay Beck ‚Äì Percussion  Discography = Studio albums  * [A‚ÜíB] Life (2002) * Catch for Us the Foxes (2004) * Brother, Sister (2006) * It's All Crazy!

Around 75% of people have some form of endocrine problems, with varying degrees of severity. FA is the result of a genetic defect in a cluster of proteins responsible for DNA repair via homologous recombination. Treatment with androgens and hematopoietic (blood cell) growth factors can help bone marrow failure temporarily, but the long- term treatment is bone marrow transplant if a donor is available. Because of the genetic defect in DNA repair, cells from people with FA are sensitive to drugs that treat cancer by DNA crosslinking, such as mitomycin C. The typical age of death was 30 years in 2000. FA occurs in about one per 130,000 births, with a higher frequency in Ashkenazi Jews and Afrikaners in South Africa. The disease is named after the Swiss pediatrician who originally described this disorder, Guido Fanconi. (Commentary on and reprint ... ) It should not be confused with Fanconi syndrome, a kidney disorder also named after Fanconi. Signs and symptoms FA is characterized by bone marrow failure, AML, solid tumors, and developmental abnormalities. Classic features include abnormal thumbs, absent radii, short stature, skin hyperpigmentation, including caf√© au lait spots, abnormal facial features (triangular face, microcephaly), abnormal kidneys, and decreased fertility. Many FA patients (about 30%) do not have any of the classic physical findings, but diepoxybutane chromosome fragility assay showing increased chromosomal breaks can make the diagnosis. About 80% of FA will develop bone marrow failure by age 20. The first sign of a hematologic problem is usually petechiae and bruises, with later onset of pale appearance, feeling tired, and infections. Because macrocytosis usually precedes a low platelet count, patients with typical congenital anomalies associated with FA should be evaluated for an elevated red blood cell mean corpuscular volume. Genetics Fanconi anemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. FA is primarily an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means that two mutated alleles (one from each parent) are required to cause the disease. The risk is 25% that each subsequent child will have FA. About 2% of FA cases are X-linked recessive, which means that if the mother carries one mutated Fanconi anemia allele on one X chromosome, a 50% chance exists that male offspring will present with Fanconi anemia. Scientists have identified 22 FA or FA-like genes: FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCJ (BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM, FANCN (PALB2), FANCO (RAD51C), FANCP (SLX4), FANCQ (XPF), FANCS (BRCA1), FANCT (UBE2T), FANCU (XRCC2), FANCV (REV7), and FANCW (RFWD3). FANCB is the one exception to FA being autosomal recessive, as this gene is on the X chromosome. These genes are involved in DNA repair. The carrier frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is about one in 90. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who may be carriers of Fanconi anemia. Because of the failure of hematologic components‚Äîwhite blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets‚Äîto develop, the body's capabilities to fight infection, deliver oxygen, and form clots are all diminished. Pathogenesis Clinically, hematological abnormalities are the most serious symptoms in FA. By the age of 40, 98% of FA patients will have developed some type of hematological abnormality. However, a few cases have occurred in which older patients have died without ever developing them. Symptoms appear progressively, and often lead to complete bone marrow failure. While at birth, blood count is usually normal, macrocytosis/megaloblastic anemia, defined as unusually large red blood cells, is the first detected abnormality, often within the first decade of life (median age of onset is 7 years). Within the next 10 years, over 50% of patients presenting haematological abnormalities will have developed pancytopenia, defined as abnormalities in two or more blood cell lineages. This is in contrast to Diamond‚ÄìBlackfan anemia, which affects only erythrocytes, and Shwachman‚ÄìDiamond syndrome, which primarily causes neutropenia. Most commonly, a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) precedes a low neutrophil count (neutropenia), with both appearing with relative equal frequencies. The deficiencies cause increased risk of hemorrhage and recurrent infections, respectively. As FA is now known to affect DNA repair, specifically homologous recombination, and given the current knowledge about dynamic cell division in the bone marrow, patients are consequently more likely to develop bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Myelodysplastic syndromes MDSs, formerly known as preleukemia, are a group of bone marrow neoplastic diseases that share many of the morphologic features of AML, with some important differences. First, the percentage of undifferentiated progenitor cells, blast cells, is always less than 20%, with considerably more dysplasia, defined as cytoplasmic and nuclear morphologic changes in erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic precursors, than what is usually seen in cases of AML. These changes reflect delayed apoptosis or a failure of programmed cell death. When left untreated, MDS can lead to AML in about 30% of cases. Due to the nature of the FA pathology, MDS diagnosis cannot be made solely through cytogenetic analysis of the marrow. Indeed, it is only when morphologic analysis of marrow cells is performed, that a diagnosis of MDS can be ascertained. Upon examination, MDS-afflicted FA patients will show many clonal variations, appearing either prior or subsequent to the MDS. Furthermore, cells will show chromosomal aberrations, the most frequent being monosomy 7 and partial trisomies of chromosome 3q 15. Observation of monosomy 7 within the marrow is well correlated with an increased risk of developing AML and with a very poor prognosis, death generally ensuing within 2 years (unless prompt allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant is an option). Acute myeloid leukemia FA patients are at elevated risk for the development of AML defined as presence of 20% or more of myeloid blasts in the marrow or 5 to 20% myeloid blasts in the blood. All of the subtypes of AML can occur in FA with the exception of promyelocytic. However, myelomonocytic and acute monocytic are the most common subtypes observed. Many MDS patients' diseases evolve into AML if they survive long enough. Furthermore, the risk of developing AML increases with the onset of bone-marrow failure. Although risk of developing either MDS or AML before the age of 20 is only 27%, this risk increases to 43% by the age of 30 and 52% by the age of 40. Historically, even with a marrow transplant, about a quarter of FA patients diagnosed with MDS/ALS have died from MDS/ALS-related causes within two years, although more recent published evidence suggests that earlier allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation in children with FA is leading to better outcomes over time. Bone marrow failure The last major haematological complication associated with FA is bone marrow failure, defined as inadequate blood cell production. Several types of failure are observed in FA patients, and generally precede MDS and AML. Detection of decreasing blood count is generally the first sign used to assess necessity of treatment and possible transplant. While most FA patients are initially responsive to androgen therapy and haemopoietic growth factors, these have been shown to promote leukemia, especially in patients with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, and have severe side effects, including hepatic adenomas and adenocarcinomas. The only treatment left would be bone marrow transplant; however, such an operation has a relatively low success rate in FA patients when the donor is unrelated (30% 5-year survival). It is, therefore, imperative to transplant from an HLA-identical sibling. Furthermore, due to the increased susceptibility of FA patients to chromosomal damage, pretransplant conditioning cannot include high doses of radiation or immunosuppressants, thus increased chances of patients developing graft- versus-host disease. If all precautions are taken, and the marrow transplant is performed within the first decade of life, two-year probability of survival can be as high as 89%. However, if the transplant is performed at ages older than 10, two-year survival rates drop to 54%. A recent report by Zhang et al. investigates the mechanism of bone marrow failure in FANCC-/- cells. They hypothesize and successfully demonstrate that continuous cycles of hypoxia- reoxygenation, such as those seen by haemopoietic and progenitor cells as they migrate between hyperoxic blood and hypoxic marrow tissues, leads to premature cellular senescence and therefore inhibition of haemopoietic function. Senescence, together with apoptosis, may constitute a major mechanism of haemopoietic cell depletion occurred in bone marrow failure. Molecular basis ATM (ATM) is a protein kinase that is recruited and activated by DNA double-strand breaks. DNA double-strand damages also activate the Fanconi anemia core complex (FANCA/B/C/E/F/G/L/M). The FA core complex monoubiquitinates the downstream targets FANCD2 and FANCI. ATM activates (phosphorylates) CHEK2 and FANCD2 CHEK2 phosphorylates BRCA1. Ubiquinated FANCD2 complexes with BRCA1 and RAD51. The PALB2 protein acts as a hub, bringing together BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 at the site of a DNA double-strand break, and also binds to RAD51C, a member of the RAD51 paralog complex RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 (BCDX2). The BCDX2 complex is responsible for RAD51 recruitment or stabilization at damage sites. RAD51 plays a major role in homologous recombinational repair of DNA during double strand break repair. In this process, an ATP dependent DNA strand exchange takes place in which a single strand invades base-paired strands of homologous DNA molecules. RAD51 is involved in the search for homology and strand pairing stages of the process. There are 19 genes responsible for FA, one of them being the breast-cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2. They are involved in the recognition and repair of damaged DNA; genetic defects leave them unable to repair DNA. The FA core complex of 8 proteins is normally activated when DNA stops replicating because of damage. The core complex adds ubiquitin, a small protein that combines with BRCA2 in another cluster to repair DNA (see Figure Recombinational repair of DNA double-strand damage). At the end of the process, ubiquitin is removed. Recent studies have shown that eight of these proteins, FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L and -M, assemble to form a core protein complex in the nucleus. According to current models, the complex moves from the cytoplasm into the nucleus following nuclear localization signals on FANCA and FANCE. Assembly is activated by replicative stress, particularly DNA damage caused by cross-linking agents (such as mitomycin C or cisplatin) or reactive oxygen species (ROS) that is detected by the FANCM protein. Following assembly, the protein core complex activates FANCL protein which acts as an E3 ubiquitin-ligase and monoubiquitinates FANCD2. Monoubiquitinated FANCD2, also known as FANCD2-L, then goes on to interact with a BRCA1/BRCA2 complex (see Figure Recombinational repair of DNA double-strand damage). Details are not known, but similar complexes are involved in genome surveillance and associated with a variety of proteins implicated in DNA repair and chromosomal stability. With a crippling mutation in any FA protein in the complex, DNA repair is much less effective, as shown by its response to damage caused by cross-linking agents such as cisplatin, diepoxybutane and Mitomycin C. Bone marrow is particularly sensitive to this defect. In another pathway responding to ionizing radiation, FANCD2 is thought to be phosphorylated by protein complex ATM/ATR activated by double-strand DNA breaks, and takes part in S-phase checkpoint control. This pathway was proven by the presence of radioresistant DNA synthesis, the hallmark of a defect in the S phase checkpoint, in patients with FA-D1 or FA-D2. Such a defect readily leads to uncontrollable replication of cells and might also explain the increase frequency of AML in these patients. Spermatogenesis In humans, infertility is one of the characteristics of individuals with mutational defects in the FANC genes. In mice, spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, and spermatocytes in the meiotic stages of leptotene, zygotene and early pachytene are enriched for FANC proteins. This finding suggests that recombinational repair processes mediated by the FANC proteins are active during germ cell development, particularly during meiosis, and that defects in this activity can lead to infertility. Neural stem cell homeostasis Microphthalmia and microcephaly are frequent congenital defects in FA patients. The loss of FANCA and FANCG in mice causes neural progenitor apoptosis both during early developmental neurogenesis and later during adult neurogenesis. This leads to depletion of the neural stem cell pool with aging. Much of the Fanconi anemia phenotype might be interpreted as a reflection of premature aging of stem cells. Treatment The first line of therapy is androgens and hematopoietic growth factors, but only 50‚Äì75% of patients respond. A more permanent cure is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. If no potential donors exist, a savior sibling can be conceived by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to match the recipient's HLA type.Page 29 in Prognosis Many patients eventually develop acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Older patients are extremely likely to develop head and neck, esophageal, gastrointestinal, vulvar and anal cancers.Institut Biologia Fonamental de Barcelona, \\"Constitutional chromosomal instability: a case with three primary and sequential cancers\\" , USUJ 2009. Retrieved 2010-04-13 Patients who have had a successful bone marrow transplant and, thus, are cured of the blood problem associated with FA still must have regular examinations to watch for signs of cancer. Many patients do not reach adulthood. The overarching medical challenge that Fanconi patients face is a failure of their bone marrow to produce blood cells. In addition, Fanconi patients normally are born with a variety of birth defects. A significant number of Fanconi patients have kidney problems, trouble with their eyes, developmental delay and other serious defects, such as microcephaly (small head).Anemia, Fanconi References External links  * Fanconi Anemia Research Fund * GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Fanconi Anemia * OMIM entries on Fanconi Anemia * * Fanconi Hope Charitable Trust - based in the UK, with Eu and International Links * Fanconi Anaemia FAmily Support - based in the UK * Fanconi's Anaemia on patient.info Category:Chromosome instability syndromes Category:Autosomal recessive disorders Category:Aplastic anemias Category:DNA replication and repair-deficiency disorders ","title":"Fanconi anemia"},{"id":"437948","text":"The year 1891 in science and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

A substantial, long-lived deciduous tree, it produces an edible seed, the chestnut, which has been used in cooking since ancient times.  Names  The tree is to be distinguished from the horse chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum, to which it is only distantly related. The horse chestnut bears similar looking seeds (conkers) in a similar seed case, which are not palatable to humans. Other common names include \\"Spanish chestnut\\",Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney blooming calendar \\"Portuguese chestnut\\" and \\"marron\\" (French for \\"chestnut\\"). The Latin sativa means \\"cultivated by humans\\". Some selected varieties are smaller and more compact in growth yielding earlier in life with different ripening time: the Marigoule, the Marisol and the Maraval.  Description  C. sativa attains a height of with a trunk often in diameter. The bark often has a net-shaped (retiform) pattern with deep furrows or fissures running spirally in both directions up the trunk. The trunk is mostly straight with branching starting at low heights. Sweet chestnut trees live to an age of 500 to 600 years. In cultivation they may even grow as old as 1000 years or more. Their large genetic diversity and different cultivars are exploited for uses such as flour, boiling, roasting, drying, sweets or wood. The oblong-lanceolate, boldly toothed leaves are long and broad.  Reproduction  The flowers of both sexes are borne in long, upright catkins, the male flowers in the upper part and female flowers in the lower part. In the northern hemisphere, they appear in late June to July, and by autumn, the female flowers develop into spiny cupules containing 3-7 brownish nuts that are shed during October. The female flowers eventually form a spiky sheath that deters predators from the seed.Kew Gardens - Rhizotron & Xstrata Treetop Walkway - Castanea sativa The sweet chestnut is naturallyself incompatible, meaning that the plant cannot pollinate itself, making cross-pollination necessary. Some cultivars only produce one large seed per cupule, while others produce up to three seeds. The nut itself is composed of two skins: an external, shiny brown part, and an internal skin adhering to the fruit. Inside, there is an edible, creamy-white part developed from the cotyledon. Habitat The tree requires a mild climate and adequate moisture for good growth and a good nut harvest. Its year-growth (but not the rest of the tree) is sensitive to late spring and early autumn frosts, and is intolerant of lime. Under forest conditions, it will tolerate moderate shade well. It can live to more than 2,000 years of age in natural conditions, see the poetically-named \\"hundred-horse chestnut\\" in eastern Sicily for example. Pests and diseases The leaves provide food for some animals, including Lepidoptera such as the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella and North American rose chafer Macrodactylus subspinosus. The two major fungal pathogens of the sweet chestnut are the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) and the ink disease caused by Phytophthora cambivora and Phytophthora cinnamomi. In North America as well as in Southern Europe Cryphonectria parasitica destroyed most of the chestnut population in the 20th century. With biological control, the population of the sweet chestnut is not threatened anymore by the chestnut blight and is regenerating. Ink disease is infesting trees mostly in humid soils, with the mycelium invading the root and resulting in wilting of the leaf. Absence of fruit formation leads to die back of the petal. The ink disease is named after the black exudates at the base of the trunk. Nowadays there are cultivars that are resistant to the ink disease. Phytophthora cambivora caused serious damage in Asia and the US, and it still continues to destroy new plantations in Europe. Another serious pest which is difficult to control is the gall wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphylus) which was recently introduced in Southern Europe, originating from Asia. Sweet chestnut a thousand years old in Levie (Corsica)  Historic development  The 450-year-old Spanish chestnut tree at Balmerino in Fife C. sativa is found across the Mediterranean region, from the Caspian Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. It is thought to have survived the last Ice Age in several refuges in southern Europe, on the southern coast of the Black Sea with a main centre on the southern slope of the Caucasus and in the region of north-western Syria, possibly extending into Lebanon. Pollen data indicates that the first spreading of C. sativa due to human activity started around 2100-2050 B.C. in Anatolia, northeastern Greece and southeastern Bulgaria. Compared to other crops, the sweet chestnut was probably of relatively minor importance and distributed very heterogeneously throughout these regions. The first charcoal remains of sweet chestnut only date from around 850-950 B.C., making it very difficult to infer a precise origin history. A newer but more reliable source are the literary works of Ancient Greece, with the richest being Theophrastus‚Äô Inquiry into plants written in the third century B.C. Theophrastus focuses mainly on the use of sweet chestnut wood as timber and charcoal, only mentioning the use of the fruit once when commenting on the digestive difficulties it causes, but praising its nourishing quality. Several Greek authors wrote about medicinal properties of the sweet chestnut, specifically as a remedy against lacerations of the lips and of the oesophagus. Similar to the introduction of grape vine and olive cultivation to the Latin world, C. sativa is thought to have been introduced during the colonisation of the Italian peninsula by the Greeks. Further clues pointing to this theory can be found in the work of Pliny the Elder, who mentions only Greek colonies in connection with sweet chestnut cultivation. Today's phylogenetic map of the sweet chestnut, while not fully understood, shows greater genetic similarity between Italian and western Anatolian C. sativa trees compared to eastern Anatolian specimen, reinforcing these findings. Nonetheless, until the end of the pre-Christian era, the spread and use of the chestnut in Italy remained limited. Carbonised sweet chestnuts were found in the Roman Villa Torre Annunziata, destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Clues in art and literature indicate a dislike of the sweet chestnut by the Roman aristocracy. Like Theophrastus, Latin authors are sceptical of the sweet chestnut as a fruit, and Pliny the Elder even goes as far as admiring how well nature has hidden this fruit of apparently so little value. In the beginning of the Christian era, people probably started to realize the value and versatility of sweet chestnut wood, leading to a slow spread of the cultivation of C. sativa trees, a theory that is supported by pollen data and literary sources, as well as the increased use of sweet chestnut wood as poles and in supporting structures, wood works and pier building between A.D. 100 and 600. Increasing sweet chestnut pollen appearances in Switzerland, France, Germany and the Iberian peninsula in the first century A.D. suggests the spreading of cultivated sweet chestnut trees by the Romans. Contrary to that notion, other scientists found no indication of the Romans spreading C. sativa before the fifth century. While the husks of sweet chestnuts, dated to the third or early fourth century, have been identified from the bottom of a Roman well at Great Holts Farm, Boreham, UK; this deposit includes remains of other exotic food plants and provides no evidence that any of them originated locally. No other evidence of sweet chestnut in Roman Britain has been confirmed.Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) in Britain: Re-assessment of its Status as a Roman Archaeophyte. R. Jarman, Z. Hazell, G. Campbell, J. Webb and F. M. Chambers. Britannia 50 (2019), 49-74 doi:10.1017/S0068113X19000011 Indeed, no center of sweet chestnut cultivation outside the Italian peninsula in Roman times has been detected. Widespread use of chestnut in western Europe started in the early Middle Ages and flourished in the late Middle Ages. In the mid-seventh-century Lombard laws a composition of one solidi is set for felling a chestnut tree (or, also, hazel, pear or apple) belonging to another person (Edictus Rothari, No. 301, 643 CE). Since the beginning of the 20th century, due to depopulation of the countryside and the abandonment of the sweet chestnut as a staple food as well as the spread of chestnut blight and ink disease, C. sativa cultivation has dramatically decreased. Nowadays, sweet chestnut production is sometimes seen at a turning point again, because the development of high-value sweet chestnut products combined with changing needs of an urban society is leading to a revival in C. sativa cultivation.  Distribution  The species is widely distributed throughout Europe, where in 2004 C. sativa was grown on 2.25 million hectares of forest, of which 1.78 million hectares were mainly cultivated for wood and 0.43 million hectares for fruit production. Italy, France, southern Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and Greece are countries with a strong sweet chestnut tradition, with trees cultivated intensively in coppices and orchards. Countries like England, Croatia, Turkey and Georgia only have a partially developed sweet chestnut tradition due to geography or history. Nevertheless, centuries-old specimens may be found in Great Britain today. Examples can be seen particularly in the London Boroughs of Islington and Camden. In other European countries, C. sativa has only been introduced recently, for example in Slovakia or the Netherlands. Sweet chestnut in New Court at Trinity College, Cambridge  Uses  The species is widely cultivated for its edible seeds (also called nuts) and for its wood. A tree grown from seed may take 20 years or more before it bears fruits, but a grafted cultivar such as 'Marron de Lyon' or 'Paragon' may start production within five years of being planted. Both cultivars bear fruits with a single large kernel, rather than the usual two to four smaller kernels. Sweet chestnut has been listed as one of the 38 substances used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its supposed effect on health. However, according to Cancer Research UK, \\"there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer\\".  Cultivation = Cultivation forms  Three different cultivation systems for the sweet chestnut can be distinguished: * Coppicing: Mainly for wood extraction. Standard conditions yield 15 m3 wood per ha and year. * Selve: Fruit production from grafted trees. The trees have a short tribe and a big crown. Trees have a high density and the ground between the trees is often used as pasture. * High forest: Wood and fruit production. This cultivation form is less intensive with a yield of 4-12 dt/ha and replacement of trees every 50‚Äì80 years. The trees grow from seeds and build a dense canopy. The field management is dependent on the cultivation system. While cleaning the soil from the leaves and pruning is the norm, the use of fertilizer, irrigation and pesticides is less common and reserved for more intensive cultivation.  Requirements  The sweet chestnut tree grows well on limestone-free, deeply weathered soil. The optimal pH value of the soil is between 4.5 and 6, and the tree cannot tolerate soil compaction. The tolerance to wet ground and to clay-rich soils is very low. It is a heat-loving tree which needs a long vegetation period. The optimal average temperature is between 8 ¬∞C and 15 ¬∞C and in January the temperature should preferably not be below -1 ¬∞C but it may tolerate temperatures as low as -15 ¬∞C. Low temperature in autumn can damage the fruit. The maximal altitude is strongly dependent on the climate. In general, the climate should be similar to viticulture. Optimal precipitation is between 400 and 1600 mm. Before planting, seeds must be stratified at 2-3 ¬∞C so germination can start 30‚Äì40 days later. After a year, the young trees are being transplanted.  Harvest  The fruit yield per tree is usually between 30‚Äì100 kg, but can get as high as 300 kg. Harvest time is between middle of September and middle of November. There are three harvesting techniques: * By hand: The sweet chestnuts are harvested by rake or broom, with a harvest speed of 5 to 30 kg every hour depending on the soil relief. Also, the capsule makes the harvest more complicated and even painful for the worker. * By hand with nets: This technique is less time-consuming and protects the fruits from injuries. However, setting up the nets is work intensive. * Mechanical: The fruits are collected with a machine that works similarly to a vacuum cleaner. Doing so is time-saving and economical, but it's possible that some fruits get injured, and a big initial investment is needed. Furthermore, a visual sorting is not possible. The total world chestnut harvest was 1,17 Mio Tons in 2006, but only 151 000 Tons were C. sativa.  Post-harvest treatment  The most widespread treatment before storage is water curing, a process in which the sweet chestnuts are immersed in water for nine days. The aim of this practice is to limit the main storage problems threatening the sweet chestnut: fungi development and the presence of insect worms. As an alternative to water curing, hot water treatment is also commercially used. After water treatment, the sweet chestnuts are stored in a controlled environment with high carbon dioxide concentrations. In contrast to a cold storage system, where the fruits are stored at low temperatures in untreated air, the controlled environment method avoids flesh hardening which negatively impacts the processability of the product.  Food  The raw nuts, though edible, have a skin which is astringent and unpleasant to eat when still moist; after drying for a time the thin skin loses its astringency but is still better removed to reach the white fruit underneath. Cooking dry in an oven or fire normally helps remove this skin. Chestnuts are traditionally roasted in their tough brown husks after removing the spiny cupules in which they grow on the tree, the husks being peeled off and discarded and the hot chestnuts dipped in salt before eating them. Roast chestnuts are traditionally sold in streets, markets and fairs by street vendors with mobile or static braziers. The skin of raw peeled chestnuts can be relatively easily removed by quickly blanching the nuts after scoring them by a cross slit at the tufted end.An easy way of peeling the pellicle, or pithy skin Once cooked, chestnuts acquire a sweet flavour and a floury texture similar to the sweet potato. The cooked nuts can be used for stuffing poultry, as a vegetable or in nut roasts. They can also be used in confections, puddings, desserts and cakes. They are used for flour, bread making, a cereal substitute, coffee substitute, a thickener in soups and other cookery uses, as well as for fattening stock. A sugar can be extracted from them. The Corsican variety of polenta (called pulenta) is made with sweet chestnut flour. A local variety of Corsican beer also uses chestnuts. The product is sold as a sweetened paste mixed with vanilla, , sweetened or unsweetened as chestnut pur√©e or pur√©e de marron, and candied chestnuts as marrons glac√©s.Lori Alden. 2006 The Cook's Thesaurus. nut pastes In Switzerland, it is often served as Vermicelles. Roman soldiers were given chestnut porridge before going into battle. Leaf infusions are used in respiratory diseases and are a popular remedy for whooping cough. A hair shampoo can be made from infusing leaves and fruit husks.  Food constituents  Castanea sativa is considered as having very interesting nutritional characteristics. The fruit contains significant amounts of a wide range of valuable nutrients. In the past, its characteristic and nutritional components gave sweet chestnut an important role in human nutrition due to its beneficial health effects. Sweet chestnut is also appreciated in a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, this characteristic is valuable in cases of celiac diseases as well as reducing coronary heart diseases and cancer rates. Various composition and health studies have shown its big potential as a food ingredient and functional food. The fat content is very low and is dominated for the most part by unsaturated fatty acids. Sweet chestnut is a good source for starch,; chestnuts of all varieties generally contain about the same amount of starch. The energy value per 100 g (3.5 oz) of C. sativa amounts to 891 kJ (213 kcal). C. sativa is characterized by high moisture content which ranges from 41% to 59 % and a considerable level of starch (‚âà40 g 100 g‚àí1 dry matter). Regarding mineral content, the chestnut provides a good source for Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn and K. Its sugar content ranges from 14% to 20% dry weight depending on the cultivar; which is very important, since the sensory appeal of sweet chestnut is correlated with its sugar content. However, high sugar amounts seem to have a negative impact on the fiber content. Generally, glucose content in European chestnuts is very low and ranges from zero to traces. Instead, fructose is mostly responsible for the sweet taste.  Effect of processing  Sweet chestnut is suited for human nutrition. Most sweet chestnut is consumed in processed form, which has an impact on the nutrient composition. Its naturally high concentration of organic acids is a key factor influencing the organoleptic characteristics of fruits and vegetables, namely flavor. Organic acids are thought to play an important role against diseases as an antioxidant. Heat appears to be the most influencing factor when it comes to decreasing the organic acid content. However, even after heating sweet chestnuts, antioxidant activity remains relatively high. On the other hand, the consumer must consider that roasting, boiling or frying has a big impact on the nutritional profile of chestnut. Vitamin C significantly decreases between 25-54 % when boiled and 2-77 % when roasted. Nevertheless, roasted or boiled chestnuts may still be a solid vitamin C source, since 100 gram still represent about 20% of the recommended daily dietary intake. The sugar content is also affected by the high temperatures. Four processes are decisive for the degrading process of sugar while cooking: hydrolysis of starch to oligosaccharide and monosaccharide, decomposition of sucrose to glucose and fructose, caramelization of sugars and degradation of sugars. Organic acids are also affected by high temperatures: their content decreases about 50% after frying, and 15% after boiling. Responsible for the aromatic characteristics of cooked chestnuts is the effect of degradation of saccharides, proteins and lipids, the caramelization of saccharides and the maillard reaction that is reducing sugar and amino acids.

This tree responds very well to coppicing, which is still practised in Britain, and produces a good crop of tannin-rich wood every 12 to 30 years, depending on intended use and local growth rate. The tannin renders the young growing wood durable and weather resistant for outdoor use, thus suitable for posts, fencing or stakes.Oleg Polunin. Trees and Bushes of Britain and Europe. Ed Paladin, 1973, pp. 51, 188 and 195). The wood is of light colour, hard and strong. It is used to make furniture, barrels (sometimes used to age balsamic vinegar), and roof beams notably in southern Europe (for example in houses of the Alpujarra, Spain, in southern France and elsewhere). The timber has a density of 560 kg per cubic meter,Chestnut . Niche Timbers. Accessed 19-08-2009. and due to its durability in ground contact is often used for external purposes such as fencing. It is also a good fuel, though not favoured for open fires as it tends to spit. Tannin is found in the following proportions on a 10% moisture basis: bark (6.8%), wood (13.4%), seed husks (10 - 13%). The leaves also contain tannin.

They are known for being capable of producing an electric discharge, ranging from 8 to 220 volts, depending on species, used to stun prey and for defense.Martin, R. Aidan. Electric Rays. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on October 12, 2008. There are 69 species in four families. Perhaps the best known members are those of the genus Torpedo, also called crampfish and numbfish. The torpedo is named after it. The name comes from the Latin torpere, to be stiffened or paralyzed, referring to the effect on someone who handles or steps on a living electric ray. Description Electric rays have a rounded pectoral disc with two moderately large rounded-angular (not pointed or hooked) dorsal fins (reduced in some Narcinidae), and a stout muscular tail with a well-developed caudal fin. The body is thick and flabby, with soft loose skin with no dermal denticles or thorns. A pair of kidney-shaped electric organs are at the base of the pectoral fins. The snout is broad, large in the Narcinidae, but reduced in all other families. The mouth, nostrils, and five pairs of gill slits are underneath the disc. Electric rays are found from shallow coastal waters down to at least deep. They are sluggish and slow-moving, propelling themselves with their tails, not by using their pectoral fins as other rays do. They feed on invertebrates and small fish. They lie in wait for prey below the sand or other substrate, using their electricity to stun and capture it. Relationship to humans The electrogenic properties of electric rays have been known since antiquity. The ancient Greeks used electric rays to numb the pain of childbirth and operations. In his dialogue Meno, Plato has the character Meno accuse Socrates of \\"stunning\\" people with his puzzling questions, in a manner similar to the way the torpedo fish stuns with electricity.Wikisource:Meno Scribonius Largus, a Roman physician, recorded the use of torpedo fish for treatment of headaches and gout in his Compositiones Medicae of 46 AD. The torpedo fish, or electric ray, appears continuously in premodern natural histories as a magical creature, and its ability to numb fishermen without seeming to touch them was a significant source of evidence for the belief in occult qualities in nature during the ages before the discovery of electricity as an explanatory mode. Bioelectricity The two electric organs. The electric ray may be the most electrosensitive of all animals. Their eyes are on the top of their heads, resulting in poor vision that must be compensated for the use of other senses, including detecting electricity. Many species of rays and skates outside the family have electric organs in the tail; however, the electric ray has two large electric organs on each side of its head, where current passes from the lower to the upper surface of the body. The organs are governed by four central nerves from each side of the electric lobe, or specialized brain lobe, which is of a different color from the rest of the brain. The main nerves branch repeatedly, then attach to the lower side of each plate in the batteries, which are composed of hexagonal columns, in honeycomb formation: each column consists of 140 to half a million gelatinous plates. In marine fish, these batteries are connected as a parallel circuit where freshwater batteries are found in series, transmitting discharges of higher voltage, as freshwater cannot conduct electricity as well as saltwater. With such a battery, an average electric ray may electrocute larger prey with a current of up to 30 amperes and a voltage of 50 to 200 volts, a similar effect to dropping a mains-powered hairdryer (large appliance plug of 110/220 volts in North America) into a bathtub. Systematics The 60 or so species of electric rays are grouped into 12 genera and two families. The Narkinae are sometimes elevated to a family, the Narkidae. The torpedinids feed on large prey, which are stunned using their electric organs and swallowed whole, while the narcinids specialize on small prey on or in the bottom substrate. Both groups use electricity for defense, but it is unclear whether the narcinids use electricity in feeding.Compagno, Leonard J.V. and Heemstra, Phillip C.

The Zone Diet. Health Care Food Nutr Focus. 2004 Oct;21(10):8-9, 11.

West/Wadsworth. p. 214. \\"Most fad diets, including the currently popular Zone Diet, advocate essentially the same high-protein, low- carbohydrate diet. Such diets may offer short-term weight- loss success to some who try them, but they fail to produce long-lasting results for most people. Furthermore, highprotein, low- carbohydrate diets are often high in fat and low in fiber, vitamins, and some minerals. Long-term use of such diets may produce adverse side effects such as nausea, fatigue, constipation, and low blood pressure.\\"  Approach  The diet is meant to promote weight loss via reduction in calories consumed and avoid spikes in insulin release, thus supporting the maintenance of insulin sensitivity. It begins with the determination of the individual's protein requirement for daily replacement due to various loss mechanisms. The Zone diet proposes that a relatively narrow distribution in the ratio of proteins to carbohydrates, centered at 0.75, is essential to \\"balance the insulin to glucagon ratio, which purportedly affects eicosanoid metabolism and ultimately produces a cascade of biological events leading to a reduction in chronic disease risk, enhanced immunity, maximal physical and mental performance, increased longevity and permanent weight loss.\\"Cheuvront SN The Zone Diet phenomenon: a closer look at the science behind the claims. J Am Coll Nutr. 2003 Feb; 22(1):9-17. The diet advocates eating five times a day, with 3 meals and 2 snacks, and includes eating proteins, carbohydrates - those with a lower glycemic index are considered more favorable, and fats (monounsaturated fats are considered healthier) in a caloric ratio of 30%-40%-30% (fat-carb- pro). The hand is used as the mnemonic tool; five fingers for five times a day, with no more than five hours between meals. The size and thickness of the palm are used to measure protein while two big fists measure favorable carbohydrates and one fist unfavorable carbohydrates. There is a more complex scheme of \\"Zone blocks\\" and \\"mini-blocks\\" that followers of the diet can use to determine the ratios of macronutrients consumed. Daily exercise is encouraged. The diet falls about midway in the continuum between the USDA- recommended food pyramid which advocates eating grains, vegetables, and fruit and reducing fat, and the high-fat Atkins Diet.Lara-Castro C, Garvey WT.

As of 2013, there were \\"no cross-sectional or longitudinal studies examining the potential health merit of adopting a Zone Diet per se, [and] closely related peer-reviewed findings from scientific research cast strong doubt over the purported benefits of this diet.

It is equidistant from both endpoints, and it is the centroid both of the segment and of the endpoints. It bisects the segment. Formulas The midpoint of a segment in n-dimensional space whose endpoints are A = (a_1, a_2, \\\\dots , a_n) and B = (b_1, b_2, \\\\dots , b_n) is given by :\\\\frac{A+B}{2}. That is, the ith coordinate of the midpoint (i = 1, 2, ..., n) is :\\\\frac{a_i+b_i} 2. Construction Given two points of interest, finding the midpoint of the line segment they determine can be accomplished by a compass and straightedge construction. The midpoint of a line segment, embedded in a plane, can be located by first constructing a lens using circular arcs of equal (and large enough) radii centered at the two endpoints, then connecting the cusps of the lens (the two points where the arcs intersect). The point where the line connecting the cusps intersects the segment is then the midpoint of the segment. It is more challenging to locate the midpoint using only a compass, but it is still possible according to the Mohr-Mascheroni theorem. Geometric properties involving midpoints=Circle The midpoint of any diameter of a circle is the center of the circle. Any line perpendicular to any chord of a circle and passing through its midpoint also passes through the circle's center. The butterfly theorem states that, if M is the midpoint of a chord PQ of a circle, through which two other chords AB and CD are drawn, then AD and BC intersect chord PQ at X and Y respectively, such that M is the midpoint of XY. Ellipse The midpoint of any segment which is an area bisector or perimeter bisector of an ellipse is the ellipse's center. The ellipse's center is also the midpoint of a segment connecting the two foci of the ellipse. Hyperbola The midpoint of a segment connecting a hyperbola's vertices is the center of the hyperbola. Triangle The perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is the line that is perpendicular to that side and passes through its midpoint. The three perpendicular bisectors of a triangle's three sides intersect at the circumcenter (the center of the circle through the three vertices). The median of a triangle's side passes through both the side's midpoint and the triangle's opposite vertex. The three medians of a triangle intersect at the triangle's centroid (the point on which the triangle would balance if it were made of a thin sheet of uniform-density metal). The nine-point center of a triangle lies at the midpoint between the circumcenter and the orthocenter. These points are all on the Euler line. A midsegment (or midline) of a triangle is a line segment that joins the midpoints of two sides of the triangle. It is parallel to the third side and has a length equal to one half of that third side. The medial triangle of a given triangle has vertices at the midpoints of the given triangle's sides, therefore its sides are the three midsegments of the given triangle. It shares the same centroid and medians with the given triangle. The perimeter of the medial triangle equals the semiperimeter (half the perimeter) of the original triangle, and its area is one quarter of the area of the original triangle. The orthocenter (intersection of the altitudes) of the medial triangle coincides with the circumcenter (center of the circle through the vertices) of the original triangle. Every triangle has an inscribed ellipse, called its Steiner inellipse, that is internally tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of all its sides. This ellipse is centered at the triangle's centroid, and it has the largest area of any ellipse inscribed in the triangle. In a right triangle, the circumcenter is the midpoint of the hypotenuse. In an isosceles triangle, the median, altitude, and perpendicular bisector from the base side and the angle bisector of the apex coincide with the Euler line and the axis of symmetry, and these coinciding lines go through the midpoint of the base side. Quadrilateral The two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides, hence each bisecting two sides. The two bimedians and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals are concurrent at (all intersect at)a point called the \\"vertex centroid\\", which is the midpoint of all three of these segments.Altshiller- Court, Nathan, College Geometry, Dover Publ., 2007. The four \\"maltitudes\\" of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side through the midpoint of the opposite side, hence bisecting the latter side. If the quadrilateral is cyclic (inscribed in a circle), these maltitudes all meet at a common point called the \\"anticenter\\". Brahmagupta's theorem states that if a cyclic quadrilateral is orthodiagonal (that is, has perpendicular diagonals), then the perpendicular to a side from the point of intersection of the diagonals always goes through the midpoint of the opposite side. Varignon's theorem states that the midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral form the vertices of a parallelogram, and if the quadrilateral is not self-intersecting then the area of the parallelogram is half the area of the quadrilateral. The Newton line is the line that connects the midpoints of the two diagonals in a convex quadrilateral that is not a parallelogram. The line segments connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of a convex quadrilateral intersect in a point that lies on the Newton line. General polygons A regular polygon has an inscribed circle which is tangent to each side of the polygon at its midpoint. In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, the midpoint of a diagonal between opposite vertices is the polygon's center. The midpoint-stretching polygon of a cyclic polygon (a polygon whose vertices all fall on the same circle) is another cyclic polygon inscribed in the same circle, the polygon whose vertices are the midpoints of the circular arcs between the vertices of .. Iterating the midpoint-stretching operation on an arbitrary initial polygon results in a sequence of polygons whose shapes converge to that of a regular polygon. Generalizations The abovementioned formulas for the midpoint of a segment implicitly use the lengths of segments. However, in the generalization to affine geometry, where segment lengths are not defined, the midpoint can still be defined since it is an affine invariant. The synthetic affine definition of the midpoint of a segment is the projective harmonic conjugate of the point at infinity, , of the line . That is, the point such that . When coordinates can be introduced in an affine geometry, the two definitions of midpoint will coincide. The midpoint is not naturally defined in projective geometry since there is no distinguished point to play the role of the point at infinity (any point in a projective range may be projectively mapped to any other point in (the same or some other) projective range). However, fixing a point at infinity defines an affine structure on the projective line in question and the above definition can be applied. The definition of the midpoint of a segment may be extended to geodesic arcs on a Riemannian manifold. Note that, unlike in the affine case, the midpoint between two points may not be uniquely determined.

Non-integrated Sachs‚ÄìWolfe effect  The non-integrated Sachs‚ÄìWolfe effect is caused by gravitational redshift occurring at the surface of last scattering. The effect is not constant across the sky due to differences in the matter/energy density at the time of last scattering.  Integrated Sachs‚ÄìWolfe effect  The integrated Sachs‚ÄìWolfe (ISW) effect is also caused by gravitational redshift, but it occurs between the surface of last scattering and the Earth, so it is not part of the primordial CMB. It occurs when the Universe is dominated in its energy density by something other than matter. If the Universe is dominated by matter, then large-scale gravitational potential energy wells and hills do not evolve significantly. If the Universe is dominated by radiation, or by dark energy, though, those potentials do evolve, subtly changing the energy of photons passing through them. There are two contributions to the ISW effect. The \\"early-time\\" ISW occurs immediately after the (non-integrated) Sachs‚ÄìWolfe effect produces the primordial CMB, as photons course through density fluctuations while there is still enough radiation around to affect the Universe's expansion. Although it is physically the same as the late-time ISW, for observational purposes it is usually lumped in with the primordial CMB, since the matter fluctuations that cause it are in practice undetectable.  Late-time integrated Sachs‚ÄìWolfe effect  The \\"late-time\\" ISW effect arises quite recently in cosmic history, as dark energy, or the cosmological constant, starts to govern the Universe's expansion. Unfortunately, the nomenclature is a bit confusing. Often, \\"late-time ISW\\" implicitly refers to the late-time ISW effect to linear/first order in density perturbations. This linear part of the effect entirely vanishes in a flat universe with only matter, but dominates over the higher-order part of the effect in a universe with dark energy. The full nonlinear (linear + higher-order) late-time ISW effect, especially in the case of individual voids and clusters, is sometimes known as the Rees‚ÄìSciama effect, since Martin Rees and Dennis Sciama elucidated the following physical picture. Accelerated expansion due to dark energy causes even strong large-scale potential wells (superclusters) and hills (voids) to decay over the time it takes a photon to travel through them. A photon gets a kick of energy going into a potential well (a supercluster), and it keeps some of that energy after it exits, after the well has been stretched out and shallowed. Similarly, a photon has to expend energy entering a supervoid, but will not get all of it back upon exiting the slightly squashed potential hill. A signature of the late-time ISW is a non-zero cross- correlation function between the galaxy density (the number of galaxies per square degree) and the temperature of the CMB, because superclusters gently heat photons, while supervoids gently cool them. This correlation has been detected at moderate to high significance. A detailed analysis of how parameters like shot noise, maximum multipole or redshift ranges can influence the significance of radio continuum surveys was presented by Rahman in 2014. In May 2008, Granett, Neyrinck & Szapudi showed that the late-time ISW can be pinned to discrete supervoids and superclusters identified in the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy catalog. Their ISW detection traces the localised ISW effect produced by supervoids and superclusters have on the CMB. However, the amplitude of this localised detection is controversial, as it is significantly larger than the expectations and depends on several assumptions of the analysis.

The game is played by two players, each with a conker threaded onto a piece of string: they take turns striking each other's conker until one breaks. Origins The first mention of the game is in Robert Southey's memoirs published in 1821. He describes a similar game, but played with snail shells or hazelnuts. It was only from the 1850s that using horse chestnuts was regularly referred to in certain regions. The game grew in popularity in the 19th century, and spread beyond England. The first recorded game of Conkers using horse chestnuts was on the Isle of Wight in 1848.Iona and Peter Opie, Children's Games in Street and Playground: Chasing, catching, seeking, hunting, racing, duelling, exerting, daring, guessing, acting, pretending, Oxford: Clarendon, 1969, p. 232. There is uncertainty of the origins of the name. The name may come from the dialect word conker, meaning \\"knock out\\" (perhaps related to French conque meaning a conch, as the game was originally played using snail shells and small bits of string. refers to Conkers as \\"the same game as Cogger\\" and states that it is more generally known as \\"plying with a hard nut\\".) The name may also be influenced by the verb conquer, as earlier games involving shells and hazelnuts have also been called conquerors. Another possibility is that it is an onomatopoeia, representing the sound made by a horse chestnut as it hits another hard object, such as a skull (another children's \\"game\\", also called conkers, consists of simply throwing the seeds at one another over a fence or wall). Conkers are also known regionally as cheesers, a \\"cheeser\\" being a conker with one or more flat sides, which comes about due to it sharing its pod with other conkers (twins or triplets). Also Cheggers was used in Lancaster, England in the 1920s. In D. H. Lawrence's book Sons and Lovers, the game is referred to as cobblers by William Morel. Game Stringing a conker conker on a string, ready to play * A hole is drilled in a large, hard conker using a nail, gimlet, small screwdriver, or electric drill. A piece of string (often a shoelace is used), about 20 cm (8 inches) long, is threaded through it. A large knot at one or both ends of the string secures the conker. * The game is played between two people, each with a conker. * They take turns hitting each other's conker using their own. One player lets the conker dangle on the full length of the string while the other player swings their conker and hits. Scoring * The conker eventually breaks the other's conker, and gains a point. This may be either the attacking conker or (more often) the defending one. * A new conker is a none-er meaning that it has conquered none yet. * If a none-er breaks another none-er then it becomes a one-er, if it was a one-er then it becomes a two-er etc. In some areas of Scotland, conker victories are counted using the terms bully-one, bully-two, etc. In some areas of the United States and Canada, conker victories are counted using the terms one-kinger, two-kinger, etc. * In some regions the winning conker assimilates the previous score of the losing conker, as well as gaining the score from that particular game. For example, if a two-er plays a three-er, the surviving conker will become a six-er (the sum of the two previous scores plus one for the current game). In other regions the winning conker simply gains one point, irrespective of the points-value of the loser. Variant rules * If the strings become entangled, the first player to shout \\"strings\\" or \\"stringsies\\" has an extra turn. * If one player drops their conker, the other can shout \\"stamps\\" or \\"stampsies\\" entitling them to try and break the conker on the ground by stamping on it. Shouting \\"no stamps\\" before the other player can shout \\"stamps\\" prevents any stamping. Hardening conkers The hardest conkers usually win. Hardening conkers is often done by keeping them for a year (aged conkers are called laggies in many areas or seasoners in Ireland and Liverpool), baking them briefly, soaking or boiling in vinegar, or painting with clear nail varnish. Such hardening is, however, usually regarded as cheating. At the British Junior Conkers Championships on the Isle of Wight in October 2005, contestants were banned from bringing their own conkers due to fears that they might harden them. The Campaign for Real Conkers claimed this was an example of over-regulation which was causing a drop in interest in the game. In both the World Conker Championship and the North American Championship, contestants are also restricted to using the conkers provided by the Organisers. One factor affecting the strength of a conker is the shape of the hole. A clean cylindrical hole is stronger, as it has no notches or chips that can begin a crack or split. Similar game A similar Puerto Rican game (played with the smaller seed of the jatob√°, Hymenaea courbaril) is called gallitos (meaning small roosters or cocks, as in cockfighting). The opponents face each other and the defending gallito is laid in the center of a circle drawn in the dirt. Not until the attacking player misses will the defending player take a turn. Upon missing, if the attacking player is quick enough, they will try to swing at the defending gallito before the defendant removes it from within the circle. If the defending gallito is struck it must remain in the circle until the attacker misses again. This move is called a \\"paso de paloma\\".Monograph on Hymenaea courbaril , p. 1 Championships In 1965 the World Conker Championships were set up in Ashton (near Oundle) Northamptonshire, England, and still take place on the second Sunday of October every year. In 2004, an audience of 5,000 turned up to watch more than 500 competitors from all over the world. The 2016 Championship was featured on the BBC programme \\"Countryfile\\". 1976 was the first time that a non-British contestant won the Men's World Conker Championship. The Mexican Jorge Ramirez Carrillo took the place of a contestant who was unable to arrive on time at Ashton, and defeated the 1975 champion at the finals. The Men's champion has been British in every other year except 1998, when Helmut Kern from Nauort, Germany, won. In 1999 the Irish Conker Championships began in Freshford, County Kilkenny in the Republic of Ireland. 2000 saw the first Ladies' champion from outside the UK. Selma Becker, originally from Austria, took the title. The title of Queen of Conkers has remained in the UK, except in 2001 when Frenchwoman Celine Parachou won. 2001 Eamonn Dooley from Freshford in Co. Kilkenny, Ireland broke the world record by smashing 306 conkers in one hour. In 2004 an alternative World Conker Championships was first hosted at Pill Harriers Rugby Club, Newport, Wales. This championship, known as the World Annual National Conker Championships, has been held every year since and is sanctioned by Dogfish Promotions. Contestants from America, Italy, England and Wales have taken part. North America The North American Conker Championship was inaugurated on 20 October 2012 at the Historic Gardens in the town of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, Canada, hosted by the Annapolis Royal Conker Club.http://www.annapolisroyalconkerclub.ca/ The first North American Conker Champion was Jeff Hafting, of Annapolis Royal, NS. Ryan Scranton of Granville Beach, NS, was the runner-up. The 2013 North American Championship was similarly held on the third Saturday, 19 October, and the eventual winner of an all-female Final was Krystyna Schulz of Halifax, NS. Victor of the 2014 North American Championship was Julian Smith of Yarmouth, NS. In 2015 the Championship took place on 17 October, once more hosted at the Historic Gardens in Annapolis Royal. The coveted Crofton Chalice was almost regained by Jeff Hafting, the Inaugural 2012 Champion, but he lost in the Final to Simon Bonnington of Granville Ferry, NS. This saw the return of the trophy to its home in Annapolis Royal. 2016 saw the Championship won by Elizabeth Mount of Bear River, NS. In the final bout she beat Oliver Bonnington, son of the 2015 Champion. Remarkably the 2017 final was a re-match of the previous year as Oliver Bonnington once again tried to beat Elizabeth Mount. It was not to be, and Elizabeth became the first North American Champion to retain the Title. In the 2018 Championship on 13 October, Mount was eliminated in the first round; the eventual Champion that year was Amanda Carson of Kingston, NS, who defeated Rikarda Albright. Amanda was eliminated in the second round the following year, and the 2019 final saw Spike Sprague of Granville Ferry, NS, pitted against his mother, Georgette Sprague. Georgette, from Petitcodiac, New Brunswick, was the victor when Spike's chestnut shattered on delivering a powerful blow. Prior to this recent re-emergence, it had been played during the late 1940s and early 1950s in New York in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, and in the 1950s and early 1960s in the Amalgamated section of the Bronx and nearby Mt.Vernon. A winning chestnut was referred to as a \\"killer\\" and the value of a chestnut was defined by its number of \\"kills.\\" It was also played in Queens, the upper West Side of Manhattan, in the Mohawk Valley area of upstate New York and in Westmount, Quebec and other English-speaking parts of Montreal into the 1970s. It was played in the Catholic areas of North Cambridge, MA in the late 1950s, and a winning chestnut was also labeled a \\"killer\\". It was being played in the 1960s in Rhode Island. and into the early 1980s in Smithfield, RI. The game was also played in Leicester, Massachusetts in the late 1970s and into the 1980s (and presumably much earlier, given the town's age and predominantly English/Irish settlers) by the children of the Primary School of the town (typically 4th and 5th graders). Leicester's seat of government (\\"town hall\\") was a dual use building, serving as both town hall and school. There is a large horse chestnut tree located on the town's common (and adjacent to town hall) that was used as a source for the chestnuts. The Leiecester variant on the name for the game was \\"Horse Cobblers\\"(presumably a variant of \\"Horse Conkers\\").Leicester, Massachusetts Safety concerns In 2000 a survey of British schools by Keele University showed that many were not allowing children to play conkers, as head teachers were afraid of the legal consequences if children were injured while playing the game, or because they thought that the conkers might be used as weapons. The TV programme Top Gear later staged a game of conkers using caravans (travel trailers) suspended from cranes. After putting on safety goggles, presenter James May commented \\"I now feel perfectly happy about being hit in the face by a caravan.\\" Top Gear, along with other media commentators, wrongly stated that the wearing of goggles during the game was due to an official Health and Safety Executive (HSE) edict when it was in fact due to a myth which started when a headmaster bought goggles for children to use as a parody of health and safety regulation and sponsored a Conkers tournament. In 2004, several schools banned conkers due to fear of causing anaphylactic shock in pupils with nut allergies. Health advisers said that there were no known dangers from conkers for nut-allergy sufferers, although some may experience a mild rash through handling them.BBC News: School bans 'nut allergy' conkers (7 October 2009) (Accessed 2009-03-18) See also * Egg tapping, a similar game with eggs References * External links * British Library Playtimes An interview about conkers recorded in 1970 by Iona Opie * Category:Children's games Category:Autumn traditions ","title":"Conkers"},{"id":"437993","text":"The year 1746 in science and technology involved some significant events.

It can be considered a kind of flattened dumpling or very nourishing pancake. It comes as a round Pfannenpickert the size of a pan, a rectangular Kastenpickert, or a palm-sized regular Pickert. The name is derived from Low German picken, pecken (\\"to stick something onto something else\\"). The main ingredients are grated potatoes, flour, milk, eggs, and (usually) raisins, with a little yeast, salt and sugar, and oil for the baking. Three big potatoes produce 10‚Äì15 palm-sized pickerts, enough for 4‚Äì5 people. Pickerts are a specialty of the district of Lippe, where they developed from a traditional meal for the poorer people. In former times, Pickert was eaten as breakfast or lunch by poor farmers, being a cheap and very nourishing dish, as would be required of food for a day's work in the fields. They are now served spread with sugar beet syrup, butter or (plum) jam, or leberwurst. A related dish, Lappenpickert, is found in the regions west of Lippe, towards M√ºnster and the Ruhr Area. It does not usually contain raisins and yeast, but may have a dash of sweet cream added. Lappenpickert is usually baked in rather thin pancakes on a griddle greased with a side of lard, and eaten with the same spreads as Pickerts from Lippe, or with smoked fish or cold cuts.

Psychophysics has been described as \\"the scientific study of the relation between stimulus and sensation\\" or, more completely, as \\"the analysis of perceptual processes by studying the effect on a subject's experience or behaviour of systematically varying the properties of a stimulus along one or more physical dimensions\\". Psychophysics also refers to a general class of methods that can be applied to study a perceptual system. Modern applications rely heavily on threshold measurement, ideal observer analysis, and signal detection theory. Psychophysics has widespread and important practical applications. For example, in the study of digital signal processing, psychophysics has informed the development of models and methods of lossy compression. These models explain why humans perceive very little loss of signal quality when audio and video signals are formatted using lossy compression. History Many of the classical techniques and theories of psychophysics were formulated in 1860 when Gustav Theodor Fechner in Leipzig published Elemente der Psychophysik (Elements of Psychophysics). He coined the term \\"psychophysics\\", describing research intended to relate physical stimuli to the contents of consciousness such as sensations (Empfindungen). As a physicist and philosopher, Fechner aimed at developing a method that relates matter to the mind, connecting the publicly observable world and a person's privately experienced impression of it. His ideas were inspired by experimental results on the sense of touch and light obtained in the early 1830s by the German physiologist Ernst Heinrich Weber in Leipzig,Snodgrass JG. 1975. Psychophysics. In: Experimental Sensory Psychology. B Scharf. (Ed.) pp. 17‚Äì67. most notably those on the minimum discernible difference in intensity of stimuli of moderate strength (just noticeable difference; jnd) which Weber had shown to be a constant fraction of the reference intensity, and which Fechner referred to as Weber's law. From this, Fechner derived his well-known logarithmic scale, now known as Fechner scale. Weber's and Fechner's work formed one of the bases of psychology as a science, with Wilhelm Wundt founding the first laboratory for psychological research in Leipzig (Institut f√ºr experimentelle Psychologie). Fechner's work systematised the introspectionist approach (psychology as the science of consciousness), that had to contend with the Behaviorist approach in which even verbal responses are as physical as the stimuli. During the 1930s, when psychological research in Nazi Germany essentially came to a halt, both approaches eventually began to be replaced by use of stimulus-response relationships as evidence for conscious or unconscious processing in the mind.Broadbent DE. 1964. Behaviour; Neisser U. 1970. Cognitive psychology. Fechner's work was studied and extended by Charles S. Peirce, who was aided by his student Joseph Jastrow, who soon became a distinguished experimental psychologist in his own right. Peirce and Jastrow largely confirmed Fechner's empirical findings, but not all. In particular, a classic experiment of Peirce and Jastrow rejected Fechner's estimation of a threshold of perception of weights, as being far too high. In their experiment, Peirce and Jastrow in fact invented randomized experiments: They randomly assigned volunteers to a blinded, repeated-measures design to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights. Peirce's experiment inspired other researchers in psychology and education, which developed a research tradition of randomized experiments in laboratories and specialized textbooks in the 1900s. The Peirce‚ÄìJastrow experiments were conducted as part of Peirce's application of his pragmaticism program to human perception; other studies considered the perception of light, etc.and text-string search Jastrow wrote the following summary: \\"Mr. Peirce‚Äôs courses in logic gave me my first real experience of intellectual muscle. Though I promptly took to the laboratory of psychology when that was established by Stanley Hall, it was Peirce who gave me my first training in the handling of a psychological problem, and at the same time stimulated my self-esteem by entrusting me, then fairly innocent of any laboratory habits, with a real bit of research. He borrowed the apparatus for me, which I took to my room, installed at my window, and with which, when conditions of illumination were right, I took the observations. The results were published over our joint names in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The demonstration that traces of sensory effect too slight to make any registry in consciousness could none the less influence judgment, may itself have been a persistent motive that induced me years later to undertake a book on The Subconscious.\\" This work clearly distinguishes observable cognitive performance from the expression of consciousness. Modern approaches to sensory perception, such as research on vision, hearing, or touch, measure what the perceiver's judgment extracts from the stimulus, often putting aside the question what sensations are being experienced. One leading method is based on signal detection theory, developed for cases of very weak stimuli. However, the subjectivist approach persists among those in the tradition of Stanley Smith Stevens (1906-1973). Stevens revived the idea of a power law suggested by 19th century researchers, in contrast with Fechner's log-linear function (cf. Stevens' power law). He also advocated the assignment of numbers in ratio to the strengths of stimuli, called magnitude estimation. Stevens added techniques such as magnitude production and cross-modality matching. He opposed the assignment of stimulus strengths to points on a line that are labeled in order of strength. Nevertheless, that sort of response has remained popular in applied psychophysics. Such multiple-category layouts are often misnamed Likert scaling after the question items used by Likert to create multi-item psychometric scales, e.g., seven phrases from \\"strongly agree\\" through \\"strongly disagree\\". Omar Khaleefa has argued that the medieval scientist Alhazen should be considered the founder of psychophysics. Although al-Haytham made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and such claims have been rebuffed. Thresholds Psychophysicists usually employ experimental stimuli that can be objectively measured, such as pure tones varying in intensity, or lights varying in luminance. All the senses have been studied: vision, hearing, touch (including skin and enteric perception), taste, smell and the sense of time. Regardless of the sensory domain, there are three main areas of investigation: absolute thresholds, discrimination thresholds and scaling. A threshold (or limen) is the point of intensity at which the participant can just detect the presence of a stimulus (absolute threshold) or the presence of a difference between two stimuli (difference threshold). Stimuli with intensities below the threshold are considered not detectable (hence: sub- liminal). Stimuli at values close enough to a threshold will often be detectable some proportion of occasions; therefore, a threshold is considered to be the point at which a stimulus, or change in a stimulus, is detected some proportion p of occasions. Detection An absolute threshold is the level of intensity of a stimulus at which the subject is able to detect the presence of the stimulus some proportion of the time (a p level of 50% is often used).John Krantz. \\"Experiencing Sensation and Perception\\" . pp. 2.3‚Äì2.4. Retrieved May 29, 2012. An example of an absolute threshold is the number of hairs on the back of one's hand that must be touched before it can be felt ‚Äì a participant may be unable to feel a single hair being touched, but may be able to feel two or three as this exceeds the threshold. Absolute threshold is also often referred to as detection threshold. Several different methods are used for measuring absolute thresholds (as with discrimination thresholds; see below). Discrimination A difference threshold (or just-noticeable difference, JND) is the magnitude of the smallest difference between two stimuli of differing intensities that the participant is able to detect some proportion of the time (the percentage depending on the kind of task). To test this threshold, several different methods are used. The subject may be asked to adjust one stimulus until it is perceived as the same as the other (method of adjustment), may be asked to describe the direction and magnitude of the difference between two stimuli, or may be asked to decide whether intensities in a pair of stimuli are the same or not (forced choice). The just-noticeable difference (JND) is not a fixed quantity; rather, it depends on how intense the stimuli being measured are and the particular sense being measured.Schacter, Daniel L.; Gilbert, Daniel t.; Wegner, Daniel M. (2010). Psychology (2nd ed.) Weber's Law states that the just-noticeable difference of a stimulus is a constant proportion despite variation in intensity.Gustav Theodor Fechner (1860). Elemente der Psychophysik (Elements of Psychophysics), Kap. IX: Das Weber‚Äôsche Gesetz. In discrimination experiments, the experimenter seeks to determine at what point the difference between two stimuli, such as two weights or two sounds, is detectable. The subject is presented with one stimulus, for example a weight, and is asked to say whether another weight is heavier or lighter (in some experiments, the subject may also say the two weights are the same). At the point of subjective equality (PSE), the subject perceives the two weights to be the same. The just- noticeable difference,Psychology: the Science of Behaviour. 4th ED. Neil R. Carlson, C. Donald Heth or difference limen (DL), is the magnitude of the difference in stimuli that the subject notices some proportion p of the time (50% is usually used for p in the comparison task). In addition, a two- alternative forced choice (2-afc) paradigm can be used to assess the point at which performance reduces to chance on a discrimination between two alternatives (p will then typically be 75% since p=50% corresponds to chance in the 2-afc task). Absolute and difference thresholds are sometimes considered similar in principle because there is always background noise interfering with our ability to detect stimuli. Experimentation In psychophysics, experiments seek to determine whether the subject can detect a stimulus, identify it, differentiate between it and another stimulus, or describe the magnitude or nature of this difference. Software for psychophysical experimentation is overviewed by Strasburger.Strasburger H (1995‚Äì2020). Software for visual psychophysics: an overview. VisionScience.com Classical psychophysical methods Psychophysical experiments have traditionally used three methods for testing subjects' perception in stimulus detection and difference detection experiments: the method of limits, the method of constant stimuli and the method of adjustment. =Method of limits= In the ascending method of limits, some property of the stimulus starts out at a level so low that the stimulus could not be detected, then this level is gradually increased until the participant reports that they are aware of it. For example, if the experiment is testing the minimum amplitude of sound that can be detected, the sound begins too quietly to be perceived, and is made gradually louder. In the descending method of limits, this is reversed. In each case, the threshold is considered to be the level of the stimulus property at which the stimuli are just detected. In experiments, the ascending and descending methods are used alternately and the thresholds are averaged. A possible disadvantage of these methods is that the subject may become accustomed to reporting that they perceive a stimulus and may continue reporting the same way even beyond the threshold (the error of habituation). Conversely, the subject may also anticipate that the stimulus is about to become detectable or undetectable and may make a premature judgment (the error of anticipation). To avoid these potential pitfalls, Georg von B√©k√©sy introduced the staircase procedure in 1960 in his study of auditory perception. In this method, the sound starts out audible and gets quieter after each of the subject's responses, until the subject does not report hearing it. At that point, the sound is made louder at each step, until the subject reports hearing it, at which point it is made quieter in steps again. This way the experimenter is able to \\"zero in\\" on the threshold. =Method of constant stimuli= Instead of being presented in ascending or descending order, in the method of constant stimuli the levels of a certain property of the stimulus are not related from one trial to the next, but presented randomly. This prevents the subject from being able to predict the level of the next stimulus, and therefore reduces errors of habituation and expectation. For 'absolute thresholds' again the subject reports whether they are able to detect the stimulus. For 'difference thresholds' there has to be a constant comparison stimulus with each of the varied levels. Friedrich Hegelmaier described the method of constant stimuli in an 1852 paper. This method allows for full sampling of the psychometric function, but can result in a lot of trials when several conditions are interleaved. =Method of adjustment= In the method of adjustment, the subject is asked to control the level of the stimulus and to alter it until it is just barely detectable against the background noise, or is the same as the level of another stimulus. The adjustment is repeated many times. This is also called the method of average error. In this method, the observers themselves control the magnitude of the variable stimulus, beginning with a level that is distinctly greater or lesser than a standard one and vary it until they are satisfied by the subjective equality of the two. The difference between the variable stimuli and the standard one is recorded after each adjustment, and the error is tabulated for a considerable series. At the end, the mean is calculated giving the average error which can be taken as a measure of sensitivity. Adaptive psychophysical methods The classic methods of experimentation are often argued to be inefficient. This is because, in advance of testing, the psychometric threshold is usually unknown and most of the data are collected at points on the psychometric function that provide little information about the parameter of interest, usually the threshold. Adaptive staircase procedures (or the classical method of adjustment) can be used such that the points sampled are clustered around the psychometric threshold. Data points can also be spread in a slightly wider range, if the psychometric function's slope is also of interest. Adaptive methods can thus be optimized for estimating the threshold only, or both threshold and slope. Adaptive methods are classified into staircase procedures (see below) and Bayesian, or maximum- likelihood, methods. Staircase methods rely on the previous response only, and are easier to implement. Bayesian methods take the whole set of previous stimulus-response pairs into account and are generally more robust against lapses in attention. Practical examples are found here. =Staircase procedures= Diagram showing a specific staircase procedure: Transformed Up/Down Method (1 up/ 2 down rule). Until the first reversal (which is neglected) the simple up/down rule and a larger step size is used. Staircases usually begin with a high intensity stimulus, which is easy to detect. The intensity is then reduced until the observer makes a mistake, at which point the staircase 'reverses' and intensity is increased until the observer responds correctly, triggering another reversal. The values for the last of these 'reversals' are then averaged. There are many different types of staircase procedures, using different decision and termination rules. Step- size, up/down rules and the spread of the underlying psychometric function dictate where on the psychometric function they converge. Threshold values obtained from staircases can fluctuate wildly, so care must be taken in their design. Many different staircase algorithms have been modeled and some practical recommendations suggested by Garcia-Perez. One of the more common staircase designs (with fixed-step sizes) is the 1-up-N-down staircase. If the participant makes the correct response N times in a row, the stimulus intensity is reduced by one step size. If the participant makes an incorrect response the stimulus intensity is increased by the one size. A threshold is estimated from the mean midpoint of all runs. This estimate approaches, asymptotically, the correct threshold. =Bayesian and maximum-likelihood procedures= Bayesian and maximum-likelihood (ML) adaptive procedures behave, from the observer's perspective, similar to the staircase procedures. The choice of the next intensity level works differently, however: After each observer response, from the set of this and all previous stimulus/response pairs the likelihood is calculated of where the threshold lies. The point of maximum likelihood is then chosen as the best estimate for the threshold, and the next stimulus is presented at that level (since a decision at that level will add the most information). In a Bayesian procedure, a prior likelihood is further included in the calculation. Compared to staircase procedures, Bayesian and ML procedures are more time-consuming to implement but are considered to be more robust. Well-known procedures of this kind are Quest, ML-PEST, and Kontsevich & Tyler's method. =Magnitude estimation= In the prototypical case, people are asked to assign numbers in proportion to the magnitude of the stimulus. This psychometric function of the geometric means of their numbers is often a power law with stable, replicable exponent. Although contexts can change the law & exponent, that change too is stable and replicable. Instead of numbers, other sensory or cognitive dimensions can be used to match a stimulus and the method then becomes \\"magnitude production\\" or \\"cross-modality matching\\". The exponents of those dimensions found in numerical magnitude estimation predict the exponents found in magnitude production. Magnitude estimation generally finds lower exponents for the psychophysical function than multiple-category responses, because of the restricted range of the categorical anchors, such as those used by Likert as items in attitude scales.

It emphasized close reading, particularly of poetry, to discover how a work of literature functioned as a self-contained, self-referential aesthetic object. The movement derived its name from John Crowe Ransom's 1941 book The New Criticism. The work of Cambridge scholar I. A. Richards, especially his Practical Criticism and The Meaning of Meaning, which offered what was claimed to be an empirical scientific approach, were important to the development of New Critical methodology.Lynn, Steven. Texts and Contexts: Writing about Literature with Critical Theory. Addison-Wesley, 2001. Also very influential were the critical essays of T. S. Eliot, such as \\"Tradition and the Individual Talent\\" and \\"Hamlet and His Problems\\", in which Eliot developed his notion of the \\"objective correlative\\". Eliot's evaluative judgments, such as his condemnation of Milton and Dryden, his liking for the so-called metaphysical poets, and his insistence that poetry must be impersonal, greatly influenced the formation of the New Critical canon. Formalism theory New Criticism developed as a reaction to the older philological and literary history schools of the US North, which, influenced by nineteenth-century German scholarship, focused on the history and meaning of individual words and their relation to foreign and ancient languages, comparative sources, and the biographical circumstances of the authors. These approaches, it was felt, tended to distract from the text and meaning of a poem and entirely neglect its aesthetic qualities in favor of teaching about external factors. On the other hand, the literary appreciation school, which limited itself to pointing out the \\"beauties\\" and morally elevating qualities of the text, was disparaged by the New Critics as too subjective and emotional. Condemning this as a version of Romanticism, they aimed for newer, systematic and objective method.For an overview, see Gerald Graff, Professing Literature, Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1987. It was felt, especially by creative writers and by literary critics outside the academy, that the special aesthetic experience of poetry and literary language was lost in the welter of extraneous erudition and emotional effusions. Heather Dubrow notes that the prevailing focus of literary scholarship was on \\"the study of ethical values and philosophical issues through literature, the tracing of literary history, and ... political criticism\\". Literature was approached and literary scholarship did not focus on analysis of texts.Dubrow, Heather. \\"Twentieth Century Shakespeare Criticism.\\" The Riverside Shakespeare. Houghton Mifflin, 1997. New Critics believed the structure and meaning of the text were intimately connected and should not be analyzed separately. In order to bring the focus of literary studies back to analysis of the texts, they aimed to exclude the reader's response, the author's intention, historical and cultural contexts, and moralistic bias from their analysis. These goals were articulated in Ransom's \\"Criticism, Inc.\\" and Allen Tate's \\"Miss Emily and the Bibliographer\\". Close reading (or explication de texte) was a staple of French literary studies, but in the United States, aesthetic concerns and the study of modern poets were the province of non-academic essayists and book reviewers rather than serious scholars. The New Criticism changed this. Though their interest in textual study initially met with resistance from older scholars, the methods of the New Critics rapidly predominated in American universities until challenged by Feminism and structuralism in the 1970s. Other schools of critical theory, including, post-structuralism, and deconstructionist theory, the New Historicism, and Receptions studies followed. Although the New Critics were never a formal group, an important inspiration was the teaching of John Crowe Ransom of Kenyon College, whose students (all Southerners), Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks, and Robert Penn Warren would go on to develop the aesthetics that came to be known as the New Criticism. Indeed, for Paul Lauter, a Professor of American Studies at Trinity College, New Criticism is a reemergence of the Southern Agrarians. In his essay, \\"The New Criticism\\", Cleanth Brooks notes that \\"The New Critic, like the Snark, is a very elusive beast\\", meaning that there was no clearly defined \\"New Critical\\" manifesto, school, or stance.Brooks, Cleanth. \\"The New Criticism.\\" The Sewanee Review 87: 4 (1979): 592. Nevertheless, a number of writings outline inter-related New Critical ideas. In 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled \\"The Intentional Fallacy\\", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author's intention, or \\"intended meaning\\" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting. In another essay, \\"The Affective Fallacy\\", which served as a kind of sister essay to \\"The Intentional Fallacy\\" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, Stanley Fish, was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay \\"Literature in the Reader\\" (1970).Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2001. The hey-day of the New Criticism in American high schools and colleges was the Cold War decades between 1950 and the mid-seventies. Brooks and Warren's Understanding Poetry and Understanding Fiction both became staples during this era. Studying a passage of prose or poetry in New Critical style required careful, exacting scrutiny of the passage itself. Formal elements such as rhyme, meter, setting, characterization, and plot were used to identify the theme of the text. In addition to the theme, the New Critics also looked for paradox, ambiguity, irony, and tension to help establish the single best and most unified interpretation of the text. Although the New Criticism is no longer a dominant theoretical model in American universities, some of its methods (like close reading) are still fundamental tools of literary criticism, underpinning a number of subsequent theoretic approaches to literature including poststructuralism, deconstruction theory, New Testament narrative criticism, and reader-response theory. Criticism It was frequently alleged that the New Criticism treated literary texts as autonomous and divorced from historical context, and that its practitioners were \\"uninterested in the human meaning, the social function and effect of literature.\\"Wellek, Ren√©. \\"The New Criticism: Pro and Contra.\\" Critical Inquiry, Vol. 4, No. 4. (Summer, 1978), pp. 611‚Äì624. . Indicative of the reader-response school of theory, Terence Hawkes writes that the fundamental close reading technique is based on the assumption that \\"the subject and the object of study‚Äîthe reader and the text‚Äîare stable and independent forms, rather than products of the unconscious process of signification,\\" an assumption which he identifies as the \\"ideology of liberal humanism,\\" which is attributed to the New Critics who are \\"accused of attempting to disguise the interests at work in their critical processes.\\" For Hawkes, ideally, a critic ought to be considered to \\"[create] the finished work by his reading of it, and [not to] remain simply an inert consumer of a 'ready-made' product.\\" In response to critics like Hawkes, Cleanth Brooks, in his essay \\"The New Criticism\\" (1979), argued that the New Criticism was not diametrically opposed to the general principles of reader-response theory and that the two could complement one another. For instance, he stated, \\"If some of the New Critics have preferred to stress the writing rather than the writer, so have they given less stress to the reader‚Äîto the reader's response to the work. Yet no one in his right mind could forget the reader. He is essential for 'realizing' any poem or novel. ... Reader response is certainly worth studying.\\" However, Brooks tempers his praise for the reader-response theory by noting its limitations, pointing out that, \\"to put meaning and valuation of a literary work at the mercy of any and every individual [reader] would reduce the study of literature to reader psychology and to the history of taste.\\"Brooks, Cleanth. \\"The New Criticism.\\" The Sewanee Review 87:4 (1979) 598. Another objection to the New Criticism is that it is thought to aim at making criticism scientific, or at least \\"bringing literary study to a condition rivaling that of science.\\" Ren√© Wellek, however, points out the erroneous nature of this criticism by noting that a number of the New Critics outlined their theoretical aesthetics in stark contrast to the \\"objectivity\\" of the sciences (although Ransom, in his essay \\"Criticism, Inc.\\" did advocate that \\"criticism must become more scientific, or precise and systematic\\").Ransom, John Crowe. \\"Criticism, Inc.\\" The Virginia Quarterly Review, Autumn 1937.

History Caloric Corporation began as the Klein Stove Company in Philadelphia in 1890. The Caloric brand was introduced in 1903. It was reorganized in 1946 as the Caloric Stove Company in Topton, Pennsylvania. The company was renamed Caloric Appliance Corp. in 1954 and became famous for offering a complete package of kitchen appliances in the 1950s and 1960s. Its most popular product was their built-in wall oven. In 1967, it was acquired by Raytheon Corporation which also owned Amana refrigerators and Speed Queen laundry products. By the early 1990s, Caloric was absorbed into Amana and the Caloric brand was phased out. The Topton plant was shut down in 1991. In 1997 the company was purchased by Goodman Global, a heating-and-cooling manufacturer who sold it to Maytag (now part of Whirlpool) in 2002.^ \\"Amana Milestones\\". Appliancedesign.com. Retrieved August 1, 2002. One important feature of the Caloric gas stove in the 1960s was the infrared burner, which cooks through radiant heat. This distinguished Caloric ovens from their competitors, which produced gas ovens comprising two burners: one positioned lower for baking and another positioned on top for broiling. The Janesville Caloric Company factory existed from 1908 to 1924. It manufactured the Caloric Cooker, a ‚Äúfireless cook stove‚Äù and precursor to modern day slow cookers. The company operated out of an old furniture factory. The Caloric Cooker consisted of an insulated cabinet with one or more deep wells fitted with soapstones on the top and on the bottom. After the stones were heated and the food was put into the wells; one stone was placed at the top and the bottom of the stove. You could close the lid and the meal would be cooked without danger of its burning. About 150 men were employed by this company when it was in full production. The cookers sold for $8.50 ‚Äì $15, depending on the number of wells, and came with a 160-page book on how to use it. The company moved operations to Pennsylvania in 1924. In the 1960s, the Caloric Company launched the iconic ad slogan ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre cooking with gas.‚Äù  Revival  JMM Lee Properties announced in 2012 the reintroduction of Caloric appliances beginning with a line of stainless steel ovens and ranges in the fall of 2012.

Notable works The Jaquet-Droz automata Constructed between 1768 and 1774 by Pierre Jaquet-Droz, his son Henri-Louis (1752-1791), and Jean- Fr√©d√©ric Leschot (1746-1824), the automata include The Writer (made of 6000 pieces), The Musician (2500 pieces), and The Draughtsman (2000 pieces). His astonishing mechanisms fascinated the kings and emperors of Europe, China, India and Japan. Some consider these devices to be the oldest examples of the computer. The Writer, a mechanical boy who writes with a quill pen upon paper with real ink, has an input device to set tabs, defining individual letters written by the boy, that form a programmable memory. It has 40 cams that represent the read-only program. The work of Pierre Jaquet-Droz predates that of Charles Babbage by decades. The automata of Jaquet-Droz are considered to be some of the finest examples of human mechanical problem solving. Three particularly complex and still functional dolls, now known as the Jaquet-Droz automata, are housed at the Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire (art and history museum) in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland.

To the East of the town is the Little Morass, an area of marshland. The fortifications of Portsmouth are extensive due to its strategic position on the English Channel and role as home to the Royal Navy. For this reason, Portsmouth was, by the 19th century, one of the most fortified cities in the world. The fortifications have evolved over the centuries in response to changes in tactics and technology and the area defended has increased. While the first defences focused on Portsmouth harbour, in step with the fortifications of Gosport, later defensive structures protected the whole of Portsea Island and an increasing distance inland. At the same time, the fortifications of Portsmouth and Gosport became part of the wider fortifications of the Solent. Old Portsmouth, on the southwest corner of Portsea Island, has been walled for much of its history.  The first fortifications  The first fortification in the area was Portchester Castle, which, ultimately, dates back to the Roman Portus Adurni. Its position allowed it to provide a degree of defence for the upper reaches of Portsmouth Harbour. The first recorded fortifications on Portsea Island appear to have been a wall constructed in 1212 around a primitive shipyard sited just to the north of what later became Camber Dock. The wall lasted less than twelve years. During the 14th century, Portsmouth was subject to attacks in 1338, 1369, 1377 and 1380. Evidence suggests that simple earthworks were constructed and reconstructed around the settlement in response. The first structure built to defend Portsmouth proper was a wooden version of the Round Tower constructed between 1418 and 1426. Four years later, a second wooden tower was added on the opposite side of the harbour.  Expansion under the Tudors  A map of Portsmouth showing the defences in the early Tudor period During Henry VII's rule, the Round Tower was rebuilt in stone and the Square Tower added. There is, however, some question as regards the extent to which it was meant to be a defensive structure. It appears likely that what is now known as the \\"saluting platform\\" was also built during Henry VII's reign. Southsea Castle at the southern tip of Portsea Island was built by his son and successor Henry VIII. To the north of the city, it is believed that a small fortification was constructed to defend the bridge across Portsbridge Creek. In 1522, the first of several defensive chains that could be raised in an attempt to block the harbour entrance was ordered. By 1542, Portsmouth was surrounded by defensive ramparts and towers built from earth and wood. One tower was positioned on the corner where the wall extending from the saluting platform met the wall running along the southeast rampart of the town. The southeast rampart was also equipped with what appears to be a firing platform, while another tower was constructed on the corner where the ramparts to the south east and the northeast of the town met. In the centre of the northwest rampart was the town gate defended by a structure known as The Mount which also acted as a bastion. Finally, the wall to the north of the town had a tower at each end one where it joined the northeast wall and one where it met the sea. Gabions were constructed along the edge of the Camber dock area and a palisade made to separate Portsmouth Point from the town. A wooden wall was constructed between the Round Tower and the saluting platform at around the same time. The next phase of expansion started in the late 1550s and continued through the rest of Elizabeth I's reign. From about 1560, the work was largely under the direction of Richard Popynjay. The ramparts were updated and the gabions along the edge of the Camber and the palisade that cut off Portsmouth point were replaced by stone wall. Other works including improving the various towers with some of them developing into bastions. The Mount defending the town gate was reconstructed, developing into what could be considered a true bastion in the process. The saluting platform also saw some rebuilding work during this period. Another development during this period is that an increasing number of the names used for the fortifications survived until the present day. The bastion on the corner where the wall extending from the saluting platform met the wall running along the southeast rampart of the town was recorded as Green's Bulwark or Chaterton's Bulwark. Of the two towers on the corners of the north wall of the town the one at the western end was known as the Dock Bulwark while the one at the eastern end is recorded as Guyes Bulwark. The mount is also recorded as being known as the Great Bastion. The gate that controlled access to Portsmouth point was known as the North Gate although by 1571 it (along with other parts of the fortifications) was in a poor state of repair. The second half of Elizabeth I's reign saw yet more work on the bastions and the first bridge at the Landport gate which was constructed in about 3 years starting 1586. During this time there also appears to have seen a fair amount of repair work. Sometime around 1600 a new gate known as point gate replaced the North Gate in controlling access to Portsmouth point.  During the Civil War  At the time of the Civil War, the fortifications mounted around 100 guns and when properly manned were considered by some to be able to withstand a siege of 40,000 men. In one of the first actions of the civil war Parliament managed to capture the city from the royalist forces during the Siege of Portsmouth.  Reconstruction under Charles II  Map, c.1668, showing Portsmouth's fortifications, together with Fort Blockhouse on Gosport point and a defensive chain across the harbour entrance. In 1665, Charles II ordered Bernard de Gomme to begin the reconstruction of Portsmouth's fortifications, a process which was to take many years. The year before this a new chain to block the harbour entrance was ordered at a cost of ¬£200. Starting 1678 Fort James was constructed on Burrow Island. Later in the 1680s Southsea castle was rebuilt. In the same decade the Portsbridge fort was also rebuilt. The city walls were again rebuilt. A second moat was also added with a new defensive line being constructed between the two moats. A ravelin was added at Landport where the London road entered the city. Round Tower and Point Battery On the shoreline a new battery was built at the end of Portsmouth point facing Gosport. Another battery, this one with 18 guns, was built that connected to the round tower with a further battery constructed between the square tower and the saluting platform. Beyond this battery, but connected to it by a tunnel, Spur redoubt was constructed. While the towns defences were being strengthened some thought appears to have been given to their aesthetic appearance. In 1665 Lieutenant-Governor Sir Philip Honeywood ordered that trees be planted on the town walls. The first true fortification of the dockyard was constructed between 1665 and 1668 although there had previously been a wall around it. The fortification consisted of an earthen rampart with a single bastion and two demi-bastions. Later in the 17th century in 1688 the fort protecting the crossing across Portsbridge creek was rebuilt under the direction of the Chief Royal Engineer Sir Martin Beckman.  18th century  1797 Ordnance Survey map, showing fortifications around Portsmouth and Portsea, fortified Gosport to the west, Hilsea Lines to the north, Fort Cumberland to the east. In the 18th century, Portsea started to grow up around the dockyard and in the 1770s a series of ramparts and moats were constructed to protect this new settlement. The sheer manpower required by de Gomme's defences meant that after about 1730 the double moat system used around Portsmouth was abandoned with the outer moat being filled in. At the same time the defences started to focus on protecting the whole of Portsea island. The portsbridge fort was again rebuilt in 1746. During 1756 and 1757 the first Hilsea lines were constructed protect the north of Portsea island. The first Fort Cumberland was constructed to prevent hostile forces from sailing to Langstone harbour and the first Lumps Fort and Eastney battery were built to protect Eastney beach. 19th century The city and harbour's most recent comprehensive fortifications were built as a result of the 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom and consist of the Palmerston Forts in the Solent, the line of Forts situated along the top of Portsdown Hill, forts in Gosport and the Hilsea Lines. Fort Cumberland and Lumps Fort were significantly rebuilt. The Portsea fortifications were expanded slightly in the 1840s and 1860s as the dockyard was extended. The city walls though were for the most part removed in the 1870s and 80s a task accomplished through the use of convict labour. 20th century Improvements in artillery technology had rendered the various landward facing fortifications obsolete over the turn of the century and by the end of the first decade they largely disarmed. After World War 1 the city council started to buy various defences as they were released by the military. The 1920s and 30s saw the purchase of much of the Hilsea lines and Lumps fort by the city. During WW2 anti tank defence blocks were constructed on Fraser Beach. Pill boxes were constructed to defend Portsmouth Airport in the form of Pickett-Hamilton Forts. The sea forts were re-equipped with AA guns. A new concrete gun emplacement which contained a single 75mm gun was constructed on the eastern part of the Hilsea lines. The remaining defences were deactivated when the UK abandoned coastal artillery in 1956. Surviving fortifications Of the defences constructed Portsea Island, Southsea Castle, Fort Cumberland, The Round tower, The Square tower, Lumps Fort, Parts of the Hilsea lines, the Spur Redoubt and parts of the walls of old Portsmouth along the seafront all survive. Various fortifications within the naval dockyard also exist. Beyond Portsea the majority of the Portsdown Forts remain although Fort Wallington has been largely demolished. Of the four gates in the walls of Old Portsmouth only Landport Gate survives in its original position. King James's gate, Lion Gate and Unicorn Gate have been re-erected slightly further away. harbour boom chains that is on display at Southsea Castle Anti tank defence blocks on Fraser Beach are now a grade 2 listed structure. A pair of links from one of the harbour boom chains are on display at Southsea castle.

They are now used as a greenspace and leisure area, also known locally as Foxes Forest. Natural defences The island is separated from the mainland by a narrow stretch of water called Portsbridge Creek. The first means of crossing the creek was by stepping stones, followed by a single track bridge, built to allow the passage of pedestrians and horse-drawn carts to have access to Portsea Island. Early defences Early defences were focused on the 'Portsbridge' that crossed the creek. A fortification is thought to have been built at the mainland end of the bridge during the reign of King Henry VIII. In 1642 the fort was captured by parliamentary forces as part of the English Civil War. It was rebuilt in 1688 and again in 1746. During the Civil War further defences were constructed by the royalists consisting of a wooden barricade mounted on the bridge backed by a small fort equipped with 4 cannon. The cannon were withdrawn on 10 August 1642 and with the barricade held by as few as eight men the parliamentarian forces were able to cross the creek two days latter. The Parliamentarians then constructed their own defences of at the site of the bridge consisting of two mounds on which a total of 6 cannon were mounted. The Parliamentarians appear to have constructed further defences near the bridge in 1643. The first lines During 1756 and 1757 defensive lines were constructed on the Portsea Island side of the creek under the supervision of John Peter Desmaretz. They consisted of a and ditch backed by a rampart. Water could be allowed to flow into the ditch from sluices at either end. The current lines The inside of one of the Hilsea Lines' gun casements The current lines were constructed between 1858 and 1871. They included special fortified bridges for road and rail access. A model of the Hilsea Lines featured in the 1862 International Exhibition. Even before their completion the Hilsea Lines had been rendered obsolete by the 1859 Royal Commission and advances in artillery technology; as such they were the last full bastioned trace constructed in the United Kingdom. The development of rifled artillery meant that it was now possible for an enemy to occupy the high ridge of Portsdown Hill north of Portsmouth and shell the naval base from several miles away without having to attack the Hilsea Lines. To counter the new threat a series of \\"Palmerston Forts\\" were constructed on Portsdown Hill and the Hilsea Lines were scaled back. In particular a pair of forts that it had been planned to place behind the lines were not constructed. As completed, the lines are largely built from clay and chalk and were high when completed. Traffic on the London Road passed through the lines via a pair of , tunnels. There was also an , tunnel for pedestrians. The section containing the tunnels was demolished in 1919. Then a further tunnel through the lines was provided for the railway. Finally, a and tunnel was built through the West centre curtain to act as a sally port. It was originally planned to equip the lines with smoothbore guns; however, it appears the guns may never have been fitted. In 1886 the lines were equipped with a mix of RML 7 inch guns and RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns on Moncrieff mountings fitted in newly constructed concrete emplacements. Further RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns were fitted in the original casements. The guns were removed in 1903. A QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss was mounted on the lines during World War 1. A small number of guns were mounted on the lines during World War II.. Post military use A section of the moat that used form part of Hilsea lagoon When the lines were built large amounts of land was purchased by the crown to the rear of the lines. Part of this land behind the west bastion was sold to the city of Portsmouth in 1926 which built a housing estate, a school and a recreation ground on it. During 1929 and 1930 the city purchased the east bastion, the curtain wall and the land behind them. This land was used as the site for a new road link to the mainland and Portsmouth Airport. At the same time the city also purchased the West Bastion. In 1932, the eastern lines were dynamited to make room for the airport. One of the more accessible parts of the Hilsea Lines path In the 1930s western end of the moat became known as the Hilsea lagoon and in the mid-1930s work was done on the banks and it was turned into a boating lake. In the same period the land between the boating lake and the lines was converted into part of the Hilsea bastion gardens. Most of the gardens were destroyed as the result of road widening in 1968-70. In 1986 the city bought those parts of the lines that were not already under its control. The terraces that formed part of the gardens were demolished in 2000. In 1938 a bridge was built across the boating lake section of the moat. It was demolished in 1999 and later replaced by the current structure. Today the lines are accessible for most of their length, but overgrown and derelict in places. The moat is used for fishing. In May 2006 the moat experienced some flooding. Most of the lines are designated as a scheduled ancient monument. In 2010 the lines were given a Green Flag Award. There is a walk around the Hilsea Lines by the Mountbatten Centre to the A27 Roundabout and Reverse. In January 2017 the casemates have various uses.

He was the President of Uganda from 29 July 1985 until 26 January 1986. Background Tito Okello was born into an ethnic Acholi family in circa 1914 in Nam Okora, Kitgum District. He joined the King's African Rifles in 1940 and served in the East African Campaign of World War II. As a career military officer, he had a variety of assignments. Okello was one of the commanders in the coalition between the Tanzania People's Defence Force and the Uganda National Liberation Army, who removed Idi Amin from power in 1979. He was selected to be the Commander of the Ugandan National Liberation Army from 1980 to 1985. Coup d'√©tat In July 1985, together with Bazilio Olara- Okello, Tito Lutwa Okello staged the coup d'√©tat that ousted president Milton Obote. He ruled as president for six months until he was overthrown by the National Resistance Army (NRA) operating under the leadership of the current president, Yoweri Museveni. He went into exile in Kenya after he was ousted. Extended family Tito Okello's son Henry Oryem Okello is the current State Minister for Foreign Affairs responsible for International Affairs. In 2002, Tito Okello's younger brother, Erisanweri Opira, was abducted from his home in Kitgum District by the rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). His abduction was considered unusual as the LRA usually kidnapped teenagers and young people to use as prospective soldiers or sex slaves. Opira was in his late seventies when he was abducted. Final years Okello remained in exile until 1993, when he was granted amnesty by President Museveni and returned to Kampala. He died three years later, of an undisclosed illness, on 3 June 1996. He was almost 82 years old at the time of his death. His remains were buried at his ancestral home in Kitgum District. Legacy and honours In January 2010, Okello was posthumously awarded the Kagera National Medal of Honor for fighting against the Idi Amin dictatorship in the 1970s.

NRA was supported by Muammar al-Gaddafi. NRA was formed in 1981 when Yoweri Museveni's Popular Resistance Army (PRA) merged with ex-president Yusuf Lule's group, the Uganda Freedom Fighters (UFF). Museveni, then leader of the Uganda Patriotic Movement party, alleged electoral fraud and declared an armed rebellion, following the victory of Uganda Peoples Congress in the bitterly disputed 1980 general elections.\\"A Country Study: The Second Obote Regime: 1981‚Äì85\\", Library of Congress Country Studies Museveni, who had guerrilla war experience with the Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO) in Mozambique, and his own Front for National Salvation (FRONASA) formed in Tanzania to fight Idi Amin, led the NRA to victory against Ugandan government troops (UNLA) in 1986. By the time that the victorious NRA entered Kampala in 1986, about a quarter of its 16,000 combatants were Banyarwanda, while Fred Rwigema was its deputy commander. The NRA then became the national army. Shortly afterwards the UNLA carried out a number of attacks against civilians in the north of Uganda. The attacks largely targeted the Acholi people and were in part seen as a form of revenge for Operation Bonanza, the scorched-earth operation there that had been ordered by Milton Obote during his presidency. From 1986 to 1990, the Museveni regime tried to end various insurgencies and to establish control over the army.Library of Congress, The Rise of the National Resistance Army, accessed February 2009 Despite repeated government claims that the NRA had defeated the UNLA and other rebel groups, insurgent activity continued, especially in the northern, eastern, and western regions. In April 1988, 3,000 former Uganda People's Army (UPA) fighters and members of several other small rebel groups accepted a government amnesty by surrendering and declaring their support for Museveni's regime. In June 1988, the president concluded a peace agreement with Uganda People's Democratic Army (UPDA) commander Lieutenant Colonel John Angelo Okello. Although the NRA subsequently integrated many UPA and UPDA personnel into its ranks, thousands of others rejected the peace accord and continued to fight against the NRA. After the 1995 Ugandan constitution was enacted, the NRA was renamed the Uganda People's Defence Force.

Guilford has both traditional students and students who attend its Center for Continuing Education (CCE). Founded in 1837 by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), Guilford's program offerings include such majors as Peace and Conflict Studies and Community and Justice Studies, both rooted in the college's history as a Quaker institution. History Guilford College is the only Quaker-founded college in the southeastern United States. Opening in 1837 as New Garden Boarding School, the institution became a four-year liberal arts college in 1888. Levi Coffin, a well-known abolitionist, Quaker, and political dissenter grew up on the land, which is now considered a historical site. The woods of New Garden, which still exist on campus today, were used as a meeting point for the Underground Railroad in the 19th century, run by Coffin. Athletics Guilford competes as an NCAA Division III as an Old Dominion Athletic Conference member. The school has won five national championships, including the NAIA men's basketball championship in 1973, the 1981 NAIA women's tennis title and the 1989 (NAIA), 2002 and 2005 (NCAA Division III) men's golf titles. Campus events Bryan Series. In the past decade, Guilford's Bryan Series has brought many notable speakers to the campus and city for an annual public lecture series. Past speakers have included Desmond Tutu, Mikhail Gorbachev, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Ken Burns, Mary Robinson, David McCullough, and Toni Morrison. The 2008‚Äì09 Bryan Series lecturers were Khaled Hosseini, Christiane Amanpour and James Rubin, Salman Rushdie, and Anna Quindlen. The 2009‚Äì10 lecturers were Garry Trudeau, Paul Krugman, Anna Deavere Smith, David Gregory, and Yo-Yo Ma. Eastern Music Festival (EMF). Every summer, the college hosts the five-week-long Eastern Music Festival (EMF), where both professional and student musicians come together for seminars and public performances. Each year, EMF features more than 70 concerts and music-related events on- and off- campus. Serendipity. The largest campus-wide event of the year is \\"Serendipity\\", held annually in the spring. It began in 1972 as a replacement to the somewhat antiquated May Day festivities, and has featured games, musical performances, and \\"general mayhem.\\" During its peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the weekend festival was attended by Guilford students and alumni, as well as thousands of students from other local institutions in the Triad area. Musical acts who have played this event include: Dave Matthews Band, Widespread Panic, Hootie and the Blowfish, Common, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, Luscious Jackson, The Violent Femmes, Man Man, The Village People and The Squirrel Nut Zippers. Despite the fact that Serendipity is considered by alum to be a hallmark of the Guilford experience, , its future remains uncertain. Following concerns expressed by the interim Dean of Students Jenn Agor about music festival culture, school officials have begun to discuss to possibility of discontinuing the tradition. This has led to a sizable student backlash. The dispute over Serendipity is indicative of the tensions between the very liberal student body and its more conservative administration. WTH?! Con This event has occurred annually since 2001. Major guests include a host of webcomic creators and wrock bands. The 2018 event attracted around 300 attendees.

It has been popular for retail since the 18th century as the home of many fashion outlets that sell prestigious or expensive items. The southern section is Old Bond Street and the longer northern section New Bond Street‚Äîa distinction not generally made in everyday usage. The street was built on fields surrounding Clarendon House on Piccadilly, which were developed by Sir Thomas Bond. It was built up in the 1720s, and by the end of the 18th century was a popular place for the upper- class residents of Mayfair to socialise. Prestigious or expensive shops were established along the street, but it declined as a centre of social activity in the 19th century, although it held its reputation as a fashionable place for retail, and is home to the auction houses Sotheby's and Bonhams (formerly Phillips) and the department store Fenwick and jeweller Tiffany's. It is one of the most expensive and sought after strips of real estate in Europe. Geography Bond Street is the only street that links Oxford Street and Piccadilly. Old Bond Street is at the southern end between Piccadilly and Burlington Gardens. The northern section, New Bond Street, extends to Oxford Street. The entire street is around long. Many shop frontages are less than wide. The nearest tube stations are Green Park in Piccadilly, and Bond Street station in Oxford Street. Bond Street station does not directly connect to either New or Old Bond Street. No buses use the street, although the C2 service crosses New Bond Street. Part of New Bond Street is numbered B406 but the remainder and all of Old Bond Street is unclassified. New Bond Street is pedestrianised between Grafton Street and Clifford Street to prevent through traffic and to stop the road being used as a rat run. History In High- Change in Bond Street (1796), James Gillray caricatured the lack of courtesy on Bond Street (young men taking up the whole footpath), which was a grand fashionable milieu at the time. There is evidence of Roman settlement around what is now Bond Street. In 1894, a culvert made from brick and stone was discovered in the area. The street was named after Sir Thomas Bond, the head of a syndicate of developers who purchased a Piccadilly mansion called Clarendon House from Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle in 1686, and proceeded to demolish the house and develop the area. At that time, the house backed onto open fields, known as Albemarle Ground, and the development of estates in Mayfair had just begun. New Bond Street was laid out during the second phase of construction 14 years after Bond's syndicate began developing the area. Most of the building along the street occurred in the 1720s, on what was the Conduit Mead Estate. John Rocque's map of London, published in 1746, shows properties along the entire length of Bond Street, including the fully constructed side streets. The two parts of the street have always had separate names, and a plan by the council to merge the two into a singular \\"Bond Street\\" in the 1920s was rejected by locals. During the 18th century, the street began to be popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair. Shop owners let out their upper storeys for residential purposes, attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift, George Selwyn, William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Sterne. In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycott Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox. This had caused him to lose his seat in parliament, leading to the dissolution of the Fox‚ÄìNorth Coalition. She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets, and encouraged people to go to Bond Street. Consequently, the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair. By the end of the century, an upper-class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared, wearing expensive wigs and parading up and down the street in a pretentious manner. Bond Street has always been divided into two sections: Old Bond Street to the south and New Bond Street to the north. The London branch of the jeweller Tiffany & Co. is next to the divide, on the Old Bond Street side. Lord Nelson stayed at temporary lodgings in New Bond Street between 1797 and 1798, and again from 1811 to 1813. Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford lived in Bond Street and was unhappy about the presence of the Bond Street Loungers. Already notorious for a violent and abusive temper, on 7 October 1801 he refused invitations to join in celebrations of peace between Britain and France (which led to the Treaty of Amiens), resulting in an altercation with several Loungers at his doorstep. Camelford retreated upstairs and fired upon the crowd with a pistol. During the 19th century, Bond Street became less known for its social atmosphere but increased its reputation as a street for luxury shopping. The auctioneer Phillips was established in 1796 at No. 101 Bond Street, specialising in stringed instruments and sheet music. The jewellers Asprey originally opened in 1830 at Nos. 165‚Äì169 New Bond Street. Opposite Asprey was the luxury luggage and trunk maker Finnigans, originally established in Manchester in 1830. The house of Finnigans opened their New Bond Street shop in 1879. The Jewish practice of Kabbalah has been associated with the street after former East End trader Sarah Levenson opened a shop on No. 50 New Bond Street in 1856 which immediately became profitable, albeit through exaggerated and questionable product claims. Levenson was twice taken to court and prosecuted for fraud; each prosecution resulted in a five-year prison sentence. She died midway through the second. Nevertheless, the practice regained popularity and a Kabbalah Centre remains on the street. The Royal Arcade links Old Bond Street with Albemarle Street. It was originally proposed in 1864 as a longer link between Old Bond Street and Regent Street, but this plan was rejected because of the scale of proposed demolition and reduced access to existing properties. It was subsequently redesigned in its current layout, opening in 1879 and replacing the Clarendon Hotel, which had been demolished in 1870. The Grosvenor Gallery opened on New Bond Street in 1877 by Sir Coutts Lindsay. It cost over ¬£100,000 to build and included a restaurant and library downstairs, and two exhibition rooms upstairs. A negative review by John Ruskin of exhibits by James McNeill Whistler led to Whistler suing Ruskin for libel, winning a farthing in compensation. This case was satirised in Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience, with the line, \\"greenery- yallery, Grosvenor Gallery\\". The street has maintained its reputation for luxury shopping into the 21st century, and has on occasion been regarded as the best retail location in Europe. In 2011, Bloomberg News reported that New Bond Street was the most expensive retail street in Europe after the Champs- √âlys√©es in Paris. As a consequence, though, the street has many times suffered from armed robbery, as robbers are attracted by the high value of the goods. The Graff Diamonds robbery in Bond Street in 2009 resulted in an estimated loss of ¬£40 million. Properties The Royal Arcade on Old Bond Street. According to Westminster City Council, Bond Street has the highest density of haute couture stores anywhere in the world, attracting \\"the rich, the famous, and the simply curious\\". The entire length of Bond Street has been part of the Mayfair Conservation Area controlled by Westminster City Council since 1969. Building alterations and constructions are tightly controlled to ensure the street's appearance and upkeep are unaltered. Many buildings are listed. The council regulates the style and materials used on shop front advertising. At one time, Bond Street was best known for top-end art dealers and antique shops that were clustered around the London office of Sotheby's auction house, which has been at Nos. 34‚Äì35 Bond Street since 1917, and the Fine Art Society, founded in 1876. The sculpture over the entrance to Sotheby's is from Ancient Egypt and is believed to date from around 1600 BC. It is the oldest outdoor sculpture in London. Some dealers and antique shops remain, but others are fashion boutiques or branches of global designer brands. The street still has a reputation as a fashionable place for shopping, including the flagship stores of Ralph Lauren and Cartier. Fenwick have had a department store on Bond Street since 1891. The Phillips building at No. 101 is still used for auctions; the company was bought in 2001 by Bonhams, who spent ¬£30 million expanding and refurbishing the premises. In 2015, Valentino announced plans to build a new flagship store on Old Bond Street. The Allies sculpture on Bond Street portrays Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The street features Allies, a statue of Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who are portrayed sitting in conversation on a park bench, sculpted by Lawrence Holofcener. The statue, popular with tourists, was erected by the Bond Street Association to commemorate 50 years since the end of World War II, and was unveiled in May 1995 by Princess Margaret. In 2013, maquettes of the sculpture (which are replicas, as Holofcener did not make any as part of the original artwork or design) were sold at Bonhams. Henry Moore has four sculptures engraved into the building work of no.153 (a Loro Piana branch), which he subsequently attempted to buy back when he felt no one noticed them. The construction of Crossrail, part of which runs between Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road stations, involved demolition of property in nearby Hanover Square, some of which backs onto New Bond Street. This affected Nos. 64‚Äì72, which required refurbishment. Cultural references Bond Street has been mentioned in several works of literature, including Jane Austen's novel Sense and Sensibility and Virginia Woolf's 1925 novel Mrs Dalloway. The plot of the 1948 film Bond Street is based on items purchased from shops in the street. In Suzanna Clarke's novel Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, Bond Street is described as having \\"the most fashionable shops in all the kingdom\\". Bond Street is also a square on the British Monopoly board and is the most expensive of the green-coloured set that also includes Regent and Oxford Streets. The three streets are grouped together because of their shared retail history. References Citations Sources     Further reading *London's Mansions by David Pearce (1986). . (Development details.)

Zimbardo has said these experiences early in life triggered his curiosity about people's behavior, and later influenced his research in school. He completed his B.A. with a triple major in psychology, sociology, and anthropology from Brooklyn College in 1954, where he graduated summa cum laude. He completed his M.S. (1955) and Ph.D. (1959) in psychology from Yale University, where Neal E. Miller was his advisor. He taught at Yale from 1959 to 1960. From 1960 to 1967, he was a professor of psychology at New York University College of Arts & Science. From 1967 to 1968, he taught at Columbia University. He joined the faculty at Stanford University in 1968. Stanford prison study=Background In 1971, Zimbardo accepted a tenured position as professor of psychology at Stanford University. With a government grant from the U.S. Office of Naval Research, he conducted the Stanford prison study in which male college students were selected (from an applicant pool of 75). After a mental health screening, the remaining men were randomly assigned to be \\"prisoners\\" or \\"guards\\" in a mock prison located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford. Prisoners were confined to a 6' x 9' cell with black steel-barred doors. The only furniture in each cell was a cot. Solitary confinement was a small unlit closet. Zimbardo's goal for the Stanford Prison study was to assess the psychological effect on a (randomly assigned) student of becoming a prisoner or prison guard. A 1997 article from the Stanford News Service described the experiment's goals in more detail: > Zimbardo's primary reason for conducting the experiment was to focus on the > power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity and situational validation of > behavior that generally would repulse ordinary individuals. \\"I had been > conducting research for some years on deindividuation, vandalism and > dehumanization that illustrated the ease with which ordinary people could be > led to engage in anti-social acts by putting them in situations where they > felt anonymous, or they could perceive of others in ways that made them less > than human, as enemies or objects,\\" Zimbardo told the Toronto symposium in > the summer of 1996. Experiment Zimbardo himself took part in the study, playing the role of \\"prison superintendent\\" who could mediate disputes between guards and prisoners. He instructed guards to find ways to dominate the prisoners, not with physical violence, but with other tactics, verging on torture, such as sleep deprivation and punishment with solitary confinement. Later in the experiment, as some guards became more aggressive, taking away prisoners' cots (so that they had to sleep on the floor), and forcing them to use buckets kept in their cells as toilets, and then refusing permission to empty the buckets, neither the other guards nor Zimbardo himself intervened. Knowing that their actions were observed but not rebuked, guards considered that they had implicit approval for such actions. In later interviews, several guards told interviewers that they knew what Zimbardo wanted to have happen, and they did their best to make that happen. Less than two full days into the study, one inmate began suffering from depression, uncontrolled rage, crying and other mental dysfunctions. The prisoner was eventually released after screaming and acting in an unstable manner in front of the other inmates. This prisoner was replaced with one of the alternates. Results By the end of the study, the guards had won complete control over all of their prisoners and were using their authority to its greatest extent. One prisoner had even gone as far as to go on a hunger strike. When he refused to eat, the guards put him into solitary confinement for three hours (even though their own rules stated the limit that a prisoner could be in solitary confinement was only one hour). Instead of the other prisoners looking at this inmate as a hero and following along in his strike, they chanted together that he was a bad prisoner and a troublemaker. Prisoners and guards had rapidly adapted to their roles, stepping beyond the boundaries of what had been predicted and leading to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. Zimbardo himself started to give in to the roles of the situation. He had to be shown the reality of the study by Christina Maslach, his girlfriend and future wife, who had just received her doctorate in psychology. Zimbardo reflects that the message from the study is that \\"situations can have a more powerful influence over our behaviour than most people appreciate, and few people recognize [that].\\" At the end of the study, after all the prisoners had been released and the guards let go, everyone was brought back into the same room for evaluation and to be able to get their feelings out in the open towards one another. Ethical concerns surrounding the study often draw comparisons to the Milgram experiment, which was conducted in 1961 at Yale University by Stanley Milgram, Zimbardo's former high school friend. More recently, Thibault Le Texier of the University of Nice has examined the archives of the experiment, including videos, recordings, and Zimbardo's handwritten notes, and argued that \\"The guards knew what results the experiment was supposed to produce ... Far from reacting spontaneously to this pathogenic social environment, the guards were given clear instructions for how to create it ... The experimenters intervened directly in the experiment, either to give precise instructions, to recall the purposes of the experiment, or to set a general direction ...In order to get their full participation, Zimbardo intended to make the guards believe that they were his research assistants.\\".Thibault Le Texier, \\"Debunking the Stanford Prison Experiment.\\" American Psychologist, Vol 74(7), Oct 2019, 823-839dx.doi.org/10.1037/amp0000401 Since his original publication in French,Le Texier, T. (2018). Histoire d‚Äôun mensonge: Enqu√™te sur l‚Äôexp√©rience de Stanford [History of a Lie: An Inquiry Into the Stanford Prison Experiment]. Paris, France: La D√©couverte Le Texier's accusations have been taken up by science communicators in the United States.Dr. Ben Blum, \\"The Lifespan of a Lie\\", Medium, 7 June 2018 https://gen.medium.com/the-lifespan- of-a-lie-d869212b1f62 Prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib Prison Zimbardo reflects on the dramatic visual similarities between the behaviour of the participants in the Stanford prison experiment, and the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. He did not accept the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Myers' claim that the events were due to a few rogue soldiers and that it did not reflect on the military. Instead he looked at the situation the soldiers were in and considered the possibility that this situation might have induced the behavior that they displayed. He began with the assumption that were probably \\"good apples\\" in a situation like that of the Stanford prison study, where he knew that physically and psychologically normal and healthy people were behaving sadistically and brutalising prisoners. Zimbardo became absorbed in trying to understand who these people were, asking the question \\"are they inexplicable, can we not understand them\\". This led him to write the book The Lucifer Effect. The Lucifer Effect The Lucifer Effect was written in response to his findings in the Stanford Prison Experiment. Zimbardo believes that personality characteristics could play a role in how violent or submissive actions are manifested. In the book, Zimbardo says that humans cannot be defined as good or evil because we have the ability to act as both especially at the hand of the situation. Examples include the events that occurred at the Abu Ghraib Detention Center, in which the defense team‚Äîincluding Gary Myers‚Äîargued that it was not the prison guards and interrogators that were at fault for the physical and mental abuse of detainees but the Bush administration policies themselves. According to Zimbardo, \\"Good people can be induced, seduced, and initiated into behaving in evil ways. They can also be led to act in irrational, stupid, self- destructive, antisocial, and mindless ways when they are immersed in 'total situations' that impact human nature in ways that challenge our sense of the stability and consistency of individual personality, of character, and of morality.\\"(Zimbardo, The Lucifer Effect, p. 211) In The Journal of the American Medical Association, There are seven social processes that grease \\"the slippery slope of evil\\":The psychology of evil  * Mindlessly taking the first small step * Dehumanization of others * De-individuation of self (anonymity) * Diffusion of personal responsibility * Blind obedience to authority * Uncritical conformity to group norms * Passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference Time In 2008, Zimbardo published his work with John Boyd about the Time Perspective Theory and the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI) in The Time Paradox: The New Psychology of Time That Will Change Your Life. In 2009, he met Richard Sword and started collaborating to turn the Time Perspective Theory into a clinical therapy, beginning a four-year long pilot study and establishing time perspective therapy. In 2009, Zimbardo did his Ted Talk \\"The Psychology of Time\\" about the Time Perspective Theory. According to this Ted Talk, there are six kinds of different Time Perspectives which are Past Positive TP (Time Perspective), Past Negative TP, Present Hedonism TP, Present Fatalism TP, Future Life Goal- Oriented TP and Future Transcendental TP. In 2012, Zimbardo, Richard Sword, and his wife Rosemary authored a book called The Time Cure. Time Perspective therapy bears similarities to Pause Button Therapy, developed by psychotherapist Martin Shirran, whom Zimbardo corresponded with and met at the first International Time Perspective Conference at the University of Coimbra, Portugal. Zimbardo wrote the foreword to the second edition of Shirran's book on the subject. Heroic Imagination Project As of 2014 Zimbardo is heading a movement for everyday heroism as the founder and director of the Heroic Imagination Project (HIP), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting heroism in everyday life. The project is currently collecting data from former American gang members and individuals with former ties to terrorism for comparison, in an attempt to better understand how individuals change violent behavior. This research portion of the project is co-headed by Rony Berger, Yotam Heineburg, and Leonard Beckum. He published an article contrasting heroism and altruism in 2011 with Zeno Franco and Kathy Blau in the Review of General Psychology.Franco, Z., Blau, K. & Zimbardo, P. (2011). Heroism: A conceptual analysis and differentiation between heroic action and altruism. Review of General Psychology, 5(2), 99-113. Social intensity syndrome (SIS) In 2008, Zimbardo began working with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social intensity syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and validity tests demonstrated that SIS was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization. Other endeavors Zimbardo in Berlin, Germany in 2008 After the prison experiment, Zimbardo decided to look for ways he could use psychology to help people; this led to the founding of The Shyness Clinic in Menlo Park, California, which treats shy behavior in adults and children. Zimbardo's research on shyness resulted in several bestselling books on the topic. Other subjects he has researched include mind control and cultic behavior.What messages are behind today's cults? , APA Monitor, May 1997 Zimbardo is the co-author of an introductory Psychology textbook entitled Psychology and Life, which is used in many American undergraduate psychology courses. He also hosted a PBS TV series titled Discovering Psychology which is used in many college telecourses. In 2004, Zimbardo testified for the defense in the court martial of Sgt. Ivan \\"Chip\\" Frederick, a guard at Abu Ghraib prison. He argued that Frederick's sentence should be lessened due to mitigating circumstances, explaining that few individuals can resist the powerful situational pressures of a prison, particularly without proper training and supervision. The judge apparently disregarded Zimbardo's testimony, and gave Frederick the maximum 8-year sentence. Zimbardo drew on the knowledge he gained from his participation in the Frederick case to write a new book entitled The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil, about the connections between Abu Ghraib and the prison experiments. Zimbardo's writing appeared in Greater Good Magazine, published by the Greater Good Science Center of the University of California, Berkeley. Zimbardo's contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships. His most recent article with Greater Good magazine is entitled: \\"The Banality of Heroism\\",Franco, Z. & Zimbardo, P. (2006-2007) The banality of heroism . Greater Good, 3 (2), 30-35 which examines how ordinary people can become everyday heroes. In February 2010, Zimbardo was a guest presenter at the Science of a Meaningful Life seminar: Goodness, Evil, and Everyday Heroism, along with Greater Good Science Center Executive Director Dacher Keltner. Zimbardo, who officially retired in 2003, gave his final \\"Exploring Human Nature\\" lecture on March 7, 2007, on the Stanford campus, bringing his teaching career of 50 years to a close. David Spiegel, professor of psychiatry at the Stanford University School of Medicine, called Zimbardo \\"a legendary teacher\\", saying that \\"he has changed the way we think about social influences.\\" Zimbardo has made appearances on American TV, such as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on March 29, 2007, The Colbert Report on February 11, 2008 and Dr. Phil on October 25, 2010. Zimbardo serves as advisor to the anti- bullying organization Bystander Revolution and appears in the organization's videos to explain the bystander effect and discuss the evil of inaction. Zimbardo speaking in Poland, 2009 Since 2003, Zimbardo has been active in charitable and economic work in rural Sicily through the Zimbardo-Luczo Fund with Steve Luczo and the local director , which provides scholarships for academically gifted students from Corleone and Cammarata. In 2015, Zimbardo co-authored a book \\"Man (Dis)connected: How Technology Has Sabotaged What It Means To Be Male\\", which collected research to support a thesis that males are increasingly disconnected from society. He argues that a lack of two-parent households and female-oriented schooling have made it more attractive to live virtually, risking video game addiction or pornography addiction. Recognition In 2012, Zimbardo received the American Psychological Foundation Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement in the Science of Psychology. In 2011, he received an honorary doctorate degree from SWPS University in Warsaw. In 2003, Zimbardo and University of Rome La Sapienza scholars Gian Vittorio Caprara, and Claudio Barbaranelli were awarded the sarcastic Ig Nobel Award for Psychology for their report \\"Politicians' Uniquely Simple Personalities\\".

He was a member of a prominent family, and was born and grew up in present-day Georgia. His Cherokee name reportedly means either 'male deer' or 'turkey.' Access Genealogy, \\"Cherokee Indian Chiefs.\\"Retrieved February 27, 2013 Born to parents of mixed Cherokee and European ancestry and educated at a missionary school in Connecticut, Boudinot became one of several leaders who believed that acculturation was critical to Cherokee survival; he was influential in the period of removal to Indian Territory. In 1826, Boudinot had married Harriet R. Gold, the daughter of a prominent New England family in Cornwall, Connecticut. He met her while a student at the Foreign Mission School in town. Following his cousin John Ridge's marriage to a local woman there in 1825, Boudinot's marriage was controversial and opposed by many townspeople. The Cherokee National Council had passed a law in 1825 enabling the descendants of Cherokee fathers and white mothers to be full citizens of the Cherokee. (Formerly they had no official place in the matrilineal tribe, as children belong to their mother's clan and people.) The Boudinots returned to Georgia to live at New Echota. They reared their six children as Cherokee. Boudinot believed that removal was inevitable. He and other treaty supporters signed the Treaty of New Echota in 1835, but it was not signed by John Ross, the Principal Chief, and was opposed by most of the tribe. The following year, the tribe was forced to cede most of its lands in the Southeast, and remove to west of the Mississippi River. After Harriet died in 1836, Boudinot moved with his children to Indian Territory. He and three other Treaty Party leaders were assassinated in June 1839 by members of the Ross faction, known as the National Party. The orphaned children were sent to his parents-in-law in Connecticut and went to school there. Boudinot's son Elias Cornelius Boudinot was educated there and then returned west, settling in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He became an attorney and active in tribal and Democratic Party politics, and would eventually come to represent the Cherokee Nation in the Confederate Congress as a non-voting delegate. Early life and education Gallegina was born in 1802 into a leading Cherokee family in present-day Georgia, the eldest son of nine children of Uwati and Susanna Reese, who was of mixed Cherokee and European ancestry. When Uwati converted to Christianity, Boudinot took the name of David Uwatie (later he dropped the \\"u\\" from his name.) Gallegina's younger brothers were Isaac, better known as Stand Watie, who served with the Confederate Army during the American Civil War and served as Principal Chief (1862-1866); and Thomas Watie. They were the nephews of Major Ridge and cousins of John Ridge. Gallegina Watie, the Ridges, John Ross, and Charles R. Hicks and his son Elijah Hicks, came to form the ruling elite of the Cherokee Nation in the early nineteenth century. All were of mixed race and had some European-American education; the tribal chiefs wanted to prepare the young men to deal with the United States and its representatives. Gallegina's Christian education began in 1808, at the age of 6, when Boudinot studied at the local Moravian missionary school. In 1812, he joined the Spring Place school, in what is now Murray County. Around this time, Cherokee leaders were petitioning the government for aid to educate their children, as they wanted to adopt aspects of white civilization.Parins, p. 3 Elias Cornelius, an agent from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), came to the community and served as a benefactor for education. In 1817, the ABCFM opened the Foreign Mission School in Cornwall, Connecticut for educating promising students from American Indian cultures. In 1818, Cornelius selected Gallegina Watie and a few others to go to the Foreign Mission School. On the way, they were introduced to the Virginia statesmen Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe. In Burlington, New Jersey, the young men met an Elias Boudinot who was president of the American Bible Society and a former member and president of the Second Continental Congress. He and Watie impressed each other, and Watie asked Boudinot for permission to use his name, which he gave. When enrolled at the Foreign Mission School, Watie started using the name Elias Boudinot, which he kept for the rest of his life. In 1820, Boudinot officially converted to Christianity, attracted to its message of universal love. His Christian belief informed his work with the Cherokee Nation. In 1824, Boudinot collaborated with others in translating the New Testament into Cherokee and having it printed in the syllabary created by Sequoyah. Marriage and family While studying in Connecticut, Boudinot met Harriet Ruggles Gold, the daughter of a prominent local family who supported the Foreign Mission School. Her family often invited Boudinot and other Native American students to their home. After Boudinot returned to Cherokee Nation because of illness, he courted Harriet by letter. His cousin John Ridge also attended the school and in 1824 married a local young woman. This caused considerable controversy in Cornwall, as many townspeople opposed the marriage. After the Ridges' return to New Echota to live, in 1825 the National Council passed a law providing full Cherokee citizenship to children of a Cherokee father and white mother.Yarbough, Fay. \\"Legislating Women‚Äôs Sexuality: Cherokee Marriage Laws,\\" Journal of Social History 38 (2004), p. 388 In the Cherokee matrilineal kinship culture, children traditionally belonged to the mother's clan and took their status from her people. The Cherokee had long absorbed the mixed-race children of Cherokee mothers and white fathers (usually fur traders). But, the children of Ridge and Boudinot would have had no place in the Cherokee society without the Council's new law. The historian Theresa Strouth Gaul wrote that the law was inspired by Ridge's marriage and Boudinot's engagement; as the young men were elite Cherokee, it protected the status of their future children.Gaul, p. 16 When Boudinot and Gold first announced their engagement, it was opposed by her family and the Congregational Church. There were also local protests. Gold persisted and finally gained her parents' permission. The couple were married on 28 March 1826 at her home.Parins, p. 5‚Äì6 The local hostility to the marriage, the second between a Cherokee man and a white woman, forced the closing of the Foreign Mission School.Langguth, p. 58. The Boudinots returned to New Echota to live. They had six surviving children: Eleanor Susan; Mary Harriett; William Penn (named after the founder of Pennsylvania, who was considered a friend to American Indians); Sarah Parkhill, Elias Cornelius (1 August 1835 ‚Äî 27 September 1890); and Franklin Brinsmade Boudinot. Five of the children later married and had families of their own.Gaul, Theresa Strouth 146 Harriet Boudinot died in August 1836, likely of complications from childbirth; she died some months after her seventh child was stillborn.Gabriel, Ralph Henry. Elias Boudinot Cherokee and His America. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1941, p. 158 Career as editor After his return to New Echota, in 1828 Boudinot was selected by the General Council of the Cherokee as editor for a newspaper, the first to be published by a Native American nation. He worked with a new friend Samuel Worcester, a missionary and printer. Worcester had new type created and cast for the new forms of the Cherokee syllabary. In 1828, the two printed the Cherokee Phoenix in Cherokee and English. While planned as a bi-lingual newspaper, the Phoenix published most of its articles in English; under Boudinot, about 16 percent of the content was published in Cherokee. The journalist Ann Lackey Landini believes that Boudinot emphasized English in the newspaper because the Cherokee Nation intended it to be a means to explain their people to European Americans and prove they had an admirable civilization.Landini, Ann Lackey; The Cherokee Phoenix: The Voice of the Cherokee Nation, 1828‚Äì1834, PhD dissertation; The University of Tennessee; Knoxville, TN; 1990 At the same time, the Council intended it to unite the Cherokee through the Southeast. The Phoenix regularly published new laws and other national Cherokee political information in the paper. Between 1828 and 1832, Boudinot wrote numerous editorials arguing against removal, as proposed by Georgia and supported by President Andrew Jackson. After Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, federal pressure on the Cherokee increased. Jackson supported removal of the Cherokee and other Southeastern peoples from their eastern homelands to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi in order to make land available for European-American development. Over a roughly four- year period, Boudinot's editorials emphasized that Georgia's disregard of the Constitution and past federal treaties with the Cherokee would not only hurt Cherokee progress in acculturating, but threatened the fabric of the Union. Boudinot's articles recounted the elements of Cherokee assimilation (conversion to Christianity, an increasingly Western-educated population, and a turn toward lives as herdsmen and farmers, etc.) He criticized the \\"easy\\" way in which treaty language was distorted by Indian Removal advocates for their own purposes.\\"Selections from the 'Cherokee Phoenix' ‚Äì The Cherokee Editor\\"; Perdue, Theda, editor; The Writings of Elias Boudinot,; The University of Tennessee Press; Knoxville, TN; 1983; pp. 87- 53. In 1832, while on a speaking tour of the North to raise funds for the Phoenix, Boudinot learned that, in Worcester v. Georgia, the US Supreme Court had sustained the Cherokee rights to political and territorial sovereignty within Georgia's borders. He soon learned that President Jackson still supported Indian Removal. In this context, Boudinot began advocating for his people to secure the best possible terms with the US by making a binding treaty of removal, as he believed it was inevitable. His changed position was widely opposed by the Cherokee. The National Council and John Ross, the Principal Chief, opposed removal, as did the majority of the people. Former allies in the Cherokee government turned against Boudinot and other \\"treaty advocates,\\" who included John Ridge and Major Ridge. Opponents attacked the men's loyalty and prevented their speaking in councils. Ross denounced Boudinot's \\"toleration of diversified views in the Cherokee Phoenix and forbade Boudinot from discussing pro-removal arguments in the paper. In protest, Boudinot resigned in the spring of 1832.Wilkins, Thurman. Cherokee Tragedy: The Story of the Ridge Family and the Decimation of a People, pp. 235‚Äì237, 242‚Äì244. London: The Macmillan Company, 1970. Ross' brother-in-law, Elijah Hicks, replaced Boudinot as editor.Langguth, p. 197 In 1959, he was inducted into the Georgia Newspaper Hall of Fame in recognition of his newspaper work. Literary works=Cherokee Phoenix The first newspaper published by a Native American tribe gave a \\"voice to the American insiders\\" who had been forced to become \\"outsiders\\".Parins, p. 9 The premier edition of the newspaper was called the Tsalagi Tsu-le-hi-sa-nu-hi; it was printed on 21 February 1828. The Cherokee Phoenix office regularly received correspondence from about 100 other newspapers, published far and wide, because it was so respected throughout the United States and Europe. In 1829, the second edition of the Cherokee Phoenix was named the Cherokee Phoenix and Indians‚Äô Advocate, indicating Boudinot's ambition to influence people outside the tribe. Boudinot regularly wrote editorials related to Indian Removal. \\"An Address to the Whites\\" (1826) Boudinot delivered this speech in the First Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia on May 26, 1826. He described the similarities between the Cherokee and the whites, and ways in which the Cherokee were adopting aspects of white culture. Boudinot was fundraising for a Cherokee national academy and printing equipment for the newspaper, support for \\"civilizing\\" the Cherokee. Following the speech, he published his speech in a pamphlet by the same title. \\"An Address to the Whites\\" was well received and \\"proved to be remarkably effective at fund-raising\\".Pulley, Angela F. \\"Elias Boudinot\\", The New Georgia Encyclopedia online Influence on Indian Removal The Indian removal policy was a result of the discovery of gold in Cherokee territory, the growth of the cotton industry, and the relentless European-American desire for land in the Southeast. European Americans resented Cherokee control of their lands, and conflicts increasingly arose. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 called for all Indian peoples living east of the Mississippi River to be removed and sent west beyond the river. While the majority of the Cherokee led by Chief John Ross opposed the act, Boudinot began to believe that Indian Removal was inevitable. He thought the best outcome was for the Cherokee to secure their rights through treaty, before they were moved against their will. Boudinot used all of his writing and oratory skills to influence Indian Removal policy, but many within the nation opposed his viewpoint. He criticized the popular principal chief John Ross, who opposed his ideas. Ross had ordered Boudinot to stop publishing his views favoring removal in the newspaper. In 1832, Boudinot resigned as editor of the Cherokee Phoenix, giving his reasons his inadequate salary, personal health problems, and the inability of the Cherokee Nation to provide sufficient supplies to run a national newspaper. However, in a letter to John Ross, he indicated that he could no longer serve because he was unable to print what he believed to be true about the dangers to the people from continuing to oppose removal. Ross and the council accepted the resignation and appointed Elijah Hicks to run the newspaper. Although Hicks was a good businessman he had no newspaper experience. The Cherokee Phoenix soon declined and ceased publication on 31 May 1834.Woodward, p. 172. Removal to Indian Territory Boudinot and Treaty Party leaders signed the Treaty of New Echota (1835) in New Echota, Cherokee Nation (now Calhoun, Georgia) ceding all Cherokee land east of the Mississippi River. Although this was opposed by the majority of the delegation and lacked the signature of the Principal Chief John Ross, the US Senate ratified the treaty. Afterward, faced with open enmity among the Cherokee, many of the signatories and their families migrated to Indian Territory, where they located with the \\"Old Settlers\\", who had gone there in the 1820s. During 1838 and 1839, the US Army enforced the Removal Act and evicted the Cherokee and their slaves from their homes in the Southeast. They forced most of them west into Indian Territory (in eastern present-day Oklahoma). The Cherokee referred to their journey as the Trail of Tears. After his wife's death in 1836, Boudinot needed to relocate both himself and the children. He sent their son, Cornelius, to live with a family in Huntsville, Alabama, where he could be treated for his condition by a doctor. Another son traveled west with the Ridge family. The rest of the children were enrolled in school at Brainerd, where they could stay when Elias left the territory. Elias himself first went north to visit Harriet's parents. After that, he joined a group that included John Ridge and traveled to the Western Cherokee Nation, it was established by \\"Old Settlers\\" in the northeast quarter of what is today Oklahoma. Two months later he wrote to Harriet's parents that he had married Delight Sargent, a New England woman who had been a teacher at New Echota.Langguth, p. 259. Impoverished, he received $500 from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (thanks to persuasive argument from Samuel Worcester) to build a modest house a quarter mile from the Worcesters in Park Hill.Langguth, p. 266 Reunited with his longtime friend, Boudinot returned to his vocation as a translator of the Gospel. The \\"Old Settlers\\" and John Ross' supporters failed agree on unification following the Nation's removal to Indian Territory. Some Ross supporters met secretly to plan assassinations of Treaty Party leaders over the hardships of the Removal and to eliminate them as political rivals in a way which would intimidate the Old Settlers into submission.Wilkins, Thurman. Cherokee Tragedy: The Story of the Ridge Family and the Decimation of a People, pp. 229-339. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1986. On June 22, 1839, a group of unknown Cherokee assassinated Boudinot outside his home. They killed his cousin and uncle, John and Major Ridge, the same day. His brother Stand Watie was attacked but survived.Peyer, Bernd C. \\"Elias Boudinot and the Cherokee Betrayal,\\" in The Tutor‚Äôd Mind: Indian Missionary-Writers In Antebellum America, Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1997, pp. 212‚Äì213 Though Ross denied any connection to the killings, Stand Watie blamed the Principal Chief. After these murders followers of Watie and Ross engaged for years in violent conflict and retaliation. Stand Watie killed a man whom he had seen attack his uncle Major Ridge; Watie was acquitted on the grounds of self- defense. At his trial, he was represented by his nephew, Elias Cornelius Boudinot. He had become a lawyer in Arkansas after having been raised by his mother's family and educated in the East following his father's assassination. The violence lasted into 1846, when the US negotiated a tenuous peace treaty. The deep bitterness contributed to tribal divisions during the American Civil War. The post-removal factionalism and violence compounded the misfortune of the Cherokee Nation.Franks, Kenny A. Stand Watie and the Agony of the Cherokee Nation, Memphis, Tennessee: Memphis State University Press, 1979, pp. 56, 103 During the Civil War, the Nation split into two factions. Stand Watie and his supporters, the majority of the Nation, sided with the Confederacy (he served as an officer in their army, along with other Cherokee.) Ross and his supporters sided with the Union. Many Union people had to leave Indian Territory during the war for their own safety. They returned after the Union victory, and Ross was the only chief recognized by the US.Franks (1979), Stand Watie, pp. 115‚Äì193 See also *Timeline of Cherokee removal *Treaty of New Echota NotesSources *Boudinot, Elias; Essay: \\"An Address to the Whites\\", National Humanities Center. *The Cherokee Phoenix, 1828‚Äìpresent, Official Website *Carter, Samuel; Cherokee Sunset; Doubleday; Garden City, N.Y; 1976. *Dale, Edwards Everett; Cherokee Cavaliers ‚Äì Forty Years of Cherokee History as Told in the Correspondences of the Ridge-Watie-Boudinot Family; University of Oklahoma Press; Norman, OK; 1939. *Garrison, Tim Alan. \\"Cherokee Removal‚Äù, The New Georgia Encyclopedia. *Gaul, Theresa Strouth; \\"Elias Boudinot; and Harriett Gold Boudinot; Introduction\\", To Marry an Indian: The Marriage of Harriett Gold and Elias Boudinot in Letters, 1823‚Äì1839; University of North Carolina Press; Chapel Hill, NC; 2005; pp 1‚Äì76. *Hutton, Frankie, and Barbara Straus Reed; Outsiders in 19th-Century Press History: Multicultural Perspectives; Bowling Green State University Popular Press; Bowling Green, OH; 1995. *Langguth, A.

Chosen as a delegate to the Arkansas secession convention, Boudinot served as a colonel in the Confederate States Army, and as the non-voting Delegate from the Cherokee Nation to the Confederate Congress. He was the mixed-race son of Elias Boudinot (Cherokee) and Harriet R. Gold Boudinot, who was from Connecticut. His father was editor of the Cherokee Phoenix, the first Native American newspaper, which was published in Cherokee and English. In 1839 his father and three other leaders were assassinated by opponents in the tribe as retaliation for having ceded their homeland in the 1835 Treaty of New Echota. The Boudinot children were orphaned by their father's murder, as their mother had died in 1836. They were sent for their safety to their mother's family in Connecticut, where they were educated. Following the Civil War, Boudinot participated in negotiations of the Southern Cherokee with the United States (US) before the tribe was reunited; he was part of the Cherokee delegation to the US. In 1868 he and his uncle Stand Watie opened a tobacco factory, to take advantage of provisions under the nation's new 1866 treaty with the United States. It was confiscated for non-payment of taxes, and their case went to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled against them. Boudinot began to lobby for Native Americans to be granted United States citizenship in order to be protected by the Constitution. He was active in politics and society in Indian Territory and Washington, DC, supporting construction of railroads in the territory. Boudinot also worked for two Arkansas politicians. He supported proposals for termination of Cherokee sovereignty and the allotment of communal land to tribal members, as was passed under the Dawes Act. As this would extinguish tribal land rights, Boudinot also worked to establish the state of Oklahoma and have it admitted to the Union. In his 2011 history of America's transcontinental railroads, historian Richard White writes of Boudinot: \\"[He] became a willing tool of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad.... If the competition were not so stiff, Boudinot might be ranked among the great scoundrels of the Gilded Age.\\" Early life and education Born August 1, 1835 near Rome, Georgia, Boudinot was the son of Elias Boudinot, a Cherokee National leader, and his wife Harriet Ruggles (n√©e Gold) (1805‚Äì1836), a young woman of English-American descent from a prominent family in Cornwall, Connecticut. They had met there when his father was a student at a local school for Native Americans. The senior Elias Boudinot became editor of the Cherokee Phoenix from 1828-1832; it was the first newspaper founded by a Native American nation and published in their language. He published articles in English and Cherokee, and had type cast for the syllabary created by Sequoyah. The newspaper was distributed across the United States and internationally. His parents named this son Elias Cornelius Boudinot, after the missionary Elias Cornelius, who had selected his father to attend the Foreign Mission School in Connecticut. Elias was the fifth of six children. The year the boy was born, his father and other leaders had signed the Treaty of New Echota, ceding the remainder of Cherokee lands in the Southeast in exchange for removal to Indian Territory and lands west of the Mississippi River. Boudinot's mother Harriet died in 1836, several months after her seventh child was stillborn. The family moved to Indian Territory prior to the forced removal of 1838. In 1839, when Boudinot was four years old, his father and other Treaty Party leaders were assassinated by Cherokee opponents for having given up the communal tribal lands, which was considered a capital offense. His uncle Stand Watie survived an attack the same day. For their safety, Boudinot and his siblings were sent back to Connecticut to their mother's family. The Golds ensured the children received good educations. As a youth, Boudinot studied engineering in Manchester, Vermont. Career In 1851 at age eighteen, Boudinot returned West and taught school briefly. In 1853 he settled in Fayetteville, Arkansas near the Cherokee, and renewed contact with his uncle Stand Watie. He studied as a legal apprentice and passed the bar in 1856 in Arkansas. His first notable victory as a lawyer was defending his uncle Stand Watie against murder charges. Watie had killed James Foreman, one of the attackers of Major Ridge, Watie's uncle. Major Ridge, his son John Ridge and Boudinot's father had all been assassinated in 1839. Watie had survived the attack. Boudinot wanted to revive his family's prominence among the Cherokee. In Arkansas, Boudinot became active as a pro-slavery advocate in the Democratic Party; this was the majority position of party members. He was elected to the city council of Fayetteville in 1859. That year, together with James Pettigrew, he founded a pro-slavery newspaper, The Arkansan. It also favored the construction of railroads into Indian Territory, which was seen as integral to development. Many American Indians did not want their territory broken up by such intrusions. Boudinot urged the territory to regularize its status with the United States, and later supported measures needed to admit Oklahoma as a state.John Reyhner, Review: Elias Cornelius Boudinot: A Life on the Cherokee Border, Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Vol. 111, No. 1, July 2007, accessed 7 August 2012 The following year Boudinot was chosen as the chairman of the Arkansas Democratic State Central Committee and monitored rising tensions in the country. In 1861, he served as secretary of the Secession Convention as the Arkansas Territory determined whether it would leave the Union. In 1863, Boudinot was elected a delegate to the Congress of the Confederate States, representing the majority faction of the Cherokee who supported the Confederacy. (A minority supported the Union.) During the American Civil War, Boudinot fought for the Confederate States Army under his uncle Stand Watie. Commissioned as an officer, Boudinot reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. After the war, Boudinot was chairman of the Cherokee Delegation (south) to the Southern Treaty Commission, which had to renegotiate their treaties postwar with the United States. They were forced to cede territory, emancipate their slaves, and to offer full citizenship to Cherokee Freedmen who chose to stay with the nation, in a pattern similar to that which the US required of the Southern Confederate states. Marriage and family Boudinot did not marry until 1885, when he was 50. He married Clara Minear; they had no children. After their marriage, they moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, and lived there for the rest of their years. Postwar years Following the war, Boudinot and his uncle Stand Watie started a tobacco factory. They intended to take advantage of tax immunities in the 1866 Cherokee treaty with the United States. As the majority of Cherokee had supported the Confederacy, the US required them to make a new peace treaty. Disagreeing that the 1866 treaty provided immunity for such operations as the tobacco factory, US officials seized the factory for nonpayment of taxes. In 1871, the US Supreme Court ruled against Boudinot and Watie. It said that the Congress could abrogate previous treaty guarantees, and that the 1866 treaty had not renewed or provided for previous tax immunities. Boudinot continued to be active in politics and society in Indian Territory after the war. He helped attract railroad construction. Under changing Indian policy by the federal government, he helped open the former Indian Territory to white settlement with passage of the Dawes Act. It first provided for allotment of communal lands to individual households of tribal members. The federal government declared any remaining land as \\"surplus\\" and allowed its sale to non-Native Americans. Boudinot founded the city of Vinita, Oklahoma. He also spent time lobbying the federal government in Washington, DC. Among his activities was lobbying for the railroads. Congress passed a bill in 1873 to provide financial relief for Boudinot. However, this bill was pocket vetoed by President Ulysses S. Grant. Beginning in 1874, Boudinot served as private secretary to Congressman Thomas M. Gunter (D-Arkansas). He also was appointed to some paid committee clerkships. After Gunter left Congress, Boudinot became the secretary to U.S. Senator James David Walker of Arkansas. In 1885, he tried to gain appointment as Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Although supported by Arkansas politicians, he was unsuccessful.Thomas Burnell Colbert, \\"Elias Cornelius Boudinot\\", Encyclopedia of Arkansas, 2009, accessed 7 August 2012 He also practiced law in Arkansas with the politician Robert Ward Johnson (18-1879), who had been elected to both houses of Congress before the Civil War. Boudinot was active politically on issues related to the Indian Territory. He frequently spoke on the lecture circuit about Cherokee issues and development in the West, and was considered a prominent orator. Boudinot contributed to the eventual formation of the state of Oklahoma in the early twentieth century. Many Cherokee and others of the Five Civilized Tribes had first tried to gain passage of legislation to found a state to be controlled by Native Americans. He continued his work as an attorney. He died at the age of 55 of dysentery in Fort Smith on September 27, 1890. He is buried in Oak Grove Cemetery. ReferencesFurther reading *Adams, John D.

For Asian options the payoff is determined by the average underlying price over some pre-set period of time. This is different from the case of the usual European option and American option, where the payoff of the option contract depends on the price of the underlying instrument at exercise; Asian options are thus one of the basic forms of exotic options. There are two types of Asian options: fixed strike, where averaging price is used in place of underlying price; and fixed price, where averaging price is used in place of strike. One advantage of Asian options is that these reduce the risk of market manipulation of the underlying instrument at maturity .Kemna et al. 1990, p 1077 Another advantage of Asian options involves the relative cost of Asian options compared to European or American options. Because of the averaging feature, Asian options reduce the volatility inherent in the option; therefore, Asian options are typically cheaper than European or American options. This can be an advantage for corporations that are subject to the Financial Accounting Standards Board revised Statement No. 123, which required that corporations expense employee stock options.  Etymology  In the 1980s Mark Standish was with the London-based Bankers Trust working on fixed income derivatives and proprietary arbitrage trading. David Spaughton worked as systems analyst in the financial markets with Bankers Trust since 1984 when the Bank of England first gave licences for banks to do foreign exchange options in the London market. In 1987 Standish and Spaughton were in Tokyo on business when \\"they developed the first commercially used pricing formula for options linked to the average price of crude oil.\\" They called this exotic option the Asian option because they were in Asia.  Permutations of Asian option  There are numerous permutations of Asian option; the most basic are listed below: * Fixed strike (also known as an average rate) Asian call payout :: C(T) = \\\\text{max}\\\\left( A(0,T) - K, 0 \\\\right), : where A denotes the average price for the period [0, T], and K is the strike price. The equivalent put option is given by :: P(T) = \\\\text{max}\\\\left( K - A(0,T), 0 \\\\right). * The floating strike (or floating rate) Asian call option has the payout :: C(T) = \\\\text{max}\\\\left( S(T) - k A(0,T), 0 \\\\right), : where S(T) is the price at maturity and k is a weighting, usually 1 so often omitted from descriptions. The equivalent put option payoff is given by :: P(T) = \\\\text{max}\\\\left( k A(0,T) - S(T), 0 \\\\right).  Types of averaging  The Average A may be obtained in many ways. Conventionally, this means an arithmetic average. In the continuous case, this is obtained by : A(0,T) = \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\int_{0}^{T} S(t) dt. For the case of discrete monitoring (with monitoring at the times 0=t_0, t_1, t_2, \\\\dots, t_n=T and t_i=i\\\\cdot \\\\frac{T}{n} ) we have the average given by : A(0,T) = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} S(t_i). There also exist Asian options with geometric average; in the continuous case, this is given by : A(0,T) = \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\int_{0}^{T} \\\\ln( S(t)) dt \\\\right).  Pricing of Asian options  A discussion of the problem of pricing Asian options with Monte Carlo methods is given in a paper by Kemna and Vorst. In the path integral approach to option pricing, the problem for geometric average can be solved via the Effective Classical potential of Feynman and Kleinert. Rogers and Shi solve the pricing problem with a PDE approach. A Variance Gamma model can be efficiently implemented when pricing Asian style options. Then, using the Bondesson series representation to generate the variance gamma process can increase the computational performance of the Asian option pricer.Mattias Sander. Bondesson's Representation of the Variance Gamma Model and Monte Carlo Option Pricing. Lunds Tekniska H√∂gskola 2008 Within L√©vy models, the pricing problem for geometric Asian options can still be solved. For the arithmetic Asian option in L√©vy models, one can rely on numerical methods or on analytic bounds.  European Asian call and put options with geometric averaging  We are able to derive a closed-form solution for the geometric Asian option; when used in conjunction with control variates in Monte Carlo simulations, the formula is useful for deriving fair values for the arithmetic Asian option. Define the continuous-time geometric mean G_{T} as:G_{T} = \\\\exp\\\\left[{1\\\\over{T}} \\\\int_{0}^{T}\\\\log S(t)dt \\\\right]where the underlying S(t) follows a standard geometric Brownian motion. It is straightforward from here to calculate that:G_{T} = S_{0}e^{{1\\\\over{2}}\\\\left(r-{1\\\\over{2}}\\\\sigma^{2} \\\\right )T}e^{{\\\\sigma\\\\over{T}}\\\\int_{0}^{T} (T-t)dW_{t}}To derive the stochastic integral, which was originally {\\\\sigma\\\\over{T}} \\\\int_{0}^{T}W_{t}dt, note that:d[(T-t)W_{t}] = (T-t)dW_{t} - W_{t}dtThis may be confirmed by It√¥'s lemma. Integrating this expression and using the fact that W_{0} = 0, we find that the integrals are equivalent - this will be useful later on in the derivation. Using martingale pricing, the value of the European Asian call with geometric averaging C_{G} is given by:C_{G} = e^{-rT}\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[(G_{T}-K)_{+} \\\\right] = {e^{-rT}\\\\over{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}} \\\\int_{\\\\ell}^{\\\\infty}\\\\left(G_{T}-K \\\\right )e^{-x^{2}/2}dxIn order to find \\\\ell, we must find x such that:G_{T} \\\\geq K \\\\implies S_{0}e^{{1\\\\over{2}}\\\\left(r-{1\\\\over{2}}\\\\sigma^{2} \\\\right )T}e^{{\\\\sigma\\\\over{T}}\\\\int_{0}^{T} (T-t)dW_{t}} \\\\geq KAfter some algebra, we find that:{\\\\sigma\\\\over{T}} \\\\int_{0}^{T}(T-t)dW_{t} \\\\geq \\\\log {K\\\\over{S_{0}}} - {1\\\\over{2}}\\\\left(r-{1\\\\over{2}}\\\\sigma^{2}\\\\right)TAt this point the stochastic integral is the sticking point for finding a solution to this problem. However, it is easy to verify that the integral is normally distributed as:{\\\\sigma\\\\over{T}} \\\\int_{0}^{T}(T-t)dW_{t} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}\\\\left( 0, \\\\sigma^{2}{T\\\\over{3}} \\\\right)This is equivalent to saying that {\\\\sigma\\\\over{T}} \\\\int_{0}^{T}(T-t)dW_{t} = \\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{T\\\\over{3}}x with x\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0,1). Therefore, we have that:x \\\\geq {\\\\log {K\\\\over{S_{0}}} - {1\\\\over{2}}\\\\left(r-{1\\\\over{2}}\\\\sigma^{2}\\\\right)T \\\\over{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{T/3}}} \\\\equiv \\\\ellNow it is possible the calculate the value of the European Asian call with geometric averaging! At this point, it is useful to define:b = {1\\\\over{2}}\\\\left(r- {1\\\\over{2}}\\\\sigma_{G}^{2}\\\\right), \\\\; \\\\sigma_{G} = {\\\\sigma\\\\over{\\\\sqrt{3}}}, \\\\; d_{1} = {\\\\log {S_{0}\\\\over{K}} + \\\\left(b+{1\\\\over{2}}\\\\sigma_{G}^{2}\\\\right)T \\\\over{\\\\sigma_{G}\\\\sqrt{T}}}, \\\\; d_{2} = d_{1}-\\\\sigma_{G}\\\\sqrt{T}Going through the same process as is done with the Black-Scholes model, we are able to find that:C_{G} = S_{0}e^{(b-r)T}\\\\Phi(d_{1}) - Ke^{-rT}\\\\Phi(d_{2})In fact, going through the same arguments for the European Asian put with geometric averaging P_{G}, we find that:P_{G} = Ke^{-rT}\\\\Phi(-d_{2}) - S_{0}e^{(b-r)T}\\\\Phi(-d_{1})This implies that there exists a version of put-call parity for European Asian options with geometric averaging:C_{G}-P_{G} = S_{0}e^{(b-r)T} - Ke^{-rT}  Variations of Asian option  There are some variations that are sold in the over-the-counter market. For example, BNP Paribas introduced a variation, termed conditional Asian option, where the average underlying price is based on observations of prices over a pre-specified threshold. A conditional Asian put option has the payoff \\\\max\\\\left(K- \\\\frac{\\\\int^T_0 S(t) I_{{S(t)> b}} d t}{\\\\int^T_0 I_{{S(t)> b}} d t},0 \\\\right) , where b>0 is the threshold and I_A is an indicator function which equals 1 if A is true and equals zero otherwise. Such an option offers a cheaper alternative than the classic Asian put option, as the limitation on the range of observations reduces the volatility of average price. It is typically sold at the money and last for up to five years. The pricing of conditional Asian option is discussed by Feng and Volkmer.  References  Category:Options (finance) Category:Investment Category:Derivatives (finance) ","title":"Asian option"},{"id":"438093","text":"Lookback options, in the terminology of finance, are a type of exotic option with path dependency, among many other kind of options. The payoff depends on the optimal (maximum or minimum) underlying asset's price occurring over the life of the option. The option allows the holder to \\"look back\\" over time to determine the payoff. There exist two kinds of lookback options: with floating strike and with fixed strike. Lookback option with floating strike As the name introduces it, the option's strike price is floating and determined at maturity. The floating strike is the optimal value of the underlying asset's price during the option life. The payoff is the maximum difference between the market asset's price at maturity and the floating strike. For the call, the strike price is fixed at the asset's lowest price during the option's life, and, for the put, it is fixed at the asset's highest price. Note that these options are not really options, as they will be always exercised by their holder. In fact, the option is never out-of-the-money, which makes it more expensive than a standard option. The payoff functions for the lookback call and the lookback put, respectively, are given by: : LC_{float}=\\\\max(S_T - S_{min},0) = S_T - S_{min}, ~~\\\\text{and} ~~ LP_{float}=\\\\max(S_{max} - S_T,0) = S_{max} - S_T, where S_{max} is the asset's maximum price during the life of the option, S_{min} is the asset's minimum price during the life of the option, and S_T is the underlying asset's price at maturity T. Lookback option with fixed strike As for the standard European options, the option's strike price is fixed. The difference is that the option is not exercised at the price at maturity: the payoff is the maximum difference between the optimal underlying asset price and the strike. For the call option, the holder chooses to exercise at the point when the underlying asset price is at its highest level. For the put option, the holder chooses to exercise at the underlying asset's lowest price. The payoff functions for the lookback call and the lookback put, respectively, are given by: : LC_{fix}=\\\\max(S_{max}-K,0), ~~ \\\\text{and} ~~ LP_{fix}=\\\\max(K-S_{min},0), where S_{max} is the asset's maximum price during the life of the option, S_{min} is the asset's minimum price during the life of the option, and K is the strike price. Arbitrage-free price of lookback options with floating strike Using the Black‚ÄìScholes model, and its notations, we can price the European lookback options with floating strike. The pricing method is much more complicated than for the standard European options and can be found in Musiela. Assume that there exists a continuously-compounded risk-free interest rate r>0 and a constant stock's volatility \\\\sigma >0. Assume that the time to maturity is T>0, and that we will price the option at time t, although the life of the option started at time zero. Define \\\\tau=T-t. Finally, set that : M = \\\\max_{0\\\\leq u \\\\leq t} S_u, ~~m= \\\\min_{0\\\\leq u \\\\leq t} S_u \\\\text{ and }S_t = S. Then, the price of the lookback call option with floating strike is given by: : LC_t = S\\\\Phi(a_1(S,m)) - me^{-r\\\\tau}\\\\Phi(a_2(S,m)) - \\\\frac{S\\\\sigma^2}{2r} ( \\\\Phi(-a_1(S,m)) - e^{-r\\\\tau}(m/S)^{\\\\frac{2r}{\\\\sigma^{2}}}\\\\Phi(-a_3(S,m))), where : a_1(S,H) = \\\\frac{\\\\ln(S/H) + (r+\\\\frac12\\\\sigma^2)\\\\tau}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{\\\\tau}} : a_2(S,H) = \\\\frac{\\\\ln(S/H) + (r-\\\\frac12\\\\sigma^2)\\\\tau}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{\\\\tau}} = a_1(S,H) - \\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{\\\\tau} : a_3(S,H) = \\\\frac{\\\\ln(S/H) - (r-\\\\frac12\\\\sigma^2)\\\\tau}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{\\\\tau}} = a_1(S,H) - \\\\frac{2r\\\\sqrt{\\\\tau}}{\\\\sigma},\\\\text{ with }H>0, S>0, and where \\\\Phi is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, \\\\Phi(a) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{a} e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2}}\\\\, dx. Similarly, the price of the lookback put option with floating strike is given by: : LP_t = -S\\\\Phi(-a_1(S,M)) + Me^{-r\\\\tau}\\\\Phi(-a_2(S,M)) + \\\\frac{S\\\\sigma^2}{2r} ( \\\\Phi(a_1(S,M)) - e^{-r\\\\tau}(M/S)^{\\\\frac{2r}{\\\\sigma^{2}}}\\\\Phi(a_3(S,M))). Partial Lookback Options Partial lookback options are a subclass of lookback options with the same payoff structure, but with the goal of reducing its fair price. One way is to scale the fair price linearly with constant \\\\mu, where 0<\\\\lambda<1. Thus the payoff is: : \\\\lambda (\\\\max{S_i}_1^T - S_T) Selecting specific dates is a more intricate way of creating partial lookback options and other partial path-dependent options. The principle lies in selecting a subset of monitoring dates, so that the lookback condition is less strong and thus reducing the premium. Examples include the partial lookback option proposed by Heynen and Kat, and the amnesiac lookback option proposed by Chang and Li, Discrete partial path-dependent options are overpriced under continuous assumptions, and pricing is complex and performed is typically done using numerical methods.

After that initial transfer of title of the copy, the new owner of the copy can generally distribute that particular copy without further authorization of the copyright holder. The first-sale doctrine is one of the limitations and exceptions to copyright. Overview Copyright law grants a copyright owner an exclusive right \\"to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending\\". 17 U.S.C. 106(3). This is called a \\"distribution right\\" and differs from the copyright owner's \\"reproduction right\\" which involves making copies of the copyrighted works. Rather than the right to copy, the distribution right involves the right to transfer physical copies or phonorecords (i.e., recorded music) of the copyrighted work. For example, the distribution right could be infringed when a retailer acquires and sells to the public unlawfully made audio or video tapes. Although the retailer may not have copied the work in any way and may not have known that the tapes were made unlawfully, they nevertheless infringe the distribution right by the sale. The distribution right allows the copyright owner to seek redress from any member in the chain of distribution. The first-sale doctrine creates a basic exception to the copyright holder's distribution right. Once the work is lawfully sold or even transferred gratuitously, the copyright owner's interest in the material object in which the copyrighted work is embodied is exhausted. The owner of the material object can then dispose of it as they see fit. Thus, one who buys a copy of a book is entitled to resell it, rent it, give it away, or destroy it. However, the owner of the copy of the book will not be able to make new copies of the book because the first-sale doctrine does not limit copyright owner's reproduction right. The rationale of the doctrine is to prevent the copyright owner from restraining the free alienability of goods. Without the doctrine, a possessor of a copy of a copyrighted work would have to negotiate with the copyright owner every time he wished to dispose of his copy. After the initial transfer of ownership of a legal copy of a copyrighted work, the first-sale doctrine exhausts copyright holder's right to control how ownership of that copy can be disposed of. For this reason, this doctrine is also referred to as the \\"exhaustion rule\\". The doctrine was first recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1908 (see Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus) and subsequently codified in the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 109. In the Bobbs-Merrill case, the publisher, Bobbs-Merrill, had inserted a notice in its books that any retail sale at a price under $1.00 would constitute an infringement of its copyright. The defendants, who owned Macy's department store, disregarded the notice and sold the books at a lower price without Bobbs-Merrill's consent. The Supreme Court held that the exclusive statutory right to \\"vend\\" applied only to the first sale of the copyrighted work. Section 109(a) provides: \\"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 (3), the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.\\" The elements of the first sale doctrine can be summarized as follows: (1) the copy was lawfully made with the authorization of the copyright owner; (2) ownership of the copy was initially transferred under the copyright owner's authority; (3) the defendant is a lawful owner of the copy in question; and (4) the defendant's use implicates the distribution right only; not the reproduction or some other right given to the copyright owner. Application to public display right 17 U.S.C. ¬ß109(c) creates a limited exception to a copyright owner's public display right. Owners of a lawful copy of a copyrighted work can, without permission from the copyright owner, display that copy, including packaging, to viewers present at the place where the copy is located. An amicus brief in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. argued that Section 109 was a key provision for US art museums: Limitations  The first sale doctrine only limits the distribution rights of copyright holders. This principle sometimes clashes with the holder's other rights, such as the right of reproduction and derivative work rights. For example, in Lee v. A.R.T. Co., the defendant bought plaintiff's artworks in the form of notecards and then mounted them on ceramic tiles, covering the artworks with transparent epoxy resin. Despite plaintiff's assertion of violation of his right to prepare derivative works, the 7th Circuit held that the derivative work right was not violated and that defendant's sale of the tiles was protected under the first sale doctrine. However, based on very similar facts, the 9th Circuit in Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Company held that plaintiff's right to prepare derivative works was infringed and that the first sale doctrine did not protect the defendant under such circumstances. Application to digital copies The first-sale doctrine does not neatly fit transfers of copies of digital works because an actual transfer does not actually happen ‚Äì instead, the recipient receives a new copy of the work while, at the same time, the sender has the original copy (unless that copy is deleted, either automatically or manually). For example, this exact issue played out in Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc., a case involving an online marketplace for pre-owned digital music. E-books have the same issue. Because the first sale doctrine does not apply to electronic books, libraries cannot freely lend e-books indefinitely after purchase. Instead, electronic book publishers came up with business models to sell the subscriptions to the license of the text. This results in e-book publishers placing restrictions on the number of times an e-book can circulate and/or the amount of time a book is within a collection before a library's license expires, then the book no longer belongs to them.Chiarizio, M. (2013). \\"An American Tragedy: E-Books, Licenses, and the End of Public Lending Libraries?\\" Vanderbilt Law Review, 66(2), 615‚Äì644. The question is whether the first-sale doctrine should be retooled to reflect the realities of the digital age. Physical copies degrade over time, whereas digital information may not. Works in digital format can be reproduced without any flaws and can be disseminated worldwide without much difficulty. Thus, applying the first sale doctrine to digital copies affects the market for the original to a greater degree than transfers of physical copies. The U.S. Copyright Office stated that \\"[t]he tangible nature of a copy is a defining element of the first sale doctrine and critical to its rationale.\\" The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled, on July 3, 2012, that it is indeed permissible to resell software licenses even if the digital good has been downloaded directly from the Internet, and that the first sale doctrine applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited amount of time, as such sale involves a transfer of ownership, thus prohibiting any software maker from preventing the resale of their software by any of their legitimate owners. The court requires that the previous owner must no longer be able to use the licensed software after the resale, but finds that the practical difficulties in enforcing this clause should not be an obstacle to authorizing resale, as they are also present for software which can be installed from physical supports, where the first-sale doctrine is in force. The ruling applies to the European Union, but could indirectly find its way to North America; moreover the situation could entice publishers to offer platforms for a secondary market. In a notable case, the High Court of Paris found against Valve for not allowing the resale of games from the Steam digital storefront, requiring Valve to comply with the European Union Directives of first-sale doctrine within three months, pending appeals. Ownership requirement For the first sale doctrine to apply, lawful ownership of the copy or phonorecord is required. As ¬ß109(d) prescribes, first sale doctrine does not apply if the possession of the copy is \\"by rental, lease, loan, or otherwise without acquiring ownership of it\\". Some software and digital content publishers claim in their end-user license agreements (EULA) that their software or content is licensed, not sold, and thus the first sale doctrine does not apply to their works. These publishers have had some success in contracting around first sale doctrine through various clickwrap, shrink wrap, and other license agreements. For example, if someone buys MP3 songs from Amazon.com, the MP3 files are merely licensed to them and hence they may not be able to resell those MP3 files. However, MP3 songs bought through iTunes Store may be characterized as \\"sales\\" because of Apple's language in its EULA and hence they may be resellable, if other requirements of first sale doctrine are met. Courts have struggled and taken dramatically different approaches to sort out when only a license was granted to the end user as compared to ownership. Most of these cases involved software-licensing agreements. In general, courts look beneath the surface of the agreements to conclude whether the agreements create a licensing relationship or if they amount to, in substance, sales subject to first sale doctrine under ¬ß109(a). Thus, specifying that the agreement grants only a \\"license\\" is necessary to create the licensing relationship, but not sufficient. Other terms of the agreement should be consistent with such a licensing relationship. In Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc. the 9th Circuit created a three-factor test to decide whether a particular software licensing agreement is successful in creating a licensing relationship with the end user. The factors include: 1) whether a copyright owner specifies that a user is granted a license; 2) whether the copyright owner significantly restricts the user's ability to transfer the software to others; and 3) whether the copyright owner imposes notable use restrictions on the software. In Vernor, Autodesk's license agreement specified that it retains title to the software and the user is only granted a non-exclusive license. The agreement also had restrictions against modifying, translating, or reverse-engineering the software, or removing any proprietary marks from the software packaging or documentation. The agreement also specified that software could not be transferred or leased without Autodesk's written consent, and could not be transferred outside the Western Hemisphere. Based on these facts, the 9th Circuit held that the user is only a licensee of Autodesk's software, not an owner and hence the user could not resell the software on eBay without Autodesk's permission. However, the same 9th Circuit panel that decided Vernor v. Autodesk, refused to apply Vernor three-factor test in UMG v. Augusto to a purported licensing agreement created when UMG sent unsolicited promotional CDs to music critics. The promotional CDs' packaging contained the language: \\"This CD is the property of the record company and is licensed to the intended recipient for personal use only. Acceptance of this CD shall constitute an agreement to comply with the terms of the license. Resale or transfer of possession is not allowed and may be punishable under federal and state laws.\\" Augusto tried to sell these CDs on eBay and UMG argued that first sale doctrine did not apply since the CDs were not sold and only a licensing relationship was created. However the court held that first sale doctrine applies when a copy is given away and that recipients of the promotional CDs did not accept the terms of the license agreement by merely not sending back the unsolicited CDs. In the case UsedSoft v Oracle, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the sale of a software product, either through a physical support or download, constituted a transfer of ownership in EU law, thus the first sale doctrine applies; the ruling thereby breaks the \\"licensed, not sold\\" legal theory, but leaves open numerous questions. (mirror here) Importation of copies Section 602(a)(1) of the US copyright statute states that \\"importation into the United States, without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside the United States is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords.\\" This provision provides the copyright owner an opportunity to stop goods from entering the United States market altogether. Application of this provision created difficult legal issues in the context of gray market products. Gray market dealers buy the genuine goods in foreign countries at a significant discount from U.S. prices. They then import these genuine goods into the U.S. and sell them at discount prices, undercutting the authorized U.S. dealers. The gray market exists where the price for goods outside the US is lower than the price inside. On the surface, ¬ß602(a), barring unauthorized importation, would seem to clash with the first-sale doctrine, which permits the resale of lawfully made copies. The issue comes down to whether ¬ß602(a) creates an affirmative right to bar all unauthorized importation, or does the first-sale doctrine limit the reach of ¬ß602(a), thus permitting the resale of at least some lawfully made imported copies. In 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court in Quality King v. L'Anza found that first-sale doctrine applied to imported goods at least where the imported goods are first lawfully made in the United States, shipped abroad for resale, and later reenter the United States. That case involved importation of hair care products bearing copyrighted labels. A unanimous Supreme Court found that the first-sale doctrine does apply to importation into the US of copyrighted works (the labels), which were made in the US and then exported. However, the Supreme Court did not decide the issue where gray-market products are initially manufactured abroad and then imported into the US. The Court indicated that importation of goods made outside the US could perhaps be barred under ¬ß602(a), since such goods would not be \\"lawfully made under this title\\". Such products might be lawfully made, either by the copyright owner or a licensee, but they would not be lawfully made under US copyright law. Rather, they would be lawfully made under the copyright laws of the other country; and the first-sale doctrine would therefore not limit the ¬ß602 importation restriction. The 2008 case Omega v. Costco involved this exact unresolved issue, where the defendant Costco obtained authentic Omega watches, which feature a copyrighted design on the back of the watches, through the gray market and resold them in its stores in the US. Omega manufactured these watches outside the US and did not authorize their importation into the US. Based on the Quality King case, the 9th Circuit held that \\"application of first-sale doctrine to foreign-made copies would impermissibly apply\\" the Copyright Act extraterritorially. However, the court stated that first-sale doctrine might still apply to a foreign manufactured copy if it was imported \\"with the authority of the U.S. copyright owner\\". The Supreme Court granted certiorari to Omega v. Costco, and affirmed 4‚Äì4. However, as an evenly split decision, it set precedent only in the 9th Circuit, not nationwide. However, in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., in 2013, the United States Supreme Court held in a 6‚Äì3 decision that the first- sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US. The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to charge vastly different prices in different markets due to ease of arbitrage. The decision removes the incentive to US manufacturers of shifting manufacturing abroad purely in an attempt to circumvent the first-sale doctrine. Exceptions=Record rentals The Record Rental Amendment of 1984, codified in 17 USC ¬ß109(b) prohibits an owner of a phonorecord that embodies a sound recording or musical work from renting it to the public for direct or indirect commercial advantage. This exception was designed to prevent music stores from renting records and thereby facilitating home copying. Section 109(b) is an exception to the first sale doctrine, but it is limited in several ways. It applies only to rentals, and not to resale or other transfers. It is also limited to a subset of sound recordings‚Äîonly those sound recordings that contain only a musical work. It does not apply to sound recordings that contain other content, such as commentaries or dialog soundtrack, or to non-musical sound recordings, for example audiobooks. Lastly, libraries and educational institutions are exempt from this restriction, and may rent or loan musical sound recordings. Software rentals The Copyright Software Rental Amendments Act of 1990 amended ¬ß109(b) further to prohibit rentals of computer software for direct or indirect commercial advantage. The exception does not apply to lending of a copy by a nonprofit library for nonprofit purposes, provided the library affixes an appropriate warning. The amendment also specifically excluded: * A computer program which is embodied in a machine or product and which cannot be copied during the ordinary operation or use of the machine or product; or * A computer program embodied in or used in conjunction with a limited purpose computer that is designed for playing video games and may be designed for other purposes. Application in trademark law With reference to trade in tangible merchandise, such as the retailing of goods bearing a trademark, the first sale doctrine serves to immunize a reseller from infringement liability. Such protection to the reseller extends to the point where said goods have not been altered so as to be materially different from those originating from the trademark owner.

Like the more general exotic derivatives they may have several triggers relating to determination of payoff. An exotic option may also include non-standard underlying instrument, developed for a particular client or for a particular market. Exotic options are more complex than options that trade on an exchange, and are generally traded over the counter (OTC). Etymology The term \\"exotic option\\" was popularized by Mark Rubinstein's 1990 working paper (published 1992, with Eric Reiner) \\"Exotic Options\\", with the term based either on exotic wagers in horse racing, or due to the use of international terms such as \\"Asian option\\", suggesting the \\"exotic Orient\\". Journalist Brian Palmer used the \\"successful $1 bet on the superfecta\\" in the 2010 Kentucky Derby that \\"paid a whopping $101,284.60\\" as an example of the controversial high-risk, high-payout exotic bets that were observed by track-watchers since the 1970s in his article about why we use the term exotic for certain types of financial instrument. Palmer compared these horse racing bets to the controversial emerging exotic financial instruments that concerned then-chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker in 1980. He argued that just as the exotic wagers survived the media controversy so will the exotic options. In 1987, Bankers Trust Mark Standish and David Spaughton, were in Tokyo on business when \\"they developed the first commercially used pricing formula for options linked to the average price of crude oil.\\" They called this exotic option, the Asian option, because they were in Asia.  Development  Exotic options are often created by financial engineers and rely on complex models to price them. Features A straight call or put option, either American or European, would be considered non- exotic or vanilla option. There are two general types of exotic options: path- independent and path-dependent. An option is path-independent if its value depends only on the final price of the underlying instrument. Path-dependent options depend not only in the final price of the underlying instrument, but also on all the prices leading to the final price. An exotic option could have one or more of the following features: * The payoff at maturity depends not just on the value of the underlying instrument at maturity, but at its value at several times during the contract's life (it could be an Asian option depending on some average, a lookback option depending on the maximum or minimum, a barrier option which ceases to exist if a certain level is reached or not reached by the underlying, a digital option, peroni options, range options, spread options, etc.) * It could depend on more than one index such as in basket options, outperformance options, Himalaya options, or other mountain range options * The manner of settlement may vary depending on the moneyness of the option at expiry, such as a cash or share option. * There could be callability and putability rights. * It could involve foreign exchange rates in various ways, such as a quanto or composite option. Even products traded actively in the market can have the characteristics of exotic options, such as convertible bonds, whose valuation can depend on the price and volatility of the underlying equity, the credit rating, the level and volatility of interest rates, and the correlations between these factors. Barriers Barriers in exotic option are determined by the underlying price and ability of the stock to be active or inactive during the trade period, for instance up-and ‚Äìout option has a high chance of being inactive should the underlying price go beyond the marked barrier. Down-and-in-option is very likely to be active should the underlying prices of the stock go below the marked barrier. Up-and-in option is very likely to be active should the underlying price go beyond the marked barrier. One-touch double barrier binary options are path-dependent options in which the existence and payment of the options depend on the movement of the underlying price through their option life.

The film stars Ra√∫l Juli√° as Oscar Romero, Richard Jordan as Romero's close friend and fellow martyred priest, Rutilio Grande, as well as actors Ana Alicia and Harold Gould. Although the film depicts true events, there are some fictional characters.  Plot  During the 1977 El Salvadoran presidential election, public unrest is at an all-time high over fears of election fraud. In the midst of a guerrilla uprising, the military regime sends death squads to detain, torture and kill anyone who speaks out against its terrible human rights record. The military also prevents average citizens from getting to the polls; soldiers are shown blocking a bus bringing people to town on election day. When the people decide to walk, the military shoots up their vans so that they have no transportation for the return journey. The Vatican elevates conservative yet reserved Oscar Arnulfo Romero (Raul Julia) to the position of Archbishop of San Salvador, hoping that with he will not get involved in the military dispute. Although apolitical, Romero is afraid of the government's increasing hostility. He initially refrains from stirring anti-government sentiments, but progressively, as he spends more time in his post, he sees evidence of deception, oppression, and systemic murder, after which he cannot support the government in good conscience and speaks out. After the assassination of Father Rutilio Grande (Richard Jordan), an outspoken Jesuit advocate for the poor and close friend of Father Romero's, Romero begins to take a stand against the government's policies, prompting the death squads to begin targeting priests. After failing to rescue a pro-government hostage of the guerrillas in a botched ransom, Romero discovers that his friend Father Osuna (Alejandro Bracho), a militant critic of the ruling regime, has been captured and tortured. After securing his release, Romero instigates a boycott of the president-elect's inauguration, defying him by taking Mass in a church the military has taken over as a barracks. He later attempts to secure the release of a soldier taken hostage by Osuna and the guerrillas, but is arrested in the process. Osuna is subsequently tortured to death. Undeterred, Romero rejects the violent methods of the guerrillas, but is nonetheless assassinated while saying Mass, specifically while consecrating the Eucharist. The film concludes with text stating that Archbishop Romero was murdered on March 24, 1980, followed by: > He had spoken the disturbing truth. Many chose not to listen. As a result, > between 1980 and 1989 more than 60,000 Salvadorians were killed. But the > struggle for peace and freedom, justice and dignity goes on.Romero. Dir. > John Duigan. By John Sacret Young.

Production  Romero is the first feature film from Paulist Pictures, a company founded by the Paulist Fathers, a Roman Catholic society of priests. This was the first time a Catholic company produced a major film. The company was also known for the production of a long-standing television series called Insight. The film was screened in 1989 at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was directed by Australian filmmaker John Duigan and produced by Paulist Pictures founder Father Ellwood (Bud) Kieser. Alfonso Cuar√≥n, a Mexican film director, worked as an assistant director for this film. Composer Gabriel Yared, who went on to win BAFTA Awards and an Oscar for his other scores, composed the music for Romero.  Reception  Romero was generally well received by critics. The film currently holds a 75% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on eight reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a mildly positive review, awarding it two and-a-half stars out of four. Ebert praised Julia's \\"restrained and reasonable\\" performance but felt that the film was predictable and therefore not as powerful as other biopics.https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/romero-1989 Spirituality and Practice gave the film a positive review stating it as an \\"excellent drama\\" with most of the praise going towards Raul Julia in his performance as Romero. Romero did receive criticism on how it did not shed light on US involvement. The Los Angeles Times stated the fact that \\"the film doesn't deal with the role of the American government in El Salvador's plight, beyond a plea from Romero for the US to stop sending arms that will be only used against his country's people.\\" Furthermore, because there were a lot of historical aspects depicted in the film, The New York Times reviewer Vicent Canby thought that the film \\"is more important as the brief, considerably simplified biography of a heroic man than as cinema. The film's manner is that of a textbook.\\"  References  External links  *Romero at the Arts & Faith Top100 Spiritually Significant Films list * Romero Movie Guide from the Foundation for Self Sufficiency in Central America, a non-profit group *Interview with Raul Julia about the film * * Category:1989 films Category:Films about Catholicism Category:Films about Christianity Category:Films about Catholic priests Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by John Duigan Category:Films about the Salvadoran Civil War Category:Films about Latin American military dictatorships Category:Cold War films Category:Films scored by Gabriel Yared Category:Political thriller films Category:Cultural depictions of √ìscar Romero ","title":"Romero (film)"},{"id":"438123","text":"impaled with the coat of arms of Shakespeare {right} John Hall (1575 ‚Äì 25 November 1635) was a physician and son-in-law of William Shakespeare. Life He was born at Carlton, Bedfordshire and studied at Queens' College, Cambridge from 1589, receiving a B.A. in 1593 and a M.A. in 1597. He became a physician, although he did not hold an English medical degree; it has been speculated that he studied medicine in France. He established a practice in Stratford- upon-Avon, where he was the only doctor in the town. He married Shakespeare's daughter Susanna on 5 June 1607. They had one daughter, Elizabeth. Their home in Stratford, Hall's Croft, is now open to the public. After Shakespeare's death, they moved into his former house at New Place. Hall appears to have had a close relationship with his father-in-law, as they are recorded being in agreement over a local issue regarding enclosure in 1613. They are also known to have travelled together to London on business in 1614. Defamation case Hall was a leading local Puritan. He had supported the Puritan vicar, Thomas Wilson, against whom there was much local opposition. In 1613, a member of the anti-Wilson faction, John Lane, defamed Susanna, claiming she had committed adultery with one Ralph Smith, a 35-year-old haberdasher, and had caught a venereal disease from Smith. On 15 July the Halls brought suit for slander against Lane in the Consistory Court at Worcester. Robert Whatcott, who three years later witnessed Shakespeare's will, testified for the Halls, but Lane failed to appear. Lane was found guilty and excommunicated. He was later involved in a riot to protest against Wilson.Park Honan, Shakespeare: A Life, Oxford UP: Oxford, 1998, pp. 384‚Äì85. Writings Hall prepared two notebooks of his case notes with the intention that they be published. They were purchased and translated from Latin by James Cooke (1614‚Äì1688), a surgeon. He published them in 1657, 22 years after Hall's death, as . The earliest case, in Stratford, dates from 1611, making it almost certain that Hall lived and worked in Stratford from at least the time of his marriage. The first notebook still survives, but the original manuscript of the second notebook has been lost. Portrayals The slander case has been used as the subject of a play, The Herbal Bed, by Peter Whelan. In the original production Hall was played by Liam Cunningham.

As such, he was considered an \\"enlightened ruler\\", and continued the progressive moves of his Abbasid predecessors. Caliphate His short reign was fraught with numerous military conflicts. The revolt of Husayn ibn Ali ibn Hasan broke out when Husayn declared himself caliph in Medina. Al-Hadi crushed the rebellion and killed Husayn and many of his followers, but Idris bin Abdallah, a cousin of Husayn, escaped and aided by Wadih, the Egyptian postal manager, reached Morocco where he founded the Idrisi state. Al-Hadi also crushed a Kharijite rebellion and repelled a Byzantine invasion. The Abbasid armies actually seized some territory from the latter. Al-Hadi died in 786. al-Tabari notes varying accounts of this death, e.g. an abdominal ulcer or assassination prompted by al-Hadi's own mother. Al-Tabari (v. 30 p. 42f) notes al-Hadi's assertion of independence from his mother, his forbidding her further involvement in public affairs and his threatening Harun's succession. Al-Tabari says others refer to al-Hadi's overtures to Harun. One account al- Tabari cites has al-Hadi attempting to poison his mother: :\\"Yahya b. al-Hasan related that his father transmitted the information to him, saying: I heard Kalisah telling al-'Abbas b. al-Fadl b. al-Rabi that Musa sent to his mother al-Khayzuran a dish of rice, saying, \\"I found this tasty and accordingly ate some of it, so you have some too!\\" Khalisah related: But I said to her, \\"Don't touch it until you investigate further, for I am afraid that it might contain something to your detriment.\\" So they brought in a dog; it ate some and fell down dead. Musa sent to al-Khayzuran afterwards and said, \\"How did you like the dish of rice?\\" She replied, \\"I enjoyed it very much.\\" He said, \\"You can't have eaten it, because if you had, I would have been rid of you. When was any Caliph happy who had a mother (still alive)?\\" (v. 30 pp. 43‚Äì44) The note on p. 42 of volume 30 of the SUNY translation of al-Tabari cites pp. 288‚Äì289 of the Kitab al-'Uyun for the possibility that al-Khayzuran feared al-Hadi would recover from his illness and thus had slave girls suffocate him. This note continues, \\"Certainly, his death appears as too opportune for so many people concerned that it should have been a natural one.\\" The famous Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun discredited this claim. Al-Hadi moved his capital from Baghdad to Haditha shortly before his death. Al-Hadi was succeeded by his younger brother, Harun al-Rashid.

The main town of Lagos (which includes only the parish of S√£o Sebasti√£o e Santa Maria) has a population of approximately 22,000. Typically, these numbers increase during the summer months, with the influx of visiting tourists and seasonal residents. While the majority of the population lives along the coast and works in tourism and services, the inland region is sparsely inhabited, with the majority of the people working in agriculture and forestry. Lagos is one of the most visited cities in the Algarve and Portugal, due to its variety of tourist-friendly beaches, rock formations (Ponta da Piedade), bars, restaurants and hotels, renowned for its vibrant summer nightlife and parties. Yet, Lagos is also a historic centre of the Portuguese Age of Discovery, frequent home of Henry the Navigator, historical shipyard and, at one time, centre of the European slave trade. In 2012, travel website TripAdvisor, classified Lagos as the number one travel destination, on a list of \\"15 destinations on the rise\\" worldwide. Lagos, Nigeria, may have been named after it, since, at the time of the 15th century, Lagos, Portugal, was the main centre of Portuguese maritime expeditions down the African coast. History A painting from the 16th century showing a caravel being provisioned in the port of Lagos depicting Africans and Europeans Replica of the caravel Boa Esperan√ßa Lagos's slave market. Built in 1444, it was colonial Europe's first slave market Lagos is an ancient maritime town with more than 2000 years of history. The name Lagos comes from a Celtic settlement, derived from the Latin Lacobriga, the name of the settlement was established during the pre-Punic civilizations. It became an early settlement of the Carthaginians, who recruited Celtic tribesmen in their war against the Romans (the Punic Wars). Owing to its already important harbour, it was colonized by the Romans and integrated into the Roman province of Lusitania, becoming known as Lacobriga. Quintus Sertorius, a rebellious Roman general, helped by the Lusitanians of Lacobriga (who had been oppressed under Roman Generals and members of Lucius Cornelius Sulla party), successfully defeated the Roman army of Caecilius Metellus Pius probably at nearby Monte Moli√£o. With the fall of Rome, the town of Lagos was occupied in the 6th century by the Visigoths from the Kingdom of Toledo and later by the Byzantines. The Moors arrived in the 8th century from North Africa, renaming the settlement Zawaia (meaning lago, or lake). It became part of the much larger coastal region of al-Gharb, which eventually became known as the algarve. The Moors fortified the town with Lagos Castle and established important trade links to Northern Africa from their bases in the Iberian peninsula. In 1174, the local WƒÅli gave permission for the Christian peoples to construct a church dedicated to S√£o Jo√£o Baptista, which was built outside the town's walls (becoming the oldest church in the Algarve). Kingdom Even as King Afonso Henriques advanced to the south, the Christian Reconquista never made it into Algarve and Alentejo, and remained under Moorish control. King Sancho I, with the support of Crusader forces used Lagos as a stepping stone to attack the fortress of Alv√¥r. CUP (1970), p.95 Zawaia was eventually captured by King Afonso III of Portugal in 1241, but was only taken definitively in 1249. From this period on the King began self-styling himself as the \\"King of Portugal and the Algarve\\", stressing the fact that the Algarve (which had for so long been ruled by the Moors as a foreign country) had been annexed into the dominion of the Portuguese. Lagos became an independent jurisdiction under the rule of King Peter I in 1361. King John I assembled his fleet in the harbour of Lagos, before setting sail for the siege and conquest of the city of Ceuta in 1415. This was the first step in opening the Muslim world to medieval Europe, which in fact led to the Age of Discovery with Portuguese explorers sailing across the whole world. By the 15th century, Lagos became the centre of Portuguese maritime exploration, with ships ordered south to trace the shoreline of Africa in order to find routes to India. Infante Henry the Navigator, third son of King John, lived most of the time in Lagos. From here he directed expeditions to Morocco and to the western coast of Africa with caravels, lateen-rigged ships with excellent seafaring capabilities. Lagos was also the home port for Gil Eanes who was the first to sail beyond Cape Bojador in 1434, after a failed attempt in 1433 that put him out of favour with the, then considered the end of the world. The act of rounding the Cape, much like the later rounding of the Cape of Good Hope, permitted Eanes (and the navigators that followed) to advance into the African subcontinent. When, by 1443, Lan√ßarote (then fiscal officer of the crown) had sailed as far as Arguim and brought back 275 Africans, the Portuguese had sufficient slaves to relieve the perpetual handicap of agricultural labour.CUP (1970), p.190 Over the following decades, news of discoveries and achievements, and ships loaded with spices and goods would flow into the port of Lagos. It was also the gateway for the first African slaves into post-medieval Europe.H. Morse Stephens (1891), p.149 Even before Africa was opened-up to the Portuguese, the seamen of Lagos were already enthusiastic slave-catchers.David Birmingham (2003), p. 27 From the first slave markets in Lagos (the Mercado de Escravos, which opened in 1444), many Africans were dispersed throughout Europe, bringing a considerable income to the Portuguese monarchy and merchant classes, as well as cheap labour force. As the major sponsor of these expeditions, Prince Henry received one- fifth of the selling price of every slave. The demand for the indentured labour force was so high that, by 1450, profit on Mauritanian slaves was 700 percent.David Birmingham (2003), p. 29 The discovery of gold by Alfonso Gon√ßales also increased activities in Lagos, whose residents petitioned the Infante Henry to establish a trading company to pursue gold deposits in the region.Robert Kerr (1844), p.189 This included Juan Dias (ancestor of Bartolomeu Dias who rounded the Cape of Good Hope), Gil Eanes, Lan√ßarote de Freitas, Estevan Alfonso and Rodrigo Alvarez, who provisioned a squadron of six caravels to travel to isle of Gar√ßas in 1444, but returned with 150 Africans. The historic centre of Lagos Following the death of Prince Henry, and the expansion into the Atlantic and New World, the port of Lagos continued to receive shipments of goods and slaves, but its role began to decrease. Lisbon, began to prosper, with ships returning directly from the colonies of the Azores, Madeira and Brazil, while trading houses began to relocate to the capital. But, even as the wealth arrived in Lisbon and Lagos, the ostentation was widely on display in the royal residences.David Birmingham (2003), p. 30 King Sebastian, obsessed with his plans for a great crusade against the Kingdom of Fez, assembled a huge fleet in Lagos in 1578.H. Morse Stephens (1891), p.253 During this ill-fated attempt he and most of Portugal's nobility were killed in the Battle of Ksar El Kebir in Morocco, eventually causing a succession crisis, that eventually resulted in the Iberian Union. When Portugal came under Spanish rule, the Portuguese coast became a target for the English fleet. Lagos, close to the Spanish naval base of C√°diz, was attacked by Sir Francis Drake in the late 1580s, but was defended by its inhabitants, resulting in Drakes sack of Faro.CUP (1970), p.275 But, the coast was under regular attack of other pirates and corsairs, in addition to the Spanish who bombarded the Algarve during the Portuguese Restoration War (1640‚Äì1668), which led to the construction of a string of forts all along the coast. One of them was the late-17th-century Fort of Ponta da Bandeira in Lagos, which was completed between 1679 and 1690 (according to the stone inscription over the main door). From 1576 to 1755, Lagos was a high-profile capital of the Algarve, until the old Portuguese town was destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami of 1755. Although some walls from the 16th century still remain, as well as the governor's castle, many of the buildings are from the 17th century. Two well-known naval battles took place off Lagos, reflecting its strategic location: in the Battle of Lagos (1693) a French flotilla defeated a combined Anglo-Dutch force, while in the Battle of Lagos (1759) a British force defeated a French force. Geography Dona Ana Beach (Praia Dona Ana) Pinh√£o beach Porto de M√≥s beach (Praia do Porto de M√≥s) is one of the most popular beaches in Lagos, along with Dona Ana and Meia Praia Physical geography By its geographical position (east-northeast to west-southwest orientation) and lithological diversity, the Algarve stands out as a unique stratigraphic and morpho-tectonic region.M. Cach√£o, P. Terrinha, A. Santos (2005), p.179-180 A peripheral Carboniferous unit of the Variscan orogeny, it constitutes the Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary layers, deposited onto two totally distinct superimposed basins. Between the Middle-Upper Triassic to Hettangian, sediments evolved from continental (fluvial red sandstone) to shallow marine over the entire region, which included instances of evaporates, tholeiite fissural magmas, lava flows, volcanic ash and pyroclasts. The area of Lagos, conforms to the Middle Miocene Lagos-Portim√£o formation (a band that extends along the coast from Lagos to Albufeira, abutting the Serra do Caldeir√£o to the north) and which corresponds to marine sedimentation over relatively stable, but a minorly deformed limestone shelf platform.Markus H. Forst, Thomas C. Brachert and Joiio Pais (2000), p.290J. Pais et al. (2000), p.279 A period of calm during the intra-Miocene (of approximately 2.4 Ma) led to generalized exposure and development of karst, that influences the present day coastline. The conspicuous horizontal bending of this profile in the cliffs of Lagos, much like the remainder of the Lagos-Portim√£o formation, is formed by alternating bands of siliciclastic and calcareous lithologies. The low degree of cementation in the layers causes a high degree of instability of the cliffs. The littoral and cliff sands are dominated by various bivalve organisms, bryozoans, larger benthic foraminifers and Coralline algaewith minor additions of echinoids and balanids implying a shallow-water depositional system of a warm-temperate climatic regime. The locality of Cerro das M√≥s, from where a large crocodilian (Tomistoma schlegelii) tooth was collected long ago,M.T. Antunes et al. (1981), p.9-38 has also produced some Odontoceti teeth. These may be dated from the Serravallian, which, constitute the oldest marine mammal occurrence in Algarve.M. Estevens (2000), p.271-280 Climate Lagos has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csa). Ecoregions/Protected areas Lagos has many natural interest sites, including: * Ponta da Piedade () * Grutas da Costa d'Oiro () * Laguna de Alvor () *\\"Bravura Dam\\" ) * Mata Nacional de Bar√£o de S.Jo√£o (), representing a varied flora that includes Pine (Pinaceae), Acacia (Acacia), Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus) and Strawberry trees (Arbutus unedo), with six pedestrian trails and six campsites. In the zone of Pedra Branca, is a Paleolithic menhir, called the Menhir of Pedro do Galo, accessible through the pedestrian trails, visitors can use the tables and picnicking areas near the guardhouse for barbecues, while small children have access to a playground. A public sports field and 100 metre interval obstacle course was also constructed to attract activity, near the picnic area. =Beaches= A view of Lagos and the Meia Praia beach in the background * Meia Praia (Half Beach) ‚Äîthe most popular tourist beach, consisting of soft, white sand, Meia Praia is one of the largest open bays in Europe, resulting in calm seas, permitting conditions for many nautical sports, while cliffs provide sheltered coves from strong windy conditions; * Praia Solaria (Sunny Beach); * Praia da Batata (Potato Beach) ‚Äî a small beach tucked between two small cliffs (where the river meets the Atlantic Ocean), it is known for the small music festivals that take place there during summer; * Praia dos Estudantes (Students' Beach); * Praia da Dona Ana (Dona Ana Beach) -its areal is slightly thicker than the beaches in the surrounding area and it is surrounded by striking rock formations. At high tide the beach is split by the geomorphology of the cliffs; * Praia do Canavial (Canavial Beach); * Praia de Camilo (Camilo Beach); * Praia da Luz (Beach of Light) - located in the parish of Luz, the beach is bounded in the east by Rocha Negra (), providing summer vactioners with a popular escape during the summer. * Praia da Balan√ßa- located after Praia da Boneca and Praia dos Pinheiros, it's a sandy cove enclosed by towering cliffs. Sustainable tourism In 2012 Lagos received the QualityCoast Gold Award for its efforts to become a sustainable tourism destination.

It is surrounded along its borders by the municipalities of Vila do Bispo (to the west), Aljezur (to the northwest), Monchique (to the northeast) and Portim√£o (to the east). To the north of Lagos is the road to Silves, the first capital of Algarve, Monchique (spa town/mountain), Milfontes, a coastal town and port/harbour of the city of Sines, that winds through the scenic protected landscape of the Southwest Natural Park (Costa Sudoeste Alentejana e Vicentina). Administratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (freguesias): * Bensafrim e Bar√£o de S√£o Jo√£o * Lagos (S√£o Sebasti√£o e Santa Maria) * Luz which includes the separate villages of Alm√°dena and Espiche. * Odi√°xere =Twin towns ‚Äî Sister cities= Lagos is twinned with: * Torres Vedras, district of Lisbon, Portugal * Ribeira Grande, island of S√£o Miguel, Azores * Ribeira Grande de Santiago, island of Santiago, Cape Verde * Palos de la Frontera, autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain * Ksar El Kebir, city in the province of Larache, Morocco * Sassenheim, town in the province of South-Holland, Netherlands Economy Lagos's marina Lagos' economy, like many coastal towns in Portugal, has always been closely linked to the sea, and fishing has been an important activity since very ancient times. Since 1960, the city has embraced tourism, which has become its most important economic activity. It has beautiful beaches, good climate, the sea, a scenic coastline, and historical patrimony. The Marina de Lagos has 460 berths and has become an important centre for long-distance cruisers, and it is also known for its modern drawbridge. Lagos also has numerous cultural and night-life entertainment venues. Lagos Station is the western terminus of the Linha do Algarve railway line, which connects Lagos to Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio (via Faro and Tavira). The passenger train service is operated by Comboios de Portugal (CP). Connections are available at Tunes for trains to Lisbon and Porto.

The ethnographic section includes exhibits from life in the Algarve, that includes not only residential, but also military artefacts, such as swords, muskets and cannonballs, and the foral (charter) issued by King Manuel for Lagos. Religious artefacts are also prominent in the displays, that include the sacerdotal vestments worn by the canons who said Holy Mass to King Sebastian (before he left on his ill-fated conquest of Morocco), and a diptych (dating from the 16th century) with scenes from the Annunciation and Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. * Slave Market/Customshoues of Lagos () Military * Bulwark of Alcaria/Freiras () * Bulwark of Porta dos Quartos () * Bulwark of Santa Maria/Porta da Vila () * Bulwark of S√£o Francisco/Jogo da Bola () * Castle of Senhora da Luz () * Fort of Meia Praia () * Fort of Ponta da Bandeira () - also known as the Forte do Pau da Bandeira, the Forte de Nossa Senhora da Penha de Fran√ßa or the Forte do Registo, the fort, which guarded the entrance to the harbour, was originally dedicated to the Santa Virgem Senhora da Penha de Fran√ßa (to which it was referred).Ponta da Bandeira (or Pau da Bandeira) are actually more recent names given the fortress, named for the area of Lagos on which it is actually located. This squat rectangular fort guards the entrance to the harbour, accessed by a small drawbridge, to terraced spaces (that overlook the town, beach and harbour) and the small chapel (decorated with 17th-century azulejos tile). Until the late 20th century, the fort was used as a service depot for military forces and housed services linked to maritime activities (such as supplies for lifeboats and nautical sports). It was restored between 1958 and 1960, and officially acquired by the municipality of Lagos in 1983, where it was converted into exhibition displays of maritime history, with astrolabes and models of caravels. * Fort of Pinh√£o () * Military Barracks of Lagos () * Musketeers' Workshop/Warehouse and Saddlery () * Regimental Warehouse/Church of S√£o Br√°s () * Tower of Atalaia () * Walled/Tower Fortifications of Lagos () Religious Altar area; Igreja de Santa Maria, September 2019 * Chapel/Hermitage of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista () * Church of Nossa Senhora do Carmo () * Church of Nossa Senhora da Luz () * Church of Odi√°xere () * Church of Santa Maria () * Church of Santo Ant√≥nio () - its simple fa√ßade with the asymmetrical bell towers, date from 1715, and contrast sharply with the extravagantly decorated interior, which is covered in gilded wood carvings and blue-and-white 18th-century azulejo tiles (talha dourada) which fill the walls of the nave, while six Baroque paintings by Jos√© Joaquim Rasquinho, representing the miracles of Saint Anthony are hung on its walls. The wooden vault was painted with a trompe-l'oeil effect, while polychrome statues of cherubs playing with animals and fishes are scattered within the interior. It was one of the few buildings to survive the Great Earthquake of 1755, reconstructed by the local commander of Regimental Infantry, who may have added the polychromatic statue of St. Anthony with military sash.

Source: Brookings Institution A public‚Äìprivate partnership (PPP, 3P, or P3) is a cooperative arrangement between two or more public and private sectors, typically of a long-term nature.Hodge, G.

They are an example of multistakeholder governance which is a key target of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 17. Public‚Äìprivate partnerships have been implemented in multiple countries, are primarily used for infrastructure projects, such as the building and equipping of schools, hospitals, transport systems, and water and sewerage systems. PPPs have been highly controversial as funding tools, largely over concerns that public return on investment is lower than returns for the private funder. PPPs are closely related to concepts such as privatization and the contracting out of government services. The lack of a shared understanding of what a PPP is and the secrecy surrounding their financial details makes the process of evaluating whether PPPs have been successful complex.Hodge, G.A. and Greve, C. (2016), On Public- Private Partnership Performance: A Contemporary Review, Public Works Management & Policy, pp. 1‚Äì24 P3 advocates highlight the sharing of risk and the development of innovation, while critics decry their higher costs and issues of accountability. Evidence of PPP performance in terms of value for money and efficiency, for example, is mixed and often unavailable.Mols, F.

Definition Gavin Newsom hosts a meeting for employers about public-private partnerships - 2019-11-13 There is no consensus about how to define a PPP.Marta Marsilio, M., Cappellaro, G and Cuccurullo, C. (2011), The Intellectual Structure Of Research Into PPPs, Public Management Review, Vol 13 (6), pp.763‚Äì782 The term can cover hundreds of different types of long-term contracts with a wide range of risk allocations, funding arrangements, and transparency requirements. The advancement of PPPs, as a concept and a practice, is a product of the new public management of the late 20th century and globalization pressures. Despite there being no formal consensus regarding a definition, the term has been defined by major entities. For example, The OECD formally defines public- private-partnerships as \\"long term contractual arrangements between the government and a private partner whereby the latter delivers and funds public services using a capital asset, sharing the associated risks\\".OECD (2012), Recommendation of the Council on Principles for Public Governance of Public- Private Partnerships, https://www.oecd.org/governance/budgeting/PPP- Recommendation.pdf The Government of India defines a P3 as \\"a partnership between a public sector entity (sponsoring authority) and a private sector entity (a legal entity in which 51% or more of equity is with the private partner/s) for the creation and/or management of infrastructure for public purpose for a specified period of time (concession period) on commercial terms and in which the private partner has been procured through a transparent and open procurement system.\\" According to Weimer and Vining, \\"A P3 typically involves a private entity financing, constructing, or managing a project in return for a promised stream of payments directly from government or indirectly from users over the projected life of the project or some other specified period of time\\". A 2013 study published in State and Local Government Review found that definitions of public-private partnerships vary widely between municipalities: \\"Many public and private officials tout public- private partnerships for any number of activities, when in truth the relationship is contractual, a franchise, or the load shedding of some previously public service to a private or nonprofit entity.\\" A more general term for such agreements is \\"shared service delivery\\", in which public-sector entities join together with private firms or non-profit organizations to provide services to citizens. JournalistsResource.org, retrieved February 14, 2014 Debate on privatization There is a semantic debate pertaining to whether public‚Äìprivate partnerships constitute privatization or not. Some argue that it isn't \\"privatization\\" because the government retains ownership of the facility and/or remains responsible for public service delivery. Others argue that they exist on a continuum of privatization; P3s being a more limited form of privatization than the outright sale of public assets, but more extensive than simply contracting-out government services. Supporters of P3s generally take the position that P3s do not constitute privatization, while P3 opponents argue that they are. The Canadian Union of Public Employees describes P3s as \\"privatization by stealth\\".  Origins  Governments have used such a mix of public and private endeavors throughout history.Wettenhall, R. (2019), The Public/Private Interface: Surveying the History, in G. Hodge and C. Greve (eds.), The Challenge of Public‚ÄìPrivapppte Partnerships: Learning from International Experience, Cheltenham UK: Edward ElgarWettenhall, R. (2000), Mixes and partnerships through time, in G.A. Hodge, C. Greve and A. Boardman (eds.),International Handbook in Public‚ÄìPrivate Partnerships, Cheltenham UK: Edward Elgar Muhammad Ali of Egypt utilized \\"concessions\\" in the early 1800s to obtain public works for minimal cost while the concessionaires' companies made most of the profits from projects such as railroads and dams. Much of the early infrastructure of the United States was built by what can be considered public-private partnerships. This includes the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike road in Pennsylvania, which was initiated in 1792, an early steamboat line between New York and New Jersey in 1808; many of the railroads, including the nation's first railroad, chartered in New Jersey in 1815; and most of the modern electric grid. In Newfoundland, Robert Gillespie Reid contracted to operate the railways for fifty years from 1898, though originally they were to become his property at the end of the period. However, the late 20th and early 21st century saw a clear trend toward governments across the globe making greater use of various PPP arrangements. This trend seems to have reversed since the global financial crisis of 2008. Pressure to change the standard model of public procurement arose initially from concerns about the level of public debt, which grew rapidly during the macroeconomic dislocation of the 1970s and 1980s. Governments sought to encourage private investment in infrastructure, initially on the basis of accounting fallacies arising from the fact that public accounts did not distinguish between recurrent and capital expenditures. In 1992, the Conservative government of John Major in the UK introduced the PFI, the first systematic program aimed at encouraging public-private partnerships. The 1992 program focused on reducing the public-sector borrowing requirement, although, as already noted, the effect on public accounts was largely illusory. Initially, the private sector was unenthusiastic about PFI, and the public sector was opposed to its implementation. In 1993, the Chancellor of the Exchequer described its progress as \\"disappointingly slow\\". To help promote and implement the policy, he created institutions staffed with people linked with the City of London, accountancy and consultancy firms who had a vested interest in the success of PFI. The Labour government of Tony Blair, elected in 1997, expanded the PFI initiative but sought to shift the emphasis to the achievement of \\"value for money\\", mainly through an appropriate allocation of risk. The PPP unit Partnerships UK was created from the previous pro-PPP institutions within the UK government. This semi-independent organization's mandate was to promote and implement PFI, and was central in making PPPs the \\"new normal\\" for public infrastructure procurements in the country. Multiple countries subsequently created similar PPP units on Partnership UK's model. While initiated in first world countries, PPPs immediately received significant attention in transition economies, as they promised to bring new sources of funding for infrastructure projects, which could translate to job and growth. However, lack of investor rights guarantees, commercial confidentiality laws, dedicated states spending on public infrastructure, and the possibility of staple revenues from user fees made it difficult to implement Public‚Äìprivate partnership in transition economies. The World Bank's Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Forum attempts to mitigate these challenges.  Economic theory  In economic theory, public‚Äìprivate partnerships have been studied through the lens of contract theory. The first theoretical study on PPPs was conducted by Oliver Hart. From an economic theory perspective, what distinguishes a PPP from traditional public procurement of infrastructure services is that in the case of PPPs, the building and operating stages are bundled. Hence, the private firm has strong incentives in the building stage to make investments with regard to the operating stage. These investments can be desirable but may also be undesirable (e.g., when the investments not only reduce operating costs but also reduce service quality). Hence, there is a trade-off, and it depends on the particular situation whether a PPP or traditional procurement is preferable. Hart's model has been extended in several directions. For instance, authors have studied various externalities between the building and operating stages, insurance when firms are risk-averse, and implications of PPPs for incentives to innovate and gather information. Clarence N. Stone frames public‚Äìprivate partnerships as \\"governing coalitions\\". In Regime Politics Governing Atlanta 1946‚Äì1988, he specifically analyzes the \\"crosscurrents in coalition mobilization\\". Government coalitions are revealed as susceptible to a number of problems, primarily corruption and conflicts of interest. This slippery slope is generally created by a lack of sufficient oversight. Corruption and conflicts of interest, in this case, lead to costs of opportunism; other costs related to P3s are production and bargaining costs. Other theoretical approaches Infrastructure PPPs can be understood at five different levels: as a particular project or activity, as a form of project delivery, as a statement of government policy, as a tool of government, or as a wider cultural phenomenon. Different disciplines commonly emphasize different aspects of the PPP phenomena. Engineering and economics primarily take a utilitarian, functional focus emphasizing concerns such as overall project costs and quality compared to traditional ways of delivering large infrastructure projects. In contrast, public administrators and political scientists tend to view PPPs more as a policy brand and a tool for governments to achieve their objectives.Mols, F. (2010) Harnessing Market Competition in PPP Procurement: The Importance of Periodically Taking a Strategic View. Australian Journal of Public Administration, 69(2), 229-244. Funding models A defining aspect of many infrastructure P3s is that most of the up-front financing is bore by the private sector. The way this financing is done differs significantly by country. For P3s in the UK, Bonds are used rather than bank loans. In Canada, P3 projects usually use loans that must be repaid within 5 years, and the projects are refinanced at a later date. In some types of public private partnership, the cost of using the service is borne exclusively by the users of the service‚Äîfor example, by toll road users. In other types (notably the PFI), capital investment is made by the private sector on the basis of a contract with government to provide agreed-on services, and the cost of providing the services is borne wholly or in part by the government. Typically, a private-sector consortium forms a special company called a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) to develop, build, maintain, and operate the asset for the contracted period. In cases where the government has invested in the project, it is typically (but not always) allotted an equity share in the SPV.Moszoro M., Gasiorowski P. (2008), 'Optimal Capital Structure of Public‚ÄìPrivate Partnerships', IMF Working Paper 1/2008. Papers.ssrn.com (2008-01-25). Retrieved on 2011-11-20. The consortium is usually made up of a building contractor, a maintenance company, and one or more equity investors. The two former are typically equity holders in the project, who make decisions but are only repaid when the debts are paid, while the latter is the project's creditor (debt holder). Public infrastructure is a relatively low-risk, high-reward investment, and combining it with complex arrangements and contracts that guarantee and secure the cash flows make PPP projects prime candidates for project financing. The equity investors in SPVs are usually institutional investors such as pension funds, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth and superannuation funds, and banks. Major P3 investors include AustralianSuper, OMERS and Dutch state-owned bank ABN AMRO, which funded the majority of P3 projects in Australia. Wall Street firms have increased their interest in P3s since the 2008 financial crisis. It is the SPV that signs the contract with the government and with subcontractors to build the facility and then maintain it. A typical PPP example would be a hospital building financed and constructed by a private developer and then leased to the hospital authority. The private developer then acts as landlord, providing housekeeping and other non-medical services, while the hospital itself provides medical services. Government sometimes make in kind contributions to a PPP, notably with the transfer of existing assets. In projects that are aimed at creating public goods, like in the infrastructure sector, the government may provide a capital subsidy in the form of a one-time grant so as to make the project economically viable. In other cases, the government may support the project by providing revenue subsidies, including tax breaks or by guaranteed annual revenues for a fixed period. In all cases, the partnerships include a transfer of significant risks to the private sector.. Because P3s are directly responsible for a variety of activities, they can evolve into monopolies motivated by rent-seeking behavior.  Profit sharing  Some public-private partnerships, when the development of new technologies is involved, include profit-sharing agreements. This generally involves splitting revenues between the inventor and the public once a technology is commercialized. Profit-sharing agreements may stand over a fixed period of time or in perpetuity.  Delivery models  There are many types and delivery models of PPPs, the following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the designs: ;Operation & Maintenance Contract (O & M) :A private economic agent, under a government contract, operates a publicly-owned asset for a specific period of time. Formal, ownership of the asset remains with the public entity. In terms of private-sector risk and involvement, this model is on the lower end of the spectrum for both involvement and risk.The Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships, \\"Definitions & Models\\", https://www.pppcouncil.ca/web/P3_Knowledge_Centre/About_P3s/Definitions_Models.aspx ;Build-Finance (BF) :The private actor builds the asset and finances the cost during the construction period, afterwards the responsibility is handed over to the public entity. In terms of private-sector risk and involvement, this model is again on the lower end of the spectrum for both measures. ;Build- Operate-Transfer (BOT) :Build-Operate-Transfer represents a complete integration of the project delivery: the same contract governs the design, construction, operations, maintenance, and financing of the project. After some concessionary period, the facility is transferred back to the owner. ;Build‚Äìown‚Äìoperate‚Äìtransfer (BOOT) :A BOOT structure differs from BOT in that the private entity owns the works. During the concession period, the private company owns and operates the facility with the prime goal to recover the costs of investment and maintenance while trying to achieve a higher margin on the project. BOOT has been used in projects like highways, roads mass transit, railway transport and power generation. ;Build‚Äìown‚Äìoperate (BOO) :In a BOO project ownership of the project remains usually with the project company, such as a mobile phone network. Therefore, the private company gets the benefits of any residual value of the project. This framework is used when the physical life of the project coincides with the concession period. A BOO scheme involves large amounts of finance and long payback period. Some examples of BOO projects come from the water treatment plants. ;Build‚Äìlease‚Äìtransfer (BLT) :Under BLT, a private entity builds a complete project and leases it to the government. In this way the control over the project is transferred from the project owner to a lessee. In other words, the ownership remains by the shareholders but operation purposes are leased. After the expiry of the leasing the ownership of the asset and the operational responsibility is transferred to the government at a previously agreed price. ;Design-Build-Finance-Maintain (DBFM) :\\"The private sector designs, builds and finances an asset and provides hard facility management or maintenance services under a long-term agreement.\\" The owner (usually the public sector) operates the facility. This model is in the middle of the spectrum for private sector risk and involvement. ;Design‚Äìbuild‚Äìfinance‚Äìmaintain-operate (DBFMO) :Design‚Äìbuild‚Äìfinance‚Äìoperate is a project delivery method very similar to BOOT except that there is no actual ownership transfer. Moreover, the contractor assumes the risk of financing until the end of the contract period. The owner then assumes the responsibility for maintenance and operation. This model is extensively used in specific infrastructure projects such as toll roads. The private construction company is responsible for the design and construction of a piece of infrastructure for the government, which is the true owner. Moreover, the private entity has the responsibility to raise finance during the construction and the exploitation period. Usually, the public sector begins payments to the private sector for use of the asset post- construction. This is the most commonly used model in the EU according to the European Court of Auditors.The European Court of Auditors (2018), \\"Special Report: Public-Private Partnerships in the EU: Widespread shortcomings and limited benefits\\", https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR18_09/SR_PPP_EN.pdf ;Design‚Äìbuild‚Äìoperate‚Äìtransfer (DBOT) :This funding option is common when the client has no knowledge of what the project entails. Hence he contracts the project to a company to design, build, operate, and then transfer it. Examples of such projects are refinery constructions. Design-Build- Approacheshttp://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_worli-haji-ali-sea-link-will- be-ready-in-4-years_1402669 ;Design‚Äìconstruct‚Äìmanage‚Äìfinance (DCMF) :A private entity is entrusted to design, construct, manage, and finance a facility, based on the specifications of the government. Project cash flows result from the government's payment for the rent of the facility. Some examples of the DCMF model are prisons or public hospitals. ;Concession :A Concession is a grant of rights, land or property by a government, local authority, corporation, individual or other legal entity.What is a concession agreement?, wisegeek.com Public services such as water supply may be operated as a concession. In the case of a public service concession, a private company enters into an agreement with the government to have the exclusive right to operate, maintain and carry out investment in a public utility (such as a water privatization) for a given number of years.  P3 drivers  There are many drivers for PPPshttp://www.unesco- mars.com/pdf_document/Peccia_et_al._Public_private_partnership_VIII_1_2017_1.pdf. Advocates argue that PPPs enable the public sector to harness the expertise and efficiencies that the private sector can bring to the delivery of certain facilities and services traditionally procured and delivered by the public sector. Critics argue that PPPs are part of an ideological program that seeks to privatize public services for the profits of private entities. Another common driver is that PPPs may be structured so that the public-sector body seeking to make a capital investment does not incur any borrowing; rather, the borrowing is incurred by the private-sector vehicle implementing the project. On PPP projects where the cost of using the service is intended to be borne exclusively by the end-user, or through a lease billed to the government every year during the operation phase of the project, the PPP is, from the public sector's perspective, an \\"off-balance sheet\\" method of financing the delivery of new or refurbished public-sector assets. This driver was particularly important during the 1990s, but has been exposed as an accounting trick designed to make the government of the day appear more fiscally responsible, while offloading the costs of their projects to service users or future governments. In Canada, many auditor generals have condemned this practice, and forced governments to include PPP projects \\"on-balance sheet\\". On PPP projects where the public sector intends to compensate the private sector through availability payments once the facility is established or renewed, the financing is, from the public sector's perspective, \\"on-balance sheet\\". According to PPP advocates, the public sector will regularly benefit from significantly deferred cash flows. This viewpoint has been contested through research that shows that a majority of PPP projects ultimately cost significantly more than traditional public ones.  Associated costs  Research has showed that on average, governments pay more for PPPs projects than for traditional publicly financed projects. This higher cost of P3s is attributed to these systemic factors: *The private sector's higher cost of capital: governments can typically borrow capital at an interest rate lower than any private company ever could. This is because governments have the power of taxation, which guarantees that they will be able to repay their debts. Since lending to governments almost always come at a lower risk than lending to private entities, governments gets better credit and cheaper financing costs for building large infrastructure projects than private finance.Mols, F. (2010). Harnessing market competition in PPP procurement: The importance of periodically taking a strategic view. Australian Journal of Public Administration, 69(2), 229-244 *Transaction costs: P3 contracts are much more complex and extensive than contracts made in traditional publicly financed projects. The negotiation of these contracts require the presence of lawyers on all sides of the table, and can take months to finalize. Barrie Mckenna reports that \\"transaction costs for lawyers and consultants [in P3s] add about 3 per cent to the final bill.\\" *Private profits: Private company that engage in P3s expect a return on investment after the completion of the project. Often, this is paid by the government through tax revenue. Sometimes, private partners manage to overcome these costs and provide a project cheaper for the taxpayers. This can by done by cutting corners, designing the project so as to be more profitable in the operational phase, charging user fees, and/or monetizing aspects of the projects not covered by the contract. For P3 schools in Nova Scotia, this latter aspect has included restricting the use of school walls, fields and grass, and charging after-hours facility access to community groups at 10 times the rate of non-P3 schools. Studies on effectiveness The effectiveness of PPPs as cost-saving or innovation- producing ventures has been called into question by numerous studies. A common problem with PPP projects is that private investors obtained a rate of return that was higher than the government's bond rate, even though most or all of the income risk associated with the project was borne by the public sector. A UK Parliament report underlines that some private investors have made large returns from PPP deals, suggesting that departments are overpaying for transferring the risks of projects to the private sector, one of the Treasury's stated benefits of PPP. A 2008 report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers argued that the comparison between public and private borrowing rates is not fair because there are \\"constraints on public borrowing\\", which may imply that public borrowing is too high, and so PFI projects can be beneficial by not putting debt directly on government books. The fact that PPP debt is not recorded as debt and remains largely \\"off balance sheet\\" has become a major concern. Indeed, keeping the PPP project and its contingent liabilities \\"off balance sheet\\" means that the true cost of the project is hidden. According to the International Monetary Fund, economic ownership of the asset should determine whether to record PPP-related assets and liabilities in the government's or the private corporation's balance sheet is not straightforward. According to a 2018 UN Report Extreme poverty and human rights*, Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 35/19, NYC, 26 September 2019, \\"in terms of costs, private finance is more expensive than public finance, and public-private partnerships can also incur high design, management and transactional costs due to their complexity and the need for external advice\\" See Languille, ‚ÄúPublic-private partnerships in education and health in the global South‚Äù, p. 156; and Germ√† Bel and Xavier Fageda, ‚ÄúWhat have we learned from the last three decades of empirical studies on factors driving local privatization? ‚Äù, Local Government Studies, vol. 43, No. 4 (2017), pp. 503‚Äì511. In addition, negotiations on issues other than traditional procurement can cause project delays of some yearsSee European Court of Auditors, Public-Private Partnerships in the EU, p. 9. In the United Kingdom, it has been found that many private finance initiative programs ran dramatically over budget and have not provided value for money for the taxpayer, with some projects costing more to cancel than to complete. An in- depth study conducted by the National Audit Office of the United KingdomSee United Kingdom, National Audit Office, PF1 and PF2, a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (London, 2018) concluded that the private finance initiative model had proved to be more expensive and less efficient in supporting hospitals, schools, and other public infrastructure than public financing. Contract management is a crucial factor in shared service delivery, and services that are more challenging to monitor or fully capture in contractual language often remain under municipal control. In the 2007 survey of U.S. city managers, the most difficult service was judged to be the operation and management of hospitals, and the least difficult the cleaning of streets and parking lots. The study revealed that communities often fail to sufficiently monitor collaborative agreements or other forms of service delivery: \\"For instance, in 2002, only 47.3% of managers involved with private firms as delivery partners reported that they evaluate that service delivery. By 2007, that was down to 45.4%. Performance monitoring is a general concern from these surveys and in the scholarly criticisms of these arrangements.\\" In Ontario, a 2012 review of 28 projects showed that the costs were on average 16% lower for traditional publicly procured projects than for PPPs. A 2014 report by the Auditor General of Ontario said that the province overpaid by $8 billion through PPPs, which are also known as Alternative Financing and Procurement (AFP)s. A number of Australian studies of early initiatives to promote private investment in infrastructure concluded that in most cases, the schemes being proposed were inferior to the standard model of public procurement based on competitively tendered construction of publicly owned assets.Economic Planning Advisory Commission (EPAC) 1995a,b; House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications Transport and Microeconomic Reform 1997; Harris 1996; Industry Commission 1996; Quiggin 1996 In 2009, the New Zealand Treasury, in response to inquiries by the new National Party government, released a report on PPP schemes that concluded that \\"there is little reliable empirical evidence about the costs and benefits of PPPs\\" and that there \\"are other ways of obtaining private sector finance\\", as well as that \\"the advantages of PPPs must be weighed against the contractual complexities and rigidities they entail\\". Value for money In response to negative findings about P3 projects was the development of formal procedures for the assessment of PPPs in which the focus was on value for money. Heather Whiteside defines \\"Value for money\\" as: > Not to be confused with lower overall project costs, value for money is a > concept used to evaluate P3 private-partner bids against a hypothetical > public sector comparator designed to approximate the costs of a fully public > option (in terms of design, construction, financing, and operations). P3 > value for money calculations consider a range of costs, the exact nature of > which has changed over time and varies by jurisdiction. One thing that does > remain consistent, however, is the favoring of \\"risk transfer\\" to the > private partner, to the detriment of the public sector comparator. Value for money assessment procedures were incorporated into the PFI and its Australian and Canadian counterparts beginning in the late 1990s and early 2000s.A 2012 study showed that value-for-money frameworks were still inadequate as an effective method of evaluating PPP proposals. The problem is that it is unclear what the catchy term \\"value-for-money\\" means in practice and technical detail. A Scottish auditor once called it \\"technocratic mumbo- jumbo\\". More recent reports indicate that P3 represents poor value for money. A treasury select committee stated that 'PFI was no more efficient than other forms of borrowing and it was \\"illusory\\" that it shielded the taxpayer from risk'. One key criticism of P3s, when it comes to value for money, is the lack of transparency surrounding individual projects, which makes it difficult to draft independent value-for-money assessments. Transfer of risk One of the main rationales for P3s is that they provide for a transfer of risk: the Private partner assumes the risks in case of cost overruns or project failures. Methods for assessing value-for-money rely heavily on risk transfers to show the superiority of P3s. However, P3s do not inherently reduce risk, they simply reassign who is responsible, and the Private sector assumes that risk at a cost for the taxpayer. If the value of the risk transfer is appraised too high, then the government is overpaying for P3 projects. Supporters of P3s claim that risk is successfully transferred from public to private sectors as a result of P3, and that the private sector is better at risk management. As an example of successful risk transfer, they cite the case of the National Physical Laboratory. This deal ultimately caused the collapse of the building contractor Laser (a joint venture between Serco and John Laing) when the cost of the complex scientific laboratory, which was ultimately built, was very much larger than estimated. On the other hand, Allyson Pollock argues that in many PFI projects risks are not in fact transferred to the private sector and, based on the research findings of Pollock and others, George Monbiot argues that the calculation of risk in PFI projects is highly subjective, and is skewed to favor the private sector: Following an incident in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh where surgeons were forced to continue a heart operation in the dark following a power cut caused by PFI operating company Consort, Dave Watson from Unison criticized the way the PFI contract operates: Furthermore, assessments ignore the practices of risk transfers to contractors under traditional procurement methods. As for the idea that the private sector is inherently better at managing risk, there has been no comprehensive study comparing risk management by the public sector and by P3s. Auditor Generals of Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick have publicly questioned P3 rationales based on a transfer of risk, the latter stating he was \\"unable to develop any substantive evidence supporting risk transfer decisions\\". Furthermore, many PPP concessions proved to be unstable and required to be renegotiated that favor the contractor.  Accountability and transparency  One of the main criticism of public-private partnerships is the lack of accountability and transparency associated with these projects. Part of the reason why evidence of PPP performance is often unavailable is that most financial details of P3s are under the veil of commercial confidentiality provisions, and unavailable to researchers and the public. Around the world, opponents of P3s have launched judicial procedures to access greater P3 project documentation than the limited \\"bottom line\\" sheets available on the project's websites. When they are successful, the documents they receive are often heavily redacted.

According to a 2007 survey, two primary reasons were expressed: cost reduction (86.7%) and external fiscal pressures, including tax restrictions (50.3%). No other motivations expressed exceeded 16%. In the 2012 survey, however, interest had shifted to the need for better processes (69%), relationship building (77%), better outcomes (81%), leveraging resources (84%), and belief that collaborative service delivery is \\"the right thing to do\\" (86%). Among those surveyed, the provision of public services through contracts with private firms peaked in 1977, at 18%, and has declined since. The most common form of shared service delivery now involves contracts between governments, growing from 17% in 2002 to 20% in 2007. \\"At the same time, approximately 22% of the local governments in the survey indicated that they had brought back in-house at least one service that they had previously provided through some alternative private arrangement.\\" Sectors=Water services Sign at the entrance of the Regina Wastewater Treatment Plant After a wave of privatization of many water services in the 1990s, mostly in developing countries, experiences show that global water corporations have not brought the promised improvements in public water utilities. Instead of lower prices, large volumes of investment, and improvements in the connection of the poor to water and sanitation, water tariffs have increased out of reach of poor households. Water multinationals are withdrawing from developing countries, and the World Bank is reluctant to provide support.the Water Justice Project on Transnational Institute The privatization of the water services of the city of Paris proved to be unwanted, and at the end of 2009 the city did not renew its contract with two of the French water corporations, Suez and Veolia.Reversal of privatization of Paris' water.

In the 2010s, as wastewater treatment plants across North America came of age and needed to be replaced, multiple cities decided to fund the renewal of their water infrastructure through a public-private partnership. Among those cities were Brandenburg, Kentucky, which was the \\"first local government in Kentucky to execute a public-private partnership under legislation passed in 2016\\", and Regina, Saskatchewan, which held a referendum on the plant's funding model. The P3 option won out.\\" Transportation Another major sector for P3s in transportation. Many P3s in the United States have been toll road concessions. Transportation projects have accounted for 1/5 of all P3 projects in Canada. Major transportation P3 projects have included the Confederation Bridge linking Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, the Pocahontas Parkway in Virginia, and the London Underground PPP. Health services For more than two decades, public-private partnerships have been used to finance health infrastructure. In Canada, they comprise 1/3 of all P3 projects nationwide. Governments have looked to the PPP model in an attempt to solve larger problems in health care delivery. However, some health-care-related PPPs have been shown to cost significantly more money to develop and maintain than those developed through traditional public procurement. A health services PPP can be described as a long-term contract (typically 15‚Äì30 years) between a public-sector authority and one or more private-sector companies operating as a legal entity. The government provides purchasing power, outlines goals for an optimal health system, and contracts private enterprise to design, build, maintain, and/or manage the delivery of agreed-upon services over the term of the contract. The private sector receives payment for its services and assumes substantial financial, technical, and operational risk while benefitting from returns on its investments during the operational phase. A criticism of P3s for Hospitals in Canada is that they result in a \\"internal bifurcation of authority\\". This occurs when the facility is operated and maintained by the private sector while the care services are delivered by the public sector. In those cases, the nursing staff cannot request their colleagues from the maintenance staff to clean something (urine, blood, etc.) or to hang workplace safety signs, even if they are standing next to each other, without the approval of the private managers. In the UK, P3s were used to build hospitals for the National Health Service. In 2017 there were 127 PFI schemes in the English NHS. The contracts vary greatly in size. Most include the cost of running services such as facilities management, hospital portering and patient food, and these amount to around 40% of the cost. Total repayments will cost around ¬£2.1 billion in 2017 and will reach a peak in 2029. This is around 2% of the NHS budget. PPP units Public-private partnership units are organizations responsible for promoting, facilitating, and assessing P3s in their territory. They can be government agencies, or semi-independent organizations created with full or part government support. Governments tend to create these units as a response to criticisms of the implementation of P3 projects in their country prior to the creation of the P3 unit. In 2009, 50% of OECD countries had created a centralized PPP unit, and many more of the institutions exist in other countries.  Other types  While long-term infrastructure project compose the bulk of P3 projects worldwide, other types of Public-private partnerships exists to suit different purposes and actors.  Asset monetization  A form of P3 that became prevalent in American cities during the 21st century are asset monetization arrangements. They concerns a city's revenue-generating assets (Parking lots, garage and meters, public lights, toll roads, etc.) and transforms them into financial assets that the city can lease to a private corporation in exchange for operation and maintenance. These deals are usually done during periods of financial distress for the city, and the immediate revenues municipalities receive in these deals is used to pay down the debt or to fill budget holes. The 2014 Detroit bankruptcy deal included many of such Asset Monetization arrangements. Global public‚Äìprivate partnership Global public‚Äìprivate partnership (GPPP) is a governance mechanism to foster public-private partnership (PPP) cooperation between an international intergovernmental organisation like the United Nations and private companies. Existing GPPPs strive, among other things, to increase affordable access to essential drugs in developing countries, and to promote handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhoea.  Market-led proposal  Market-led proposals (MLP) are P3s proposed by the private sectors. MLP policies encourage private sector firms to make unsolicited PPP infrastructure project proposals to the government, instead of putting the onus on the government to propose each project. During the 2010s, MLP policies has been implemented in most Australian states and territories. Amy Sarcevic from Informa Australia notes that \\"to date, market-led proposals have had a relatively high failure rate\\". Partnership with non-profit organizations Public‚Äìprivate partnerships with non-profits and private partners have seen a large increase over the years, in part because local and state governments rely heavily on the growing number of non-profits to provide many public services. Neighborhood organizations or small and local non-profits saw a broad source of funding during the early years, but there has been a shift in funding more recently, reducing the overall funding and seeing more of it go to larger agencies focusing on large grants. With the rise in public‚Äìprivate partnerships, there is also a rise in the responsibility that non-profits tend to hold. With some governments relying on many more of these organizations to provide public services, it is proving difficult for the government to hold non-profits responsible. Too many projects and partnerships can also lead to a lack of accountability. A lack of defined accountability roles can also lead to some taking advantage of others, causing a distrustful partnership. Many partnerships can be terminated early due to issues with trust and cooperation during the contract implementation process. These issues can be avoided when the organization has initial guidelines for dos and don'ts, a continuous commitment to negotiations in times of trouble, and even an outline for termination procedures if necessary. When entering into a cross-sector partnership, problems may arise due to differences between the cultures of government, industry, and non-profits. Items like performance measures, goal measurements, government regulations, and the nature of funding can all be interpreted differently, causing blurred communication. Conflicts can also be related to territorialism or protectionism and a lack of commitment to working within the partnership. A business partnership model would not be accurate or appropriate for a P3. Product development partnership Product development partnerships (PDPs) are a class of public‚Äìprivate partnerships that focus on pharmaceutical product development for diseases of the developing world. These include preventive medicines such as vaccines and microbicides, as well as treatments for otherwise neglected diseases. PDPs were first created in the 1990s to unite the public sector's commitment to international public goods for health with industry's intellectual property, expertise in product development, and marketing. International PDPs work to accelerate the research and development of pharmaceutical products for underserved populations that are not profitable for private companies. They may also be involved in helping plan for access and availability of the products they develop to those in need in their target populations. Publicly financed, with intellectual property rights granted by pharmaceutical industry partners for specific markets, PDPs are less concerned with recouping development costs through the profitability of the products being developed. These not-for-profit organizations combine public- and private-sector interests, with a view toward resolving the specific incentive and financial barriers to increased industry involvement in the development of safe and effective pharmaceutical products.  Public‚Äìprivate‚Äìcommunity partnership  Another model being discussed is the public‚Äìprivate‚Äìcommunity partnership (PPCP), in which both the government and private players work together for social welfare, eliminating the prime focus of private players on profit. This model is being applied more in developing nations such as India.  Social Impact Bond  Social impact bonds (also called Pay for Success bonds) are \\"a public-private partnership which funds effective social services through a performance-based contract\\", according to Social Finance Ltd.'s definition.Social Finance (2016) Social Impact Bonds: The early years They operate over a fixed period of time, but they do not offer a fixed rate of return. Generally, repayment to investors is contingent upon a specified social outcomes being achieved.http://www.socialfinance.org.uk/downloads/SIB_report_web.pdf A similar system, development impact bonds, is being implemented in developing countries.

The Model 59 \\"Shrike\\" was designated XA-8 (the \\"Shrike\\" nickname was not officially adopted). Development The XA-8 won a competition against the General Aviation/Fokker XA-7, after which 13 service test aircraft were ordered (five as YA-8s and eight as Y1A-8s). After the completion of testing, 11 of these aircraft were redesignated A-8. The A-8 was the first Curtiss machine of all-metal low-wing monoplane configuration with advanced features such as automatic leading edge slats and trailing-edge flaps. Four forward-firing .30 in (7.62 mm) machine guns were mounted in the wheel fairings, and an additional weapon of the same calibre was fitted in the observer's cockpit for rear defense. The standard bomb load was four 100 lb (45 kg) bombs. One YA-8 was fitted with a radial engine and designated YA-10, while another was used for testing of the Curtiss V-1570 Conqueror engine as the Y1A-8A. This aircraft was redesignated A-8 upon the completion of testing. 46 aircraft were ordered as A-8Bs, however the order was changed to the Model 60 A-12s before production began. Operational history The A-8 created a sensation in US aviation circles when it went into service with the 3rd Attack Group at Fort Crockett, Texas in April 1932. All other standard aircraft were of biplane configuration, and the first monoplane fighter (the Boeing P-26A) did not become operational until eight months later.

It outlined the history of the Latter Day Saint movement up to that time, and included Mormonism's Articles of Faith. The letter was written in response to Wentworth's inquiry on behalf of one of his friends, George Barstow, who was writing a history of New Hampshire. The letter was first published on March 1, 1842, in the Times and Seasons in Nauvoo, Illinois. A similar letter (with some slight revisions) was published by Daniel Rupp in 1844 in a book called An Original History of the Religious Denominations at Present Existing in the United States. wikisource:The Rupp Letter Significance The Wentworth Letter is significant for several reasons. First, it connects the message of what members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe to be the Restoration with the history of said Restoration: \\"By these things we know...\\" (Doctrine and Covenants 20:1-17) Second, it emphasizes the First Vision as an essential part of Latter-day Saint message. Third, it contains the Standard of Truth, a mission statement for missionaries: ‚ÄúOur missionaries are going forth to different nations . . . the Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.‚Äù (History of the Church 4:540) Fourth, it ends with the statements which later became the Articles of Faith. B. H. Roberts said of these, > ‚ÄúThese Articles of Faith were not produced by the labored efforts and > harmonized contentions of scholastics, but were struck off by one inspired > mind at a single effort to make a declaration of that which is most > assuredly believed by the church, for one making earnest inquiry about the > truth.\\" > \\"The combined directness, perspicuity, simplicity and comprehensiveness of > this statement of the principles of our religion may be relied upon as > strong evidence of a divine inspiration resting upon the Prophet, Joseph > Smith.‚Äù (B. H. Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church, Vol.2, Ch.47, > p.131) And finally, the Wentworth letter re-establishes Joseph Smiths teachings that the Lamanites are the principal ancestors of the American Indians. In the Wentworth letter we read, > \\"They were principally Israelites, of the descendants of Joseph. The > Jaredites were destroyed about the time that the Israelites came from > Jerusalem, who succeeded them in the inheritance of the country. The > principal nation of the second race fell in battle towards the close of the > fourth century. The remnant are the Indians that now inhabit this country.\\" > (Wentworth Letterhttps://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/wlett10.txt) Changes in versions published by the LDS Church The wording of some of the articles was modified in 1851 and 1902: 1\\\\. The fourth article of faith originally read, ‚ÄúWe believe that these ordinances are: 1st. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; 2d. Repentance; 3d. Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; 4th.

The various species are known as currants or gooseberries, and some are cultivated for their edible fruit or as ornamental plants. Ribes is the only genus in the family Grossulariaceae. Description Shrub like plants with marked diversity in strikingly diverse flowers and fruit. Taxonomy Ribes is the single genus in the Saxifragales family Grossulariaceae. Although once included in the broader circumscription of Saxifragaceae sensu lato, it is now positioned as a sister group to Saxifragaceae sensu stricto. Subdivision First treated on a worldwide basis in 1907, the infrageneric classification has undergone many revisions, and even in the era of molecular phylogenetics there has been contradictory evidence. Although sometimes treated as two separate genera, Ribes and Grossularia (Berger 1924), the consensus has been to consider it as a single genus, divided into a number of subgenera, the main ones of which are subgenus Ribes (currants) and subgenus Grossularia (gooseberries), further subdivided into sections. Janczewski (1907) considered six subgenera and eleven sections. Berger's twelve subgenera based on two distinct genera (see Table 1) have subsequently been demoted to sections. Weigend (2007) elevated a number of sections to produce a taxonomy of seven subgenera; Ribes (sections Ribes, Heretiera, Berisia) Coreosma, Calobotrya (sections Calobotrya, Cerophyllum), Symphocalyx, Grossularioides, Grossularia, Parilla. Taxonomy, according to Berger, modified by Sinnott (1985): * Subgenus Ribes L. (currants) 8 sections ** Section Berisia Spach (alpine currants) ** Section Calobotrya (Spach) Jancz. (ornamental currants) ** Section Coreosma (Spach) Jancz. (black currants) ** Section Grossularioides ( Jancz.) Rehd. (spiny or Gooseberry-stemmed currants) ** Section Heritiera Jancz. (dwarf or skunk currants) ** Section Parilla Jancz. (Andine or South American currants) ** Section Ribes L. (red currants) ** Section Symphocalyx Berland. (golden currants) * Subgenus Grossularia (Mill.) Pers. (Gooseberies) 4 sections ** Section Grossularia(Mill.) Nutt. ** Section Robsonia Berland. ** Section Hesperia A.Berger ** Section Lobbia A. Berger Some authors continued to treat Hesperia and Lobbia as subgenera. Early molecular studies suggested that subgenus Grossularia was actually embedded within subgenusRibes. Analysis of combined molecular datasets confirms subgenus Grossularia as a monophyletic group, with two main lineages, sect. Grossularia and another clade consisting of glabrous gooseberies, including Hesperia, Lobbia and Robsonia. Other monophyletic groups identified were Calobotrya, Parilla, Symphocalyx and Berisia. However sections Ribes, Coreosma and Heritiera were not well supported. Consequently, there is insufficient resolution to justify further taxonomic revision. Species There are around 200 species of Ribes. Selected species include: Distribution and habitat Ribes is widely distributed through the Northern Hemisphere, and also extending south in the mountainous areas of South America. Cultivation Ribes speciosum (fuchsia- flowered gooseberry) The genus Ribes includes the edible currants: blackcurrant, redcurrant and white currant, as well as the European gooseberry Ribes uva-crispa and several hybrid varieties. It should not be confused with the dried currants used in cakes and puddings, which are from the Zante currant, a small-fruited cultivar of the grape Vitis vinifera. Ribes gives its name to the popular blackcurrant cordial Ribena. The genus also includes the group of ornamental plants collectively known as the flowering currants, for instance R. sanguineum. There are restrictions on growing some Ribes species in some U.S. states, as they are the main alternate host for white pine blister rust. Historical use Blackfoot Indians used blackcurrant root (Ribes hudsonianum) for the treatment of kidney diseases and menstrual and menopausal problems.

He was one of the first serious collectors of manuscripts of works by Johann Sebastian Bach. Smith is best known for writing the music for \\"The Anacreontic Song\\", which became the tune for the American patriotic song \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" following the War of 1812, and in 1931 was adopted as the national anthem of the United States. Early life and education Smith was baptised in Gloucester Cathedral, England, on 30 March 1750, the son of Martin Smith, organist of Gloucester Cathedral from 1743 to 1782. He attended the Gloucester cathedral school, where he became a boy-singer. He furthered his career as a choir boy at the Chapel Royal, London, and also studied under Dr. William Boyce. Career By the 1770s he had gained a reputation as a composer and an organist. He was elected as a member of the select Anacreontic Society which boasted amongst its membership Samuel Johnson, James Boswell and Sir Joshua Reynolds. In the 1770s, Smith composed music for the society's constitutional song entitled \\"To Anacreon in Heaven\\" (The Anacreontic Song). The words were by Ralph Tomlinson, the president of the society, and were inspired by the 6th-century BC Greek lyric poet, Anacreon, who wrote odes on the pleasures of love and wine. The song became popular in Britain and also America following the establishment of several Anacreontic Societies there. Smith never married. Smith later became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1784, organist for the Chapel Royal in 1802 and Master of the Children in 1805. He also became lay- vicar of Westminster Abbey. He was organist at the Three Choirs Festival held at Gloucester in 1790. Smith is considered to be the first Englishman to be a serious antiquarian and musicologist. He began by publishing A Collection of English Song in 1779, which musicologist Nicholas Temperley called \\"perhaps the first scholarly edition printed in England.\\" Smith's library included the Old Hall Manuscript, Drexel 4175, as well as a copy of Ulm Gesangbuch from 1538 that had belonged to Johann Sebastian Bach. He also collected works that dated back to the 12th century including some Gregorian chants. His publication Musica Antiqua (1812) included musical scores of works by Jacob Obrecht, Adrian Willaert, Jacob Clemens and Crist√≥bal de Morales with historical notes on each piece. According to Vincent Duckles, Smith's major contribution was \\"to direct the attention of his readers to the importance of source studies.\\" Death John Stafford Smith's memorial in Gloucester Cathedral Smith died in 1836 at the age of eighty-six, his death allegedly caused by a grape-pip lodged in his windpipe. He was buried at St Luke's Church, Chelsea, and has a memorial plaque in Gloucester Cathedral, above which are displayed the US and UK's flags. Legacy=National anthem of the United States In 1814, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\" (later re-titled, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\") which was later set to the tune of \\"Anacreon\\", a piece composed by Smith. The US Congress officially designated this song as the US national anthem in 1931.

J & J Snack Foods Corporation once licensed the brand name for Barq's Floatz ice cream squeeze tubes. History Historical Marker at Edward Barq's Pop Factory, Biloxi, Mississippi, USA The Barq's Brothers Bottling Company was founded in 1890 in the French Quarter of New Orleans, by Edward Charles Edmond Barq and his older brother, Gaston. The Barq Brothers bottled carbonated water and various soft drinks of their own creation. Early on, their most popular creation was an orange-flavored soda called Orangine. Edward Barq moved to Biloxi, Mississippi in 1897 with his new wife. The following year he opened the Biloxi Artesian Bottling Works. Eighteen ninety- eight is often given as the debut year for what was later to be known as \\"Barq's root beer,\\" but some sources say this particular product was not produced until some two years later. It was on the Mississippi coast that Barq met and employed a young boy, Jesse Robinson. Robinson was mentored by Barq and later moved to New Orleans to find his fortune. In 1934 Edward Barq, Sr. and Robinson signed a contractual agreement on Barq's product rights. The agreement was unique from other franchises in many aspects. For one thing, Robinson was allowed to make his own concentrate. The two men remained close their entire lives, working on flavors and production challenges. A distinctive difference between the Biloxi-based root beer and the Louisiana's was that the Louisiana bottle was printed in red (versus Biloxi's blue). This was to distinguish ownership of bottles as blue labeled ones were returned to Mississippi and vice versa. There were also regional taste differences between the various Barq's bottlers. While there may have been minor formula differences, water generally defined these differences. For many decades, Barq's was not marketed as a \\"root beer\\". This was in part a desire to avoid legal conflict with the Hires Root Beer company, which was attempting to claim a trademark on the term \\"root beer\\". It was also due to differences from other root beers at the time. The formulation was sarsaparilla-based, contained less sugar, had a higher carbonation, and less of a foamy head than other brands. The traditional slogan was the simple affirmation \\"Drink Barq's. It's good\\" which first appeared on the classic diamond-necked bottle, patented in 1935 by Ed Barq. In 1976, the Biloxi Barq's Company was purchased from the third generation of Barq family members by John Oudt and John Koerner. An aggressive television campaign was developed based on the \\"Barq's Got Sparks\\" theme. Their plans to market the brand nationally were complicated by the existence of the Louisiana-based Barq's companies which were owned and operated by Robinson's heirs. There were extended legal conflicts over the rights and ownership of the trademark Barq's, Barq's Sr. and Barq's Root Beer. The legal battle went all the way to the United States Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit, which ruled in favor of the Robinson heirs. The last family-held Louisiana Barq's was sold by Robinson's heirs to Coca-Cola in 2000. In 1990, Barq's partnered with the Pick N Save grocery store in Dekalb, Illinois to create the World's Largest Root Beer Float. It was mixed in an above ground swimming pool in the parking lot and consisted of 1,500 gallons of Barq's root beer and 1,000 gallons of vanilla ice cream. Since 1995, Barq's has marketed with the slogan \\"Barq's has bite!\\" This slogan has been featured in numerous television advertisements since its inception. These ads would typically feature a Barq's salesman (played by Nick Swardson) going door-to-door to tell people, \\"Barq's has bite\\" at which point the subjects would take a sip and have an energetic reaction. Regular Barq's has 22.5 mg of caffeine per 12 ounce serving (similar to green tea), while Diet Barq's has no caffeine. Barq's also contains sodium benzoate as a flavor protectant, which under the right conditions, is a precursor to the known carcinogen benzene. The Barq's that is dispensed from Coca-Cola Freestyle machines is caffeine-free.Statement by Coca-Cola on Facebook 16 January 2016. Retrieved 25 May 2016.Ingredient list on Barq's Freestyle cartridge This is because the system uses the same concentrated, microdosed ingredient for both Barq's and Diet Barq's; the only difference between the two is the sweetener that is added. It is also common for Barq's that is sold in the state of Utah to be caffeine-free because many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints avoid caffeinated beverages.

A large, deciduous tree, it is essentially a montane species, growing at elevations up to 1500 m, preferring sites with moist soils and high humidity.Heybroek, H. M., Goudzwaard, L, Kaljee, H. (2009). Iep of olm, karakterboom van de Lage Landen (:Elm, a tree with character of the Low Countries). KNNV, Uitgeverij. The tree can form pure forests in Scandinavia and occurs as far north as latitude 67¬∞N at Beiarn in Norway, and has been successfully introduced as far north as Troms√∏, Norway and Alta, Norway (70¬∞N). Wych elm has also been successfully introduced to Narsarsuaq, near the southern tip of Greenland (61¬∞N). The tree was by far the most common elm in the north and west of the British Isles and is now acknowledged as the only indisputably British native elm species. Owing to its former abundance in Scotland, the tree is occasionally known as the Scotch or Scots elm; Loch Lomond is said to be a corruption of the Gaelic Lac Leaman interpreted by some as 'Lake of the Elms', 'leaman' being the plural form of leam or lem, 'elm'.Richens, R. H. (1983). Elm. Cambridge University Press. However, this is contested; the correct Gaelic name considered Loch Laomainn, its origin obscure. Closely related species, such as Bergmann's elm U. bergmanniana and Manchurian elm U. laciniata, native to northeast Asia, were once sometimes included in U. glabra;Elwes, H. J. & Henry, A. (1913).

H., Elm (Cambridge 1983), p.279 Etymology The word \\"wych\\" (also spelled \\"witch\\") comes from the Old English wice, meaning pliant or supple, which also gives definition to wicker and weak. Jacob George Strutt's 1822 book, _Sylva Britannica_ attests that the Wych Elm was sometimes referred to as the \\"Wych Hazel\\". Full text of expanded 1830 edition. (not to be confused with Hamamelis wych hazels). Classification=Subspecies Some botanists, notably Lindquist (1931), have proposed two subspecies: * U. g. subsp. glabra in the south of the species' range, with broad leaves, trees often with a short, forked trunk and a low, broad crown * U. g. subsp. montana (Stokes) Lindqvist in the north of the species' range (northern Britain, Scandinavia), the leaves are narrower, trees commonly with a long single trunk and a tall, narrow crown.bioportal.naturalis.nl L.1587168 Ulmus glabra Huds. subsp. montana (Stokes) Lindq., Thirsk, Yorkshire, 1937 However, similar structures and leaves are found on wych elms in Italy, much further to the south.U. glabra bioportal.naturalis.nl, specimen L.1582132, Vallombrosa, Tuscany Much overlap is seen between populations with these characters, and the distinction may owe to environmental influence, rather than genetic variation; the subspecies are not accepted by Flora Europaea.Flora Europaea: Ulmus glabra Description The type sometimes reaches heights of 40 m, typically with a broad crown where open-grown, supported by a short bole < 2 m. diameter at breast height (DBH). Normally, root suckers are not seen; natural reproduction is by seed alone. The tree is notable for its very tough, supple young shoots, which are always without the corky ridges or 'wings' characteristic of many elms. The alternate leaves are deciduous, 6-17 cm long by 3-12 cm broad, usually obovate with an asymmetric base, the lobe often completely covering the short (<5 mm) petiole; the upper surface is rough. Leaves on juvenile or shade-grown shoots sometimes have three or more lobes near the apex.Coleman, M (ed.). (2009). Wych Elm. Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. . The perfect hermaphrodite flowers appear before the leaves in early spring, produced in clusters of 10-20; they are 4 mm across on 10 mm long stems, and being wind-pollinated, are apetalous. The fruit is a winged samara 20 mm long and 15 mm broad, with a single, round, 6 mm seed in the centre, maturing in late spring.Bean, W. J. (1981).

HMSO, London, UK. it is less favoured as a host by the elm bark beetles, which act as vectors. Research in Spain has indicated the presence of a triterpene, alnulin, rendering the tree bark less attractive to the beetle than the field elm, though at 87 Œºg/g dried bark, its concentration is not as effective as in Ulmus laevis (200 Œºg/g).Mart√≠n-Benito D., Concepci√≥n Garc√≠a-Vallejo M., Alberto Pajares J., L√≥pez D. 2005. Triterpenes in elms in Spain. Can. J. For. Res. 35: 199-205 (2005). Moreover, once the tree is dying, its bark is quickly colonized by the fungus Phoma, which radically reduces the amount of bark available for the beetle to breed on.Webber, J. (1980). A natural biological control of Dutch elm disease. Nature, 292, 449-451 In European trials, clones of apparently resistant trees were inoculated with the pathogen, causing 85 - 100% wilting, resulting in 68% mortality by the following year. DNA analysis by Cemagref (now Irstea) in France has determined the genetic diversity within the species is very limited, making the chances of a resistant tree evolving rather remote.Solla et al. (2005). Screening European Elms for Resistance to Ophiostoma novo-ulmi. Forest Science, 134-141\\\\. 51 (2) 2005. Society of American Foresters. The Swedish Forest Tree Breeding Association at K√§llstorp produced triploid and tetraploid forms of the tree, but these proved no more resistant to Dutch elm disease than the normal diploid form.Went, J. (1954). The Dutch Elm Disease - Summary of fifteen years' hybridization and selection work (1937-1952). European Journal of Plant Pathology. 02(1954); 60(2): 109-1276. In trials conducted in Italy, the tree was found to have a slight to moderate susceptibility to elm yellows, and a high susceptibility to the elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola . Cultivation The wych elm is moderately shade-tolerant, but requires deep, rich soils as typically found along river valleys.Edlin, H. L. (1949). British woodland trees. Batsford, London. However, the species is intolerant of flooding, as it is of prolonged drought.CAB International (2005) Forestry Compendium. CAB International, Wallingford, UK Although rarely used as a street tree owing to its shape, it can be surprisingly tolerant of urban air pollution, constricted growing conditions, and severe pollarding. As wych elm does not sucker from the roots, and any seedlings are often consumed by uncontrolled deer populations, regeneration is very restricted, limited to sprouts from the stumps of young trees. The resultant decline has been extreme, and the wych elm is now uncommon over much of its former range. It is best propagated from seed or by layering stooled stock plants, although softwood cuttings taken in early June will root fairly reliably under mist.Beckett, K. & G. (1979). Planting Native Trees and Shrubs. Jarrold & Sons, Norwich, UK. Wych elm was widely planted in Edinburgh in the 19th century as a park and avenue tree, and despite losses, it remains abundant there, regenerating through seedlings.Coleman, Max, ed., Wych Elm (Edinburgh, 2009) It was introduced to New England in the 18th century, to Canada (as U. montana at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa) canadiantreetours.org and Australia in the 19th century.Spencer, Roger, ed., Horticultural Flora of South-Eastern Australia, Vol. 2 (Sydney, 1995), Ulmus, p. 103-118 File:Gardens, Princes Street, Edinburgh - DSC06170.JPGWych elms flanking the Scott Monument, Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh, 2010 File:Ulmus glabra.

The bosses on old trees produce the characteristic fissures and markings of 'burr elm' wood.Coleman, Max, ed., Wych Elm (Royal Botanic Garden publications, Edinburgh, 2009) Bosses fringed with shoots are burrs, whereas unfringed bosses are burls.

It was good for the nerves, the chest, the stomach ‚Äî what can I say? ‚Äî it was a true panacea.\\"Gaston de L√©vis, Souvenirs et portraits, 1780-1789, 1813, p. 240 It was this so-called \\"pyramidal elm bark\\" about which Michel-Philippe Bouvart famously quipped \\"Take it, Madame... and hurry up while it [still] cures.\\" It still appeared in a pharmacopeia of 1893. Notable trees E. M. Forster cites a particular wych elm, one that grew at his childhood home of Rooks Nest, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, 16 times in his novel Howards End. This tree overhangs the house of the title and is said to have a \\"...girth that a dozen men could not have spanned...\\" Forster describes the tree as \\"...a comrade, bending over the house, strength and adventure in its roots.\\" The wych elm of the novel had pigs' teeth embedded in the trunk by country people long ago and it was said that chewing some of the bark could cure toothache. In keeping with the novel's epigraph, \\"Only connect...\\", the wych elm may be seen by some as a symbol of the connection of humans to the earth. Margaret Schlegel, the novel's protagonist, fears that any \\"....westerly gale might blow the wych elm down and bring the end of all things...\\" The tree is changed to a chestnut in the 1991 film adaptation of Howards End. The UK Champion listed in the Tree Register of the British Isles is at Brahan in the Scottish Highlands;The Brahan Elm, forestry.gov.uk it has a girth of 703 cm (2.23 m DBH) and a height of 24 m . Possibly the oldest specimen in England was found in 2018 in a field north of Hopton Castle in Shropshire. Coppiced long ago, its bole girth measured 6.3 m in 2018. The oldest specimen in Edinburgh (2016) is believed to be the tree (girth 5.2 m) in the former grounds of Duddingston House, now Duddingston Golf Course.CEC information; tree may be seen on Google Streetview, beside Cavalry Park Drive, E. of Holy Rood High School. Other notable specimens in Edinburgh are to be found in Learmonth Gardens and The Meadows.Edinburgh Wych-elm photographs In Europe, a large tree planted in 1620 grows at Bergemolo, 5 km south of Demonte in Piedmont, Italy (bole-girth 6.2 m, 2.0 m DBH, height 26 m., 2008).Association of Nature Patriarchs in Italy: Piemonte - Olmo di Bergemolo, access-date: November 23, 2016 Other ancient specimens grow at Styria, in Austria, and at Grenzhammer, Germany (see Gallery). In 1998, over 700 healthy, mature trees were discovered on the upper slopes of Mount ≈†imonka in Slovakia, but they are believed to have survived courtesy of their isolation from disease-carrying beetles rather than any innate resistance; 50 clones of these trees were presented to the Prince of Wales for planting at his Highgrove Estate, and at Clapham, Yorkshire .

Duddingston, Edinburgh (2).jpgThe Duddingston elm (girth 5.2 m), Edinburgh Cultivars About 40 cultivars have been raised, although at least 30 are now probably lost to cultivation as a consequence of Dutch elm disease and/or other factors: NB: 'Exoniensis', Exeter Elm, has traditionally been classified as a form of U. glabra, but its identity is now a matter of contention. Hybrids and hybrid cultivars U. glabra hybridises naturally with U. minor, producing elms of the Ulmus √ó hollandica group, from which have arisen a number of cultivars: However, hybrids of U. glabra and U. pumila, the Siberian elm, have not been observed in the field and only achieved in the laboratory, though the ranges of the two species, the latter introduced by man, overlap in parts of Southern Europe, notably Spain. A crossing in Russia of U. glabra and U. pumila produced the hybrid named Ulmus √ó arbuscula. Hybrids with U. glabra in their ancestry have featured strongly in recent artificial hybridization experiments in Europe, notably at Wageningen in the Netherlands, and a number of hybrid cultivars have been commercially released since 1960. The earlier trees were raised in response to the initial Dutch elm disease pandemic that afflicted Europe after the First World War, and were to prove vulnerable to the much more virulent strain of the disease that arrived in the late 1960s. However, further research eventually produced several trees effectively immune to disease, which were released after 1989. *Arno, Clusius, Columella, Commelin, Den Haag, Dodoens, Groeneveld, Homestead, Lobel, Nanguen = , Pioneer, Plinio, Regal, San Zanobi, Urban, Wanoux = .

It generally is considered to include ca 7 genera and about 45 species. Some classifications also include the genus Ampelocera. Description The family is a group of evergreen or deciduous trees and shrubs with mucilaginous substances in leaf and bark tissue. Leaves are usually alternate on the stems. The leaf blades are simple (not compound), with entire (smooth) or variously toothed margins, and often have an asymmetrical base. The flowers are small and either bisexual or unisexual. The fruit is an indehiscent samara, nut, or drupe. Ulmus provides important timber trees mostly for furniture, and U. rubra, the slippery elm, is a medicinal plant known for the demulcent property of its inner bark. Planera aquatica is also a timber species. Planera, Ulmus, and Zelkova are all grown as ornamental trees.

Previously included either in the elm family (Ulmaceae) or a separate family, Celtidaceae, the APG III system places Celtis in an expanded hemp family (Cannabaceae). The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the unrelated Ziziphus lotus. Description Celtis species are generally medium-sized trees, reaching tall, rarely up to tall. The leaves are alternate, simple, long, ovate-acuminate, and evenly serrated margins. Diagnostically, Celtis can be very similar to trees in the Rosaceae and other rose motif families. Small flowers of this monoecious plant appear in early spring while the leaves are still developing. Male flowers are longer and fuzzy. Female flowers are greenish and more rounded. The fruit is a small drupe in diameter, edible in many species, with a dryish but sweet, sugary consistency, reminiscent of a date.

They are a regular feature of arboreta and botanical gardens, particularly in North America. Chinese hackberry (C. sinensis) is suited for bonsai culture, while a magnificent specimen in Daegu-myeon is one of the natural monuments of South Korea. Some, including common hackberry (C. occidentalis) and C. brasiliensis, are honey plants and pollen source for honeybees of lesser importance. Hackberry wood is sometimes used in cabinetry and woodworking. The berries of some, such as Celtis douglasii, are edible, and were consumed by the Mescalero Apaches. Lepidoptera Celtis species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera.

The robots move and make noise (generally a recorded speech or song), but are usually fixed to whatever supports them. They can sit and stand but usually cannot walk. An Audio-Animatronic is different from an android-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics. History Pierre, a talking parrot in The 231x231px 188x188px Audio-Animatronics were originally a creation of Walt Disney employee Lee Adams, who worked as an electrician at the Burbank studio and was one of Disney's original Imagineers. One of the first Disney Audio-Animatrons was a toy bird Walt Disney got in New Orleans. It was a simple mechanical bird, and Walt decided to improve the device that moved it. Another was a \\"dancing man\\", created by Roger Broggie and Wathel Rogers. The dancing man was modeled after a tap dancing routine by actor Buddy Ebsen. The term \\"Audio-Animatronics\\" was first used commercially by Disney in 1961, was filed as a trademark in 1964, and was registered in 1967. Perhaps the most impressive of the early Audio-Animatronics efforts was The Enchanted Tiki Room, which opened in 1963 at Disneyland. It is a room full of tropical creatures with eye and facial actions synchronized to a musical score entirely by electromechanical means. The \\"cast\\" of the musical revue uses tones recorded on tape to vibrate a metal reed that closes a circuit to trigger a relay, which sends a pulse of electricity to a mechanism that causes a pneumatic valve to move part of the figure. The movements of the attraction's birds, flowers, and tiki idols are triggered by sound. Figures' movements have a neutral \\"natural resting position\\" that the limb or part returns to when there is no electric pulse present. Other than this, the animation is a digital system, with only on/off moves, such as an open or closed eye. Other early Audio-Animatrons were at the 1964 New York World's Fair. They were used in the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln exhibit at the State of Illinois Pavilion, Pepsi/UNICEF's \\"it's a small world\\" exhibit, General Electric's Carousel of Progress, and Ford Motor Company's \\"Magic Skyway.\\" An Audio- Animatronic robin sang a duet with Julie Andrews in the 1964 film Mary Poppins. Technology Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland220x220px Pneumatic actuators are powerful enough to move heavier objects like simulated limbs, while hydraulics are used more for large figures. On/off type movement would cause an arm to be lifted (for example) either up over an animatron's head or down next to its body, but with no halting or change of speed in between. To create more realistic movement in large figures, an analog system was used. This gave the figures' body parts a full range of fluid motion, rather than only two positions. To permit a high degree of freedom, the control cylinders resemble typical miniature pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, but mount the back of the cylinder on a ball joint and threaded rod. This ball joint permits the cylinders to float freely inside the frame, such as when the wrist joint rotates and flexes. Disney's technology is not infallible however; the oil-filled cylinders do occasionally drip or leak. It is sometimes necessary to do makeup touch-up work, or to strip the clothing off a figure due to leaking fluids inside. The Tiki Room remains a pneumatic theatrical set, primarily due to the leakage concerns; Disney does not want hydraulic fluids dripping down onto the audience during a show. Because each individual cylinder requires its own control channel, the original Audio-Animatronic figures were relatively simple in design, to reduce the number of channels required. For example, the first human designs (referred to internally by Disney as series A-1) included all four fingers of the hand as one actuator. It could wave its hand but it could not grasp or point at something. With modern digital computers controlling the device, the number of channels is virtually unlimited, allowing more complex, realistic motion. The current versions (series A-100) now have individual actuators for each finger. Disney also introduced a brand new figure that is used in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and is referred to as the A1000. Compliance Compliance is a new technology that allows faster, more realistic movements without sacrificing control. In the older figures, a fast limb movement would cause the entire figure to shake in an unnatural way. The Imagineers thus had to program slower movements, sacrificing speed in order to gain control. This was frustrating for the animators, who, in many cases, wanted faster movements. Compliance improves this situation by allowing limbs to continue past the points where they are programmed to stop; they then return quickly to the \\"intended\\" position, much as real organic body parts do. The various elements also slow to a stop at their various positions, instead of using the immediate stops that caused the unwanted shaking. This absorbs shock, much like the shock absorbers on a car or the natural shock absorption in a living body. Cosmetics The skin of an Audio-Animatronic is made from silicone rubber. Because the neck is so much narrower than the rest of the skull, the skull skin cover has a zipper up the back to permit easy removal. The facial appearance is painted onto the rubber, and standard cosmetic makeup is also used. Over time, the flexing causes the paint to loosen and fall off, so occasional makeup work and repainting are required. Generally as the rubber skin flexes, the stress causes it to dry and begin to crack. Figures that do not have a high degree of motion flexibility, such as the older A-1 series for President Lincoln, may only need to have their skin replaced every ten years. The most recent A-100 series human AAs, like the figure for President Barack Obama, also include flexion actuators that move the cheeks and eyebrows to permit more realistic expressions; however, the skin wears out more quickly and needs replacement at least every five years. The wig on each human AA is made from natural human hair for the highest degree of realism, although using real hair creates its own problems, since the changing humidity and constant rapid motions of the moving AA carriage hardware throughout the day cause the hair to slowly lose its styling, requiring touch-ups before each day's showing. Autonomatronics Autonomatronics is a registered trademark for a more advanced Audio-Animatronic technology, also created by Walt Disney Imagineers. The original Audio-Animatrons used hydraulics to operate robotic figures to present a pre-programmed show. This more sophisticated technology can include cameras and other sensors feeding signals to a high-speed computer which processes the information and makes choices about what to say and do. In September 2009, Disney debuted \\"Otto\\", the first interactive figure that can hear, see and sense actions in the room. Otto can hold conversations and react to the audience. In December 2009, Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln returned to Disneyland using the new Autonomatronics technology. Stuntronics In June 2018, it was revealed that Disney Imagineering had created autonomous, self- correcting aerial stunt robots called stuntronics. This new extension of animatronics utilizes onboard sensors for precision control of advanced robotics to create animatronic human stunt doubles that can perform advanced aerial movements, such as flips and twists. Variations 233x233px The technology of the AAs at Disney's theme parks around the world vary in their sophistication. They range from the blinking and mouth movements at Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room to full body movement, from the mouth to the tip of the fingers at Stitch's Great Escape! at the Magic Kingdom. Current technologies have paved the way for more elaborate AA figures, such as President Donald Trump in The Hall of Presidents, ‚ÄúUrsula head\\" inside the Mermaid Lagoon Theater at Tokyo DisneySea, the Indiana Jones figures inside the Indiana Jones attractions at both Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, the \\"swordfighting\\" pirates inside Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland Park (Paris), the \\"lava/rock monster\\" inside Journey to the Center of the Earth at Tokyo DisneySea, the \\"Na'vi Shaman of Songs\\" inside the Na'vi River Journey, the dinosaurs inside DINOSAUR, and the \\"Yeti\\" inside Expedition Everest at Disney's Animal Kingdom (though the latter has been non-functional since 2008, using a strobe light to simulate movement of the still figure, referred to by fans as \\"Disco Yeti\\"), or the Roz figure inside Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue! at Disney California Adventure Park. The Roz figure is able to \\"interact\\" with guests with help from an unseen ride operator who chooses pre- recorded messages for Roz to \\"speak\\", thereby seeming to \\"react\\" to individual guests' unique appearances and clothing. Mr. Potato Head outside of the Toy Story Mania! attractions at the Disney California Adventure and Disney's Hollywood Studios parks does the same. One of the newest figures comes with changes to the classic Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom, both now featuring characters from the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. The Jack Sparrow figure is based on the actor that portrays him, Johnny Depp, and features his voice and facial mold. So far, the newest and most advanced Audio-Animatronic figure is Abraham Lincoln at The Disneyland Story: Featuring Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln at Disneyland. Lincoln can move his lips to form words, can make dramatic movements, and can portray emotions to match the words he is saying. The Audio-Animatronic Indiana Jones figures inside Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull at Tokyo DisneySea resemble actor Harrison Ford, unlike the original figures found at the Disneyland version, Temple of the Forbidden Eye. In 2010, some of the Audio-Animatronic figures at the Disneyland version were replaced with more technically advanced figures that also look more like Ford. The Audio-Animatronics formerly featured in the Great Movie Ride used the likeness of the actors that portrayed the characters. Audio-Animatronics found in Magic Kingdom's Seven Dwarfs Mine Train are Disney's latest animatronic technology and use projections as faces to make the dwarfs' mouths move and their eyes blink. These Audio-Animatronics were succeeded by the figures in use in the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge lands at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2019, such as Hondo Ohnaka in the Millennium Falcon ‚Äì Smugglers Run attraction. These new figures, known as A-1000 Animatronics, have a fully functional face, featuring a full range of motion in the eyes and mouth. In popular culture * Less-sophisticated forms of audio-animatronics also gained popularity in the 1980s through use at family entertainment centers such as Showbiz Pizza Place and Chuck E. Cheese's. At Showbiz, The Rock-afire Explosion band was made by Aaron Fechter and Creative Engineering, who also made other animatronic characters and arcade redemption games. They are also used in film and television special effects. * Several passengers and the crew of a Pioneer Zephyr are represented in a display of this historic train at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. Neatly dressed in the proper style of first class passengers of their era, one remarks upon the casual dress of the visitors. * The George Washington Masonic National Memorial features an animatronic George Washington. * John Wardley is often said to have brought animatronics to the United Kingdom, utilizing a concept called Ramped Movement, which allowed for smoother movements of the figures. John appeared on Tomorrow's World in the 1970s showing a guitar playing animatronic programmed to music. His first project was the creation of the animated show \\"50 Glorious Years\\" for Tussaud's \\"Royalty and Empire Exhibition\\" at Windsor. * Scissor Sisters member Ana Matronic named herself after animatronics, as a homage to her love of The Bionic Woman. * The Pennsylvania Lottery uses an animatronic groundhog named Gus (who refers to himself as the \\"second-most- famous groundhog in Pennsylvania\\", after Punxsutawney Phil) as the mascot for television commercials for their instant scratch-off games. * The 2015 Disney film Tomorrowland uses the Audio-Animatronics word as a term for their sophisticated android characters.

Tyrannosaurus at London's Natural History Museum RoboThespian at France's Futuroscope Animatronics refers to mechatronic puppets. They are a modern variant of the automaton and are often used for the portrayal of characters in films and in theme park attractions. Before the term \\"animatronics\\" became common, they were usually referred to as \\"robots\\". Since then, robots have become known as more practical programmable machines that do not necessarily resemble living creatures. Robots (or other artificial beings) designed to convincingly resemble humans are known as \\"androids\\". Animatronics is a multi-disciplinary field which integrates puppetry, anatomy and mechatronics. Animatronic figures can be implemented using both computer control and human control, including teleoperation. Motion actuators are often used to imitate muscle movements and create realistic motions in limbs. Figures are usually covered with body shells and flexible skins made of hard and soft plastic materials and finished with details like colors, hair and feathers and other components to make the figure more lifelike.  Etymology  Animatronics is a portmanteau of animate and electronics. West Edmonton Mall's fire-breathing dragon animatronic (1999 - 2014) The term Audio-Animatronics was coined by Walt Disney in 1961 when he started developing animatronics for entertainment and film. Audio-Animatronics does not differentiate between animatronics and androids. Autonomatronics was also defined by Disney Imagineers, to describe a more advanced Audio- Animatronic technology featuring cameras and complex sensors to process information around the character's environment and respond to that stimulus.  Timeline  The Enchanted Tiki Room Tyrannosaurus animatronic, the largest one of its kind built to date, used for Jurassic Park     * *2005: Engineered arts produced the first version of their animatronic actor, RoboThespian   History =Origins in automata Animatronics stand in a very long tradition of mechanical automata, that could be powered by for instance hydraulics, pneumatics or clockwork. Early descriptions are found in Greek mythology and ancient Chinese writings. The oldest extant examples date to the 16th century.  Modern attractions  Sparko the Robot Dog from 1940s The first animatronics characters to be displayed to the public were a dog and a horse. Each were the attraction at two separate spectacles during the 1939 New York World's Fair. Sparko, The Robot Dog, pet of Elektro the Robot, performs in front of the public at the 1939 New York World's Fair but Sparko is not like normal robots. Sparko represents a living animal, thus becoming the very first modern day animatronic character, along with an unnamed horse which was reported to gallop realistically. The animatronic galloping horse was also on display at the 1939 World's Fair, in a different exhibit than Sparko's. Walt Disney is often credited for popularizing animatronics for entertainment after he bought an animatronic bird while he was vacationing, although it is disputed whether it was in New Orleans or Europe. Disney's vision for audio-animatronics was primarily focused on patriotic displays rather than amusements. In 1951, two years after Walt Disney discovered animatronics, he commissioned machinist Roger Broggie and sculptor Wathel Rogers to lead a team tasked with creating a 9\\" tall figure that could move and talk simulating dance routines performed by actor Buddy Ebsen. The project was titled 'Project Little Man' but was never finished. A year later, Walt Disney Imagineering was created. Disney used a supposedly animatronic bird in 1962 for the film Mary Poppins (released in 1964). This was actually controlled fully by bicycle cables. After \\"Project Little Man\\", the Imagineering team at Disney's first project was a \\"Chinese Head\\" which was on display in the lobby of their office. Customers could ask the head questions and it would reply with words of wisdom. The eyes blinked and its mouth opened and closed. The Walt Disney Production company started using animatronics in 1955 for Disneyland's ride, the Jungle Cruise, and later for its attraction Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room which featured animatronic Enchanted Tiki Birds. The first fully completed human audio-animatronic figure was Abraham Lincoln, created by Walt Disney in 1964 for the 1964 World's Fair in the New York. In 1965, Disney upgraded the figure and coined it as the Lincoln Mark II, which appeared at the Opera House at Disneyland Resort in California. For three months, the original Lincoln performed in New York, while the Lincoln Mark II played 5 performances per hour at Disneyland. Body language and facial motions were matched to perfection with the recorded speech. Actor Royal Dano voiced the animatronics version of Abraham Lincoln. Lucky the Dinosaur is an approximately green Segnosaurus which pulls a flower- covered cart and is led by \\"Chandler the Dinosaur Handler\\". Lucky is notable in that he was the first free-roving audio-animatronic figure ever created by Disney's Imagineers. The flower cart he pulls conceals the computer and power source. The Muppet Mobile Lab is a free-roving, audio-animatronic entertainment attraction designed by Walt Disney Imagineering. Two Muppet characters, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant, Beaker, pilot the vehicle through the park, interacting with guests and deploying special effects such as foggers, flashing lights, moving signs, confetti cannons and spray jets. It is currently deployed at Hong Kong Disneyland in Hong Kong. A Laffing Sal is one of the several automated characters that were used to attract carnival and amusement park patrons to funhouses and dark rides throughout the United States. Its movements were accompanied by a raucous laugh that sometimes frightened small children and annoyed adults. = Film and television = The film industry has been a driving force revolutionizing the technology used to develop animatronics. Animatronics are used in situations where a creature does not exist, the action is too risky or costly to use real actors or animals, or the action could never be obtained with a living person or animal. Its main advantage over CGI and stop motion is that the simulated creature has a physical presence moving in front of the camera in real time. The technology behind animatronics has become more advanced and sophisticated over the years, making the puppets even more lifelike. Animatronics were first introduced by Disney in the 1964 film Mary Poppins which featured an animatronic bird. Since then, animatronics have been used extensively in such movies as Jaws, and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which relied heavily on animatronics. Directors such as Steven Spielberg and Jim Henson have been pioneers in using animatronics in the film industry; a film co-directed by the latter, The Dark Crystal, was promoted as the first to feature no human characters, and showcased groundbreaking puppets designed by Brian Froud and created by Henson's then recently established Creature Shop in London. The 1993 film Jurassic Park used a combination of computer-generated imagery in conjunction with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston and his team. Winston's animatronic \\"T. rex\\" stood almost , in length and even the largest animatronics weighing were able to perfectly recreate the appearance and natural movement on screen of a full-sized Tyrannosaurus rex. Jack Horner called it \\"the closest I've ever been to a live dinosaur\\". Critics referred to Spielberg's dinosaurs as breathtakingly ‚Äî and terrifyingly ‚Äî realistic. The 1999 BBC miniseries Walking with Dinosaurs was produced using a combination of about 80% CGI and 20% animatronic models. The quality of computer imagery of the day was good, but animatronics were still better at distance shots, as well as closeups of the dinosaurs. Animatronics for the series were designed by British animatronics firm Crawley Creatures. The show was followed up in 2007 with a live adaptation of the series, Walking with Dinosaurs: The Arena Spectacular. Geoff Peterson is an animatronic human skeleton that serves as the sidekick on the late-night talk show The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. Often referred to as a \\"robot skeleton\\", Peterson is a radio- controlled animatronic robot puppet designed and built by Grant Imahara of MythBusters. = Advertising = The British advertisement campaign for Cadbury Schweppes titled Gorilla featured an actor inside a gorilla suit with an animatronically animated face. The Slowskys was an advertising campaign for Comcast Cable's Xfinity broadband Internet service. The ad features two animatronic turtles, and it won the gold Effie Award in 2007. = Toys = Some examples of animatronic toys include Teddy Ruxpin, Big Mouth Billy Bass, FurReal, Kota the triceratops, Pleo, WowWee Alive Chimpanzee, Microsoft Actimates, and Furby. Well-known brands include Cuddle Barn, Gemmy Industries, and Dan Dee.  Design  An animatronics character is built around an internal supporting frame, usually made of steel. Attached to these \\"bones\\" are the \\"muscles\\" which can be manufactured using elastic netting composed of styrene beads. The frame provides the support for the electronics and mechanical components, as well as providing the shape for the outer skin. The \\"skin\\" of the figure is most often made of foam rubber, silicone or urethane poured into moulds and allowed to cure. To provide further strength a piece of fabric is cut to size and embedded in the foam rubber after it is poured into the mould. Once the mould has fully cured, each piece is separated and attached to the exterior of the figure providing the appearance and texture similar to that of \\"skin\\".  Structure  An animatronics character is typically designed to be as realistic as possible and thus, is built similarly to how it would be in real life. The framework of the figure is like the \\"skeleton\\". Joints, motors, and actuators act as the \\"muscles\\". Connecting all the electrical components together are wires, such as the \\"nervous system\\" of a real animal or person. = Frame or skeleton = Steel, aluminum, plastic, and wood are all commonly used in building animatronics but each has its best purpose. The relative strength, as well as the weight of the material itself, should be considered when determining the most appropriate material to use. The cost of the material may also be a concern. = Exterior or skin = Several materials are commonly used in the fabrication of an animatronics figure's exterior. Dependent on the particular circumstances, the best material will be used to produce the most lifelike form. For example, \\"eyes\\" and \\"teeth\\" are commonly made completely out of acrylic.  Latex  White latex is commonly used as a general material because it has a high level of elasticity. It is also pre-vulcanized, making it easy and fast to apply. Latex is produced in several grades. Grade 74 is a popular form of latex that dries rapidly and can be applied very thick, making it ideal for developing molds. Foam latex is a lightweight, soft form of latex which is used in masks and facial prosthetics to change a person's outward appearance, and in animatronics to create a realistic \\"skin\\". The Wizard of Oz was one of the first films to make extensive use of foam latex prosthetics in the 1930s.  Silicone  Disney has a research team devoted to improving and developing better methods of creating more lifelike animatronics exteriors with silicone. RTV silicone (room temperature vulcanization silicone) is used primarily as a molding material as it is very easy to use but is relatively expensive. Few other materials stick to it, making molds easy to separate. Bubbles are removed from silicone by pouring the liquid material in a thin stream or processing in a vacuum chamber prior to use. Fumed silica is used as a bulking agent for thicker coatings of the material.  Polyurethane  Polyurethane rubber is a more cost effective material to use in place of silicone. Polyurethane comes in various levels of hardness which are measured on the Shore scale. Rigid polyurethane foam is used in prototyping because it can be milled and shaped in high density. Flexible polyurethane foam is often used in the actual building of the final animatronic figure because it is flexible and bonds well with latex.  Plaster  As a commonplace construction and home decorating material, plaster is widely available. Its rigidity limits its use in moulds, and plaster moulds are unsuitable when undercuts are present. This may make plaster far more difficult to use than softer materials like latex or silicone.  Movement  Pneumatic actuators can be used for small animatronics but are not powerful enough for large designs and must be supplemented with hydraulics. To create more realistic movement in large figures, an analog system is generally used to give the figures a full range of fluid motion rather than simple two position movements.  Emotion modeling  Mimicking the often subtle displays of humans and other living creatures, and the associated movement is a challenging task when developing animatronics. One of the most common emotional models is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) developed by Ekman and Friesen. FACS defines that through facial expression, humans can recognize 6 basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. Another theory is that of Ortony, Clore, and Collins, or the OCC model which defines 22 different emotional categories.  Training and education  Animatronics has been developed as a career which combines the disciplines of mechanical engineering, casting/sculpting, control technologies, electrical/electronic systems, radio control and airbrushing. Some colleges and universities do offer degree programs in animatronics. Individuals interested in animatronics typically earn a degree in robotics which closely relate to the specializations needed in animatronics engineering. Students achieving a bachelor's degree in robotics commonly complete courses in: * Mechanical engineering * Industrial robotics * Mechatronics systems * Modeling of robotics systems * Robotics engineering * Foundational theory of robotics * Introduction to robotics  Animatronics and artificial intelligence  The fusion of animatronics with artificial intelligence results in androids, as is usually known, robots that imitate human behavior. We have a technique capable of providing the appearance and behavior of living beings to machines. We are 'humanizing' robots. But it's not only the movements that look very real, but also, it seems real thanks to the synthetic skin they have used and makeup. The Disney company is about to use animatronics and artificial intelligence to simulate one of their characters in real life: Pascal, one of the characters in the movie Tangled. On the other hand, Dubai is already using police robots created by PAL Robotics. * Automaton * Karakuri ningy≈ç * Uncanny valley  References  ;Footnotes ;Sources  External links  Category:Robotics hardware Category:Simulation Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Animatronics"},{"id":"438276","text":"Hanham High Street Hanham is a suburb of Bristol.

They vary in size from shrubs (Z. sicula) to large trees up to tall (Z. carpinifolia). The bark is smooth, dark brown. Unlike the elms, the branchlets are never corky or winged. The leaves are alternate, with serrated margins, and (unlike the related elms) a symmetrical base to the leaf blade. The leaves are in two distinct rows; they have pinnate venation and each vein extends to the leaf margin, where it terminates in a tooth. There are two stipules at each node, though these are caducous (shed early), leaving a pair of scars at the leaf base. Zelkova is polygamous. Staminate flowers are clustered in the lower leaf axils of young branchlets; the perianth is campanulate, with four to six (to seven) lobes, and the stamens are short. Pistillate and hermaphrodite flowers are solitary, or rarely in clusters of two to four, in the upper leaf axils of young branchlets. The fruit is a dry, nut-like drupe with a dorsal keel, produced singly in the leaf axils. The perianth and stigma are persistent. Andrews, S. (1994). Tree of the year: Zelkova. Int. Dendrol. Soc.

However, extensive Pleistocene glaciation has confined the genus to its present range to the eastern Mediterranean islands and the Caucasus, and in eastern Asia where only local glaciation occurred.Follieri, M., Magri, D., & Sadori, L. (1986). Late Pleistocene Zelkova Extinction in Central Italy. New Phytologist 103 (1): 269‚Äì273 AbstractFlora of North America: History of North American Vegetation Species of Zelkova were important elements of the vast forests that prevailed throughout the Northern Hemisphere during much of the Cenozoic Period. Autumn foliage Today, the genus comprises six species with disjunct distribution patterns: three in eastern Asia [Zelkova serrata (Thunb.) Makino; Zelkova schneideriana Hand.-Mazz.; and Zelkova sinica C. K. Schneid.], one in southwestern Asia [Zelkova carpinifolia (Pall.) C. Koch] and two on the Mediterranean islands of Sicily (Zelkova sicula Di Pasq., Garfi & Qu√©zel) and Crete [Zelkova abelicea (Lam.) Boiss.]. The oldest fossils attributed to Zelkova date from the early Eocene (55 million years ago) in western North America, where the genus is extinct today. In Bulgaria, Zelkova fossils were found in Paleogene and Neogene layers in the following locations: Zelkova ungeri (Ett.) Kov. ‚Äî Lozenets, Kurilo, Chukurovo in Sofia Region, Dospey in Samokov Region, Pernik, Pirin Mine in Blagoevgrad Region, Bobov Dol in Kyustendil Region; Zelkova praelonga Berger ‚Äî Pirin Mine in Blagoevgrad Region. Zelkova abelicea is endemic to Crete (Greece); it has a fragmentary distribution in the four main mountain regions of Crete (Lefka Ori, Psiloritis, Dikti and Thrypti), between 900 and 1800 m above sea level, which corresponds to the upper timberline. It grows mainly on north-facing slopes or in and around rocky river-beds and gullies which remain moist during dry summers. The species is highly endangered through habitat fragmentation and destruction, overgrazing, fire and water stress. The Sicilian Zelkova Z. sicula, only discovered in 1991, is listed as an endangered species. The two known populations close to Syracuse (Bosco Pisano and Ciranna) comprise a small number of low shrubs suffering from severe overgrazing; the natural mature size of undamaged specimens is unknown.IUCN: Zelkova sicula Whilst all the known Zelkova taxa are currently in cultivation and in botanic gardens or arboreta, relatively few collections are known to be from wild sourced material or known in the countries of their natural distribution. Z. sicula and Z. abelicea are the two taxa considered to be at most risk of extinction (Critically Endangered and Vulnerable). These two Zelkova species are the two with the most restricted natural distribution‚Äîboth are small island endemics. The Zelkova with the widest natural distribution, Z. serrata, is also the most common Zelkova in botanic garden collections Global Survey of Ex situ Zelkova collections Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) Phylogeography, using chloroplast and mitochondrial markers, has mostly focused on the Quaternary and the influence of the cycles of glaciation on species distribution and structure. Phylogeography has, however, also been used to document more ancient patterns, with some of them presumably dating as far back as the early Miocene. The retrieval of ancient patterns may be specific to tree species, which are assumed to evolve more slowly than herbaceous plants and shrubs. Zelkova trees live for centuries, which is a good indication that ancient patterns might be recovered using molecular markers. A few phylogenetic and biogeographical studies have been carried out on Zelkova, but these studies had small sample sizes or weak representation of wild populations. A more comprehensive phylogeographical analysis, based on trnH‚ÄìpsbA, trnL and internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2), was the first to use a wide sampling of natural populations from nearly all the disjunct regions where Z. abelicea, Z. carpinifolia and Z. sicula presently grow. It aimed to assess the diversity within and among species using DNA from two cellular compartments that have different modes of inheritance and trace different histories. Cultivation and uses Zelkova serrata and Z. carpinifolia are grown as ornamental trees. Kozlowski, Gratzfeld et al., p. 13 The wood is hard, used for making furniture. Etymology The name Zelkova derives from the native name of Z. carpinifolia in the Georgian language - one of the Kartvelian languages spoken in the Caucasus, as shown by the Georgian name, (dzelkva), from (dzeli) meaning 'bar' or 'pillar', and (kva) meaning 'rock', 'stone' The tree was often used for making rock-hard and durable bars for building and furniture.

The form is mainly used in intercollegiate competitions at the University of Oxford since 1815, and at the University of Cambridge since 1827.The Bumps:An Account of the Cambridge University Bumping Races 1827-1999, John Durack, George Gilbert & Dr John Marks, 2000, Bumps racing in fours is also the format of inter-house rowing at Eton College and Shrewsbury School. It is particularly suitable where the stretch of water available is long but narrow, precluding side-by-side racing. Bumps racing gives a sharper feel of immediate competition than a head race, where boats are simply timed over a fixed course. Few rowers worldwide use rivers as narrow as the Cam or the Isis, but bumps races are also contested elsewhere. Origins and history The first attested bumps race, and the first attested race between two clubs anywhere in the world, took place in Oxford in 1815. This was between two eights from Brasenose College and Jesus College.Burnell, p. 26 The fact the racing was conducted in eight-oared boats gave rise to the event being known as Eights. The practice began with the two colleges racing upstream from Iffley Lock to a finishing line just short of Folly Bridge. Both crews began one behind the other in the lock, with each having to push their way out of the lock before being able to commence racing. This created an inevitable gap between boats, with the one behind trying to bump the one in front to claim victory. The boat in front could claim to be \\"Head of the River\\" if they avoided being bumped. As the number of crews contesting races increased, races ceased to start in the lock, and instead were started from the bank upstream of the lock. This first occurred in 1825 or 1826. Burnell, op cit Twelve years after bumps racing began in Oxford, Lent Bumps racing commenced at Cambridge University in 1827. At Oxford, an additional bumping regatta, known as Torpids, was begun in 1838. This regatta was originally for men who had not rowed in Eights, nor in a University crew. Sherwood, p 147 Racing practice and procedures The starting gun. There are three gun signals: 4 (or 5 in Oxford) minute gun; 1 minute gun; and the starting gun. Bumps races are typically raced in a series over several days. The starting order of each day's race is based on the previous day's results; the first day's starting order each year is determined by the results on the last day of the previous year. Each day the boats line up bow-to-stern, usually along the bank of the river, with a set distance between each boat and the next (usually about one and a half boat-lengths of clear water). The starting positions are usually marked by a rope or chain attached to the bank, the other end of which is held by each boat's cox. Boats wait along the bank, and may be poled out just in time for the start, to avoid drifting. At the start signal the cox lets go of the rope and the crew starts to row, attempting to catch and bump the boat in front while simultaneously being chased by the one behind. Poling off: LMBC in the 2009 May Bumps A bump is made when any form of contact is made with the boat in front; however, outright collisions are neither necessary nor encouraged. Alternatively, if possible, an overtaking-bump occurs when the stern of the chasing boat completely passes the bow of the boat in front. This is relatively rare simply because it is easier to make contact with a rival boat than it is to overtake it. A bump of this kind usually only occurs when a boat crashes. Under the current Cambridge rules, to overtake merely requires the pursuing boat to draw alongside the other boat's bow ball; side by side is good enough, and in the early part of the course a bump is deemed to occur when the bowball of the chasing crew passes the cox of the crew being chased. Generally, and at Oxford during Eights Week, once a bump has occurred both crews pull over to the river bank and take no further part in that race. At Oxford during Torpids a bumping crew pulls over but the bumped crew must continue racing over the entire course and can be bumped by more than one crew per day. As bumps racing usually takes place on narrow stretches of water, when contact occurs, two or more boats can become tangled up or not clear the river quickly enough, causing the racing line to be blocked. This can be very dangerous and the chance of boats getting damaged is high. To avoid this, the cox of the boat being bumped can concede as soon as slight physical contact occurs or even once it is inevitable. Nonetheless, collisions involving several boats are common. Crews in Torpids tend to concede bumps early to avoid being entangled with the crew that caught them: should they be unable to continue, other boats may row past, overtake and 'bump' the stationary crew. Any crew that has been bumped starts the next race behind the boat or boats that caught it; they switch places. A boat which reaches the finish line without either bumping or being bumped is said to have 'rowed over' and stays in the same position. Corpus III bumps Girton III at the 2005 May Bumps in Cambridge Organisation As the length of the racing course is limited, large regattas are organised into divisions of 12 to 20 boats. Each division races separately, but they are ranked to achieve an overall order of crews: e.g. the top crew in the second division is considered to be one place behind the last crew in the first division. The first day's starting position is based on the final positions from the previous year, though in the bottom divisions the boats may be placed according to qualifying getting/rowing on races held before the event. This allows boat clubs to introduce new crews. On each day of a bumps regatta the division races are rowed in reverse order, i.e. the lowest division first. A crew finishing at the top of a division race goes on to compete in the next-higher division later that day (starting last). Alternatively, a crew finishing last in a division must race in the next-lower division the following day (starting first). This is referred to as a sandwich boat and allows crews to move between divisions. A crew (A) may find that the boat in front of them has caught the boat ahead of them. Since (except at Oxford during Torpids) these boats both then drop out, crew A must now try to catch the next boat ahead of them still racing (most often the one which started three places ahead). If they succeed, this is called an overbump and, in exchanging places with the boat they bumped, they move three places up the start order. Further still, it is possible, though very rare, to double- overbump (move up five places) or triple-overbump (seven places). Only two occasions of a quadruple-overbump (9 places at once) have been recorded at the Cambridge May Bumps, by W1 in 1986 and by M4 in 2018. Overbumps, and variants thereof, are most common in the lower divisions where the quality of the crews varies greatly year-on-year. The ultimate achievement in such a competition is to finish first in the overall order; that crew is said to be 'Head of the River'. This is only realistically possible for crews starting a bump race in the top 5 places. A more attainable goal for most crews, apart from moving up towards the headship, is to bump up a place (or more) on each of the four days. The crew is said to have \\"won its blades\\", or achieved blades. Traditionally, members of such a crew can purchase a rowing oar in the crew colours and inscribed with the crews' names and the boats they bumped to hang on their wall. Conversely, crews that go down four places win a wooden spoon, achieving spoons. The bottom crew at the bottom of the last division is known as the 'Tail of the River'. A bumps chart is a graphical representation of the week's results; each boat's fortunes can be traced as its line on the chart rises and falls. At Cambridge, the most successful college boat club over the four days of the May Bumps is awarded the Pegasus Cup, sponsored by Milton Brewery. First and Third Trinity Boat Club celebrate the double headship of the Lent Bumps 2007 by burning a boat, the Fair Maid of Kent. Races Both Oxford and Cambridge Universities host two sets of university bumps races per year, one in early spring and one in early summer, each lasting four days. At Cambridge these are called \\"Lent Bumps\\" and \\"May Bumps\\" respectively, while at Oxford they are \\"Torpids\\" and \\"Summer Eights\\". The races are for eights (i.e. eight rowers with a cox steering), each representing one of the university's various colleges. Most colleges enter several crews. In both Oxford and Cambridge, there are also separate Town Bumps races in which local clubs compete. Oxford's races, run by the City of Oxford Rowing Club (CORC), are open to all comers and are raced in fours, all races taking place on the same day. Cambridge's races are run under the auspices of the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association (CRA) and are run exclusively in eights and take place over 4 consecutive days in July. There are typically four men's divisions with 17 boats (plus a sandwich boat; a sandwich boat being the top boat from each division) in each division, and three women's divisions. The bumps are fiercely contested, and the ideal that the races are for local rowers can lead to disputes over whether crews are 'legal'. The United Hospitals boat club holds a bumps race over three days each May after exams on the River Thames, racing from upstream of Kew Bridge adjacent to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew ending at the UL Boathouse at Chiswick. Traditionally involving only medical school crews, in recent years alumni and non-medical crews have been allowed to enter as invitational crews. The start of a bumps race at Oxford, June 2014. At Eton and Shrewsbury, both schools still have an annual bumping race. At Eton, it takes place over four evenings, in early May. There is usually one boat entered per house, and one boat entered by College. Because of the dangerous nature of the sport, only fours are used, and only the second and third years may row. On the fourth evening there are prizes for the leaders of the chart and also a 'Bumping Cup' for the boat who has made the most bumps over the four nights. The event is marshalled by senior rowers and rowing prefects called The Monarch. The crew training is mainly pupil driven. Previously races were run every day until there were no more bumps (i.e. until they were nominally in speed order). This historical set-up could lead to weeks of racing and was therefore abandoned in favour of a four-day version more than 100 years ago.

In 1989, Casper was appointed provost of the University of Chicago and served in that capacity until 1992. He served as president of Stanford University from 1992 to 2000. Casper has written and taught primarily in the fields of constitutional law, constitutional history, comparative law, and legal theory. Among his books is Separating Power (Harvard University Press, 1997). From 1977 to 1990, he was an editor of The Supreme Court Review. Stanford University In 1992, Casper became the ninth president of Stanford University. His concerns as president ranged from resolution of the indirect cost dispute with the federal government to restoration of the campus after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake to innovation in curriculum, programs, and physical plant. Casper's Commission on Undergraduate Education was the first comprehensive examination of undergraduate education at Stanford in 25 years. The commission and other faculty initiatives led to a new approach to the first two years of college, Stanford Introductory Studies (SIS), which provides small-group learning and research experiences. SIS includes the Freshman and Sophomore Introductory Seminars and Sophomore College. Casper kept tuition increases to a minimum while increasing financial aid. Casper also initiated the Stanford Graduate Fellowships and helped raise a substantial endowment for their support. The purpose of the Stanford Graduate Fellowships is to attract the best graduate students and give them full freedom to pursue their work at Stanford without worrying about the vagaries of sponsored research or other traditional sources of support. Recruitment and retention of exceptional faculty members who excel in both research and teaching was emphasized during Casper's presidency through Research Grants for Junior Faculty in the three schools that offer undergraduate degrees: Earth Sciences, Engineering, and Humanities and Sciences. The university's bureaucracy was also streamlined through internal reorganizations and a reduction in the number of vice presidential positions. The integration of the Stanford Alumni Association into the university in 1998 enhanced outreach to Stanford's alumni worldwide. Donations to Stanford, especially from alumni, increased sharply under Casper's leadership, with particular emphasis on fortifying Stanford's endowment and increasing participation through the creation of the Stanford Fund for Undergraduate Education. During Casper's presidency, the physical infrastructure of the campus improved substantially. Restoration of buildings damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was completed, and the architectural value of new buildings was enhanced with competitions attracting some of the world's most gifted architects. The 1893 Leland Stanford Junior Museum became part of an expanded complex, the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts. The reconstructed Bing Wing of Cecil H. Green Library opened in 1999, a decade after the severe damage inflicted by the Loma Prieta earthquake closed its doors. Other new constructions included the Science and Engineering Quad, the Center for Clinical Sciences Research, graduate residences, and the Arrillaga Alumni Center. In 1993, Casper chose Condoleezza Rice as provost of the university. She was succeeded in 1999 by John L. Hennessy. In 2000, Hennessy became the tenth president of the university. About the Stanford presidency, Casper wrote Cares of the University (Stanford, CA, 1997), in which he addressed many issues facing the contemporary university. His most recent book about higher education is The Winds of Freedom: Addressing Challenges to the University, which was published by Yale University Press in 2014.  American Academy in Berlin  In July 2015, Casper was appointed one-year interim president of the American Academy in Berlin, an institute for culture and research founded in 1994 by Ambassador Richard Holbrooke. The independent, privately funded, nonpartisan American Academy in Berlin seeks to improve cultural and academic ties between Germany and the USA. Since August 2019, Casper serves as the American Academy's trustee-in-residence. He returned to the Academy's board in 2015, after having previously served as trustee from 2000 to 2009. While acting as president, Casper arranged a visit by Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, in September 2015, who discussed \\"The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain.\\" Casper also helped to oversee the Richard C. Holbrooke Forum, which was created in memory of the Academy's founder. The intercultural and interdisciplinary setting and the creative program made the Academy a prestigious center according to the German magazine Der Spiegel.  Honors, awards and leadership  Casper has been elected to membership in the American Law Institute, the International Academy of Comparative Law, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Orden Pour le m√©rite f√ºr Wissenschaften und K√ºnste (Order Pour le m√©rite for the Sciences and Arts), and the American Philosophical Society. During the fall of 2006, he held the Kluge Chair in American Law and Governance at the Library of Congress. He has been awarded various honorary doctorates. On May 26, 2000 Casper received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Social Sciences at Uppsala University, Sweden That spring, he also received an honorary doctorate from Yale. Casper is the 2014 recipient of the American Law Institute's Distinguished Service Award. He served on ALI's Council from 1980 to 2010, and continues to participate as an emeritus member. From 2000 to 2008, he served as a successor trustee of Yale University. From 2010 to 2016, he was chairman of the Board of the Terra Foundation for American Art. Casper is a trustee of the Central European University in Budapest and a member of international advisory councils at the Israel Democracy Institute, the European University at St. Petersburg, and Ko√ß University, Istanbul. Casper also has the honor of having been the subject of the first Google search by someone not a part of the Google team.

At long, it is the longest three-digit U.S. route. It serves as the major truck route between Fort Worth and Amarillo, Texas, and between Fort Collins, Colorado, and Laramie, Wyoming. The highway is broken into two segments by Yellowstone National Park, where an unnumbered park road serves as a connector. The highway's northern terminus is in Choteau, Montana, south of the Canadian border, at an intersection with US 89\\\\. Its southern terminus (as well as those of US 69 and US 96) is in Port Arthur, Texas at an intersection with State Highway 87 (SH 87), up the Sabine River from the Gulf of Mexico. It intersects its parent route US 87 twice, overlapping it from Amarillo to Dumas, Texas, and then crossing it in Denver, Colorado. US 287 is the shortest route between Denver and Dallas-Fort Worth. Route description=Texas US 287 originates at its southern terminus in Port Arthur as a branch of SH 87\\\\. From Port Arthur, US 287 runs concurrently with US 69 and US 96 to Lumberton, where US 96 diverges to the northeast and the co-signed US 287/US 69 continues northwesterly until US 287 and US 69 diverge in Woodville. Continuing northwesterly, US 287 merges with Interstate 45 (I-45) in Corsicana and follows the Interstate to Ennis, where it branches off and continues through Waxahachie, crossing I-35E and continuing north through Tarrant County, where it encounters and briefly merges with three different Interstates (I-820, I-20, and I-35W). From Fort Worth, US 287 continues north to Wichita Falls and continues just south of the Oklahoma border before entering the Texas Panhandle. A section of US 287, between Midlothian and Waxahachie, was dedicated as the Chris Kyle Memorial Highway, in honor of fallen SEAL Chris Kyle, whose hometown was Midlothian. The highway continues through Amarillo, where it intersects I-40, and then runs north to Kerrick and crosses into neighboring Oklahoma. Oklahoma In Oklahoma, US 287 remains within Cimarron County, located at the end of the Panhandle. After crossing the state line north of Kerrick, Texas, the highway intersects SH 171 at its southern terminus. US 287 continues northwesterly, crossing the Beaver River, toward Boise City, the county seat. On the east side of town, the highway runs concurrently with US 56, US 64, US 412, and SH 3\\\\. These five highways then enter the traffic circle in downtown Boise City. US 287 emerges from the north side of the circle, as well as US 385 and SH 3\\\\. These three highways head north to the Colorado state line. SH 3 ends there, while US 287 and US 385 continue onward into Colorado. Colorado View south along US 287 in Larimer County, Colorado From Oklahoma, US 287 and US 385 enter into a very rural part of Colorado. They continue in a north/northwest direction through the state. The two highways pass through the town of Campo, and make an interchange with US 160 on the outskirts of Springfield. In Lamar and Carlton, the highways make an interchange with US 50\\\\. Here US 385 heads east on US 50, and US 287/US 50 continue to the north. Just outside the town the highways make a sharp turn toward the west, and the road heading north is SH 196\\\\. South of Wiley, US 50 heads west, while US 287 turns north toward Wiley. East of Eads, US 287 turns toward the west again, briefly merging with SH 96\\\\. In Eads, SH 96 continues toward the west, while US 287 turns toward the north. Near Kit Carson, US 287 again turns toward the west and merges with US 40\\\\. Near Limon, the two highways make two interchanges with I-70 before passing through Limon. Then the two highways merge with I-70. Near the outskirts of Denver US 36 merges with the group of highways making the road, I-70/US 287/US 36/US 40\\\\. Just past E-470, I-70 and US 36 split to follow a more northerly course, while US 287 and US 40 continue west into Downtown Denver on Colfax Avenue. The I-25, US 6, US 87, and US 85 interchange marks US 287's second junction with its parent route, US 87; the other is in Texas. Shortly thereafter, at a cloverleaf interchange with Federal Boulevard, SH 88 runs south, US 40 continues west on Colfax, and US 287 turns toward the north on Federal Boulevard. After crossing US 36 (Denver‚ÄìBoulder Turnpike), US 287 turns west onto 120th Avenue where it overlaps SH 128\\\\. Just before meeting US 36 again in Broomfield, US 287 bends back to the north, leaving SH 128 which continues west through an interchange with SH 121 and US 36\\\\. At Baseline Road in Lafayette, SH 7 joins US 287 for about a mile, before SH 7 splits to the west on Arapahoe Avenue towards Boulder. It intersects SH 119 as it enters Longmont on Main Street, and then it intersects SH 66 at the north edge of town. The road bypasses Berthoud en route to Loveland, where US 287 splits into the pair of one-way streets Lincoln Avenue (northbound) and Cleveland Avenue (southbound). It then divides the Loveland cemetery. This is the only cemetery in the US with a US Highway dividing it. Continuing north, US 287 passes through Fort Collins on College Avenue, merging with SH 14 at Jefferson Street. On the edge of the mountains at Ted's Place, SH 14 splits and heads west into Poudre Canyon, while US 287 continues north into Wyoming. The section of US 287 between Fort Collins and Laramie, Wyoming, carries very heavy truck traffic and is regarded as quite dangerous. Wyoming US 287 enters Wyoming through a pass between the Laramie Mountains to the east and the Medicine Bow Mountains to the west. In Laramie, US 287 crosses I-80 and merges with US 30 and the two highways continue to head north. After passing Medicine Bow, these highways turn west-southwest and return to I-80 near Walcott, where they merge with the interstate west until Rawlins. US 287 branches off from I-80 and US 30 and heads into the town. US 287 merges with Wyoming Highway 76 (WYO 76), WYO 82, and WYO 30 for a short distance just outside Rawlins, though WYO 76 ends when US 287 branches to the northwest as a stand-alone highway. It is also possible to take Business US 287 (WYO 80, WYO 30) into Rawlins. In Downtown Rawlins, WYO 80 and WYO 30 head toward the west while Business US 287 heads to the north, merging with WYO 789 where WYO 30 and WYO 80 split off the highway. A short while later Business US 287 and WYO 789 merge with mainline US 287, which made a detour around the city. US 287 and WYO 789 stay merged all the way to Lander, where WYO 789 heads toward the northeast and US 287 heads toward the northwest. US 287 merges with US 26 in the very mountainous terrain of West Central Wyoming, and the two highways head west. The highways enter Grand Teton National Park. In Moran, US 287 and US 26 meet US 191 and US 89\\\\. US 26 heads south merging with US 191 and US 89\\\\. US 287 heads north merging with US 191 and US 89, and as it reaches Yellowstone National Park, becomes an unsigned park road and continues into Montana. Montana US 287 north of Yellowstone National Park US 287 in Montana begins at the West Entrance of Yellowstone National Park in West Yellowstone, terminating a concurrency with US 20\\\\. US 287 and US 191 split north of the town. US 287 heads toward the northwest, merging with Montana Highway 2 (MT 2) north of Sappington, and running northeast. At I-90, MT 2 ends and US 287 continues to head north. In Townsend, US 287 merges with US 12 and the two highways continue north. At I-15 (near Helena), US 287 continues north on I-15 and US 12 heads west through downtown Helena. Northeast of Wolf Creek, US 287 and I-15 split with US 287 heading northwest and I-15 heading northeast. US 287 ends at US 89 in Choteau. History When US 287 was first commissioned in 1939, it extended only from the south entrance of Yellowstone National Park to Denver, Colorado. The route was extended southward to the Gulf Coast at Port Arthur, Texas in 1940, and northward into Montana to US 89 at Choteau, Montana in 1965. US 89 continues north of Choteau into Alberta as Highway 2 through the major cities of Calgary and Edmonton, connecting with a Canadian link to the Alaska Highway in the latter. Included in the route of US 287 is former US 370, which was commissioned in 1926 and connected Amarillo to Bowie, traveling concurrently with US 70 between Vernon and Wichita Falls, Texas. The Canada to Gulf Highway Association, which later became the U.S. Highway 287 Association, was active from the 1910s until the 1970s to promote US 287 as a popular tourist route, and was composed of members from businesses and organizations in cities along the route. The Wyoming state transportation department started widening US 287 in 2009. Future In 2017, House Bill 2026 (HB 2026) was filed in the Texas Legislature to provide funding for a study on upgrading US 287 in Texas to an Interstate highway, with the eventual goal of designating US 287 as an Interstate from Beaumont, Texas, to the Canadian border in Montana. HB 2026 later died in committee. Major intersections Southern segment :Texas :: in Port Arthur :: in Port Arthur. US 69/US 287 travels concurrently to Woodville.

The ride features over 300 audio-animatronic dolls in traditional costumes from cultures around the world, frolicking in a spirit of international unity, and singing the attraction's title song, which has a theme of global peace. According to Time.com, the Sherman Brothers' song \\"It's A Small World\\" is the most publicly performed song of all time. In recent years, the Small World attractions at the various Disney parks have been updated to include depictions of Disney characters, albeit in a design compatible with the original 1960s design of Mary Blair, alongside the original characters. History Fabricated at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank as Children of the World, it was created by WED Enterprises, then shipped to the 1964 New York World's Fair's UNICEF pavilion, sponsored by Pepsi, where it featured at its entrance a kinetic sculpture, The Tower of the Four Winds, a 120-foot perpetually spinning mobile created by WED designer Rolly Crump. It was added to four attractions ‚Äî Magic Skyway (Ford), Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (Illinois), The Carousel of Progress (General Electric), and CircleVision 360 (Kodak)‚Äîalready under development, which were used by Disney to sponsor, fund, and test concepts and develop ride systems and innovative entertainment intended to be moved and rebuilt at Disneyland after the World's Fair closed in 1966. The Pepsi Board of Directors took so long to agree on what type of attraction to sponsor that then-board member and widow of past company president Alfred Steele, actress Joan Crawford, prevailed upon her longtime Hollywood friend Walt Disney to design such an attraction as would be suitable for Pepsi. Because of the short lead-time to design, create, and construct such an attraction, she insisted that the board of directors accept his proposal, seeing as he was already designing attractions for the state of Illinois, Ford, General Electric, and Kodak and knew Walt was the only one who could accomplish such a feat in the short time left until the fair was scheduled to open.Paul F. Anderson (2001). \\"A Little Boat Ride: It's A Small World\\". Excerpted from \\"Disney and the 1964 New York World's Fair\\", Persistence of Vision, Issue #6/#7. nywf64.com. Retrieved on November 4, 2015. The WED Enterprises company was given only 11 months to create and build the pavilion.. Mary Blair was responsible for the attraction's whimsical design and color styling. Blair had been an art director on several Disney animated features, including Cinderella, Alice In Wonderland, and Peter Pan. Like many Disneyland attractions, scenes and characters were designed by Marc Davis, while his wife, Alice Davis, designed the costumes for the dolls. Rolly Crump designed the toys and other supplemental figures on display. The animated dolls were designed and sculpted by Blaine Gibson. Walt was personally involved with Gibson's and Greg S. Marinello development of the dolls' facial design; each animated doll face is completely identical in shape. Arrow Development was deeply involved in the design of the passenger-carrying boats and propulsion system of the attraction. Two patents that were filed by Arrow Development staff and assigned to The Walt Disney Company illustrate passenger boats and vehicle guidance systems with features very similar to those later utilized on the Disneyland installation of the attraction. The firm is credited with manufacturing the Disneyland installation. Song/melody \\"Children of the World\\" was the working title of the attraction. Its tentative soundtrack, which can be heard on the album, featured the national anthems of each country represented throughout the ride all playing all at once, which resulted in disharmonic cacophony. Walt conducted a walk-through of the attraction scale model with his staff songwriters Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, saying, \\"I need one song that can be easily translated into many languages and be played as a round.\\" The Sherman brothers then wrote \\"It's a Small World (After All)\\" in the wake of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, which influenced the song's message of peace and brotherhood. When they first presented it to Walt, they played it as a slow ballad. Walt requested something more cheerful, so they sped up the tempo and sang in counterpoint. Walt was so delighted with the final result that he renamed the attraction \\"It's a Small World\\" after the Sherman Brothers' song. Robert J. Sherman, youngest son of Robert B. Sherman, has claimed that this song is the single most-performed and most-translated piece of music. In 2014, it was estimated that the song had played nearly 50 million times worldwide on the attractions alone, beating out the radio and TV estimates for \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\\" and \\"Yesterday\\", which were believed to have been played at least eight and seven million times respectively. A third verse celebrating the attraction's 50th anniversary was written and popularized, but not incorporated into the ride. Global installations=1964 New York World's Fair The attraction debuted at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The first incarnation of It's a Small World, which debuted at the 1964 New York World's Fair, was an afterthought and nearly did not happen. Ford and General Electric had engaged Disney early on to create their pavilions for the 1964 New York World's Fair. WED Enterprises had already long been at work developing a \\"dancing-doll\\" designed to reproduce human movement resulting in a crude early audio-animatronics fashioned as Abraham Lincoln when the State of Illinois approached Disney to create the Illinois Pavilion, representatives of the state instantly approved after being \\"introduced\\" to the robotic figurehead. A nine wide-screen CircleVision 360¬∞ exhibit for Kodak's pavilion was also being planned as an improvement over the existing Disneyland eleven 4:3 format screen Circarama (which later failed the installation deadline for opening) when Pepsi approached Disney with a plan to tribute UNICEF. > Disney seemed to be the showman to give us the package we want ... He's > terrific. He's got his hands in more bowls than anyone I've ever seen, but > he accomplishes what he sets out to do. ‚Äî J.G. Mullaly, Ford's World's Fair > program manager.Walt Disney Conversations, p.83 1964 World's Fair \\"It's a Small World\\" ticket, logo portion ;April 22, 1964 ‚Äì opening day :\\"A salute to the children of the world, designed by Walt Disney, presents animated figures frolicking in miniature settings of many lands. Visitors are carried past the scenes in small boats. In an adjoining building Pepsi sponsors exhibits by the U.S. Committee for the United Nations Children's Fund. Above the pavilion rises the 120-foot Tower of the Four Winds, a fanciful creation of coloured shapes that dance and twist in the breeze.\\" ‚Äì 1965 Official Guide Book to the New York World's Fair The attraction was incredibly successful. Ten million 60¬¢ and 95¬¢ tickets for children and adults, respectively, were collected in two half-year seasons and the proceeds were donated to UNICEF. While other attractions had lines out the doors, there seemed to always be a seat available aboard It's a Small World. Its high rider-per-hour capacity was recognized as a valuable innovation and was incorporated indirectly and directly into future attractions. Pirates of the Caribbean had been under construction at Disneyland as a subterranean walk-through. That design was scrapped as concrete was broken out so similar boats could sail past scenes which (because the original walk-through scene length was not shortened) were now different each voyage, another concept which forever influenced attraction design and popularity. Disneyland The boats enter the show building through a tunnel under the Small World clock and emerge from the attraction fifteen minutes later. The show building interior is larger than the fa√ßade. Voyagers see animatronic dolls in traditional local costumes singing \\"It's a Small World (After All)\\" together, each in their native language. Boats carry voyagers as they visit the regions of the world. Other Disney park installations wind the flume around one large room, emphasizing its theme that the world is small and interconnected. Each installation may vary the countries which are represented and the order in which they appear. The boats are stored behind the facade and go in and out backstage in between the Spanish room. =Exterior= It's a Small World at Disneyland The Tower of the Four Winds was not relocated to Disneyland's It's a Small World after the New York World's Fair; in its place is an outdoor oval flume and boarding queue decorated with topiary backed by a large, flat facade with stylized cutout turrets, towers and minarets which are vaguely reminiscent of world landmarks (such as the Eiffel Tower and the Leaning Tower of Pisa). The facade was designed by Disney Imagineer Rolly Crump, who was inspired by Mary Blair's styling. Walt Disney asked Rolly to design a large 30-foot clock, a central feature of the exterior facade, with a smiling face that rocks back and forth to a ticking sound. A parade of wooden dolls in native culture costumes dance out from doors at the base of the Small World clock to an instrumental toy soldier version of \\"It's a Small World (After All)\\" in preparation for each quarter-hour, reminiscent of a European automaton clock. As the last doll returns into the clock, the parade doors close and the large central pair of doors open to reveal two giant toy blocks ‚Äì the large block displays stylized numerals of the hour, the small one displays the minutes, while large and small bells toll to count the hours and quarters. The exterior has been subtly repainted over the years, first as all- white with a gold/silver trim, then in various shades of blue, then in pink and white with pastel accents. Portions of the left side of the original facade were removed in 1993 to make room for the entrance to Mickey's Toontown. As of 2015, the facade is white with a gold trim as it was in 1966, except the original gold and silver paint of the clock, the smiling clock face, is now entirely gold leaf. The gardens around the building are decorated with topiary animals. During the 2005‚Äì2006 holiday season, an elaborate multimedia presentation was projected on the outdoor fa√ßade which registered colored patterns matched to the fa√ßade each quarter-hour after dusk. Guests were encouraged to view the popular Remember... Dreams Come True fireworks presentation from the It's a Small World Mall and nearby parade viewing platform built for Light Magic (which had included a smoking area, now relocated under the Monorail track between the Matterhorn Bobsleds and Autopia) to decrease overwhelming crowds gathered for viewing the fireworks spectacular in Plaza and Main Street. =2008 refurbishment= Disneyland's \\"It's a Small World\\" was closed from January to November 2008 (closed and reopening in holiday version, skipping the summer season) to receive a major refurbishment. The building's structure was improved, permanent attachments created for the \\"It's a Small World Holiday\\" overlay, the water flume replaced and its propulsion upgraded to electric water jet turbines, and the attraction's aging fiberglass boats redesigned in durable plastic. The refurbishment added 29 new Disney characters, each in their native land in a similar manner to the Hong Kong Disneyland version. Sylvania has agreed to a twelve-year sponsorship. In 2014, the sponsor logo at the attraction's entrance changed to that of Siemens, the parent company of Sylvania. The sponsorship ended its run after the 2017 Christmas season. =The Magic, the Memories and You= As part of Disney's \\"Let the Memories Begin\\" campaign for 2011, a nighttime projection show premiered at Disneyland's It's a Small World in Anaheim on January 27, 2011. The Magic, the Memories and You show projected sequences of Disney attractions and characters set to Disney music onto the exterior fa√ßade of It's a Small World to fill its architectural features, personalized with exclusive photographs and videos of park guests taken that day by Disney's PhotoPass cast members. The show also existed in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, but was projected onto Cinderella Castle. As the \\"Let the Memories Begin\\" campaign drew to a close, the show ended its run on Labor Day, September 3, 2012 at both locations. The Florida version was eventually replaced by Celebrate the Magic in fall 2012 and later by Once Upon a Time in 2016. The Magic, The Memories and You theme song later rewritten for Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland as part of the Tokyo Disney Resort 35th Anniversary celebration that premiered at Tokyo Disneyland on July 10, 2018 which also created as nod and tribute for the former nighttime projection show. Magic Kingdom On October 1, 1971, a version of the ride opened in Florida's Walt Disney World Fantasyland within Magic Kingdom. The boarding queue was built inside, and the three-dimensional facade that is seen outdoors in the other Disney parks was instead located in a slightly smaller scale along the far wall. The clock lacks the parade of wooden dolls and instead goes straight to opening the central pair of doors to reveal the time. The toy company Mattel sponsored the attraction from 1991 until 1998, when it transferred its sponsorship to another Magic Kingdom attraction, Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin in nearby Tomorrowland from that attraction's opening in 1998 until 1999, when it also dropped its sponsorship of that attraction, thus ending Mattel's history as a Walt Disney World sponsor. In 2020, the attraction is slated to be refurbished, gaining the Disney characters present at other parks. Tokyo Disneyland It's a Small World at Tokyo Disneyland before the 2018 refurbishment The Tokyo Disneyland version of the attraction is identical in layout to the Magic Kingdom version except for these differences: * The fa√ßade's design is an almost-complete replica of the California counterpart under a different color scheme, resembling Disneyland's 1990s version. * The loading area is split into two zones instead of one. * A Welcome room was added during the 2018 refurbishment, resembling the one at the California version. * There are scenes featuring various Disney characters redesigned in Mary Blair's style that were added during the 2018 refurbishment. * The Asian room features radically different sets and dolls for Japan and China compared to the Magic Kingdom version. A Mandarin language track was added to the China section in the 2018 refurbishment. * The ride uses a different, more recent recording of the song sung in Japanese specifically created for this version instead of the original Japanese recording. The vocal track is used for both the Asian room and finale room. * The walls of the African, South American, and Polynesian rooms are painted in colors similar to the Magic Kingdom version before its 2005 renovation compared to the current black walls in the Magic Kingdom version. * The Polynesian room has vocals singing in English. * The Goodbye room resembles the one found at the California version. =2018 refurbishment= On March 1, 2017, Tokyo Disneyland's version of \\"It's a Small World\\" closed down for refurbishment for its first major update since the park's opening in 1983. Reopened on April 8, 2018 coinciding with Tokyo Disneyland's 35th anniversary, the attraction featured 40 characters from Disney properties including Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, The Aristocats, Brave, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Pinocchio, The Jungle Book, The Lion King, Hercules, The Three Caballeros, Mulan, Tangled, Lilo & Stitch, Frozen, Finding Nemo, and Moana similar to its counterparts in California and Hong Kong. The attraction was initially set to be relocated to another area in Fantasyland with a new facade similar to the California counterpart as part of original expansion plans announced in October 2014 for the resort within the next ten years before being revised and updated. The updated version of the attraction soft opened on April 8, 2018, revealing a redone color scheme for the fa√ßade, a new tick-tock sound and parade music (similar to the ones used in Hong Kong and Anaheim), an entirely redone loading area dubbed ‚ÄúSmall World Station,‚Äù a new Welcome room, an extended Goodbye room, redone set pieces, and music tracks new to the ride including a Mandarin language track added to the China scene formerly exclusive to the Hong Kong version along with the aforementioned Disney characters. Disneyland Paris The attraction at Disneyland Paris is a departure from other versions of the attraction. The fa√ßade features rearranged and slightly redesigned landmarks with a completely different clock tower. The exterior clock face features a wide-awake sun on its left half and a sleeping moon on its right half. Unlike all other versions of the ride, every scene is housed in one room with arches being used to define sections of the ride. The scenery design is a complete departure from Mary Blair's distinctive style, though the dolls used remain identical to all other versions. The ride also uses a completely different soundtrack composed by John Debney (which was also used for roughly a decade at the Californian version from the early 1990s to the early 2000s), which can be described as more ornate compared to the original soundtrack. This is the first version of the ride to incorporate a scene for North America with dolls representing Canada and the United States, and a distinct Middle Eastern section with dolls singing in Arabic and Hebrew. In the Finale room, in addition to the song being sung in English, it is also sung in French and German. Also, the attraction had a post-show area called World Chorus that was sponsored by France T√©l√©com, which opened with the park in 1992 and then closed in 2010 to make way for the Princess Pavilion meet and greet area. =2015 refurbishment= As part of an ongoing plan to refurbish several attractions for the park's 25th anniversary, this version went under an extensive refurbishment for six months before it reopened on December 19, 2015. The refurbishment included a different color scheme for the fa√ßade that is identical to the color scheme when it first opened, restored assets and special effects, refurbished boats, new LED lighting to replace the old stage lighting, and all 176 dolls in the ride being progressively replaced through 2017. The entrance and exit rooms have been completely revamped, being identical to the entrance scene in Hong Kong Disneyland's version and the exit scene in the Magic Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland versions (rendered in the Mary Blair style similar to the other parks). The soundtrack has been completely remastered with the base instrumental removed from the majority of the ride's audio except for the finale, making the soundtrack more similar to the original version. Additionally, new audio tracks are added including a new recording of someone yodeling to the tune of the song in the Switzerland scene. Hong Kong Disneyland It's a Small World at Hong Kong Disneyland The Hong Kong Disneyland version of the attraction is mostly modeled after the original Disneyland counterpart, using a canal for the boats to travel through instead of the open-ended water track found in the Magic Kingdom, Tokyo, and Paris versions. Some of this version's prominent and unique characteristics include: * 38 Disney characters (all rendered in the Mary Blair style) added to scenes where their stories originated This plan was originally supposed for the Magic Kingdom version of the attraction. * An expanded Asia sequence with Hong Kong, the Philippines and Korea represented with children singing in Cantonese, Tagalog and Korean, respectively, as well as an extended China scene with represented with children singing in Mandarin * A distinct Middle Eastern room, and scenes for North America, similar to the Paris version * Extraordinary fiber-optic lighting effects in the Finale room not seen on any other Disney attraction * Cantonese, Korean, Mandarin, and Tagalog versions of the song that were specifically recorded for Hong Kong Disneyland. The finale is sung in three languages: Cantonese, English and Mandarin. The attraction is the largest indoor attraction at Hong Kong Disneyland. It is situated beyond the Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad, next to Disney's Storybook Theater where Mickey and the Wondrous Book is performed daily. Holiday overlay \\"It's a Small World holiday\\" lighting display Since 1997, Disneyland has featured \\"It's a Small World Holiday\\" during the end-of-the-year Christmas and holiday season. The attraction is closed in late October to receive temporary holiday decorations inside and outside, and reopens in early November before the start of the busy holiday tourist season. After the holiday season, \\"It's a Small World Holiday\\" stays open until late January where it closes to remove the holiday overlay and return to classic \\"It's a Small World\\" in early February. Almost one million lights are included during the holidays. The overlay has proved very popular and has led to the installation of Fastpass machines. The attraction is the same boat voyage through many regions of the world, though the main theme song is not played in full. Instead, the children sing \\"Jingle Bells\\" and a bridge of \\"Deck the Halls\\" in addition to the main theme. Other versions of this overlay have been implemented at different international versions of the ride since. Since the holiday 2009 season, the Disney characters and The Spirit of America room (formerly the covered transition room) have joined in the \\"It's a Small World Holiday\\" at Disneyland. During the 2019 holiday season, Disney Imagineering added 3 new scents smells on \\"It's a Small World\\" Holiday. Since 1997, the European room has had a peppermint gingerbread scent, but now can be accompanied by 3 new scents such as, cherry blossoms in Asia, cinnamon in South America, and coconuts in the South Seas. Prior to the 2018 refurbishment, Tokyo Disneyland had a version of \\"It's a Small World Holiday\\" called \\"It's a Small World Very Merry Holidays.\\" Disneyland Paris had a version of the overlay in which the full holiday soundtrack was not used. For the 2009 winter season, it received an overhaul with an official name of \\"It's a Small World Celebration\\". The overhaul included new lighting and decorations throughout the ride, and the entire ride now uses the full \\"It's a Small World Holiday\\" soundtrack. Following a 2015 renovation, \\"It's a Small World Celebration\\" was planned to use an updated soundtrack originally set for winter 2016. However, it was delayed for unknown reasons. ‚ÄúIt's a Small World Celebration‚Äù returned for the 2017-2018 holiday season, featuring an updated soundtrack. Hong Kong Disneyland implemented its own version called \\"It's a Small World Christmas\\" that highlights the Disney character scenes in Christmas fashion with an appearance of Santa Claus in the North Pole scene. The Magic Kingdom does not have its own holiday edition of \\"It's a Small World\\", and the regular ride operates continuously through the holiday season. Planned film * On April 22, 2014, it was announced a feature film franchise about the ride was in the works, to be directed by Jon Turteltaub, written by Jared Stern, and produced by Turteltaub, Stern, and Dan Lin. No release date has been announced.

He was best known for his major project to drain the Everglades to recover land for agricultural cultivation. As governor, he built alliances with the federal government to gain funds for this project. He had previously served as the sheriff of Duval County, Florida and in the Florida House of Representatives. He was allied with the Straightouts, Populist-leaning elements of the Democratic Party in the state. Early life and education Broward's parents were American, and he had French heritage from his paternal line. His childhood was spent on a series of family farms along the St. Johns River in Jacksonville; during the Civil War, the original farm was burned by Union troops who occupied the town. After the war, the Browards had a tough time recovering. Napoleon's parents both died when he was still quite young. His brother and he tended the family farm for a few years before moving into the city with their uncle. Broward first worked on the river with this uncle, doing odd jobs on his uncle's steamboat during the summer. In 1876, having graduated high school, Broward became a ship's mate and traveled to New England. He stayed in that region for two years, working on ships along the New England coast. After gaining this experience, he returned to Jacksonville in 1878 and took a job working tugboats on the St. Johns River. He got to know many of the captains and shipping operations. Broward married his captain's daughter (Georgiana Carolina \\"Carrie\\" Kemp) in January 1883. That spring, he applied for a license to pilot ships over the St. Johns Bar, a constantly shifting sandbar that stretched across the mouth of the St. Johns, sometimes above water and sometimes many feet below. Piloting ships over the treacherous bar was quite lucrative. Broward seemed destined for a life of comfort until his wife died during childbirth in December, followed by the death of their infant son a few days later. He withdrew from the river for a while and again traveled north. By 1885, he was back on the St. Johns, piloting his father-in- law's steamboat Kate Spencer. While working on the ship, he met Annie Isabell Douglass, a frequent passenger. They were married in 1887. Political beginnings Broward established his reputation as a good pilot and captain. In January 1888, a major prison break disgraced the city's sheriff, and he was removed from office. The county Democratic leadership got together to nominate a new sheriff, and quickly settled on Broward as the best man for the job. The governor appointed him to the post on February 27. In less than a month, Broward gained statewide notoriety for breaking up gambling operations in the city. Broward soon took an active part in city politics. In the early 1890s, the Democratic Party in Florida was undergoing some internal strife. Two factions developed in Jacksonville that eventually became the major statewide camps, the Antis and the Straightouts. The Antis were conservative and pro- business, whereas the Straightouts were allied with Populists and agrarians. Broward joined the Straightout camp. In this period, Populists, sometimes in biracial alliances with Republicans, won numerous states in the South. The Democratic Party struggled to regain power in state legislatures. In the election of 1892, the Straightouts, under Broward's leadership, swept the city offices - Broward's close friends, John N.C. Stockton and John M. Barrs, became city attorney and councilman, respectively, while Broward retained the sheriff's office. (He was an indicted felon when elected.) The Antis continued to struggle for power; two years later, the split between the two camps was more severe. Antis and Straightouts accused each other of vote fraud, complaining to the secretary of state and the governor. Anti sympathizers held most of the state offices, and the Antis won out. Broward was replaced by a new appointee when the Antis regained power in the city. Cuban involvement In 1895, Broward, his brother, and an associate began building a new steamboat, The Three Friends. Located on Fort George Island, the proprietors of the boat-building company were John Joseph Daly and Charles Scammell. During the construction, Cuban insurgents began fighting for independence from Spain. Broward was approached by a prominent member of Jacksonville's Cuban community about shipping a load of munitions and some Cuban expatriates from Nassau to Cuba. Broward agreed, and in January 1896, The Three Friends shipped out of Jacksonville on her maiden voyage, bound for Cuba. Broward continued this military filibustering operation until President William McKinley declared war on Spain. Several times, he was nearly caught and destroyed by Spanish gunboats. Aware of Broward's identity, the Spanish ambassador to the United States demanded that the American be stopped and his ship impounded. U.S. authorities tried to catch him, but Broward eluded them by loading The Three Friends under cover of darkness in secluded locations, hiding her behind larger ships as she left the St. Johns, and picking up Cubans and munitions from other ships at various points near the mouth of the river. Except when trying to evade capture, Broward never pretended not to be a filibusterer. He gained notoriety around the state for his daring deeds. Return to politics In 1896, the Straightouts offered to nominate Broward for sheriff, but he was busy with his filibustering operation and declined. In 1900, the war ended and his filibustering days were over. Broward accepted the Democratic nomination for the State House and was elected almost without opposition. In the House, Broward supported many progressive initiatives, including a state dispensary bill and a law allowing insanity as grounds for divorce (at the request of powerful developer Henry Flagler). The most important law he supported was the Primary Election Law. Broward had long supported a primary election system to replace the state's convention system, which was controlled by a small clique headed by Flagler. A strong law was drawn up in the House, which Broward enthusiastically supported, but after the Senate weakened the bill substantially, he withdrew his support. The bill passed anyway. Broward was not na√Øve when it came to politics. As a Straightout and supporter of the \\"common man\\", Broward naturally opposed Flagler's control of the party nominating system in the state. It tended to produce Democratic candidates from the Anti faction. As Florida had disfranchised most blacks and was essentially a one-party state, Anti control of the party nominating system effectively meant Anti control of the state government. Broward was smart enough to sponsor Flagler's requested divorce bill, but still wanted to wrest power from the big man. Road to Florida's governor's Broward did not run for the House again in 1902, because he was busy with a salvage operation in the Keys. During the summer of 1903, he decided to run for the governorship. He had been approached numerous times during the spring and the summer about running for the office. As the party was hard pressed to find another liberal candidate, he agreed to do so. Broward was never wealthy, and in fact, frequently found himself in debt for one reason or another. The liberal forces in the state did not have great financial backing, while the conservative forces controlled most of the money and most of the newspapers in the state, as well as the major cities. Broward said of his chances, > I don't intend to go after the cities. Their newspapers are against me and > they don't take me seriously. But I'm going to stump every crossroads > village between Fernandina and Pensacola and talk to the farmers and the > crackers and show them their top ends were meant to be used for something > better than hatracks. I'm going to make 'em sit up and think. They won't > mind mistakes in grammar if they find I'm talking horse sense. Broward began campaigning immediately. His strongest opponent was Robert W. Davis, the railroad (and hence Flagler) candidate; two other candidates presented smaller threats. Broward hit Davis early and throughout the election for being a railroad man; Davis and the city newspapers generally derided Broward as a liberal whose time had passed and an idiot. The greatest issue in the campaign was Everglades drainage, a program first examined by the sitting governor, William S. Jennings. Broward came out strongly in favor of drainage, calling the ground \\"the fabulous muck.\\" While campaigning, he carried an elevation map of the various parts of the Glades; if Broward found that he was losing an argument over drainage, he would point to his map and say, \\"Water will run downhill!\\" Davis and Broward easily moved ahead into the second primary, and the campaign grew fiercer, with Davis at one point saying, \\"Mr. Broward is a man of but little ability and no intellectual brilliance whatever!\\" Broward used Davis' congressional record to repeatedly attack his voting in support of his railroad ties. Broward appealed to few urban voters and no business interests, while Davis could not win support among farmers or rural voters. On election day, Broward's rural voters gave him the primary victory by only 600 votes out of 45,000. The general election some weeks later was uneventful, and Broward was inaugurated on January 3, 1905. Governorship Broward's biggest push as governor was for drainage of the Everglades, then considered useless swamp, as people did not understand its ecology or relation to water table and habitat. Early in his term, Broward was attacked often and by many different people for his drainage program and for the land tax he instituted to pay for it. One newspaper noted, \\"The treasury will be drained before the Everglades.\\" As drainage progressed, Broward began taking his fiercest opponents for \\"ocular displays\\" in the Glades, showing them the work that had been done and how it was progressing. John Beard, one of Broward's most effective opponents, was eventually convinced by one of these trips that the land was fertile and that drainage was working. Broward gained national prominence through this massive program. As his administration progressed, Broward became more involved with legislators and officials in Washington, gaining federal funds for the drainage project. Eventually, he brought President Teddy Roosevelt down to the Glades for a trip through the drainage areas. Roosevelt was an avid supporter of drainage and became an important advocate for the program. Broward tackled other problems, as well; he worked to emphasize education and upgrade the state universities. His appointees assessed them as not offering much beyond the high-school level. Broward helped guide a reorganization bill through the legislature that closed some of the schools and set up a commission to determine where the remaining schools should be located. A fight ensued about where to locate the major state university, which at the time was in Lake City. The Control Board (consisting of Broward and the cabinet) eventually selected Gainesville as the new site for the flagship state university. Residents in both cities complained that the commission members had been bought off. Broward introduced a bill to the legislature in 1905 directing the state to provide life insurance for its citizens, and setting up an Insurance Commission and a cabinet-level post to go along with the program. The legislature voted the bill down with little debate. Broward supported measures to create a state textbook commission, reform the state hospital system, regulate the accounting profession, and make the state's Railroad Commission permanent. In December 1907, U.S. Senator Stephen R. Mallory, Jr. died suddenly. Broward appointed William James Bryan, Mallory's campaign manager and already a candidate for the seat, to fill the vacancy. Newspapers criticized his selection of Bryan, then only 31; the Tampa Tribune wrote, \\"if Mr. Bryan has given any symptoms of being worthy of this distinction then we are utterly at a loss to know it; it must be a weighty secret hidden in the governor's brain.\\" After the governorship In February 1908, Senator Bryan contracted typhoid fever and died in March, shocking the state. Broward appointed William Hall Milton to the post. Milton pledged not to run for the seat in November, and Broward soon announced that he was a candidate. He was roundly criticized for this, but took to the stump against his opponents, among them his old adversary John Beard and a former political ally, Jacksonville mayor Duncan U. Fletcher. Beard and Fletcher attacked Broward throughout the campaign, but the former governor prevailed in the first primary, and entered the second primary campaign against Fletcher. Broward's friend John Stockton advanced to the second primary in the governor's race, against General Albert Gilchrist of Fort Myers. Fletcher was an old liberal, and though now more conservative than Broward, the two men still agreed on many things. Gilchrist was much feared as a railroad man. Broward campaigned as much for Stockton for governor as he did for himself. Broward and Stockton both lost. Newspapers statewide loudly proclaimed the end of the Broward era, and the Everglades drainage project seemed doomed, but Broward was not through. The 1908 Democratic National Convention was to be held shortly in Denver, and Broward planned to attend. He had been mentioned for months in newspapers throughout the South as a potential candidate for the vice presidency, and he was nationally known for his drainage work and for his earlier filibustering. Upon arrival in Denver, he was greeted by banners reading: \\"Bryan, Broward, and Bread.\\" An editorial in the Denver Post spoke very favorably of him, concluding that he was an excellent choice for the position. Presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan telegraphed from his home, though, that he wanted a Midwesterner, rather than a Southerner. Although the crowd at the convention continued to back Broward, Bryan was able to name his own candidate. The 1908 election results were not all bad for Broward. Fletcher as senator was still a mild progressive and maintained his long friendship with Broward. Gilchrist proved to be much more liberal in the role of governor and became an avid supporter of draining the Everglades. In 1910, James Taliaferro's Senate seat was up for election. Big- city newspapers endorsed Taliaferro for re-election, but Broward soon entered the race against him. The race, expected to be an exciting showdown, proved to be such a bore that election news was pushed off the front page by coverage of Halley's Comet. Broward and Taliaferro entered the second primary after a quiet election. The second primary campaign proved scarcely more interesting, though Broward took to the stump, travelling throughout the state. After an exciting election-eve rally at which Broward's supporters got so carried away that Taliaferro left in disgust, Broward pulled out a victory. Exhausted by the campaign, Broward retired with his family to the beach at Fort George. Late in September, Broward took ill with gallstones, which had been a concern for some months, though Broward had been too busy for surgery. He was in the hospital for a few days, and died just before he was to enter surgery. He was buried on October 4. The Florida Times-Union wrote, Broward is one of the few Florida politicians to have achieved lasting national recognition. For many years after his death, his name was still well known in the state, as is Claude Pepper. As recently as the 1950s, Floridians still referred to the Broward era and to Browardism--remarkable staying power in a state that changed as much and so quickly. The main aspect of his legacy was the draining of the Everglades; opponents have argued this damaged the Everglades more than helped. Pro-Broward and pro-Floridan supporters believe these efforts were integral to establishing the Florida citrus industry as an international powerhouse. Racism \\"An arms smuggler as well as a racist\\", \\"in 1907 ... Broward proposed that every black person be physically evicted from the state.\\" According to the Sun-Sentinel, Broward was \\"an unapologetic segregationist.\\" In September, 2017, a Broward County lawyer, Bill Gelin, published an excerpt of a forgotten document that Broward wrote during his term and may have delivered as a speech. He called on Congress \\"to purchase territory, either domestic or foreign, and provide means to purchase the property of the negroes at a reasonable price and to transport them to the territory purchased by the United States.\\" Whites would not be allowed to live in the new nation, and blacks would not be allowed to return to live in the United States. (This is the \\"colonization\\" project of the 19th century, which led to the founding of Liberia and Sierra Leone. See American Colonization Society.) \\"The white people have no time to make excuses for the shortcomings of the negro,\\" he said. \\"And the negro has less inclination to work for one and be directed by one he considers exacting, to the extent that he must do a good day's work or pay for the bill of goods sold to him.\\" These remarks prompted a series of voices to call for removal of the statue of Broward from the Broward County Courthouse. County Mayor Barbara Sharief said she \\"would be open to discussion about renaming the county if it's what people want to do,\\" although she said shortly afterward that \\"we're not considering that at this time\\" and \\"I don't even want to go down that road.\\" The statue was removed during the night of October 18‚Äì19, 2017, and placed in storage.

The acronym OICW is often used to refer to the entire weapons program. It was started in the aftermath of the Advanced Combat Rifle (or ACR) during the 1980s. Like the ACR program, it has largely been a failure in terms of achieving the specific program goals (e.g., replacing the M16) and has cost millions of dollars, but has resulted in many innovative weapons and weapon concepts as well as offshoot programs of its own. Development A working XM25 prototype is tested in 2005; this was part of OICW Increment 2 The final four ACR program test entrants The central idea of the program was to develop a rifle that enabled the attacking of targets behind cover by using airburst munitions. The munitions were to be much smaller than pre-existing grenades and grenade launchers, but large enough to be effective. The idea was refined into a combination of a short assault rifle and semi-automatic, low-velocity cannon firing air-bursting munitions. The OICW aimed to use advances in computer technology in a weapon that fired grenades automatically pre-set to explode above or beside targets hidden from view. Fragmentation from the exploding grenades could hit the target when normal rifle fire could not. The winners of the first competition for the project during the 1990s were ATK and firearms manufacturer Heckler & Koch with the XM29 OICW. They went on to build numerous prototypes of the rifle for the United States military in the late 1990s. These projects centered on using a programmable 20 mm airburst munition-firing rifle by itself or with other projectile-based weapons attached. The 20 mm launcher was analyzed in various configurations, including a launcher by itself, with a 5.56 mm weapon (based on the HK G36), or with a MP7 PDW. By the early 2000s, the weapon had settled on a design and was classified as the XM29. The XM29 was based on the HK CAW (Close Assault Weapon) (Cal. 18.5√ó76mm or 12 Gauge non-conventional). However, the weapon had serious problems: it did not meet weight or cost targets, and the 20 mm High Explosive Air Bursting (HEAB) did not seem to be lethal enough in testing. To compound matters, the kinetic-energy component had to be light and short in length. As a result, the 5.56√ó45mm NATO barrel had a length of only 250 mm (9.8 inches), which is too short to generate enough muzzle velocity to be effective as a standard infantry rifle. It was also too heavy and too large to be operated effectively by a soldier. This resulted in the army starting development on new weapons, and finally shelving the XM29 in 2004. The kinetic energy component split off into the XM8 rifle program and the airburst component developed into the XM25 airburst weapon. According to a presentation by Major Kevin Finch, Chief of the Small Arms Division of the Directorate of Combat Developments at the U.S. Army Infantry Center, there were three main parts to the OICW program: * Increment 1 (OICW 1) was a competition for a whole weapon system family similar to the XM8. The weapon system was to potentially replace the M4 carbine, M16 rifle, M249 light machine gun and some M9 pistols. Other arms companies had contended that the OICW project goals had changed enough to warrant another competition. Potential challengers could include a weapons system based on an updated M16, the Steyr AUG, the FN SCAR, and potentially any other manufacturer that fulfilled the Army requirements for participating. It also listed the shotgun being replaced by a modular shotgun system (XM26 LSS) mounted on the OICW 1 winner. The Increment 1 portion was put on an eight-week hold in July 2005, primarily to take into account input and needs of other services. On October 31, 2005, the OICW I program was cancelled. The reason given for the cancellation was stated as: \\"This action has been taken in order for the Army to reevaluate its priorities for small caliber weapons, and to incorporate emerging requirements identified during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Government will also incorporate studies looking into current capability gaps during said reevaluation.\\" * OICW Increment 2 was a stand-alone airburst weapon the (XM25).

He took the name Dick Sargent from a Saturday Evening Post illustrator/artist of the same name. Early life and career Sargent was born Richard Stanford Cox in Carmel-by- the-Sea, California, on April 19, 1930, to Ruth McNaughton, daughter of John McNaughton (who founded Los Angeles's famed Union Stockyards). She appeared under the 'nome d'arte' (stage name) of Ruth Powell, and had important supporting bit roles in such films as The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and Hearts and Trumps with the great Nazimova. Sargent's father, Colonel Elmer Cox, who served in World War I, later became a business manager to such Hollywood alumni as Douglas Fairbanks and Erich von Stroheim. Sargent attended the San Rafael Military Academy in San Rafael, California before majoring in drama at Stanford University. He appeared two dozen plays with the Stanford Players Theater. Sargent appeared in feature films following his debut in Prisoner of War (1954). He appeared in The Great Locomotive Chase (1956) starring Fess Parker. In the 1957 movie Bernardine, the little-known Sargent had his most important role to date, as lovesick teenager Sanford \\"Fofo\\" Wilson. The character was the main focus of the story, but Sargent's work was overshadowed by the presence of several famous names in the cast, including Hollywood legend Janet Gaynor, sitcom star Ronnie Burns and Pat Boone, who had just become a singing sensation and was making his film debut. Sargent appeared in the 1959 feature film Operation Petticoat starring Cary Grant and The Ghost and Mr. Chicken starring Don Knotts in 1966. He was a regular on three short-lived television comedies, One Happy Family in 1961, Broadside in 1964, and The Tammy Grimes Show, a four-episode ABC flop in 1966. For three seasons, from 1969 to 1972, he played Darrin Stephens on Bewitched, replacing ailing actor Dick York, a role he had previously turned down. His later movies included the crime drama Hardcore (1979) as Jake Van Dorn's strait-laced brother-in-law, Wes DeJong, and as Dr. Jameson in the sci-fi horror film Parts: The Clonus Horror (1979). He also played Sheriff Grady Byrd on two 1979‚Äì1980 season episodes of The Dukes of Hazzard. Sargent continued to work in film. He played Harry in Live a Little, Love a Little (1968) opposite Elvis Presley and Michele Carey and made guest appearances on television series such as Navy Log, The West Point Story, Medic, Code 3, Ripcord, Gunsmoke, Wagon Train, The Alaskans, Ozzie and Harriet, The Rat Patrol, I Dream of Jeannie, Hazel, Dr. Kildare, Daniel Boone, Kraft Mystery Theater, Three's Company, The Waltons, Charlie's Angels, Knots Landing, Family Ties, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Adam-12, The Streets of San Francisco, Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law, Ellery Queen, The Tony Randall Show, The Devlin Connection, Baretta, Switch, The Six Million Dollar Man, Marcus Welby, M.D., Trapper John, M.D., Matt Houston, Alice, Taxi, Benson, Vega$, Diff'rent Strokes, Here's Lucy, Love American Style, The Yellow Rose, The Commish, Finder of Lost Loves, Murder, She Wrote. L.A. Law and Harry and the Hendersons. In 1990, he also portrayed himself on an episode of Columbo. In the mid-1980s, he landed the steady role of Richard Preston, the widowed father, in the TBS sitcom Down to Earth. He also appeared in the fantasy comedy Teen Witch (1989). Throughout the 1980s, he joined actress Sally Struthers as an advocate for Christian Children's Fund, which brought relief to children in developing nations. Sargent also did charitable work for the Special Olympics, World Hunger, AIDS Project Los Angeles and the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Personal life On National Coming Out Day in 1991, Sargent publicly declared his homosexuality and supported gay rights issues. The high rate of suicide among young gay people was the main reason; he jokingly referred to himself as a \\"retroactive role model.\\" Sargent recognized that his ill health from prostate cancer may have led people to assume he suffered from AIDS. Sargent had a long-time companion with whom he lived for over 20 years, before the unidentified man died from a cerebral haemorrhage in 1979. He later lived with his domestic partner, Albert Williams, until his death. In June 1992, Sargent was a Grand Marshal of the Los Angeles Gay Pride parade along with Elizabeth Montgomery. In 1975 Sargent appeared on the television show TattleTales, with Fannie Flagg as his \\"beard.\\" Death Sargent was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1989. Doctors were initially optimistic that it could be treated. However, the disease continued to spread and, by early 1994, he had become seriously ill. Sargent died from the disease on July 8, 1994, at age 64. His body was cremated. Former Bewitched co-star Elizabeth Montgomery commented, \\"He was a great friend, and I will miss his love, his sense of humor and his remarkable courage.\\" Montgomery herself died of colon cancer less than a year later.

Originally formed as a short spur to connect Denton, Texas with Fort Worth, Texas, it has since been extended to Oklahoma and Mexico. Route description=Texas The southern terminus is in Del Rio, Texas at an intersection with U.S. Route 90. It goes north of town co-signed with U.S. Route 277 for 20 miles (32 km). After splitting off, it enters Edwards County and Carta Valley. It meets SH 55 at the county seat, Rocksprings, before serving as the western terminus of SH 41. It heads northeast into Kimble County, crossing the county line near Telegraph. At Junction, Texas, it meets both Interstate 10 and US 83. It then continues northeast through London, extreme southeastern Menard County, and Mason County. In Mason County, US 377 passes through Streeter before forming a concurrency with SH 29 near Grit. In Mason, SH 29 splits off to its own alignment while US 377 turns north to join U.S. Route 87. US 87/377 head north together into Brady, where they meet US 190, the southern terminus of US 283, and SH 71. US 377 splits off to the north and heads to Mercury and crosses the Colorado River near Winchell. In Brownwood, US 377 joins with U.S. Route 67, following its routing all the way to Stephenville, where US 377 splits off on its own again. US 377 then enters Hood County, where it passes through the county seat, Granbury. It cuts the corners of both Johnson County and Parker County before entering Tarrant County and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. US 377 crosses Interstate 20 at exit 429A in Benbrook. It then enters Fort Worth proper, meeting SH 183 and Spur 580. It runs northeast on Camp Bowie Blvd. to Interstate 30, which it begins a concurrency with. At the Interstate 35W junction, it heads north along that highway before splitting off at Exit 52A (Belknap St.). It heads due north at the Denton Highway and continues to run parallel to I-35W through many D/FW suburbs, including Haltom City, Watauga, Keller, Westlake, Roanoke, and Argyle. In Denton, it crosses Interstate 35E and has a brief concurrency with US 380 through the eastern portion of Denton into Crossroads. After splitting from US 380, US 377 runs through Crossroads and north into Krugerville. It continues through Aubrey, through Pilot Point, Tioga, and Collinsville, before having an interchange with US 82 at Whitesboro. It the heads north to cross Lake Texoma (the Red River) into Oklahoma. Oklahoma US 377 is co-signed with State Highway 99 for its entire Oklahoma length. US 377's first junction within Oklahoma is with SH-32 west of Kingston. The first town that US 377/SH-99 pass through is Madill, where the two highways meet US 70 and State Highway 199. The next town after that is Tishomingo, where there is a brief concurrency with SH-22. US 377/SH-99 run north from Tishomingo, having a one-mile (1.6 km) three-route concurrency with SH-7 before meeting State Highway 3 southeast of Ada. US 377/SH-99 run around the east and north sides of town. On the north side of Ada, SH-3E joins the concurrency. After leaving Ada, US 377/SH-3E/99 pass through Byng. The three highways cross the Canadian River just south of a junction that serves as the eastern terminus of SH-39 and the western terminus of SH-56. North of Bowlegs, SH-59 joins with the other routes briefly. The next major town is Seminole, where the highways meet SH-9, and SH-3E splits off. US 377/SH-99 cross I-40 at Exit 200. The highways have a junction with US 62 in Prague. As of 2007, the highway's northern terminus is in Stroud, Oklahoma at an indeterminate point somewhere between old Route 66 (now Oklahoma State Highway 66) and modern Interstate 44. SH-99 continues north into Kansas. History=U.S. 377 in Texas When US 377 was commissioned in 1930, US 77 connected Dallas, Texas with the north and south, but nearby Fort Worth lacked a direct northern connection. US 377 connected US 77 in Denton, Texas with US 81 in Fort Worth, forming a parallel route between Denton and Hillsboro, where US 81 met US 77\\\\. When the Interstate highway system was built, I-35 paralleled the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth split with routes I-35E through Dallas (along US 77) and I-35W through Fort Worth (along US 377 and US 81). The section of US 377 in Texas north of Denton was signed as SH 99 until 1968. The \\"Willis Bridge\\" crossing the Red River was constructed in 1968. It has guardrail damage causing the remaining bridge to be very narrow and has since been considered structurally deficient. Parts of the bridge have collapsed. An original ETA of replacement was February 2018, costing $80 million. In November 2018, the Oklahoma Transportation Commission awarded a $43 million contract to replace the bridge with a new two-lane bridge scheduled to start construction in late December 2018 or early January 2019. U.S. 377 remained a two-lane highway between Denton and Fort Worth. It has since been widened with more construction scheduled. North of Denton, U.S. 377 is currently two lanes. Oklahoma State Highway 99=Major intersections=Texas State Highway Loop 118 Texas State Highway Loop 118 (Loop 118) is a short and unsigned loop highway. The highway connects Highway 377 to Business State Highway 114 (Bus. SH 114) without the need for an intersection between those highways. The loop is just long, and is located entirely within the downtown portion of the town of Roanoke, Texas. The highway was first designated on February 4, 1941. The original route traveled from US 377 just south of Roanoke, along Oak Street, past Bus. SH 114 northward to SH 114, with State Highway Spur 118 (Spur 118) going from Loop 118 to US 377 via Denton Drive. On September 26, 1996, the stretch of Oak St. traveling from US 377 to Denton Dr. was given back to the city of Roanoke.

No further transmissions were received by bases from Escolar, but Perch and Croaker recorded intra-ship communications with her until 17 October, when Perch received a routine message from Escolar giving her position and course. She was never heard from again. Had Escolar ended her patrol on the scheduled date, she would have arrived at Midway Island about 13 November 1944. All attempts to contact Escolar failed, and she was reported on 27 November 1944 as presumed lost. Information supplied by the Japanese on anti-submarine attacks gives no clue as to the cause of her loss, but the Yellow Sea area is thought to have been mined. Her course as transmitted to Perch does not cross any known Japanese minefields, but positions of mines laid before April 1945 are not precisely known. However, the most likely explanation for her end remains that she detonated a naval mine. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) Type D Escort Destroyer Number 38 reported having contact with and sinking a US Navy submarine on 19 October 1944 near Escolars expected position. They \\"fired about 30 depth charges and then observed a heavy oil slick on the surface and a lot of gear from an enemy submarine floated to the surface.\\" This could be the fate of Escolar as no other US submarines were in the area and no contact was made with Escolar after this. http://www.combinedfleet.com/CD-38_t.htm In 1973 a -tall stone memorial was dedicated to Escolar.

Its story chronicles pre-colonial life in the southeastern part of Nigeria and the arrival of Europeans during the late 19th century. It is seen as the archetypal modern African novel in English, and one of the first to receive global critical acclaim. It is a staple book in schools throughout Africa and is widely read and studied in English-speaking countries around the world. The novel was first published in the UK in 1962 by William Heinemann Ltd., and became the first work published in Heinemann's African Writers Series. The novel follows the life of Okonkwo, an Igbo (\\"Ibo\\" in the novel) man and local wrestling champion in the fictional Nigerian clan of Umuofia. The work is split into three parts, with the first describing his family, personal history, and the customs and society of the Igbo, and the second and third sections introducing the influence of European colonialism and Christian missionaries on Okonkwo, his family, and the wider Igbo community. Things Fall Apart was followed by a sequel, No Longer at Ease (1960), originally written as the second part of a larger work along with Arrow of God (1964). Achebe states that his two later novels A Man of the People (1966) and Anthills of the Savannah (1987), while not featuring Okonkwo's descendants, are spiritual successors to the previous novels in chronicling African history. Plot=Part 1 The novel's protagonist, Okonkwo, is famous in the villages of Umuofia for being a wrestling champion, defeating a wrestler nicknamed \\"Amalinze The Cat\\" (because he never lands on his back). Okonkwo is strong, hard-working, and strives to show no weakness. He wants to dispel his father Unoka's tainted legacy of unpaid debts, a neglected wife and children, and cowardice at the sight of blood. Okonkwo works to build his wealth entirely on his own, as Unoka died a shameful death and left many unpaid debts. He is also obsessed with his masculinity, and any slight compromise to this is swiftly destroyed. As a result, he often beats his wives and children, and is unkind to his neighbours. However, his drive to escape the legacy of his father leads him to be wealthy, courageous, and powerful among the people of his village. He is a leader of his village, having attained a position in his society for which he has striven all his life.Irele, F. Abiola, \\"The Crisis of Cultural Memory in Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart\\", African Studies Quarterly, Volume 4, Issue 3, Fall 2000, pp. 1‚Äì40. Okonkwo is selected by the elders to be the guardian of Ikemefuna, a boy taken by the clan as a peace settlement between Umuofia and another clan after Ikemefuna's father killed an Umuofian woman. The boy lives with Okonkwo's family and Okonkwo grows fond of him, although Okonkwo does not show his fondness so as not to appear weak. The boy looks up to Okonkwo and considers him a second father. The Oracle of Umuofia eventually pronounces that the boy must be killed. Ezeudu, the oldest man in the village, warns Okonkwo that he should have nothing to do with the murder because it would be like killing his own child ‚Äì but to avoid seeming weak and feminine to the other men of the village, Okonkwo disregards the warning from the old man, striking the killing blow himself even as Ikemefuna begs his \\"father\\" for protection. For many days after killing Ikemefuna, Okonkwo feels guilty and saddened. Shortly after Ikemefuna's death, things begin to go wrong for Okonkwo. He falls into a great depression, as he has been greatly traumatized by the act of murdering his own adopted son. His sickly daughter Ezinma falls unexpectedly ill and it is feared she may die; during a gun salute at Ezeudu's funeral, Okonkwo's gun accidentally explodes and kills Ezeudu's son. He and his family are sent into exile for seven years to appease the gods he has offended. Part 2 While Okonkwo is away in Mbanta, he learns that white men are living in Umuofia with the intent of introducing their religion, Christianity. As the number of converts increases, the foothold of the white people grows and a new government is introduced. The village is forced to respond with either appeasement or resistance to the imposition of the white people's nascent society. Okonkwo‚Äôs son Nwoye starts getting curious about the missionaries and the new religion. After he is beaten by his father for the last time, he decides to leave his family behind and live independently. He wants to be with the missionaries because his beliefs have changed while being introduced to Christianity by Mr. Brown. In the last year of his exile, Okonkwo wants his best friend Obierika to sell all of his yams and to buy two men to build him two huts so he can have a house to go back to with his family. Okonkwo also wants a feast for his mother's kinsmen before he leaves his exile. Part 3 Returning from exile, Okonkwo finds his village changed by the presence of the white men. After a convert commits a heinous act by unmasking an elder as he embodies an ancestral spirit of the clan, the village retaliates by destroying a local Christian church. In response, the District Commissioner representing the colonial government takes Okonkwo and several other native leaders prisoner pending payment of a fine of two hundred cowries. Despite the District Commissioner's instructions to treat the leaders of Umuofia with respect, the native \\"court messengers\\" humiliate them, doing things such as shaving their heads and whipping them. As a result, the people of Umuofia finally gather for what could be a great uprising. Okonkwo, a warrior by nature and adamant about following Umuofian custom and tradition, despises any form of cowardice and advocates war against the white men. When messengers of the white government try to stop the meeting, Okonkwo beheads one of them. Because the crowd allows the other messengers to escape and does not fight alongside Okonkwo, he realizes with despair that the people of Umuofia are not going to fight to protect themselves ‚Äì his society's response to such a conflict, which for so long had been predictable and dictated by tradition, is changing. When the District Commissioner comes to Okonkwo's house to take him to court, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself to avoid being tried in a colonial court. Among his own people, Okonkwo's actions have tarnished his reputation and status, as it is strictly against the teachings of the Igbo to commit suicide. The District Commissioner reflects that Okonkwo's story will make for a good page in his book, or perhaps a \\"reasonable paragraph\\". Characters * Okonkwo, the protagonist, has three wives and ten (total) children and becomes a leader of his clan. His father, Unoka, was weak and lazy, and Okonkwo resents him for his weaknesses: he enacts traditional masculinity. Okonkwo strives to make his way in a culture that traditionally values manliness. * Ekwefi is Okonkwo's second wife. Although she falls in love with Okonkwo after seeing him in a wrestling match, she marries another man because Okonkwo is too poor to pay her bride price at that time. Two years later, she runs away to Okonkwo's compound one night and later marries him. She receives severe beatings from Okonkwo just like his other wives; but unlike them, she is known to talk back to Okonkwo. * Unoka is Okonkwo's father, who defied typical Igbo masculinity by neglecting to grow yams, take care of his wives and children, and pay his debts before he dies. * Nwoye is Okonkwo's son, about whom Okonkwo worries, fearing that he will become like Unoka. Similar to Unoka, Nwoye does not subscribe to the traditional Igbo view of masculinity being equated to violence; rather, he prefers the stories of his mother. Nwoye connects to Ikemefuna, who presents an alternative to Okonkwo's rigid masculinity. He is one of the early converts to Christianity and takes on the Christian name Isaac, an act which Okonkwo views as a final betrayal. * Ikemefuna is a boy from the Mbaino tribe. His father murders the wife of an Umuofia man, and in the resulting settlement of the matter, Ikemefuma is put into the care of Okonkwo. By the decision of Umuofian authorities, Ikemefuna is ultimately killed, an act which Okonkwo does not prevent, and even participates in, lest he seems feminine and weak. Ikemefuna became very close to Nwoye, and Okonkwo's decision to participate in Ikemefuna's death takes a toll on Okonkwo's relationship with Nwoye. * Ezinma is Okonkwo's favourite daughter and the only child of his wife Ekwefi. Ezinma, the Crystal Beauty, is very much the antithesis of a normal woman within the culture and Okonkwo routinely remarks that she would've made a much better boy than a girl, even wishing that she had been born as one. Ezinma often contradicts and challenges her father, which wins his adoration, affection, and respect. She is very similar to her father, and this is made apparent when she matures into a beautiful young woman who refuses to marry during her family's exile, instead choosing to help her father regain his place of respect within society. * Obierika is Okonkwo's best friend from Umuofia. Unlike Okonkwo, Obierika thinks before he acts and is therefore less violent and arrogant than Okonkwo. He is considered the voice of reason in the book, and questions certain parts of their culture, such as the necessity to exile Okonkwo after he unintentionally kills a boy. Obierika's own son, Maduka, is greatly admired by Okonkwo for his wrestling prowess. * Ogbuefi Ezeudu is one of the elders of Umuofia. * Mr. Brown is a white man who comes to Umuofia. Kind and compassionate, he shows kindness and compassion towards the villagers, making an effort to respect and understand the Igbo beliefs. Background The title is a quotation from \\"The Second Coming\\", a poem by W. B. Yeats. Most of the story takes place in the fictional village of Iguedo, which is in the Umuofia clan. Umuofia is located west of the actual city of Onitsha, on the east bank of the Niger River in Nigeria. The events of the novel unfold in the 1890s. The culture depicted, that of the Igbo people, is similar to that of Achebe's birthplace of Ogidi, where Igbo-speaking people lived together in groups of independent villages ruled by titled elders. The customs described in the novel mirror those of the actual Onitsha people, who lived near Ogidi, and with whom Achebe was familiar. Within forty years of the colonization of Nigeria, by the time Achebe was born in 1930, the missionaries were well established. He was influenced by Western culture but he refused to change his Igbo name Chinua to Albert. Achebe's father was among the first to be converted in Ogidi, around the turn of the century. Achebe himself was an orphan raised by his grandfather. His grandfather, far from opposing Achebe's conversion to Christianity, allowed Achebe's Christian marriage to be celebrated in his compound. Language choice Achebe wrote his novels in English because the written standard Igbo language was created by combining various dialects, creating a stilted written form. In a 1994 interview with The Paris Review, Achebe said, \\"the novel form seems to go with the English language. There is a problem with the Igbo language. It suffers from a very serious inheritance which it received at the beginning of this century from the Anglican mission. They sent out a missionary by the name of Dennis. Archdeacon Dennis. He was a scholar. He had this notion that the Igbo language‚Äîwhich had very many different dialects‚Äîshould somehow manufacture a uniform dialect that would be used in writing to avoid all these different dialects. Because the missionaries were powerful, what they wanted to do they did. This became the law. But the standard version cannot sing. There's nothing you can do with it to make it sing. It's heavy. It's wooden. It doesn't go anywhere.\\"Brooks, Jerome, \\"Chinua Achebe, The Art of Fiction No. 139\\", The Paris Review No. 133 (Winter 1994). Achebe's choice to write in English has caused controversy. While both African and non-African critics agree that Achebe modelled Things Fall Apart on classic European literature, they disagree about whether his novel upholds a Western model, or, in fact, subverts or confronts it.Booker (2003), p. 7. Achebe continued to defend his decision: \\"English is something you spend your lifetime acquiring, so it would be foolish not to use it. Also, in the logic of colonization and decolonization it is actually a very powerful weapon in the fight to regain what was yours. English was the language of colonization itself. It is not simply something you use because you have it anyway.\\"Sickels, Amy. \\"The Critical Reception of Things Fall Apart\\", in Booker (2011). Achebe is noted for his inclusion of and weaving in of proverbs from Igbo oral culture into his writing.Jayalakshmi V. Rao, Mrs A. V. N. College, \\"Proverb and Culture in the Novels of Chinua Achebe\\", African Postcolonial Literature in English. This influence was explicitly referenced by Achebe in Things Fall Apart: \\"Among the Igbo the art of conversation is regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm-oil with which words are eaten.\\" Literary significance and reception Things Fall Apart is regarded as a milestone in African literature. It has come to be seen as the archetypal modern African novel in English,Kwame Anthony Appiah (1992), \\"Introduction\\" to the Everyman's Library edition. and is read in Nigeria and throughout Africa. It is studied widely in Europe, India, and North America, where it has spawned numerous secondary and tertiary analytical works. It has achieved similar status and repute in Australia and Oceania. Considered Achebe's magnum opus, it has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide. Time magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005.\\"All-TIME 100 Novels Full list\\", Time, 16 October 2005. The novel has been translated into more than 50 languages, and is often used in literature, world history, and African studies courses across the world. Achebe is now considered to be the essential novelist on African identity, nationalism, and decolonization. Achebe's main focus has been cultural ambiguity and contestation. The complexity of novels such as Things Fall Apart depends on Achebe's ability to bring competing cultural systems and their languages to the same level of representation, dialogue, and contestation. Reviewers have praised Achebe's neutral narration and have described Things Fall Apart as a realistic novel. Much of the critical discussion about Things Fall Apart concentrates on the socio- political aspects of the novel, including the friction between the members of Igbo society as they confront the intrusive and overpowering presence of Western government and beliefs. Ernest N. Emenyonu commented that \\"Things Fall Apart is indeed a classic study of cross-cultural misunderstanding and the consequences to the rest of humanity, when a belligerent culture or civilization, out of sheer arrogance and ethnocentrism, takes it upon itself to invade another culture, another civilization.\\"Whittaker, David, \\"Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart\\", New York, 2007, p. 59. Achebe's writing about African society, in telling from an African point of view the story of the colonization of the Igbo, tends to extinguish the misconception that African culture had been savage and primitive. In Things Fall Apart, western culture is portrayed as being \\"arrogant and ethnocentric,\\" insisting that the African culture needed a leader. As it had no kings or chiefs, Umuofian culture was vulnerable to invasion by western civilization. It is felt that the repression of the Igbo language at the end of the novel contributes greatly to the destruction of the culture. Although Achebe favours the African culture of the pre-western society, the author attributes its destruction to the \\"weaknesses within the native structure.\\" Achebe portrays the culture as having a religion, a government, a system of money, and an artistic tradition, as well as a judicial system. Influence and legacy The publication of Achebe's Things Fall Apart helped pave the way for numerous other African writers. Novelists who published after Achebe were able to find an eloquent and effective mode for the expression of the particular social, historical, and cultural situation of modern Africa. Before Things Fall Apart was published, most of the novels about Africa had been written by European authors, portraying Africans as savages who were in need of western enlightenment. Achebe broke from this outsider view, by portraying Igbo society in a sympathetic light. This allows the reader to examine the effects of European colonialism from a different perspective. He commented: \\"The popularity of Things Fall Apart in my own society can be explained simply ... this was the first time we were seeing ourselves, as autonomous individuals, rather than half-people, or as Conrad would say, 'rudimentary souls'.\\" The language of the novel has not only intrigued critics but has also been a major factor in the emergence of the modern African novel. Because Achebe wrote in English, portrayed Igbo life from the point of view of an African man, and used the language of his people, he was able to greatly influence African novelists, who viewed him as a mentor. Achebe's fiction and criticism continue to inspire and influence writers around the world. Hilary Mantel, the Booker Prize- winning novelist in a 7 May 2012 article in Newsweek, \\"Hilary Mantel's Favorite Historical Fictions\\", lists Things Fall Apart as one of her five favourite novels in this genre. A whole new generation of African writers ‚Äì Caine Prize winners Binyavanga Wainaina (current director of the Chinua Achebe Center at Bard College) and Helon Habila (Waiting for an Angel [2004] and Measuring Time [2007]), as well as Uzodinma Iweala (Beasts of No Nation [2005]), and Professor Okey Ndibe (Arrows of Rain [2000]) count Chinua Achebe as a significant influence. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the author of the popular and critically acclaimed novels Purple Hibiscus (2003) and Half of a Yellow Sun (2006), commented in a 2006 interview: \\"Chinua Achebe will always be important to me because his work influenced not so much my style as my writing philosophy: reading him emboldened me, gave me permission to write about the things I knew well.\\" Things Fall Apart was listed by Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as one of \\"12 Novels Considered the 'Greatest Book Ever Written'\\".Hogeback, Jonathan, \\"12 Novels Considered the 'Greatest Book Ever Written'\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. The 60th anniversary of the first publication of Things Fall Apart was celebrated at the South Bank Centre in London, UK, on 15 April 2018 with live readings from the book by Femi Elufowoju Jr, Adesua Etomi, Yomi Sode, Lucian Msamati, Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, Chibundu Onuzo, Ellah Wakatama Allfrey, Ben Okri, and Margaret Busby.Murua, James, \\"Chinua Achebe‚Äôs 'Things Fall Apart' at 60 celebrated\\", James Murua's Literature Blog, 24 April 2018.Hewitt, Eddie, \\"Brnging Achebe's Masterpiece to Life\\", Brittle Paper, 24 April 2018. On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Things Fall Apart on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Film, television, music and theatrical adaptations A radio drama called Okonkwo was made of the novel in April 1961 by the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. It featured Wole Soyinka in a supporting role.Ezenwa-Ohaeto (1997). Chinua Achebe: A Biography Bloomington: Indiana University Press, p. 81. . In 1970, the novel was made into a film starring Princess Elizabeth of Toro by Francis Oladele and Wolf Schmidt, executive producers Hollywood lawyer Edward Mosk and his wife Fern, who wrote the screenplay. Directed by Jason Pohland.Filmportal. \\"Things Fall Apart‚Äú. In 1987, the book was made into a very successful miniseries directed by David Orere and broadcast on Nigerian television by the Nigerian Television Authority. It starred several established film actors, including Pete Edochie, Nkem Owoh, and Sam Loco Efe. In 1999, the American hip-hop band The Roots released their fourth studio album Things Fall Apart in reference to Achebe's novel. A theatrical production of Things Fall Apart, adapted by Biyi Bandele, took place at the Kennedy Center that year as well. In 2008, a film adaptation of Things Fall Apart was made by a Nigerian production company with an all-Nigerian cast. Pete Edochie starred as Okonkwo. In 2019, the lyrics of \\"No Holiday for Madiba\\", a song honoring Nelson Mandela include the phrase, \\"things fall apart\\", in reference to the book's title.

The band initially planned for Tchad Blake, producer of their first album Ruby Vroom, to produce the album, but the death of a family member in a car accident caused Blake to take a hiatus. Over the objections of his bandmates and his record label, Slash Records/Warner Bros., frontman Mike Doughty (then billed as \\"M. Doughty\\") hired producer David Kahne (Fishbone, The Bangles, Sublime, Tony Bennett, Sugar Ray, The Strokes); he was intent on following up the wild sonics of Ruby Vroom with a tightly wound, trembly, New Wave‚Äìinspired record. The tracking, at Manhattan's Power Station recording studio, was complete in eleven days, and Doughty was jubilant at the results. Doughty tapped Steve Fisk to produce the tune \\"Unmarked Helicopters\\" for The X-Files soundtrack Songs in the Key of X. All of Irresistible Blisss songs were produced by Kahne, except tracks 2 and 6 (by Fisk) and track 12 by the band themselves. The mixing process split the tracks between three mixers: Kahne, Chris Shaw, and Ruby producer Tchad Blake, who intervened when bass player Sebastian Steinberg briefly quit the band.

It was directed by Mick Jackson and co-written by Robert Wiener based on Wiener's book of the same title. The movie was released during the prelude stage of the Iraq War. Michael Keaton stars as CNN on-location producer Robert Wiener in Baghdad, Iraq during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. The movie focuses on the news media's (primarily CNN's) coverage of the war. Fundamentally an action‚Äìdrama, the characters grapple with the ethics and implications of 24-hour journalism in the days leading up to and during the United States-led bombing of Baghdad. Plot On August 2, 1990, Iraqi forces and tanks roll into Kuwait City, as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait begins. In Atlanta, CNN picks Robert Wiener (Michael Keaton) and his crew to go to Baghdad and cover the invasion. At Rome International Airport, Wiener meets his colleague and producer Ingrid Formanek (Helena Bonham Carter). Wiener and his crew arrive in Baghdad on August 23, and stay at the Al-Rasheed Hotel. As they settle in their hotel rooms, they notice that they are being monitored. The crew report their first story on a young British boy held as a hostage by Saddam Hussein (Jerry Haleva). As they continue to report stories, they get pressured by the Iraqi government. Wiener later meets the Iraqi Minister of Information Naji Al Hadithi (David Suchet), and requests pieces of equipment and an interview with Hussein. As the movie goes on, Wiener and Al Hadithi become friends. Wiener and his crew get access to interview Americans forced to stay in the country by the Iraqi government. The Iraqis use the American hostages as human shields for potential bombing sites. After Wiener's crew interview an American named Bob Vinton (Murphy Dunne), Vinton goes missing. Wiener becomes worried about Vinton. Later, Al Hadithi gives CBS and Dan Rather the Saddam Hussein interview. Instead of the Hussein interview, Al Hadithi gives Wiener and his crew a trip to Kuwait. They arrive in Jahra Air Force Base, Kuwait on October 17. The crew cover the incubator story in three hospitals, but then Iraqis call off the interviews because the CNN crew broke some ground rules. As soon as they arrive back in Baghdad, Wiener and the crew become the story as the only Americans to be in Kuwait. After an argument between Wiener and Al Hadithi, Al Hadithi agrees to give CNN a Saddam Hussein interview. On October 29, Bernard Shaw (Robert Wisdom) and the CNN crew interview Saddam Hussein at one of his presidential palaces. In the interview, Hussein states that Iraq withdrawing from Kuwait would be like the U.S. withdrawing from Hawaii. The crew then covers the release of American hostages from Iraq. Wiener then finds Bob Vinton and is emotionally moved by his being safe. The United Nations gives Iraq until January 15, 1991 to withdraw from Kuwait, or face military action. As the deadline comes to an end the crew sees that the Iraqi Army is installing anti-aircraft guns in Baghdad. The crew then gets a piece of equipment called the four-wire, which gives them communications to CNN in Atlanta. The four-wire is essentially a direct phone line to their CNN facility in Jordan. From that point it can hit the satellite above and then go to the CNN headquarters in Atlanta. The Iraqis eventually find out that the crew have established communication with Atlanta. The CNN crew is the only foreign news group with the four wire. On January 9, the crew eventually believe that there will be war. Bernard Shaw arrives in Baghdad again on January 13 to interview Saddam Hussein again at the deadline. As soon as the deadline expires, streets in Baghdad are empty and businesses are shut down. Americans and foreign news groups begin evacuating Baghdad on January 15 in fear of American bombing strikes. Wiener decides to stay, and some members of the crew decide to leave. At around 3 a.m. on January 17, U.S. F-117 Nighthawk stealth bombers begin to bomb Baghdad. Iraqi soldiers begin to fire anti- aircraft guns into the sky to shoot down the bombers. As soon as the bombing strikes begin, CNN correspondents Bernard Shaw (Robert Wisdom), John Holliman (John Carroll Lynch) and Peter Arnett (Bruce McGill) begin to report and describe the bombings on the four-wire communicator. The reports are broadcast live on CNN in America. The film shows the points of view from Saddam Hussein and U.S. President George H. W. Bush watching the CNN reports. It also intersperses actual archival footage of news anchors from rival networks, having to report off CNN's live feed, since CNN was the only news source transmitting during the bombing of Baghdad. Other archival footage is of Dick Cheney, during a news conference as Bush's Defense Secretary, stating \\"The best coverage I've seen of what transpired in Baghdad was on CNN\\", and NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw stating, \\"CNN used to be called the little network that could. It's no longer a little network.\\" At around 5 a.m., the crew is forced to stop reporting by Al Hadithi and Iraqi soldiers. Most of the crew leaves Baghdad, including Formanek and Shaw. Wiener stays, returning to America on January 23. The film ends showing the destruction of buildings from bombings in Baghdad. Cast * Michael Keaton as Robert Wiener, a CNN producer who braves Iraq and refuses to flee when all the other news broadcasters have fled Iraq. He is resourceful in his dealings with Iraqi bureaucracy. * Helena Bonham Carter as Ingrid Formanek, Robert's colleague who agrees to leave Baghdad with the other reporters.

Independent Assemblies of God International is a member of the Pentecostal Charismatic Churches of North America. International offices are located in Laguna Hills, California. History In 1907, the Mission of William Howard Durham has inspired many congregations and individuals learned about the Pentecostal movement through Mission in Chicago. IAOGI, History, Official website, USA, retrieved August 17, 2017 One of his assistant elders, F. A. Sandgren, published the Folke-Vennena a periodical for Scandinavians and many Midwest churches joined the Pentecostal movement. In 1918, the denomination was organized as the Scandinavian Assemblies of God in the United States of America, Canada and Foreign Lands with A. W. Rasmussen. Ron Rhodes, The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations: Understanding the History, Beliefs, and Differences, Harvest House Publishers, USA, 2015, p. 357 In 1935, at the annual convention in Minneapolis, Minnesota, they merged with another group named the Independent Pentecostal Churches, and became Independent Assemblies of God International. Later, a split over the latter rain movement led to the formation of the Fellowship of Christian Assemblies. The IAOGI has congregations in Africa, Canada, Guatemala, India, Mexico, the Philippines, Romania, and the United States. The churches meet in an annual convention. There are approximately 1500 churches worldwide. They are present in India since the second half of the 20th century The area of their work includes Nagaland. Beliefs The Independent Assemblies of God International believes some of the uniqueness that sets it apart from other Pentecostal bodies is \\"its conviction of the sovereignty of the local church\\". The IAOGI's doctrinal statement reflects the following beliefs: *The Bible as the inspired and infallible Word of God; *One God, eternally existent in three persons * The virgin birth of Christ, His vicarious, atoning death, bodily resurrection, and Ascension * Salvation through the blood of Jesus Christ * Water baptism by immersion * The Lord's Supper *Divine healing through the redemptive work of Christ on the cross *The baptism of the Holy Spirit *The sanctification power of the Holy Spirit; * The second coming of Jesus Christ; *The Blessed hope resurrection and translation of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and those who are alive at His coming; and The final judgment of those who have not accepted Christ as Savior, with the devil and his angels in the Lake of Fire. The Independent Assemblies of God International should not be confused with the Assemblies of God International Fellowship, the International Assemblies of God Fellowship, and the Assemblies of God, all of which are Pentecostal denominations that have good fellowship with one another as organizations.

Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of .Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Castlemaine) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Castlemaine was laid down by HMA Naval Dockyard in Williamstown, Victoria on 17 February 1941. She was launched on 7 August 1941 by Dame Pattie Menzies, wife of the then Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies. The corvette was commissioned into the RAN at Melbourne on 17 June 1942. Operational history After commissioning, Castlemaine sailed to Sydney, where she was involved in training exercises and convoy escort along the east coast of Australia. On the night of 11 August 1942, the corvette collided with a Manly ferry, requiring a week of repairs at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. After repairs, Castlemaine was ordered to Townsville, then assigned to Darwin in October: at both locations the ship was tasked with supporting and supplying Allied guerrilla operations in Timor. In late November 1942, the RAN was called on to evacuate the commandoes of the 2/2nd Independent Company (an evacuation attempt in September failed when the destroyer grounded and was scuttled after being badly damaged by attacking Japanese aircraft), a contingent of Dutch troops, and over 100 Portuguese civilians, while delivering a relief contingent.Feuer, Heroic stand of HMAS Armidale, p.50 Castlemaine, sister ship , and the auxiliary patrol boat were assigned to the operation by Commodore Cuthbert Pope, Naval Officer in Charge Darwin, with Castlemaine the commanding ship. The plan was for Kuru to reach Betano Bay early on the night of 30 November, offload supplies, and take on the civilians. The two corvettes were to arrive two hours later; Kuru would deliver her passengers to Castlemaine, which was to head for Darwin at first opportunity, then shuttle relief troops aboard Armidale to shore while evacuating the soldiers. The corvettes sailed from Darwin at midday on 29 November, leaving just as Japanese aircraft flew over the harbour. At 09:00 on 30 November, the two ships were located by a Japanese reconnaissance plane, but were unable to shoot it down. Because of the likelihood of attack during the day and the distance from the destination, the ships radioed Darwin and suggested that the mission be aborted, but Pope instructed they were to continue after steering away from their intended destination for an hour, and promised fighter support. Armidale and Castlemaine were attacked at midday by 14 Japanese bombers, but these were driven off by a force of Bristol Beaufighters, which then returned to Australia. Another attack came at 14:00, but neither side was able to do damage. Delays from the evasive course and two air attacks meant the corvettes reached Betano Bay after 02:30 on 1 December, with no sign of Kuru, and retreated to sea. Kuru was sighted at daybreak-assuming the corvettes were not coming, her commander chose to sail for Darwin with the civilians-and the civilians were transferred to Castlemaine. Although as senior ship, Castlemaines commanding officer felt he should return to Betano Bay with the soldiers, the troops were aboard the other corvette, and at 11:00 he ordered (with Commodore Pope's approval) Armidale and Kuru to return by separate routes and attempt the operation again that night. Although Castlemaine returned without trouble, Armidale was attacked and sunk by Japanese aircraft on 1 December. On 15 December, Castlemaine was escorting the merchant ships Period and James Cook to Thursday Island when they were attacked by Japanese aircraft. Four of Periods crew were killed, and the three ships were attacked two more times on 15 December, and a fourth time on 16 December. No further damage was sustained, with the aircraft driven off by the corvette's anti- aircraft armament on all four occasions. HMAS Sleuth (left) off Darwin in 1944. Following the Allied withdrawal from Timor in early 1943, Castlemaine was assigned to minesweeping and escort duties in northern Australian waters. This continued until the end of 1943, when she was reassigned to the convoy escort role between Queensland and New Guinea. In August 1944, the corvette was tasked with survey duties in Australia waters, before sailing to Hong Kong for the Japanese surrender in September 1945. The ship was granted three battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Darwin 1942‚Äì43\\", \\"Pacific 1942‚Äì43\\", and \\"New Guinea 1942‚Äì44\\". Decommissioning and preservation Castlemaine paid off to reserve on 14 December 1945. She was immobilised at HMAS Cerberus at Crib Point in Victoria as a training hulk for Engine Room Artificers, who ran the boilers in part providing steam heating throughout the base. During this period, she was also used for damage control training for service personnel. In September 1973, Castlemaine was presented as a gift to the Maritime Trust of Australia from the Australian Government. Transferred into Trust ownership by the end of 1973, minus most of the original fittings, Castlemaine was restored and converted into a museum ship. Castlemaine is presently berthed at Gem Pier, Williamstown, Victoria, adjacent to the historic Customs House. The ship is not capable of sailing, as the main mess deck houses a museum, and the engines have been converted to run on compressed air, displaying their mechanical operation to visitors. Between 14 and 29 August 2015, Castlemaine was drydocked for maintenance, cleaning, and hull preservation at the nearby BAE Systems Williamstown shipyard.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. .) is a small city in Victoria, Australia, in the Goldfields region about 120 kilometres (75 miles) northwest by road from Melbourne and about 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the major provincial centre of Bendigo. It is the administrative and economic centre of the Shire of Mount Alexander. The population at the 2016 Census was 6,757. Castlemaine was named by the chief goldfield commissioner, Captain W. Wright, in honour of his Irish uncle, Viscount Castlemaine. Castlemaine began as a gold rush boomtown in 1851 and developed into a major regional centre, being officially proclaimed a City on 4 December 1965, although since declining in population.\\"Castlemaine\\" in The Age, 15 September 2008 It is home to many cultural institutions including the Theatre Royal, the oldest continuously operating theatre in mainland Australia. History=Toponomy The first European settlers named it Forest Creek and as the population grew it became known as Mount Alexander. The old name is still present in some place names in Victoria including the Shire of Mount Alexander and the former main road leading to it from Melbourne ‚Äì Mount Alexander Road. In 1854, Chief goldfields commissioner, Captain W. Wright, renamed the settlement 'Castlemaine' in honour of his Irish uncle, Viscount Castlemaine. Indigenous background Castlemaine exists on the traditional lands of the Dja Dja Wurrung people, also known as the Jaara people. They were regarded by other tribes as being a superior people, not only because of their rich hunting grounds but because from their area came a greenstone rock for their stone axes. Early Europeans described the Dja Dja Wurrung as a strong, physically well-developed people and not belligerent. The Jaara people have a rich culture and reverence for the land. Sovereignty was never ceded. European settlement Major Mitchell passed through the region in 1836. Following his discovery, the first squatters arrived in 1837 to establish vast sheep runs. Discovery of gold On 20 July 1851 gold was discovered near present-day Castlemaine (Mt Alexander Goldfields) at Specimen Gully on Barkers Creek. The gold was discovered by Christopher Thomas Peters, a shepherd and hut-keeper on the Barker's Creek, in the service of Dr William Barker on his Mount Alexander run. When the gold was shown in the men's quarters, Peters was ridiculed for finding fool's gold, and the gold was thrown away. Barker did not want his workmen to abandon his sheep, but in August they did just that. John Worley, George Robinson and Robert Keen, also in the employ of Barker as shepherds and a bullock driver, immediately teamed with Peters in working the deposits by panning in Specimen Gully where the gold had been found, which they did in relative privacy during the next month. When Barker sacked them and ran them off his land for trespass, Worley, on behalf of the party \\"to prevent them getting in trouble\\", mailed a letter to The Argus (Melbourne) dated 1 September 1851 announcing this new goldfield with the precise location of their workings. This letter was published on 8 September 1851. \\"With this obscure notice, rendered still more so by the journalist as 'Western Port', were ushered to the world the inexhaustible treasures of Mount Alexander\\" also to become known as the Forest Creek diggings. Within a month there were about 8,000 diggers working the alluvial beds of the creeks near the present day town of Castlemaine, and particularly Forest Creek which runs through Chewton where the first small village was established. By the end of the year there were about 25,000 on the field. Gold rush: a city develops A view of the first small village to develop on the Mount Alexander goldfields at Chewton (then known as Forest Creek) near Castlemaine in 1852 painted by Samuel Thomas Gill Mount Alexander goldfields in 1852, painted by ST Gill Coach is packed with equipment, Chinese passengers inside and on top of coach, 1835. A view of the diggings from Old Post Office Hill in 1858. State Library Victoria pictures collection. The first small village developed at Chewton, today in effect a suburb of Castlemaine, which included the Commissioner's tent, stores, an office for The Argus newspaper, and an office for the Mount Alexander goldfields' own newspaper the Daily Mail. On 28 January 1852, William Henry Wright was one of nearly 200 men who were assigned or affirmed as Territorial Magistrates for Victoria. Not long after, he took control of the Mount Alexander diggings and set up a government camp on Forest Street near the junction of Barker and Forest Creeks (today's Camp Reserve). This was to be the new township of Castlemaine. The first reference in a newspaper to the township is found in the Geelong Advertiser of 13 March 1852 with the following notice: :.- The Lieutenant Governor has appointed John Fletcher, Esq., J.P., to be Police Magistrate at Castlemaine; but where Castlemaine is situate[d] we cannot tell.\\"\\"New police magistrate\\" Geelong Advertiser and Intelligencer (Vic.) 13 March 1852 Page 2 A court house was established on what is today known as Goldsmith Crescent, Castlemaine near the new government camp. Stores were also established nearby. The first official Post Office at Castlemaine, named \\"Forrest Creek\\", opened on 1 March 1852. (Renamed the Castlemaine Post Office on 1 January 1854.) The first official Post Office was established after \\"The Argus\\" (Melbourne) correspondent at Forest Creek had an article published in November 1851 that put the case forward for a Post Office to be established somewhere between the Forest Creek goldfield and Kyneton. At the same time (November 1851) he described the Forest Creek diggings as having many businesses such as stores and licensed hawkers and \\"at least 8000 persons on the two creeks (Forest and Barker)\\". The need pointed out in \\"The Argus\\" in November 1851 had resulted in an unofficial Post Office being established on the diggings at Chewton (Forest Creek) in December 1851, a Post Office then described as being \\"on the most central part of the diggings\\". On 15 February 1853 town lots were offered for sale. By that time the first Castlemaine District Hospital had been opened, the gaol had been built, and Castlemaine was moving from 'tent' town to bricks and mortar. State of Victoria Early Postal Cancels (and History) Illustrated, Section II: 1851 to 1853 A local government was formed on 23 April 1855 and was later to become the Town of Castlemaine and in 1965 became the City of Castlemaine. Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room. However, with municipal amalgamations in the early 1990s, Castlemaine lost its 'City' status and is now simply the largest town in the Shire. The Theatre Royal opened in 1856 to provide entertainment for the gold diggers, with a notable performance being provided by the world-renowned Lola Montes and her celebrated Spider Dance. It remains mainland Australia's continuously operating theatre. In 1859, the historic Castlemaine Football Club was established. Evidence makes it the second oldest football club in Australia and one of the oldest football clubs in the world. After the gold rush Barker Street, Castlemaine in 1908 Before 1880 the residences numbered over 2000, and there was a population in the township of 7,500. As gold mining gradually ceased a number of other secondary industries sprang up. These included breweries, iron foundries and a woollen mill. Thompson's Foundry (now trading as Flowserve) was one of Castlemaine's largest employers. From the 1970s the industries that had dominated employment in the town for a century began to decline, with many factories closing and others such as Thompson's Foundry significantly downsizing. This led to the displacement of large numbers of people, with many families leaving in search of jobs elsewhere. The area's precious goldrush history and heritage was, however, increasingly recognised, along with its notable population of arts practitioners. Substantial planning and activity helped create new industries in heritage tourism, arts tourism, nature tourism and so on. As a result, Castlemaine began to be visited ‚Äì and settled ‚Äì by more 'outsiders', primarily from Melbourne. Some of these more recent arrivals added to the gentrification of the Victorian era town, helping to preserve its already charming country aspect and enhancing it by establishing a number of cafes and restaurants. As with much gentrification, however, consequent rising house prices placed increased economic pressure on many earlier inhabitants who sometimes struggle to continue living in the area. The town has, overall, taken on a fresh lease of life, combining some of the more desirable aspects of urban Melbourne with the charm and openness of old Castlemaine. Geography Castlemaine is nestled in a valley. The urban area extends to several suburban areas, north toward Barkers Creek, west to McKenzie Hill, east to Moonlight Flat and Chewton and south to Campbells Creek. Climate=Governance Shire of Mount Alexander meets at Castlemaine Town Hall In local government, the Castlemaine region is covered by the Shire of Mount Alexander. The council was created in 1995 as an amalgamation of a number of other municipalities in the region with the Council and Civic Centre in the former School of Mines, in central Castlemaine, next to the original Town Hall. Castlemaine is represented by the Castlemaine Ward. In state politics, Castlemaine is located in the Legislative Assembly districts of Bendigo West currently held by the Australian Labor Party. In federal politics, Castlemaine is located in a single House of Representatives division ‚Äì the Division of Bendigo. The Division of Bendigo has been an Australian Labor Party seat since 1998. Economy Castlemaine's largest industry is in manufacturing, particularly food manufacturing. The biggest employer is KR Castlemaine (formerly the Castlemaine Bacon Company, established 1905), producing smallgoods with over 900 employees.Is Don. Is good for Castlemaine Bendigo Advertiser. 31 July 2008 Cultural and heritage tourism is another large industry in Castlemaine, with the historic art gallery being a major drawcard. Castlemaine has recently joined the likes of nearby Daylesford with gaining tourism from Melbourne, offering an array of local cafes and bars which have increased the region's appeal. Heritage Castlemaine Post Office Barker Street was named after William Barker, another pioneer pastoralist whose run included part of the land which is now Castlemaine. The whole eastern side of Barker Street, between Templeton Street and Lyttleton Street, has been classified by the National Trust. Adjacent to the solicitors' offices is the library, built in 1857 as a mechanics' institute with additions in 1861, 1872 and 1893. Next to it is the Faulder Watson Hall which opened in 1895 and adjacent is the old telegraph office (1857). On the Lyttleton Street corner is the decorative Classical Revival post office (1873‚Äì75). It is in the form of an Italian palazzo with a central clock tower, five arched bays and strongly contrasting colouration. This structure replaced a wooden post office which was built on this same spot in 1859 when the service was transferred from the gold commissioner's camp. Over the road is the Cumberland Hotel (1884). Parks and open space Castlemaine has its own botanical gardens, established in 1860, which are on the Victorian Heritage Register. The gardens feature Lake Joanna (an artificial lake), many exotic tree species and structures dating to the Victorian era. The Castlemaine public swimming pool is 50m in length and is located next to the botanical gardens. The Castlemaine Diggings National Heritage Park is the first of its kind in Australia. It embraces gold rush relics and bushland. Home to rare and threatened species of both flora and fauna it offers opportunities for bush walking, bird watching, wildlife monitoring and study while providing a bush setting for the township. Castlemaine Art Museum The art deco Castlemaine Art Museum, built in 1931 Founded in 1913, the Castlemaine Art Museum has acquired a collection of Australian art works and historical items from the district's past. The 1931 art deco building designed by Percy Meldrum is noted for its elegant design and is heritage listed. The building has been extended a number of times. The gallery has always specialised in Australian art. Its particular strength is in major works of the late 19th century and the Edwardian era. Traditional landscape painting is a feature of the collection. Contemporary artists are also well represented. Earlier artists include Louis Buvelot, Fred McCubbin, Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Violet Teague, May Vale, Walter Withers, David Davies, Rupert Bunny, Max Meldrum, John Russell, Hugh Ramsay, Clarice Beckett, A.M.E. Bale, Arthur Lindsay and John Longstaff. Modernists include Margaret Preston, Roland Wakelin, Russell Drysdale, Fred Williams, John Brack, Albert Tucker, John Perceval, Clifton Pugh, Lloyd Rees and Roger Kemp. More contemporary painters include Rick Amor, John Dent, Ray Crooke, Peter Benjamin Graham, Robert Jacks, Jeffrey Smart, Ian Armstrong, Paul Cavell and Brian Dunlop. The gallery collects photographic images of Australian artists by Australian photographers and has built up a collection by photographers as Max Dupain, David Moore, Richard Beck and Olive Cotton. The museum houses a collection of historical artworks, journals, photographs, costumes and items specifically relating to the history of the Mount Alexander district. Copies of about a dozen examples of the work of Christian Waller (nee Yandell) are available in the museum, which also holds photographs and information related to other members of the Yandell family, who were among the notable founding residents of the town of Castlemaine. One of the most prominent Yandells was Augustus Courts Yandell, whose success as a gold-finder in the 1850s enabled him and his family to own as many as 15 Castlemaine properties at one time. One example is the house at 14 Doveton Street, dating from 1858.Mather, K, 2019, \\"Comings and goings in my goldfields house\\", Traces, December 2019, pp. 46‚Äì48. The museum was due to close on 11 August 2017 due to lack of funds, but was saved by a donation of $250,000 by an anonymous couple and local fundraising efforts.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-03/victoria-anonymous- donors-save-castlemaine-gallery/8770270 Culture, community and sport The Theatre Royal claims to be the oldest continuously operating theatre in mainland Australia. It hosts films (including several world and Australian premieres), concerts and functions. Castlemaine Farmers Market Castlemaine also hosts a local farmers market where the finest producers of the Mount Alexander Shire region, all in one place. The market is currently held on the Western Reserve, Forest Street, Castlemaine Buda Historic Home and Garden See Buda Historic Home and Garden Wesley Hill Community Market The Wesley Hill Community Market operates every Saturday from 9a.m. to 2 p.m. It is located at 149 Pyrenees Highway, Castlemaine, and has over 70 stalls selling a range of merchandise, local products and farmers' products. Castlemaine State Festival Since 1974, Castlemaine has biennially been the home of the Castlemaine State Festival. Running for ten days, this festival is one of Victoria's most notable regional arts events. The festival, now usually held in late March, offers many events with a particular emphasis on visual arts, music and theatre. It has also attracted internationally and nationally renowned performers, including the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The most recent festival was held on 22‚Äì31 March 2019. Run the Maine Held annually in October, Run the Maine is a fun run event around the Castlemaine Botanical Gardens which raises funds for the local hospital ‚Äì Castlemaine Health. Participants can choose to run 5.5 km, 11 km or a 14 km trail run. The 2020 event was run virtually, with runners uploading their times individually due to Covid 19. Sport Australian rules football is popular, with the Castlemaine Football Club competing in the Bendigo Football League. The club is acknowledged as being the second oldest in Australia. On Wesley Hill, just out of Castlemaine, is the Castlemaine sporting complex, which hosts a range of sport including basketball, netball, badminton and cycling. Castlemaine Tennis Club on Wheeler Street next to Forest Creek features four plexipave courts and eight further synthetic grass courts. Castlemaine has many cricket teams in the town itself and the surrounding area. It is also renowned for its mountain bike trails, with a reputedly world-class, newly-developed multi trail walking and cycling facility on the slopes of Mount Alexander at nearly Harcourt. Two golf courses are available; at the Castlemaine Golf Club in the bordering Muckleford region on Newstead Road, and at the course of the Mount Alexander Golf Club on Wimble Street. Castlemaine is also the self-proclaimed Hot Rod centre of Australia with many small businesses catering to this popular form of motor sport at a national level. Examples of the cars can be seen on show days and rod runs throughout the year. There are plans for a permanent Hot Rod centre. Churches As a gold rush town, Castlemaine attracted migrants from all over the world. So in addition to 'established' churches such as the Anglicans, Presbyterians and Roman Catholics, arrivals in the district included Methodists, Baptists and Congregationalists from mining areas in provincial Britain where nonconformist churches were more popular, as well as Lutherans from continental Europe. Initially the churches in Victoria were unable to cope with huge numbers of migrants settling in areas which had been sparsely populated.Serle, Geoffrey. The golden age: a history of the colony of Victoria 1851 ‚Äì 1861. M.U.P., 1977. Chapter 12. However a few proactive clergymen set out for the diggings where they were assisted by lay preachers amongst the diggers. Initially they preached in tents and from tree stumps but by 1853 the first rough churches had been built. There was also a sizeable Chinese population with concomitant Joss Houses and Temples; besides a few artifacts, no structures remain. Churches to have operated in Castlemaine in order of establishment are: * Methodist. 1850s ‚Äì 1977 when they merged to become the Uniting Church of Australia. * Anglican. 1850s ‚Äì present. * Roman Catholic. 1853‚Äìpresent. * Presbyterian. 1850s ‚Äì 1977 and 1984 ‚Äì present. The Castlemaine congregation merged with the Uniting Church in 1977, but some members later broke away to reestablish that denomination in the town. * Baptist. 1861? ‚Äì present. * Congregational. 1800s ‚Äì 1977 when they merged to become part of the Uniting Church. * Church of Christ. 1800s ‚Äì present. * Lutheran. 1800s to present. * Salvation Army. Late 1800s to present. * Seventh Day Adventist. * Uniting Church. 1977‚Äìpresent. Absorbed the local Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational churches, although some Presbyterians broke away in 1984 to reestablish a Presbyterian presence in the town. * Pentecostal: Grace Church, Liberty Christian Life Centre in Campbell Creek (affiliated with Assemblies of God). The Uniting Church was created in 1977 and the local Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational congregations chose to join. Since the Presbyterians had the largest church building, the best hall and largest grounds, the merged denominations met there. The Methodist and Congregational buildings were sold, with the Adventists taking over the former Methodist church and a conservative group that wished to reestablish a distinct Presbyterian service moving into the former Congregational Church building over the road from their original church. In popular culture Castlemaine XXXX beer and were named after the city. The Glitch TV series was partially filmed in Castlemaine, and the fictional town of Yoorana the series is set in is located on the western side of (and effectively replaces) Castlemaine, per an on-screen map.

Health A large hospital and a geriatric care centre (Castlemaine Health, formerly Mount Alexander Hospital) is located on the northern edge of Castlemaine. The former Maldon Hospital is now home to older and frail residents in the Jessie Bowe Centre and Mountview Centre. The Castlemaine District Community Health Centre provides a range of health services (including a Needle & Syringe Program) and there are several large medical general practices. Primary care options include dentists, opticians, physiotherapists, podiatrists, chiropractors, pathology and hearing services, plus a substantial number of complementary and alternative practitioners. The Shire has three prisons ‚Äì HMP Loddon and HMP Middleton for men are located on the eastern outskirts at Wesley Hill, and HMP Tarrengower (outside Maldon) for women. Transport Castlemaine railway station Castlemaine is at the junction of several main roads including the Pyrenees Highway running west connecting it to Maryborough and east toward Elphinstone, the Midland Highway running north connecting it to Bendigo and south connecting it to Daylesford and Maldon-Castlemaine Road, running north west toward Maldon. V/Line Rail services operate out of the Castlemaine railway station which is on the Bendigo railway line. V/Line operates VLocity services to Melbourne's Southern Cross station, the fastest weekday express taking 65 minutes. Travel to Bendigo by train takes a minimum of 18 minutes. A V/Line Coach service between Castlemaine and Maryborough also operates out of Castlemaine railway station. The Victorian Goldfields Railway operates a tourist railway, running old steam and diesel engines from Maldon station to Castlemaine via Muckleford. Castlemaine Bus Lines provides suburban bus services from Castlemaine railway station to Chewton, Campbells Creek, and North Castlemaine as well as Intercity services to Maldon, Elphinstone, and Taradale. The local taxi service is run by Castlemaine Taxis.

Life Paczy≈Ñski was born on 8 February 1940 in Vilnius, Lithuania, to a lawyer and a teacher of Polish literature. In 1945 his family chose to leave for Poland and settled in Krak√≥w, and then in 1949 in Warsaw. At the age of 18, Paczy≈Ñski published his first scientific article in Acta Astronomica. Between 1959 and 1962 he studied astronomy at the University of Warsaw. Two years later he received a doctorate under the tutelage of Stefan Piotrowski and W≈Çodzimierz Zonn. In 1962 Paczy≈Ñski became a member of the Centre of Astronomy of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where he continued to work for nearly 20 years. In 1974 he received habilitation and in 1979 became a professor. Thanks to his works on theoretical astronomy, at the age of 36 he became the youngest member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. http://www.gazetawyborcza.pl/1,86024,4626294.html In 1981 Paczy≈Ñski visited the United States, where he gave a series of lectures at Caltech to former interns at his Warsaw-based institute. After the introduction of the Martial Law in Poland he decided to stay abroad. He was the Lyman Spitzer Jr. Professor of Astrophysics at Princeton University. Paczy≈Ñski was the initiator of Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE, led by Andrzej Udalski of Warsaw University Observatory) and All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS, created together with Grzegorz Pojma≈Ñski). His new methods of discovering cosmic objects and measuring their mass by using gravitational lenses gained him international recognition, and he is acknowledged for coining the term microlensing. He was also an early proponent of the idea that gamma-ray bursts are at cosmological distances. His research concentrated on stellar evolution, gravitational lensing and gravitational microlensing, variable stars, gamma- ray bursts, and galactic structure. In 1999, he became the first astronomer to receive all three major awards of the Royal Astronomical Society, by winning the Gold Medal, having won the Eddington Medal in 1987 and the George Darwin Lectureship in 1995. He was honoured with the title of doctor honoris causa by Wroc≈Çaw University in Poland (on June 29, 2005) and Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ in Poland (on September 22, 2006). In January 2006 he was awarded Henry Norris Russell Lectureship of the American Astronomical Society, \\"for his highly original contributions to a wide variety of fields including advanced stellar evolution, the nature of gamma ray bursts, accretion in binary systems, gravitational lensing, and cosmology. His research has been distinguished by its creativity and breadth, as well as the stimulus it has provided to highly productive observational investigations\\".

It was released on January 11, 2002. The movie was distributed by Paramount Pictures and produced by MTV Productions and Scott Rudin. The movie was directed by Jake Kasdan and written by Mike White. Plot Shaun Brumder (Colin Hanks) is an intelligent teenager from affluent Orange County, California with little interest in his education, leading a carefree SoCal lifestyle of surfing, drinking, and partying. Shaun's best friend Lonny (Bret Harrison) is killed in a surfing accident, leading Shaun to rethink his life. He finds a novel on the beach by the author Marcus Skinner, which inspires him to become a writer. Upon learning that Skinner is an English professor at Stanford University, Shaun makes it his goal to attend Stanford and study under him. Shaun dramatically improves himself academically, obtaining high grades and SAT scores and becoming president of his graduating class. Following the advice of his guidance counselor, Ms. Cobb (Lily Tomlin), Shaun applies only to Stanford. This backfires when Shaun is rejected because Ms. Cobb mixed up his transcript with that of another student. Reaching out to his wealthy father Bud (John Lithgow), who left his family to marry a much younger woman (Leslie Mann), Shaun pleads with him to donate to Stanford to increase Shaun‚Äôs chances of acceptance. Disapproving of Shaun's dream of becoming a writer, Bud refuses. Shaun's girlfriend Ashley (Schuyler Fisk) convinces her friend Tanya (Carly Pope) to allow Shaun to be interviewed at his home by Tanya's grandfather, a Stanford board member. Unfortunately, the antics of Shaun‚Äôs dysfunctional family members, including his alcoholic, emotionally fragile mother Cindy (Catherine O'Hara) and his dim-witted stoner brother Lance (Jack Black), cause Shaun's interviewers to storm out in disgust. In a last-ditch effort, Ashley and Lance convince Shaun to drive to Palo Alto and plead his case directly to Stanford Admissions Director Don Durkett (Harold Ramis). By the time they reach campus, the admissions building is closed. While Lance seduces the secretary on duty, Shaun and Ashley steal Durkett's home address. There, Shaun impresses Durkett with his real transcript, but Durkett is reluctant to admit him so late in the admissions process. After much groveling, Shaun convinces him to give it a second thought. Disaster strikes again when Ashley confuses Lance's MDMA for pain relievers, offering Durkett the pills for his headache and causing him to become high. Shaun, Ashley, and Durkett return to find the Admissions Building engulfed in flames, caused by Lance smoking with the receptionist. With Lance wanted for arson, they abandon Durkett and flee the scene. Frustrated with Shaun's obsession, Ashley points out that his attending Stanford would likely mean the end of their relationship, and she leaves. Depressed, Shaun wanders the campus and meets a female student who invites him to a frat party. He is disappointed to learn the Stanford coeds are just as vapid as teenagers from Orange County. With a more cynical view of college, Shaun runs into Professor Skinner (Kevin Kline) and is invited to his office. Shaun confides that he is afraid his dreams of being a good writer are over. Skinner reminds him that many famous authors such as James Joyce and William Faulkner grew up in places that were not intellectually stimulating, and were inspired by the conflicts in their own lives. Having an epiphany, Shaun realizes his misguided intentions and finds Ashley to apologize. They pick up Lance, still hiding from police, and drive home. In Orange County, Shaun's parents seek each other out to deal with Shaun's problem. They reconcile, realizing they are much happier together than with their respective new spouses, and conclude they have not been good parents to Shaun. To make amends, Bud donates enough money to Stanford for the construction of a new Admissions Building, which secures Shaun‚Äôs acceptance. Initially ecstatic, Shaun remembers what Ashley and Professor Skinner said, and decides to stay in Orange County with Ashley and his family, realizing they are the true inspiration for his writing. Shaun leaves a copy of Skinner's book at the beach for someone else to find, then surfs with his friends for the first time since Lonny's death.

It will sound like the kind of movie that, if you are over 17, you don't usually go to see. But it isn't. It's one of those movies where the description can't do justice to the experience.\\" The film currently holds a rating of 6.2/10 and 46% on Rotten Tomatoes. The site's consensus states: \\"Smarter than the average teen movie, but a little on the unmemorable side.\\" It garnered a better reception abroad than domestically. Matthew Turner of ViewLondon states that, \\"though there are no real belly laughs or any Farrelly-like set pieces, this is still a better than average comedy, thanks to its witty script and its amusing collection of characters.

Born in Dakar, she was raised a Muslim. Her frustration with the fate of African women is expressed in her first novel, Une si longue lettre (1979; translated in English as So Long a Letter). In this semi- autobiographical epistolary work B√¢ depicts the sorrow and resignation of a woman who must share the mourning for her late husband with his second, younger wife. This short book was awarded the first Noma Prize for Publishing in Africa in 1980. Biography B√¢ was born in Dakar, Senegal, in 1929, into an educated and well-to-do Senegalese family of Lebu ethnicity. Her father was a career civil servant who became one of the first ministers of state. He was the Minister of Health in 1956 while her grandfather was an interpreter in the French occupation regime. After her mother's death, B√¢ was largely raised in the traditional manner by her maternal grandparents. She received her early education in French, while at the same time attending Koranic school. B√¢ later married a Senegalese member of Parliament, Ob√®ye Diop-Tall, but divorced him and was left to care for their nine children. B√¢ was a prominent law student at school. During the colonial revolution period and later, girls faced numerous obstacles when they wanted to have a higher education. B√¢'s grandparents did not plan to educate her beyond primary school. However, her father's insistence on giving her an opportunity to continue her studies eventually persuaded them. In a teacher training college based in Rufisque (a suburb in Dakar), she won the first prize in the entrance examination and entered the √âcole Normale. In this institution, she was prepared for later career as a school teacher. The school's principal began to prepare her for the 1943 entrance examination to a teaching career after he noticed B√¢'s intellect and capacity. She taught from 1947 to 1959, before transferring to the Regional Inspectorate of teaching as an educational inspector. B√¢ died a year later after a protracted illness, before the publication of her second novel, Un Chant √©carlate (Scarlet Song), which is a love story between two star-crossed lovers from different ethical backgrounds fighting the tyranny of tradition. Work B√¢ wrote three books: So Long a Letter (1981), Scarlet Songs (1986), and La fonction politique des litt√©ratures Africaines √©crites (The Political Function of African Written Literatures) (1981). So Long a Letter In 1981, Une si longue lettre, translated as So Long a Letter, was awarded the first Noma Award for Publishing in Africa. In this book, the author recognized the immense contributions African women have made and continue to make in the building of their societies. The book is written in the form of a letter, or a diary, from a widow, Ramatoulaye, to her childhood girlfriend, Aissatou, who lives in the United States. Nafissatou Niang Diallo (1941‚Äì1982), who started her works in the 1970s, was a mirror for Mariama B√¢, whose leading role was a strong-minded character. Moreover, she found support, friendship and values from female confidence, unity and harmony. The discriminatory use of power forces Ramatoulaye to deal with its consequences. This discriminatory power is what is in the novel a form of male domination coming from society's construction of a patriarchal ideology. Because Ramatoulaye is a woman, she has little power in determining her own destiny, but Aissatou rejects this notion and chooses her own life without being denied a life of her own by her husband Mawdo. Scarlet Song Scarlet Song (1986) also gained international attention. This book deals with the critically urgent need for women to create \\"empowered\\" spaces for themselves, meaning, women need to create a space where they are not considered the \\"weaker sex\\". Scarlet Song is about a marriage between a European woman and an African man. As So Long a Letter, Scarlet Song gained international attention. Mireille, whose father is a French diplomat, marries Ousmane, son of a poor Senegalese Muslim family. Moving back from Paris to Senegal, Ousmane once again adopts his traditions and customs. But, as an occidental, Mireille cannot handle this kind of life, especially when Ousmane takes a second wife. However, Africa is a polygamous society and in their religion it is acceptable but Mireille did not accept it. She suffers the marriage. Most notably, the book criticizes the tyranny of tradition and expounds upon the despair of cross-cultural marriages. La Fonction politique des litt√©ratures africaines √©crites La Fonction politique des litt√©ratures africaines √©crites (1981). Mariama B√¢ states that every African woman should be proud of her strength and accomplishments. She believes that each woman contributes to Africa's development and participates in Africa's growth.Plant, D. G. (ed.) (1996). \\"Mythic Dimensions in the Novels of Mariama B√¢\\", Research in African Literatures Feminism and politics B√¢ did not accept the appellation \\"feminist\\", which for her was too loaded with Western values, and did not agree with the tradition, Muslim values of Senegalese women. According to Rizwana Habib Latha, Ramatoulaye does portray a kind of womanism, and B√¢ herself saw an important role for African women writers: > The woman writer in Africa has a special task. She has to present the > position of women in Africa in all its aspects. There is still so much > injustice .... In the family, in the institutions, in society, in the > street, in political organizations, discrimination reigns supreme .... As > women, we must work for our own future, we must overthrow the status quo > which harms us and we must no longer submit to it. Like men, we must use > literature as a non-violent but effective weapon. Legacy A biography of B√¢ was published in Dakar in 2007: Mariama B√¢ ou les all√©es d'un destin by her daughter, Mame Coumba Ndiaye, was praised by Jean- Marie Volet as \\"a fascinating, considerate and enlightening\\" book. Mariama B√¢ Boarding School (Maison d'Education Mariama B√¢) The Mariama B√¢ Boarding School is a top boarding school on Gor√©e, an island in Senegal. It was founded in 1977 by Leopold Sedar Senghor, first president of Senegal. The school was named after Mariama B√¢ because of what she stood for, spoke and wrote about. It admits young women who obtained the highest scores during the national secondary school entry exam. Each year, about 25 female students from the 11 regions of Senegal, are given the opportunity to attend Mariama B√¢ boarding school for the rest of their high school years. The curriculum is similar to secondary education in France in that it has seven levels, and students finish with their baccalaureat. In 2009, Jana Films, a Spanish production company, filmed a documentary about the school, directed by Ana Rodr√≠guez Rosell.

Radio edits may also be used for commercial single versions, which may be denoted as the 7\\" version. However, not all \\"radio edit\\" tracks are played on radio. Editing for time Radio edits often shorten a long song in order to make it more commercially viable for radio stations. The normal length for songs played on the radio is between 3 to 4 minutes. The amount of cut content differs however, ranging from a few seconds to effectively half of a song being cut. It is common for radio edits to have shortened intros and/or outros. In the intro, any kind of musical build-up is removed, or, if there is no such build- up, an extensive intro is often halved. In the outro, occasionally, the song will simply fade out earlier, common on tracks with long instrumental endings, or, if it doesn't fade out, a part before the ending will be cut out. It is also frequent that a chorus is repeated less often towards the end. However, if necessary, many radio edits will also edit out verses, choruses, bridges, or interludes in between. An example is the radio edit of 'Heroes' by David Bowie, which fades in shortly before the beginning of the third verse and fades out shortly before the vocal vamping at the end of the song. Another example is B.o.B's song, \\"Nothin' On You\\" featuring Bruno Mars, whose radio edit skips the first five seconds & starts with the sixth second in which Bruno Mars starts singing the first chorus. The second half of the first chorus is sometimes skipped, along with the last 24 seconds which is the normal fade-out part in which B.o.B says, \\"Yeah, and that's just how we do it/And I'ma let this ride/B.o.B and Bruno Mars\\", and the radio edit ends with the fourth and last chorus with an earlier fade-out. A third example would be the song, \\"The Man\\" by Aloe Blacc, in which the radio edit skips the \\"I'm the man/Go ahead & tell everybody/What I'm saying ya all\\" part & the first ten seconds. Also, the third chorus of the song is shortened. Some songs will be remixed heavily and feature different arrangements than the original longer versions, occasionally even being completely different recordings. A popular example of this is \\"Revolution\\" by The Beatles which is a completely different recording from the version which appears on The White Album. Another example is Miley Cyrus's \\"Adore You\\", whose original album version is a slow, quiet version clocking in at 4 minutes & 37 seconds; the radio edit is a completely different version which is a remix done by Cedric Gervais running at 3 minutes & 36 seconds. Likewise, an attempt at a radio edit for Arlo Guthrie's 18-minute epic \\"Alice's Restaurant\\" scrapped the entire monologue that served as the main base of the song's popularity and instead was a 4-minute, three- verse rock and roll song. This also became more prevalent with the rise of the 12\\" record, as artists like New Order started making songs specifically for the format. Many of the 7\\" mixes aimed for pop radio airplay of their songs feature very different arrangements, such as \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\", or even a completely different recording, such as \\"Temptation\\". Some long songs do not have a radio edit, despite being as long as 5, 6, 7, or 8 minutes in length, presumably due to listener demand from radio stations. Examples of this include the following 10 songs: \\"Vicarious\\" (2006) by Tool at 7 minutes and 6 seconds, \\"Hey Jude\\" (1968) by The Beatles at 7 minutes and 11 seconds long, \\"You're the Voice\\" (1986) by John Farnham at 5 minutes and 4 seconds long, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" (1971) by Led Zeppelin at 8 minutes and 3 seconds, \\"One\\" (1989) by Metallica at 7 minutes and 24 seconds, \\"American Pie\\" (1971) by Don McLean with a length of 8 minutes and 32 seconds, \\"Georgia Dome\\" (2004) by Ying Yang Twins (which actually has a radio edit but removing profanity & not shortening it) at 6 minutes and 6 seconds, \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" (1965) by Bob Dylan at 6 minutes & 13 seconds, \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\\" (1975) by Elton John at 6 minutes & 45 seconds, and \\"Again\\" (2015) by Fetty Wap at 5 minutes and 13 seconds. The idea of extended songs receiving airplay on commercial radio was extremely rare until the birth of progressive radio in the mid-1960s; most rock music formats descend from progressive radio, and as such, rock songs tend to be played at their longer original length than songs of other formats. On rare occasions, a radio edit might be longer than the original album version. This may occur when the song is edited for form, such as in the cases of \\"Creep\\" by Radiohead, \\"2 On\\" by Tinashe, and \\"Miserable\\" by Lit. \\"Creep\\"'s radio edit has a 4-second drumstick count off before the regular first second, \\"2 On\\" repeats part of the chorus 1 more time than it does on the normal version, and Miserable's radio edit adds the chorus between the first and second verses. Some radio edits lengthen some parts of the song while shortening others. For example, the radio edit of \\"Thinking Out Loud\\" by Ed Sheeran has a 6-second introduction before the first verse but later in the song cuts from the end of the second verse to the beginning of the last chorus, omitting the second chorus and the guitar solo. Different radio stations may edit songs differently for length; an example is \\"Uptown Funk\\" by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. The syndicated radio format \\"QuickHitz\\", notably adopted by the Calgary radio station CKMP-FM in August 2014, utilizes even shorter edits of songs, from 1 minute and 30 seconds to 2 minutes in length. In the song \\"The Entertainer\\" by Billy Joel, he alludes directly to radio edits for time: :\\"You've heard my latest record, :It's been on the radio; :Ah, it took me years to write it, :They were the best years of my life, :It was a beautiful song, :But it ran too long, :If you're gonna have a hit, :You gotta make it fit, :So they cut it down to 3:05.\\" Editing for content Radio edits often come with any necessary censorship done to conform to decency standards imposed by government agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in Canada, the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas in the Philippines, the Korea Communications Commission in South Korea, the Australian Communications and Media Authority in Australia, and Ofcom in the United Kingdom. The offending words may be silenced, reversed, distorted, or replaced by a tone or sound effect. The edits may come from the record label itself, broadcasters at the corporate level before the song is sent for airplay to their stations, or in rarer cases, at a radio station itself depending on local standards. Some individual stations may be more lenient with words that tread the broadcast-appropriate line, depending on their management and programming format; for instance a rhythmic AC, classic hits, adult contemporary or urban contemporary station may indeed make several radio edits to a song to appeal to a broad base of listeners, while a rhythmic contemporary, modern rock or hip-hop-focused station might be more apt to have a light hand in their radio edits to appeal both to listeners and artists who would be favorable to the station's reputation. Some edits might even be done for promotional reasons; for instance a song that mentions a city's name or a certain radio station might see a special 'station cut' where the station and its community are mentioned in the song (as heard in Lady Gaga's \\"You and I\\", which has a reference to Nebraska that is easily substituted with another region, state or city; similarly Sia's \\"Cheap Thrills\\" is sometimes edited to replace the line \\"turn the radio on\\" with \\"...turn [station name] on\\" to promote the radio station on which the song is playing). In an unusual case, Lizzo's 2019 single \\"Truth Hurts\\" was edited locally in June 2019 by the market-leading Top 40 station WIXX in Green Bay, Wisconsin, not because of inappropriate content, but due to Lizzo's reference in a lyric to an unsaid new player on the Minnesota Vikings. As WIXX is one of three flagship stations for the Green Bay Packers' radio network and features wraparound content involving the Packers, the station determined that referencing their hometown football team's closest rival in a positive manner would be jarring to local listeners. One example of censoring profanity would be \\"Dynamite\\" by Taio Cruz, replacing the word, \\"fuck\\" with a sound effect. Another example is \\"Talk Dirty\\" by Jason Derulo featuring 2 Chainz, in which the radio edit omits three of the words present in the song: \\"penis\\", \\"sex\\", & \\"pussy\\". \\"Penis\\" is replaced with an elephant sound effect, \\"sex\\" is replaced by an echo of the word \\"oral\\" that precedes it in the standard album version from Tattoos & Talk Dirty, and \\"pussy\\" is replaced with a sound effect of a cat meowing. Occasionally, the song may be re-recorded with different lyrics, ranging from just the replacement of one line being re-recorded, like James Blunt's \\"You're Beautiful,\\" which replaces \\"fucking high\\" from the original version on his \\"Back to Bedlam\\" album with \\"flying high\\" in the second verse, to the entire song be completely changed, such as D12's \\"Purple Hills\\", which replaces profanity, drug references, and other inappropriate lyrics from the original \\"Purple Pills\\". Another example of the first type (one-line replacement) is The Black Eyed Peas song \\"Let's Get It Started\\", whose original title was \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" but was changed to make it suitable for radio play. Sean Kingston's \\"Beautiful Girls\\", in some radio edits, changed \\"You got me suicidal\\" to \\"in denial\\". The whole chorus of Cee Lo Green's \\"Fuck You\\" substituted the word \\"Fuck\\" with \\"Forget\\", thus changing the title to \\"Forget You\\" on the radio edit. In Bruno Mars' song \\"That's What I Like\\", as played on The Steve Harvey Morning Show, \\"You and your ass invited\\" is replaced by an instrumental version; the same occurs in the line, \\"Sex by the fire at night\\". Radio edits may have more or fewer words edited than the \\"clean version\\", because of the stations' or agencies' standards. A \\"dirty\\" radio edit preserving the offensive language but maintaining the shorter play time may be produced, which may be aimed at club play, nighttime radio, and non- terrestrial radio stations. Kid Rock wrote the term \\"radio edit\\" into two of his songs, both of which are the same on radio and album versions. After two million copies of Michael Jackson's \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" had already been shipped, the lyrics of the original track with the words \\"Jew me\\" and \\"Kike me\\" were replaced with \\"do me\\" and \\"strike me\\" due to its controversial anti-Semitic references. Radio edit versions of the track remained with the original version until the edited version was pressed and released. An example occurs in Lady Gaga's song \\"Poker Face\\", where the line, \\"P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face\\" is misheard as, \\"P-p-p-poker face, p-p-fuck her face\\". Some radio stations repeated the word \\"poker\\" from the first part of the line, while others played the original version. A promotional CD single is available containing both of these versions. The edited version is available on the compilation Now 31 in the US.

Orchestra The title of \\"music director\\" or \\"musical director\\" is used by many symphony orchestras to designate the primary conductor and artistic leader of the orchestra. The term \\"music director\\" is most common for orchestras in the United States. With European orchestras, the titles of \\"principal conductor\\" or \\"chief conductor\\" are more common, which designate the conductor who directs the majority of a given orchestra's concerts in a season. In musical theatre and opera, the music director is in charge of the overall musical performance, including ensuring that the cast knows the music thoroughly, supervising the musical interpretation of the performers and pit orchestra, and conducting the orchestra. In the 20th century, the title and position typically brought with it an almost unlimited influence over the particular orchestra's affairs. As implied by the name, the music director not only conducts concerts, but also controls what music the orchestra will perform or record, and has much authority regarding hiring, firing, and other personnel decisions over an orchestra's musicians. Such authoritarian rule, once expected and even thought necessary for a symphonic ensemble to function properly, has loosened somewhat in the closing decades of the 20th century with the advent and encouragement of more power sharing and cooperative management styles (with the orchestra musicians themselves, the administrative staff, and volunteer board of directors). The music director in American lingo also assists with fund-raising, and also is the primary focus of publicity for the orchestra, as what is often called its \\"public face\\". The term \\"music director\\" or \\"musical director\\" became common in the United States in the middle of the 20th century, following an evolution of titles. Early leaders of orchestras were simply designated as the \\"conductor.\\" In the 1920s and 1930s, the term musical director began to be used, in order to delineate the fact that the person in this position was doing much more than just conducting, and to differentiate them from guest conductors who simply led one particular program or concert. George Szell, for instance, was appointed as \\"musical director\\" of the Cleveland Orchestra in 1946, and his position was so named until his death in 1970. His successor, Lorin Maazel, was given the title \\"music director.\\" Other major American orchestras kept more current with the times and began using the simpler term in the 1950s and 1960s. The term can also refer to the person who directs a school band or heads the music program. Film and theatre Alternatively, the term \\"music director\\" used to appear in the film credits for a professional hired to supervise and direct the music selected for a film or music documentary, but today the more common designation is music supervisor. In India, where many films are produced as musicals, the term 'music director' is commonly used for the composer and music producer of the songs and score used in the film. Their roles also entail arranging, mastering, mixing and supervising recording of film music with conducting and orchestration. Usually, another artist will receive the credit for the lyrics of the songs. Further information: . The \\"music director\\" for a theatrical production or Broadway or West End musical often serves as rehearsal pianist and conductor. This music director is often also the vocal coach, may also be involved in arranging material for new works, or collaborate on underscoring. There was a Tony Award category for Best Musical Director beginning in 1948, but it was discontinued in 1964 in part due to the fluid responsibilities of musical directors. Brass bands, wind bands, choirs, opera companies and other ensembles may also have musical directors. Broadcasting A music director of a radio station is responsible for interacting with record company representatives, auditioning new music, offering commentary, and making decisions (sometimes in conjunction with the program director) as to which songs get airplay, how much and when. In college radio, there may be more than one music director, as students usually volunteer only a few hours each per week, and most stations have a diverse and extensive library of several different music genres. Military Major Tim Cooper, Director of Music of The Blues and Royals mounted band in London. In the British Armed Forces, a director of music is a commissioned officer, always a musician commissioned from the ranks, who leads a military band. A non-commissioned officer or warrant officer who leads a band is called a bandmaster. Pop music In pop music, a musical director or \\"MD\\" is responsible for supervising the musical arrangements and personnel for a touring artist. This can include festivals and televised performances as well as those at traditional on-stage venues. In the modern era, the sound of a studio recording is often impossible or impractical to reproduce on stage, and it is the music director's job to assemble musicians and arrangements to adapt that material to a live setting (which may or may not include playback of prerecorded tracks). The music director generally leads rehearsals as well as each performance, allowing the lead artist to focus on performing. Germany and Austria ''''' (GMD, general music director) is a German title for the artistic director of an orchestra, an institution or a town.Gerald Mertens: Orchestermanagement. VS ‚Äì Verlag f√ºr Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden 2010, , p. 132. A music director (Latin: director musices) was originally the title of the person responsible for music in a town in Germany and Austria. Johann Sebastian Bach was music director in Leipzig, Georg Philipp Telemann and later Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach were music directors in Hamburg, Robert Schumann was music director in D√ºsseldorf.Musikdirektor in: Brockhaus Riemann Musiklexikon, p. 7134; Vol. 3, p. 177) Schott Generalmusikdirektor is a title given by larger towns to a person typically responsible for a symphony orchestra and the opera.

According to Du Cange, the designation captal (capital, captau, capitau) was applied loosely to the more illustrious nobles of Aquitaine, counts, viscounts, &c.;, probably as capitales domini, \\"principal lords\\", though he quotes more fanciful explanations. As an actual title, the word was used only by the seigneurs of Trene, Puychagut, Epernon and Buch. Buch was a strategically located town and port on the Atlantic, in the bay of Arcachon. When Pierre, the seigneur of Grailly (ca 1285 ‚Äì 1356) married Asalide (the captaline de Buch), the heiress of Pierre-Amanieu de Bordeaux, captal de Buch, in 1307, the title passed into the Grailly family, a line of fighting seigneurs with origins in Savoy. The title is best known in connexion with the famous soldier, Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch (r. 1343‚Äì1376), the \\"captal de Buch\\" par excellence, immortalized by Jean Froissart as the confidant of the Black Prince and the champion of the English cause against France during the first phase of the Hundred Years' War. He played a decisive role as a cavalry leader in the Battle of Poitiers (1356). In 1364, he ravaged the country between Paris and Rouen, but was beaten by Bertrand du Guesclin at the Battle of Cocherel (1364) and taken prisoner. Released next year, he received the seigniory of Nemours and took the oath of fealty to the French king, Charles V, but soon resigned his new fief and returned to his allegiance to the English king. In 1367, he took part in the Battle of Navarrete (1367) in which Du Guesclin was taken prisoner, the captal being entrusted with his safe-keeping. In 1371, Jean de Grailly was appointed constable of Aquitaine, but was taken prisoner next year and interned in the Temple in Paris where, resisting all the tempting offers of the French king, he remained until his death five years later.

It originated from Andres via metathesis. In Sweden, Anders has been one of the most common names for many centuries, earliest attested in 1378. It was common for priests and farmers during medieval times. According to Statistics Sweden, as of December 31, 2002, it ranks 4th among the male names. The great frequency of this name at the point in time (around 1900) when patronymics were converted into family names is the reason why 1 out of every 30 Swedes today is called Andersson. The name day of Anders in the Scandinavian calendar is November 30, and in the old peasant superstition that day was important for determining what the Christmas weather would be. If it was very cold on November 30, there would be much sleet on Christmas (and vice versa). In Denmark (but not in Norway or Sweden), Donald Duck's name is Anders And. The Fering name Anders may have been borrowed from the Danish version.

It is also a tool to assess the operational capacity and to balance diverse views of interested parties. It is also known as office politics and organizational politics. It involves the use of power and social networking within a workplace to achieve changes that benefit the organization or individuals within it. \\"Organizational politics are self-serving behaviors\\" that \\"employees use to increase the probability of obtaining positive outcomes in organizations\\". Influence by individuals may serve personal interests without regard to their effect on the organization itself. Some of the personal advantages may include: * access to tangible assets * or intangible benefits such as status * pseudo-authority that influences the behavior of others Positive politics are behaviors that are designed to influence others with the goal of helping both the organization and the person playing the politics. Examples of positive politics include portraying a professional image, publicizing one's accomplishments, volunteering, and complimenting others. On the other hand, organizational politics can increase efficiency, form interpersonal relationships, expedite change, and profit the organization and its members simultaneously. Both individuals and groups may engage in office politicsMarilyn Haight, Office Politics, BigBadBoss.com which can be highly destructive, as people focus on personal gains at the expense of the organization. \\"Self-serving political actions can negatively influence our social groupings, cooperation, information sharing, and many other organizational functions.\\" Thus it is vital to pay attention to organizational politics and create the right political landscape. Negative politics are designed to achieve personal gain at the expense of others and the organization. Examples of negative politics are spreading rumors, talking behind someone‚Äôs back, and not telling someone important information. \\"Politics is the lubricant that oils your organization's internal gears.\\" John Eldred has characterized politics as \\"simply how power gets worked out on a practical, day-to-day basis.\\"Compare: Psychologist Oliver James identifies the dark triadic personality traits (psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism) as of central significance in understanding office politics. The political landscape Political landscape is a set of hierarchies that link the political players together. In other words, political landscape is what defines relationships between colleagues at a given time. Drafting of this landscape begins with the leaders of the organization influencing the formal hierarchy; which defines the reporting structure and indicates the political setup of the organization as it was initially intended. Organizational hierarchies, each with its own unique political challenges, depend on many factors of the given organization. Said factors include organizational goals, size of the organization, number of resources available and the type of leaders within the organization. Political landscape will change as individuals are introduced into the organizational mix. During the process of working together an informal hierarchy is established. The main link between individuals on a political landscape is the access to-in addition to-the flow of information. This hierarchy can be identified by applying numerical values to relationships in proportion to how much two individuals rate and value one another. The sum value of these relating to an individual establishes the place on the hierarchy. Two or more people estimating relationships and merging results can produce more certain results. People quickly realize who the boss is, whom they depend on for valuable information, and who knows all the office gossip. It is very important to recognize where you fit in this landscape and what power and influence you have within the organization. It is important not only to use that power in pursuit of the organization's goals, but also to ensure others do not abuse it. \\"Each player in the organization has a role in the politics that grease the wheels of getting things done.\\" Gossip Office politics differs from office gossip in that people participating in office politics do so with the objective of gaining advantage, whereas gossip can be a purely social activity. However, the two are somewhat related. Office gossip is often used by an individual to place themselves at a point where they can control the flow of information, and therefore gain maximum advantage. The secretive nature of organizational politics differentiates it from public gossip and thus, may be more harmful to the organization. Both can cause one to doubt the intentions of co-workers, which creates a hostile work environment. Office politics also refers to the way co-workers act among each other. Employee interaction holds the potential to be either positive or negative (i.e. cooperative or competitive). Manipulation At the root of office politics is the issue of manipulation. Manipulation can be present in any relationship where one or more of the parties involved uses indirect means to achieve their goals. In the workplace, where resources are limited, individuals often have an incentive to achieve their goals at the expense of their colleagues. For example, if six people apply for one promotion, they might expect the selection to be made purely on merit. If one of the candidates were to believe that this would put them at a disadvantage, they may use other means of coercion or influence to put themselves into an advantageous position. When those who have fallen subject to the manipulation begin to talk to each other directly‚Äîor when other evidence comes to light such as financial results‚Äîthe manipulator will have an explanation ready but will already be planning their exit, as they are driven to stay in control, not to face a revelation which would expose his behavior. Aims The aims of office politics or manipulation in the workplace are not always increased pay or a promotion. Often, the goal may simply be greater power or control for its own end; or to discredit a competitor. Office politics do not necessarily stem from purely selfish gains. They can be a route towards corporate benefits, which give a leg up to the company as a whole, not just an individual. \\"A 'manipulator' will often achieve career or personal goals by co-opting as many colleagues as possible into their plans.\\" Despite the fact that the hidden agenda is a personal victory, allying with unsuspecting co-workers strengthens the manipulator's personal position and ensures that they will be the last person accused of wrongdoing. Issues Office politics is a major issue in business because the individuals who manipulate their working relationships consume time and resources for their own gain at the expense of the team or company. In addition to this problem, the practice of office politics can have an even more serious effect on major business processes such as strategy formation, budget setting, performance management, and leadership. This occurs because when individuals are playing office politics, it interferes with the information flow of a company. Information can be distorted, misdirected, or suppressed, in order to manipulate a situation for short-term personal gain. Games One way of analyzing office politics in more detail is to view it as a series of games.Berne, Eric, Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships, Jan. 2010, Penguin Books Ltd., These games can be analyzed and described in terms of the type of game and the payoff. Interpersonal games are games that are played between peers (for example the game of \\"No Bad News\\" where individuals suppress negative information, and the payoff is not risking upsetting someone); leadership games are played between supervisor and employee (for example the game of \\"Divide and Conquer\\" where the supervisor sets his employees against each other, with the payoff that none threatens his power base); and budget games are played with the resources of an organization (for example the game of \\"Sandbagging\\" where individuals negotiate a low sales target, and the payoff is a bigger bonus).Games At Work - How to recognize and reduce office politics Goldstein, Read and Cashman April 2009, Jossey Bass Wiley, Dealing with organizational politics Organizational politics is itself similar to a game, one that requires an assumption of risks just like any contact sport. \\"It must be played with diligence and a full understanding of the landscape, players and rules.\\" \\"The dynamics of the situation should always dictate a reexamination of the players and how they fit into the landscape.\\" One must be careful relying on alliances made on previous circumstances; once the situation changes, alliances need to be reassessed. Building strong alliances will maximize the efficiency of the collective political radar and alert you before conflicts arise. In time of conflict, data-driven employees who rely on hard facts will have an easier time diffusing political conflicts. Always looking out for the best interests of your company is a certain way to ensure that your motivation will remain unquestioned. L.A. Witt, from the University of New Orleans, through his findings, believes that if supervisors were to mold employee values to match their own, it would protect employees from the negative effects of organizational politics and help improve their performance.

Its focus is the team's analytical, evidence-based, sabermetric approach to assembling a competitive baseball team despite Oakland's small budget. A film based on Lewis' book, starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, was released in 2011. Synopsis The central premise of Moneyball is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the front office) over the past century is outdated, subjective, and often flawed. Statistics such as stolen bases, runs batted in, and batting average, typically used to gauge players, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game and the statistics available at that time. Before sabermetrics was introduced to baseball, teams were dependent on the skills of their scouts to find and evaluate players. Scouts are experienced in the sport, usually having been players or coaches. The book argues that the Oakland A's' front office took advantage of more analytical gauges of player performance to field a team that could outsmart and better compete against richer competitors in Major League Baseball (MLB). Rigorous statistical analysis had demonstrated that on-base percentage and slugging percentage are better indicators of offensive success, and the A's became convinced that these qualities were cheaper to obtain on the open market than more historically valued qualities such as speed and contact. These observations often flew in the face of conventional baseball wisdom and the beliefs of many baseball scouts and executives. By re-evaluating their strategy in this way, the 2002 Athletics, with approximately $44 million in salary, were competitive with larger market teams such as the New York Yankees, who spent over $125 million in payroll that season. Because of its smaller budget, Oakland had to find players undervalued by the market, and their system has proven itself thus far. The approach brought the A's to the playoffs in 2002 and 2003. Lewis explored several themes in the book, such as insiders vs. outsiders (established traditionalists vs. upstart proponents of sabermetrics), the democratization of information causing a flattening of hierarchies, and \\"the ruthless drive for efficiency that capitalism demands\\". The book also touches on Oakland's underlying economic need to stay ahead of the curve; as other teams begin mirroring Beane's strategies to evaluate offensive talent, diminishing the Athletics' advantage, Oakland begins looking for other undervalued baseball skills, such as defensive capabilities. Distribution of team salaries in 2002. Team salaries ranged from about $35 million (the Tampa Bay Devil Rays) to about $120 million (the New York Yankees) The Oakland Athletics had the third-lowest team payroll in the league (about $40 million) marginally higher than that of the Montreal Expos, whose franchise was transferred to the Washington Nationals in 2005. Moneyball also touches on the A's' methods of prospect selection. Sabermetricians argue that a college baseball player's chance of MLB success is much higher than the more traditional high school draft pick. Beane maintains that high draft picks spent on high school prospects, regardless of talent or physical potential as evaluated by traditional scouting, are riskier than those spent on more polished college players. Adding on, college players have played more games and thus there is a larger mass of statistical data to base expensive decisions off. Lewis cites A's minor leaguer Jeremy Bonderman, drafted out of high school in 2001 over Beane's objections, as an example of the type of draft pick Beane would avoid. Bonderman had all of the traditional \\"tools\\" that scouts look for, but thousands of such players have been signed by MLB organizations out of high school over the years and failed to develop as anticipated. Lewis explores the A's approach to the 2002 MLB draft, when the team had a run of early picks. The book documents Beane's often tense discussions with his scouting staff (who favored traditional subjective evaluation of potential rather than objective sabermetrics) in preparation for the draft to the actual draft, which defied all expectations and was considered at the time a wildly successful (if unorthodox) effort by Beane. Moneyball traces the history of the sabermetric movement back to such people as Bill James (then a member of the Boston Red Sox front office) and Craig R. Wright. Lewis explores how James's seminal Baseball Abstract, published annually from the late 1970s through the late 1980s, influenced many of the young, up-and-coming baseball minds that are now joining the ranks of baseball management. Impact Moneyball has entered baseball's lexicon; teams that value sabermetrics are often said to be playing \\"Moneyball.\\" Baseball traditionalists, in particular some scouts and media members, decry the sabermetric revolution and have disparaged Moneyball for emphasizing sabermetrics over more traditional methods of player evaluation. Nevertheless, Moneyball changed the way many major league front offices do business. In its wake, teams such as the New York Mets, New York Yankees, San Diego Padres, St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Red Sox, Washington Nationals, Arizona Diamondbacks, Cleveland Indians, and the Toronto Blue Jays have hired full-time sabermetric analysts. When the Mets hired Sandy Alderson - Beane's predecessor and mentor with the A's - as their general manager after the 2010 season, and hired Beane's former associates Paul DePodesta and J.P. Ricciardi to the front office, the team was jokingly referred to as the \\"Moneyball Mets\\". Like the Oakland A's in the 1990s, the Mets have been directed by their ownership to slash payroll. Under Alderson's tenure, the team payroll dropped below $100 million per year from 2012 to 2014, and the Mets reached the 2015 World Series (defeating MLB's highest-payroll team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, en route). Lewis has acknowledged that the book's success may have hurt the Athletics' fortunes as other teams accepted sabermetrics, reducing Oakland's edge. Daryl Morey's analytical approach in the NBA has been called \\"Moreyball\\". Since the book's publication and success, Lewis has discussed plans for a sequel to Moneyball called Underdogs, revisiting the players and their relative success several years into their careers, although only four players from the 2002 draft played much at the Major League level. Moneyball has also influenced and been influenced by other professional sports teams including European club association football (soccer). Beane has regarded Arsenal's former manager Ars√®ne Wenger as a personal idol. Beane has held discussions with Wenger, former Manchester United F.C. manager Sir Alex Ferguson, and Liverpool F.C. owner John W. Henry. His friendship with ex-Arsenal scout Damien Comolli and Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke allowed him to delve deep into the world of English football.According to El Pa√≠s, Liverpool F.C. co-owner John W. Henry didn't trust public opinion so he looked for a mathematical method similar to the one used for Boston Red Sox (in guiding them to three World Series wins) which he also owns via Fenway Sports Group. The mathematical model turned out to be that of Cambridge physicist Ian Graham, which was used to select the manager (J√ºrgen Klopp) and players essential for Liverpool to win the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League. People discussed in the book Moneyball covers the lives and careers of several baseball personalities. The central one is Billy Beane, whose failed playing career is contrasted with wildly optimistic predictions by scouts.

Thaler of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and Cass R. Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School described the book as a \\"sensation... Lewis has a wonderful story to tell, and he tells it wonderfully... Lewis also raises some serious puzzles that he does not resolve, and his account has some large and perhaps profound implications that he does not much explore.\\" David Haglund of Slate and Jonah Keri of Grantland have both criticized the book for glossing over key young talent acquired through the draft and signed internationally. Specifically, they have argued that the book ignores the pitching trio of Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder, and Barry Zito, as well as position players such as Eric Chavez and Miguel Tejada, all of whom were discovered via traditional scouting methodology and were key contributors to the success of the 2002 Athletics. In 2002, Barry Zito received the AL Cy Young Award and Miguel Tejada received the AL MVP Award. Film A movie based on the book was released in 2011. Actor Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, while Jonah Hill plays a fictional character based on Paul DePodesta; Philip Seymour Hoffman plays A's manager Art Howe. Academy Award-winning screenwriter Steve Zaillian was hired to write the script, and Steven Soderbergh was slated to direct, replacing David Frankel.Siegel, Tatiana. \\"Columbia pitches Moneyball to Pitt\\", Variety (October 16, 2008). But in June 2009, because of conflicts over a revised script by Soderbergh, Sony put the movie on hold just days before it was scheduled to begin shooting. Soderbergh was eventually let go. Bennett Miller took over directing duties, and Aaron Sorkin rewrote the script. Shooting began in July 2010 at Blair Field, the Sports Stadium for Wilson High School (Long Beach, California), Sony Studios in Culver City, Dodger Stadium, and the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum. The film was released in theaters on September 23, 2011. Moneyball was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Actor and Best Picture. In popular culture The book is parodied in the Simpsons episode \\"MoneyBART\\", in which Lisa manages Bart's Little League baseball team using sabermetric principles. Bill James made an appearance in this episode. The film adaptation is mentioned in Brooklyn Nine-Nine as being Captain Raymond Holt's favourite film because of the beauty of its statistical analysis.

It originally ran from 1986 to 1993. A revival ran in 2000, and the most recent revival aired from 2018 to 2019. Hosted by Marc Summers, the program originally premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986, as its first game show. The series saw many adjustments in scheduling and titling throughout its run. Almost immediately after its debut, Double Dare had more than tripled viewership for Nickelodeon's afternoon lineup, becoming the most-watched original daily program on cable television. The program was a major success for Nickelodeon, helping to establish the network as a major player in cable television, and to revitalize the genre of game shows for children. Double Dare remains Nickelodeon's longest-running game show. In January 2001, TV Guide ranked the show number 29 on its list of 50 Greatest Game Shows. A continuation for syndication premiered on February 22, 1988, later revamped as Super Sloppy Double Dare on January 22, 1989. The program also had a short run on Fox as Family Double Dare, airing from April 3 to July 23, 1988. Nickelodeon continued Family Double Dare, premiering a new version on October 6, 1990. The original series ended on February 6, 1993. The series was revived, hosted by Jason Harris, and titled Double Dare 2000; this aired from January 22 to November 10, 2000. A second revival of the series, hosted by Liza Koshy and featuring Marc Summers, premiered on June 25, 2018. The second revival series ended on December 20, 2019. Gameplay=Main game Each team on the original Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare consisted of two children, while teams on Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000 included two adults and two children. Originally, both teams wore red uniforms, but after Double Dare entered syndication in 1988, one team wore blue uniforms while the other wore red. Each round begins with a toss-up physical challenge in which both teams compete, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host begins asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earns a monetary award, and allows the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turns control over to the opponents. However, the team can dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents can double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control is challenged to a double dare, they have to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awards both control and the appropriate amount of money to the team that issues it. The second round plays the same as the first, with question values doubled. On the original Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, a question was initially worth $10. On Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, a question was initially worth $25. On the 2018 Double Dare, a question was initially worth $50, later 50 points. After the toss-up at the start of the first round, the host explains the rules as follows: Physical challenges A 1990 Family Double Dare toss-up physical challenge showing two contestants trying to catch a \\"meatball\\" in a bowl of \\"spaghetti.\\" Physical challenges are often messy stunts that a team has to perform in a specified time, usually 20 or 30 seconds, although occasionally 10 or 15 seconds. All physical challenges on Double Dare 2000 were 30 seconds in length, unless a time reduction was in play due to the Triple Dare Challenge. The team wins money and retained control for completing the stunt. Otherwise, the money and control pass to their opponents. Many challenges have involved filling a container past a line with one of a variety of substances including water, uncooked rice, green slime, whipped cream, and milk. Others involve catching a specific number of items before time runs out. For example, during \\"Pies in the Pants,\\" a contestant has to catch a set number of pies in a pair of oversized clown pants within the specified time limit, while their teammate launches the pies from a foot-operated catapult at the opposite end of the stage. On the original Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, both contestants on a team competed in all physical challenges. For the 1988 version of Family Double Dare, all four members of a team competed in the challenges. On the 1990‚Äì93 version of Family Double Dare and on Double Dare 2000, two members of a team competed in round one, and all four members competed in round two. All members of a team competed in physical challenges in the first season of the 2018 Double Dare, while most challenges in the second season are for two players. Double Dare 2000 introduced the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed a team to make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents. Obstacle course The Sundae Slide being prepared on a 1987 Double Dare obstacle course. The team with the highest score at the end of round two goes on to the bonus round, the obstacle course (renamed the Slopstacle Course for Double Dare 2000). From the original Double Dare through Double Dare 2000 both teams keep all money earned, regardless of the outcome. Only the winning team on the 2018 version gets to keep their money. The course consists of eight obstacles which have to be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle has an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it. One team member runs the first obstacle, then passes its flag to a partner, who then moves on to the next obstacle. The team continues to alternate in this manner until they have completed the course or until time expires. For safety reasons, team members are given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course. Many obstacles have appeared in the course rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life. Popular elements of the obstacle course have included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an oversized hamster wheel; Pick It, a giant human nose with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a playground slide with ice cream at the bottom; and Gum Drop, which required contestants to leap into a giant gumball machine filled with plastic balls and slide out through the dispensing hatch at the bottom. Through January 2019, the team would win a prize for each obstacle completed, escalating in value up to a grand prize for completing the entire course. Two-person teams split cash earnings from the front game, and both contestants receive the same physical prize for each obstacle. Prizes have included televisions, concert tickets, encyclopedias, electronics, gift certificates, non-motorized modes of transportation and, on the Fox Family Double Dare, cash. On the original and Super Sloppy versions, the grand prize was usually a vacation or an experience at Space Camp. All eight prizes were usually worth a total of between $3,000 and $4,000, with some episodes featuring a prize package nearing $10,000. On the Fox Family Double Dare, as well as the first season of the Nickelodeon run, the grand prize was a vehicle, making all eight prizes worth between $15,000 and $25,000. Once again, the grand prize was typically a vacation for the second season of Nickelodeon's Family Double Dare, Double Dare 2000 and the first season of the 2018 Double Dare, with grand prize packages on the 2018 version having a value of more than $6,000. With the premiere of the second season of the 2018 revival, the obstacle course is now played for $500 cash for each obstacle completed, with a total jackpot of $5,000 for successfully completing the course. Cash values were doubled for the finals game of a tournament series. Broadcast and production history=1986‚Äì1989 Marc Summers hosted Double Dare from 1986 to 1993. In the mid-1980s, Nickelodeon was approached by production and consulting groups with the idea of doing a game show for children, a first for the network. Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults, but they did not have a game show targeted at their demographic. Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse Trap. The pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby. Double Dare was green-lighted and announced in June 1986. Initial candidates to host the program included Soupy Sales, host of children's variety shows in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian Dana Carvey. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for Saturday Night Live, the search for a host continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from New York or Los Angeles. First attending a tryout in lieu of a friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television warm-up comedian Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition. Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host Double Dare. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a commercial break was more professional and he was hired for the position in the first week of September 1986. Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers, then 34 years old, was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly. In need of an announcer, Double Dare producers were made aware of Philadelphia-area radio host John Harvey, known on-air as Harvey, whose Harvey in the Morning program on WIOQ had been canceled months earlier. He accepted the offer to be announcer of the program. Stage assistants also appeared on- camera on Double Dare, initially only assisting in setting up physical challenges and obstacles, but expanding the role as the series continued to sometimes interacting with Summers, demonstrating challenges, and modeling prizes. Robin Marrella and Dave Shikiar were the two permanent stage assistants when the program began. James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor created the original stage design for Double Dare. The design for the original series' set was inspired by a 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the Memphis Group. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, often in a checkerboard pattern, were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set to look like a natatorium (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom. All the original Double Dare music was composed by Edd Kalehoff. Production originated at the studios of PBS affiliate WHYY-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. WHYY offered Nickelodeon their newly opened production wing to use, and Nickelodeon felt Philadelphia was a better location to initially produce Double Dare because of its lower production costs, instead of cities like New York or Los Angeles where national television production is more common. The 65-episode first season was recorded in a 23-day period beginning September 18, 1986. Double Dare premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986. New episodes aired weekdays at 5:30p.m. ET during the original series' run on Nickelodeon. After the success of the first 65 episodes, a second 65-episode season was ordered. Double Dare logo, used for the original series. A weekend edition titled Super Sloppy Double Dare began taping in July 1987 and premiered August 2, 1987, with an initial 26-episode run. Super Sloppy Double Dare featured gameplay identical to the original format; however, physical challenges and obstacles were designed to make a bigger mess. Viewers were encouraged to send in a postcard with their contact information and could win a prize if their card was selected, and a team performing a physical challenge completed the stunt successfully. Episodes of Super Sloppy Double Dare were taped at Unitel Studio in New York City before production moved back to WHYY-TV. In July 1987, pilots hosted by Bruce Jenner were produced by Viacom for two possible versions of Double Dare with adult players: one pairing celebrities with contestants, and another with married couples. Neither concept advanced to a full series. By November 1987, Fox announced they had partnered with Viacom to purchase the distribution rights for new episodes of the program in syndication. New episodes of Double Dare aired on independent stations and Fox affiliates beginning on February 22, 1988. There were 130 first-run syndication episodes in 1988. A 13-episode Saturday night edition titled Family Double Dare aired on Fox from April 3 to July 23, 1988. Teams on this version consisted of four family members, most often a mother, father, and two children. The budget was increased, and the prize total featured during the obstacle course was larger than that featured on the Nickelodeon series. A further 13 episodes of Family Double Dare were then ordered, but Fox canceled the series shortly before production was to begin because of \\"creative differences.\\" On January 5, 1989, production began on a new version of Super Sloppy Double Dare from Philadelphia at WHYY-TV, continuing in syndication. The series premiered on January 22, 1989. The second half of the series was produced at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, with production beginning in April 1989. This version of the show recorded in larger studios with a larger set allowed for a lower level devoted to physical challenges and obstacles with a bigger size and, typically, bigger messes. Many episodes in this part of the series featured unique and offbeat themes that questions, challenges, and sometimes wardrobe would be patterned after. Themes included a Salute to Baseball, Backwards Day, Stupid Hat Day, a Salute to Breakfast, and two Super-Slop-a- Mania episodes featuring wrestlers and personalities from the World Wrestling Federation. Another special episode saw Summers and Harvey each team with a contestant to compete against each other, with Jim J. Bullock taking over hosting duties. By the end of Super Sloppy Double Dare, the program was syndicated to 154 stations. The series left syndication on September 8, 1989. 1990‚Äì1993 A contestant, dressed in a \\"hot dog bun\\", is covered in \\"mustard\\" and has completed a 1990 Family Double Dare physical challenge. Family Double Dare returned to Nickelodeon on August 13, 1990, first airing repeats of the Fox version. A Salute to Double Dare special aired September 2, 1990, with Summers, Harvey, and Marrella highlighting moments from Double Dare, discussing its popularity, and previewing the upcoming Family Double Dare. Nickelodeon launched its own version of Family Double Dare on weekends beginning October 6, 1990. Nickelodeon produced the series at the newly-opened Nickelodeon Studios on the Universal Studios Florida grounds in Orlando. Production began in July 1990 and ended on July 24, 1992, with 80 episodes taped over two seasons. Between the production cycles of Family Double Dare, two special episodes of Double Dare were recorded in January 1992: NBA All- Star Double Dare with National Basketball Association alumni and Super Special Double Dare with members of the casts of Clarissa Explains It All and Welcome Freshmen. Jamie Bojanowski and Chris Miles joined Robin Marrella as stage assistants for Family Double Dare, replacing Dave Shikiar who left the series between the ending of Super Sloppy Double Dare in 1989 and the beginning of Family Double Dare in 1990 to pursue production opportunities on other programs like The Home Show and Wild & Crazy Kids. In order to spend time with his wife and his newborn son Caleb, Harvey did not announce the last season of Family Double Dare in 1992. He was replaced as announcer by Doc Holliday, an Orlando-area radio host on WXXL's Doc & Johnny in the Morning. Harvey made a cameo appearance on the final episode of the season and the series. Family Double Dare concluded on February 6, 1993, with a one-hour Tournament of Champions episode. The episode featured a \\"brains vs. brawn\\" mini-tournament where the two families from the final season who answered the most questions correctly played against each other, and the two families from the final season with the fastest obstacle course times played against each other. The winners of those games competed to determine the 1993 Family Double Dare champions. Physical challenges from Double Dare appeared on Nickelodeon All- Star Challenge, a three-part special combining elements from many of Nickelodeon's game shows, airing on October 3, 1994. Repeats of the original Double Dare continued to air on Nickelodeon until March 15, 1991, and returned to Nickelodeon's schedule again from June 12 to September 30, 1994. Repeats of Family Double Dare remained on the Nickelodeon schedule until January 31, 1999. At this time, development began for the revival that would become Double Dare 2000. Double Dare has spawned versions in foreign countries throughout the world, including: Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, The Netherlands, Germany, India, and Brazil. Six episodes of the Australian version recorded for American consumption, one featuring an American team competing against an Australian team, aired on Nickelodeon during a special marathon on September 3, 1990. Repeats of all versions of Double Dare aired in various cycles on Nick GAS from the network's inception in 1999 until its closure in 2009. From 2011 to 2019, Double Dare was incorporated into the branding of TeenNick's classic Nickelodeon blocks The '90s Are All That, and its successor, The Splat (later known as NickSplat and presently NickRewind). Episodes of Double Dare have occasionally aired in these blocks. Double Dare 2000 On December 20, 1999, Nickelodeon announced a revival of the original Double Dare show, titled Double Dare 2000. Production began on January 5, 2000, and the show broadcast its first episode later that same month on January 22, 2000, now hosted by Jason Harris with Tiffany Phillips as announcer. Additional episodes were taped in July of the same year. Eileen Braun, who worked on the original Double Dare as a production assistant and a production coordinator, was the executive producer for Double Dare 2000. Marc Summers advised on production as an executive consultant. Tia Schroeder and Will Finley worked on Double Dare 2000 as stage assistants. Double Dare 2000 followed the Family Double Dare format with a revamped set and bigger physical challenges. It also featured the new Triple Dare Challenge option in round two, and referred to the obstacle course as the Slopstacle Course. In association with Sony and National Mobile Television, five episodes of Double Dare 2000 were produced in high-definition with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The episodes were broadcast in a 4:3 letterboxed format as Nickelodeon did not broadcast in high-definition until 2008. The music for Double Dare 2000, a remix of the original soundtrack, was composed by former Crack the Sky guitarist Rick Witkowski. Byron Taylor again served as set designer. The series concluded on November 10, 2000. Repeats remained on the Nickelodeon schedule until July 29, 2001. 2012‚Äì2016 Beginning May 21, 2012, Nickelodeon Suites Resort in Orlando produced Double Dare as a nightly live stage presentation, Double Dare Live. As part of the Studio Nick feature of the hotel, shows were performed each night exclusively for the resort's guests. The show featured elements and updates from the various versions of Double Dare, including remixed music, physical challenges and an obstacle course similar to the TV show. Like the most recent formats of the program, eight contestants were selected to participate for the game- playing teams, while additional audience members played other physical challenges throughout the program. The production continued until Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando rebranded as a Holiday Inn Resort on June 1, 2016. A scaled-down version of Double Dare Live, called Double Dare Challenge, has been presented at Nickelodeon Universe in Mall of America in seasonal cycles since 2016. On July 22, 2016, special live editions of Double Dare, produced by Nickelodeon and The Splat with original host Marc Summers, took place at Fluxx nightclub during San Diego Comic-Con 2016. The event was live-streamed on The Splat's Facebook page and included in the later anniversary special. The week of July 25, 2016, The Splat aired a Double Dare-themed week featuring episodes and moments from the series' history, and included edited versions of the Comic-Con games. These events marked Summers' first Nickelodeon-sponsored involvement with the brand since Double Dare 2000. 2018 version Liza Koshy hosted Double Dare from 2018 to 2019. A half-hour special presentation, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the show's premiere, the Double Dare Reunion Special, aired on November 23, 2016, on Nick at Nite, with an encore airing on The Splat. The special included vintage clips, behind-the-scenes footage, and a new game recorded at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 played by cast members from All That. Summers, announcer Harvey, and stage assistant Robin Russo (n√©e Marrella) appeared in the special. 1.126 million viewers watched the special on Nick at Nite, outperforming all other shows on the network for the evening, and finishing as the third-most viewed of all non-sports original cable telecasts among viewers ages 18 to 34 for that day. In 2017, Summers stated that, due to the success of the special, he was in negotiations to return to Double Dare in some form with Nickelodeon. News outlets reported in March 2018 that Nickelodeon was producing a new series of Blue's Clues, and was in negotiations to reboot Clarissa Explains It All, two shows originally made by the network in the 1990s. Upon learning of these developments, and inspired by the success of other contemporary television revivals like Will & Grace, Summers emailed Nickelodeon executives to ask if he was going to be the person to receive \\"the next phone call.\\" On April 25, 2018, Nickelodeon announced a new version of Double Dare, which is the second revival of the show. The network ordered 40 episodes that recorded in Los Angeles at CBS Studio Center throughout June 2018. The series premiered on June 25, airing weeknights. Actress and television/internet personality Liza Koshy hosted the series. Original host Marc Summers also appeared on the series in an on-camera role. Along with performing traditional duties of an announcer, Summers provided commentary on the show's physical challenges and helped introduce elements and transition the game. Summers was also one of the show's executive producers. Fremantle produced the series on behalf of Nickelodeon. The set, designed by James Pearse Connelly, bore a heavy resemblance to the original set used in the 1980s. Updates included using digital screens for displays and decoration, enhanced lighting, and a dedicated space for the obstacle course, though timing and scoring uses emulation of the original vane display-type numerals. Members of the \\"challenge team\\" also appeared as stage assistants, including Eric Pierce, Michelle Kallman, James Michael Ryan Jr., and Stad St. Fleur. Edd Kalehoff remixed and re-composed the original theme song and soundtrack for this version. Episodes broadcast predominantly featured teams of two children competing, but some episodes have participation from teams of one child and one adult family member. An episode also aired with teams of three siblings, and one with teams of two children with two adult family members. Some episodes featured celebrity participants, such as actors from past Nickelodeon series competing, including All That's Jamie Lynn Spears and Josh Server. The 2018 Kids' Choice Sports, which aired on July 20, 2018, culminated with host and basketball player Chris Paul competing against Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps in the Double Dare obstacle course, presented by Liza Koshy and Marc Summers. Because Koshy had difficulty with her voice during the taping of an episode, Summers filled in as host for the second half of a show, which aired on July 26. The first cycle of season one, airing 24 half-hour episodes, concluded on July 27. Episodes resumed airing on September 30, with weekly airings, culminating with a special 60-minute episode featuring Kenan & Kel stars Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell aired on November 21. The final episode of season one aired on February 1, 2019. In celebration of Super Bowl LIII, a special 45-minute episode featuring stars of Nickelodeon comedy Cousins for Life and NFL players was recorded on January 31, 2019 at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, as part of the Super Bowl Experience. The episode was simulcast on Nickelodeon, TeenNick, and Nicktoons on February 3, the same day Super Bowl LIII was held. In January 2019, casting began for a second season of Double Dare. Filming of season two began on February 27 and ran through early March. The season premiered on March 11, with a new tournament format offering cash prizes in the obstacle course. Two teams of four children compete in the first episode, with the winning team splitting up into four individual teams, where each child is paired up with a celebrity. The winning teams from these episodes play against each other in the fourth and final episode of the tournament. The premiere week featured the Kids' Choice Awards Tournament, teaming kids with nominees of the 2019 awards. WWE Superstars Week aired the week of April 22, teaming kids with wrestlers in WWE. SpongeBob Week aired the week of July 8, celebrating the 20th anniversary of SpongeBob Squarepants. Halloween Week aired the week of October 21, celebrating Halloween. The Holiday Tournament aired in four weekly installments, beginning November 29. On August 31, 2019, Summers announced that Double Dare would not be renewed for a third season. The series concluded with the finals of the Holiday Tournament, which aired on December 20, 2019. Reception and achievements=Ratings and impact Within a month of its premiere, Double Dare had more than tripled viewership for Nickelodeon's afternoon schedule becoming the highest-rated original, daily program on cable. During Double Dares first year, the program averaged a 3.0 household Nielsen rating, with over 1 million households tuned in each week. On its February 1988 debut in syndication, the program averaged a 5.4 household Nielsen rating and a 15.4 rating among children ages 2 to 11, and was the second-highest rated syndicated program in that demographic. By January 1989, Double Dare averaged a 3.1 household Nielsen rating. The special Sunday premiere episode of Family Double Dare on Fox on April 3, 1988, scored a 4.0 household Nielsen rating, finishing 5th out of 10 programs broadcast on Fox that week helping to give Fox's Sunday night schedule its highest ratings to that point. When Double Dare 2000 premiered in January 2000, episodes in its first two weeks averaged household Nielsen ratings of up to 3.0, being viewed by up to 2.7 million households, and finishing in the top 25 basic cable programs each week. Double Dare 2000 often won its time slot in viewership among children ages 2 to 11. The June premiere of the 2018 revival was watched by 1.843 million viewers, outperforming all other shows on Nickelodeon for the day, finishing as the highest-rated broadcast for teenagers ages 12 to 17. Double Dare's premiere was Nickelodeon's most-viewed series launch among adults 18 to 49 in more than five years. By the end of its second week, viewership for new episodes hovered around one million overall viewers. At its peak, Double Dare was the highest-rated, live-action show for children ages 8 to 15. The show was also popular with college students, with many schools offering Double Dare fan clubs. Half of Nickelodeon's operating profit in 1988 was due to the success of Double Dare and its syndication. On the show's success, then-senior vice-president of Nickelodeon programming Herb Scannell said that Double Dare was like \\"having a hit record your first time out. Double Dare put Nick on the map.\\" Double Dare revitalized interest in the concept of a game show for children. Less than a year after the program launched, NBC had premiered I'm Telling!, Lorimar Television had announced plans for Fun House, and Nickelodeon's Finders Keepers began airing--all shows based on competition between teams of children. During Double Dares first year on television, junior versions of established game shows including Hollywood Squares and The Cross-Wits were developed for syndication, but ultimately were not produced. Game show executive and producer Bob Boden noted that Double Dare \\"allowed kids to get dirty and have a good time in ways that really were not acceptable before that show\\". Double Dare remains the longest-running game show produced by Nickelodeon. As Double Dare grew messier, a green slime substance became more commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't Do That on Television. Double Dare's high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy Kids and Figure It Out. The relationship of Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network. Critical reception Reviews of the show were often favorable, noting it was fun entertainment for the family. After Double Dare premiered, Kenneth R. Clark, media writer for the Chicago Tribune, observed that when contestants \\"squeal and make faces, it is somehow natural, wholesome and infectious,\\" and said, \\"Double Dare is so refreshing.\\" Noel Holston of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune wrote that \\"kids and game shows, when you think about it, go together like hot fudge and ice cream\\". The Orange County Registers Ellen T. Klein said Double Dare is \\"such fast-paced, furious and messy fun\\" and rated the show as \\"good\\". In 1988, television critic Ken Tucker cited the interaction between, and the performances of host Marc Summers and announcer Harvey as \\"the not-so-secret ingredients in the show's success in drawing adult, as well as youthful, viewers\\". Some criticism came from the feeling that the program was not educational. Others were concerned about food waste like beans and eggs in physical challenges and obstacles. In a \\"Cheers and Jeers\\" section in 1988, TV Guide gave \\"jeers\\" to Double Dare for \\"daring to push beyond the limits of good taste,\\" saying it was \\"gross and insulting to watch.\\" In 1989, television and film critic Jeffrey Lyons wrote that he \\"wouldn't dream of proclaiming that Super Sloppy Double Dare is good for your child. But what's wrong with watching an admittedly dumb‚Äîbut hilarious‚Äîprogram just for fun?\\" Andrea Graham wrote for Common Sense Media that revival series Double Dare 2000 is a \\"fun, action-filled game show that families can watch together ‚Äì amid all the slime are some good messages about family togetherness\\". Original host and executive consultant for Double Dare 2000 Marc Summers said that \\"there were issues\\" with the revival. In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, he said that he felt the length of the Triple Dare Challenge took away from the game and that \\"if we would have done it the way we originally did it, we would have been fine, but unfortunately, it didn't happen\\". The 2018 revival of Double Dare premiered to positive reviews, particularly for host Liza Koshy. Reality Blurred's Andy Dehnart said that the reboot \\"did an excellent job of balancing the old and new,\\" and praised the combination of Koshy and Marc Summers, saying she \\"can absolutely hold her own as host,\\" and \\"her rapport with [Summers] felt natural and playful.\\" Joel Keller of the New York Post's Decider observed that \\"the show belongs to Koshy, who ad libs well and makes the kids feel at ease,\\" and gave Double Dare a favorable \\"stream it\\" rating. Double Dare was nominated for a CableACE Award in the Game Show Special or Series category at the 1989 and 1993 ceremonies, winning the award in 1989, but losing to MTV's Lip Service in 1993. Dana Calderwood was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Children's Series in 1989. Nickelodeon was nominated for a 1988 Golden ACE award, cable's then-highest programming honor, for its \\"pro-social television,\\" including Double Dare by name. In January 2001, TV Guide ranked the show number 29 on its list of 50 Greatest Game Shows. At the 2019 Kids' Choice Awards, Double Dare was nominated in the category of Favorite Reality Show, and Liza Koshy and Marc Summers were nominated as a duo in the category of Favorite TV Host. Double Dare was honored at the 47th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2020 with an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Game Show Other media=Portrayals and parodies Double Dare has been featured in a number of notable visual media since its premiere, often with one or more characters participating as contestants in homages to the series. On \\"Double Dare\\", a 2016 episode of the 1980s-set sitcom The Goldbergs, Adam Goldberg (Sean Giambrone) tries to find the perfect partner to audition to be a contestant on Double Dare. After rejecting his friend Emmy Mirsky (Stephanie Katherine Grant), he eventually runs through a mock obstacle course at a tryout with his grandfather Albert \\"Pops\\" Solomon (George Segal). Neither are selected to take part in the program. Benjamin Bauman and Amy Gross, real-life friends of series' creator Adam F. Goldberg who appeared as contestants on Double Dare in 1988, cameo as producers of the show. A first-season episode of the 2013 Nickelodeon series Sanjay and Craig titled \\"Trouble Dare\\" features the titular characters (voiced by Maulik Pancholy and Chris Hardwick), along with Sanjay's mother and father (voiced by Grey Griffin and Kunal Nayyar), leaving their home after a bug infestation. After asking Remington Tufflips (voiced by Chris D'Elia) to stay in his trailer, and finding that the Dickson family is already occupying it, Tufflips decides which family can stay through a game of Family Double Dare hosted by himself. Harvey (voiced by himself) is concerned with how Tufflips is running the game, until Marc Summers (voiced by himself) appears and declares Sanjay's family the winners of a night's sleep inside the Pick It obstacle. Another Family Double Dare game is seen in the music video for rock band Good Charlotte's 2011 single \\"Last Night.\\" The video shows an abridged game of Family Double Dare, going through questions, physical challenges, and the obstacle course. Marc Summers appears as himself, guitarist Benji Madden appears as Harvey, and band members play contestants and stage assistants. In July 2020, an episode in season four of Nickelodeon's The Loud House aired titled \\"How Double Dare You!\\" in which the Loud family siblings attempt to get on Double Dare. Double Dare has also been subject to parodies and spoofs in various forms. The October 1988 issue of Mad has a spoof of Double Dare called \\"Double Damp\\". Marc Summers and Harvey are lampooned as \\"Muck Slummers\\" and \\"Hardly\\". The piece mocked the program's use of food products, the dangerous nature of some stunts, and the similarity to game show Beat the Clock. Both Summers and Harvey consider being parodied in Mad a high point in their careers. A 2015 episode of the truTV sketch comedy series Friends of the People titled \\"Double Dare\\" guest stars Marc Summers as himself, hosting \\"banned\\" moments from Double Dare. Sketches include a contestant exploding, and another being stuck permanently inside an obstacle. \\"March Dadness,\\" a 2012 episode of The Cleveland Show, features a flashback to a Family Double Dare-like program called Dare Squared. A young Cleveland Brown (voiced by Mike Henry) has difficulty finding an orange flag in an oversized stack of pancakes at the end of the program's obstacle course. Marc Summers voices the frustrated host. Also, in a 2017 episode of Billy on the Street, host Billy Eichner led guest Keegan-Michael Key through an obstacle course with gun law themes titled Super Sloppy Semi-Automatic Double Dare. Eichner has cited Double Dare as a favorite show of his. Merchandise and promotions Marc Summers hosts a physical challenge in Cleveland, Ohio on the Double Dare live tour in November 2018. Reebok has been a major sponsor of Double Dare throughout its run. Every contestant and stage crew member wore a pair of the company's shoes. Additional corporate sponsorships and tie-ins were proposed, including Casio putting their logo on the stage clock, and a Double Dare-branded breakfast cereal, but Nickelodeon declined the offers. From 1987 to 1995, various Double Dare live tours visited venues around the United States. Featuring a format similar to the TV show wherein members of a live local audience could participate, the tour would later incorporate aspects of What Would You Do?, another show hosted by Marc Summers for Nickelodeon. Some events in these tours sold-out arenas they were held in, with attendance of more than 20,000 spectators. The tours and events resumed in 2000 to promote Double Dare 2000. Beginning October 30, 2018, a version of Double Dare once again began touring nationwide. Marc Summers serves as host, with previous Double Dare personality Robin Russo appearing as well. The tour ran through the end of 2019. Double Dares lasting popularity has led to a variety of products being made available. Pressman Toy Corporation released two traditional board games based on the show: The Double Dare home game was released in September 1987 and Wet 'N Wild Double Dare was released in March 1989. Another board game titled Double Dare: The Game was manufactured by Mattel in 2001.

Nedao is believed to be a tributary of the Sava River.Wolfram 1990, p.258. Battle After the death of Attila the Hun, allied forces of the subject peoples under the leadership of Ardaric, king of the Gepids, defeated the Hunnic forces of Ellac, the son of Attila, who had struggled with his brothers Ernak and Dengizich for supremacy after Attila's death. Ellac himself was killed in the battle. According to the 6th-century historian Jordanes: > And so the bravest nations tore themselves to pieces.

Modern views Jordanes claimed that at the Battle of Nedao the Ostrogoths fought against the Huns, but this is rejected by modern historians such as Herwig WolframWolfram 1990, p.259. and Hyun Jin Kim. The latter believes that this is a forged story and that the Ostrogoth king Valamir himself fought alongside the Huns. Alternatively, J.R.

Steve Westly at the 'Tech Titans' Dinner in 2011 with President Obama, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and more. Political career In addition to his professional career, Westly has maintained a concurrent career in the Democratic Party. At age 23 in 1981, he was elected as Northern Treasurer of the California Democratic Party, the youngest party officer ever. He was subsequently elected State Controller of the California Democratic Party in 1983, Northern Chair of the California Democratic Party in 1985, and Vice Chair of the California Democratic Party in 1987. In 1989, he was defeated as State Chair of the California Democratic Party by Jerry Brown. Despite that loss, Westly continued his activism within the party by being elected to the Democratic National Committee in 1988, as the highest vote getter, and was reelected in 1992, 1996, and 2000. Westly ran for California State Controller in 2002 against State Senator Tom McClintock and won by a margin of 22,730 votes (out of 7,258,758 votes cast). Westly garnered 3,289,839 (45.4%) votes while McClintock won the support of 3,273,028 (45.1%) people. Three other candidates won 695,891 (9.5%) votes. California State Controller As Controller, Westly opposed Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's plan to change Proposition 98, which requires a certain amount of the state's budget to go towards funding public education and community colleges,http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050212/news_1n12schools.html and in 2005, he created a tax amnesty plan that allowed individuals and corporations who owed back taxes to prevent facing criminal charges and increased penalties if they would immediately pay their back taxes. Westly's plan brought in a gross amount of $4 billion revenue for the State of California. The state's non-partisan Legislative Analyst's Office states that after refunds and advance payments the net profit of the tax amnesty plan was $380 million.http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/04/19/BAGIPIBFUO1.DTLhttp://www.ftb.ca.gov/amnesty/summary.html Westly also introduced the ReadyReturn plan to simplify tax preparation by offering to send taxpayers a prefilled form from the state, and allowing them to sign and automatically file their tax refund in a pilot program started in 2005. Westly is also in favor of enforcing current laws requiring Californians to pay sales tax on Internet purchases.http://www.sacbee.com/content/politics/story/14259087p-15073366c.html 2006 gubernatorial election On June 19, 2005, Steve Westly announced his candidacy for the 2006 California gubernatorial election. Despite entering the race long after his primary opponent, California State Treasurer Phil Angelides, Westly's campaign picked up considerable momentum, receiving endorsements from such figures as Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, Congressmembers Grace Napolitano, Diane Watson, and Brad Sherman, State Senators Carole Migden, Martha Escutia, and Nell Soto, County Supervisor Yvonne Burke, Assembly Members Judy Chu, Ted Lieu, Rudy Bermudez, and Nicole Parra, former Assembly Speaker and current Los Angeles City Councilman Herb Wesson, the majority of the Los Angeles City Council, and other elected officials at the federal, state, and local levels. Westly also gained the support of 85% of the major newspapers that endorsed in the race, including the San Francisco Chronicle, San Jose Mercury News, Los Angeles Daily News, LA Weekly, Fresno Bee, and many others. Several organizations also endorsed Westly, such as the California Sierra Club, California Police Chiefs Association, California NOW, and the Orange County Professional Firefighters Association. In the months leading up to the election, Westly overcame an early Angelides advantage and gained the edge in various polls, leading by as much as 13 points. Moreover, unlike Angelides, he consistently beat Governor Schwarzenegger in hypothetical general election matchups. Despite Westly's momentum and resources, the California Democratic Party endorsed Angelides at the State Democratic Party Convention. The race turned extremely negative, highlighting environmental controversies surrounding Angelides' background as a real estate developer and Westly's broken pledge to keep his campaign clean. Westly's candidacy also was hurt by an unprecedented multi-million dollar independent expenditure by Sacramento real estate developer and longtime Angelides patron Angelo Tsakopoulos. As election day neared, Westly's momentum dissipated and the race tightened. A Field Poll held on June 2, 2006 had Westly leading Angelides by one percentage point, 35% to 34% with 26% undecided and an error size of +/- 4.5 points. The high number of undecided voters led to the lowest turnout in a California primary election in over half a century. Despite over $80 million spent on the race, including over $35 million of Westly's personal fortune, only 30.8% of California Democrats came out to vote, the lowest number in recent history. Angelides finished on election night with 48% of the vote compared to Westly's 44%. Westly endorsed Angelides' candidacy at a unity breakfast the morning after election night. Angelides' Republican opponent, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has since used quotes from Westly's campaign to attack Angelides. Westly, who endorsed Angelides after the primary, countered, \\"Governor Schwarzenegger has shown great interest in what Steve Westly has to say about 2006. He is right here to tell you that we all need to vote for the Democratic candidate Phil Angelides in November 2006.\\"abc7news.com: Westly Stands Beside Phil Angelides 7/07/06 Phil Angelides was defeated in a landslide by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger during the general election held on November 7, 2006 .http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/11/08/EDG6PKE1EA1.DTL Later career After the election of President Barack Obama in November 2008, it was rumored that Westly was being considered for appointment as Secretary of Energy, though Dr. Steven Chu was ultimately named to that position.\\"Westly 'honored to be considered' for Obama Cabinet\\", San Francisco Business Times, November 13, 2008 Westly's name was also figured in political speculation as a possible candidate for Governor to succeed Schwarzenegger in 2010. Former Governor Jerry Brown won the Democratic nomination and defeated Republican Meg Whitman (also a former eBay executive) in November 2010. Westly supported Brown for governor and hosted a Brown fundraiser in October 2010. He was rumored to run again for Governor of California in 2018, however he did not file to run before the primary. Westly returned to teach a new course at Stanford Business School called ‚ÄúThe Policy, Politics, and Finance for Solving Global Warming‚Äù in Spring of 2020.

It is a quantitative approach to economic history (as opposed to qualitative or ethnographic).Edward L. Glaeser, \\"Remembering the Father of Transportation Economics\\", The New York Times (Economix), October 27, 2009. There has been a revival in 'new economic history' since the late 1990s. Clio by Pierre Mignard, oil on canvas, 1689 History The new economic history originated in 1958 with The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South by American economists Alfred H. Conrad and John R. Meyer. The book would cause a firestorm of controversy with its claim, based on statistical data, that slavery would not have ended in the absence of the U.S. Civil War, as the practice was economically efficient and highly profitable for slaves owners. The term cliometrics‚Äîwhich from Clio, who was the muse of history‚Äîwas originally coined by mathematical economist Stanley Reiter in 1960. Cliometrics became better known when Douglass North and William Parker became the editors of the Journal of Economic History in 1960. The Cliometrics Meetings also began to be held around this time at Purdue University and are still held annually in different locations. North, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, would go on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in October 1993 along with Robert William Fogel, himself often described as the father of modern econometric history and Neo-historicals.The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1993, Press Release, October 12, 2003. The two were honoured \\"for having renewed research in economic history;\\" the Academy noted that \\"they were pioneers in the branch of economic history that has been called the 'new economic history,' or cliometrics.\\" Fogel and North received the prize for turning the theoretical and statistical tools of modern economics on the historical past: on subjects ranging from slavery and railroads to ocean shipping and property rights. North was heralded as a pioneer in the \\"new\\" institutional history. In the Nobel announcement, specific mention was made of a 1968 paper on ocean shipping, in which North showed that organizational changes played a greater role in increasing productivity than did technological change. Fogel is especially noted for using careful empirical work to overturn conventional wisdom. With that being said, the new economic history revolution is thought to have begun in the mid-1960s, where areas of key interest included transportation history, slavery, and agriculture. The discipline was resisted as many incumbent economic historians were either historians or economists who had very little connection to economic modeling or statistical techniques. According to cliometric economist Claudia Goldin, the success of the cliometric revolution had as an unintended consequence the disappearance of economic historians from history departments. As economic historians started using the same tools as economists, they started to seem more like other economists. In Goldin's words, \\"the new economic historians extinguished the other side.\\" The other side nearly disappeared altogether, with only a few remaining in history departments and business schools. However, some new economic historians did, in fact, begin research around this time, among them were Kemmerer and Larry Neal (a student of Albert Fishlow, a leader of the cliometric revolution) from Illinois, Paul Uselding from Johns Hopkins, Jeremy Atack from Indiana, and Thomas Ulen from Stanford. Cliometrics would be introduced to Germany by American-born and -educated Richard H. Tilly in the 1970s. The Cliometric Society, a group to encourage and further the study of cliometrics, was founded in 1983. There has been a revival in 'new economic history' since the late 1990s. The number of papers on economic history published in the top economics journals has increased in the last decades, comprising 6.6% of articles in the American Economic Review and 10.8% of articles in the Quarterly Journal of Economics for the period 2004-2014. Today, cliometric approaches are standard in several journals, including the Journal of Economic History, Explorations in Economic History, the European Review of Economic History, and Cliometrica. Critics Cliometrics has had sharp critics. Francesco Boldizzoni summarized a common critique by arguing that cliometrics is based on the false assumption that the laws of neo- classical economics always apply to human activity. Those laws, he says, are based on rational choice and maximization as they operate in well-developed markets, and do not apply to economies other than those of the capitalist West in the modern era. Instead, Boldizzoni argues that the workings of economies are determined by social, political and cultural conditions specific to each society and time period. On the other hand, Claude Diebolt (2016) argued that cliometrics is mature and well accepted by scholars as an \\"indispensable tool\\" in economic history. He says most scholars agree that economic theory, combined with new data as well as historical and statistical methods are necessary to formulate problems precisely, to draw conclusions from postulates and to gain insight into complex processes in order to close the gap between Geisteswissenschaften and Naturwissenschaften, i.e. to move from the historical verstehen or understanding side to the economic erkl√§ren or explaining side or, much better, mixing both approaches for the achievement of a unified approach of the social sciences. At the applied level, cliometrics is accepted as the way to measure variables and estimate parameters. A criticism of Cliometrics by Joseph T. Salerno, based on the perspective of the Austrian School of economics, especially that of Ludwig von Mises, can be found in his Introduction to Murray N. Rothbard's A History of Money and Banking in the United States. Distinguishing cliometrics and cliodynamics Cliometrics and cliodynamics share the scientific ambition of using quantitative tools and historical data to test general historical principles. Both fields endeavor to gather large amounts of historical data across big samples. However, the two fields also differ in several ways. Cliodynamics maintains a close relationship with the natural sciences, often employing dominant methods from the natural sciences such as differential-equation models, power-law relations, and agent-based models. Evolutionary game theory and social network analysis are also frequently employed by cliodynamicists, but less often by cliometricians. Cliodynamicists also tend to include factors associated with ecological context and biological determinants in their models.

Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Colac) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Colac was laid down by Mort's Dock and Engineering Company at Balmain, New South Wales on 18 April 1941. She was launched on 30 August 1941 by Miss M. Heady, senior lady on the staff of Morts Dock and Engineering, and commissioned into the RAN on 6 January 1942. The ship was originally to be named HMAS Hamilton. Operational history=World War II After entering service, Colac was assigned as an anti-submarine patrol and convoy escort vessel, operating between Townsville and New Guinea. This continued until December 1942, when Colac and sister ships Ballarat and Broome were ordered to support the Allied efforts to recapture Buna-Gona by embarking 762 Australian soldiers and delivering them as far into the Japanese-occupied Oro Province of Papua New Guinea as possible. The first attempt, early on 14 December, saw 46 soldiers landed at Cape Sudest before the three corvettes were attacked by Japanese aircraft and forced to withdraw. That night, under the cover of darkness, the remaining troops were landed nearby. Throughout December, Colac was involved in three similar troop deployments, and later took part in Operation Lilliput; the reinforcement and supply of the captured area. In March 1943, Colac and Ballarat were reassigned to convoy escort duty along the east coast of Australia. On 26 April, a five-ship convoy escorted by the two corvettes was attacked by Japanese submarine I-177 off Cape Byron. The MV Limerick was torpedoed and sunk, with all but two of the crew rescued by Colac. I-177 escaped unharmed. In July, Colac was instructed to begin escorting convoys between Australia and New Guinea, before returning to east coast convoys at the start of 1944, then undergoing a refit. In April 1944, Colac was assigned to escort and patrol duties in New Guinea waters, which continued until April 1945, when the corvette was one of four RAN ships providing gunfire support for operations in the Wewak area. In mid-May, Colac was assigned to harass Japanese bases in the Solomon Islands area. On 26 May, the ship suffered her first casualties of the war, two hits from Japanese shore batteries killed two sailers, wounded two others, and holed Colac at the waterline. The corvette jettisoned stores, her depth charge payload, and replaceable pieces of equipment to avoid sinking and escape, and later limped to the Treasury Islands under tow for repairs. Temporary repairs were made to allow Colac to sail to New Guinea and then to Sydney, where she arrived on 18 June and entered dock for repairs. Colac was still under repair when World War II ended, and she was paid off into reserve on 27 November 1945. The corvette was awarded two battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Pacific 1942‚Äì45\\" and \\"New Guinea 1942‚Äì44\\". Training ship On 20 February 1951, Colac was recommissioned for use as a training ship for National Service trainees. Decommissioning and fate Colac was returned to reserve on 30 January 1953. In 1962, the ship was converted into a tank cleaning vessel, and served in this role until 30 September 1983. Colac was not recommissioned during this time. On 4 March 1987, Colac was sunk by a Mark 48 torpedo fired by the submarine HMAS Ovens in a weapons test. The corvette sank at .

In computing, tree data structures, and game theory, the branching factor is the number of children at each node, the outdegree. If this value is not uniform, an average branching factor can be calculated. For example, in chess, if a \\"node\\" is considered to be a legal position, the average branching factor has been said to be about 35, and a statistical analysis of over 2.5 million games revealed an average of 31. This means that, on average, a player has about 31 to 35 legal moves at their disposal at each turn. By comparison, the average branching factor for the game Go is 250. Higher branching factors make algorithms that follow every branch at every node, such as exhaustive brute force searches, computationally more expensive due to the exponentially increasing number of nodes, leading to combinatorial explosion. For example, if the branching factor is 10, then there will be 10 nodes one level down from the current position, 102 (or 100) nodes two levels down, 103 (or 1,000) nodes three levels down, and so on. The higher the branching factor, the faster this \\"explosion\\" occurs. The branching factor can be cut down by a pruning algorithm. The average branching factor can be quickly calculated as the number of non-root nodes (the size of the tree, minus one; or the number of edges) divided by the number of non-leaf nodes.

A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803‚Äì1859, Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 The area was first settled by Europeans in 1837 by Hugh Murray (died 1869) and his brother Andrew (died 1889) in 1840, and proclaimed a town, Lake Colac, in 1848. The Post Office opened on 1 July 1848 as Lake Colac and was renamed Colac in 1854. Colac Botanic Gardens in Queen Street located on the shores of Lake Colac, were established in 1868. Brookhouse Mystery In 1854 town founder Hugh Murray employed a couple of shepherds named Thomas Brookhouse and Patrick Geary. Brookhouse who was looking for missing sheep disappeared without a trace. Patrick Geary and his wife soon left the district. Fifteen years later a boy out rabbiting found the skeletal remains of Thomas Brookhouse under a pile of rocks near Lake Corangamite. Brookhouse had his head smashed in. It took Police two years to track Patrick Geary and charge him with Brookhouse's murder. A friend of Geary told the court that Geary had killed Brookhouse with an axe to stop him from informing Murray of Geary's sheep stealing activities.http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&d;=WI18711208.2.13 Geary was hanged in Melbourne in 1871.

Collins was one of the first graduates of the Royal Australian Naval College to attain flag rank. During the Second World War, he commanded the cruiser in the Mediterranean campaign. He led the Australian Naval Squadron in the Pacific theatre and was wounded in the first recorded kamikaze attack, in 1944. Early life and education John Augustine Collins was born in Deloraine, Tasmania, in 1899. In 1913, at age 14, Collins joined the first intake to the RAN College. He became a midshipman in January 1917, in time to see war service while attached to the Royal Navy. Second World War In the early Second World War, Collins commanded in the Battle of the Mediterranean. Sydney led Allied ships which sank an Italian cruiser, Bartolomeo Colleoni, in the Battle of Cape Spada, in July 1940. For this action he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Relations between the RAN and British Royal Navy were close at the time, with frequent exchanges of officers between the two and in June 1941, Collins was transferred to Singapore, as Assistant Chief of Staff to the British Naval Commander in Chief, China Station, Vice Admiral Geoffrey Layton. Following the outbreak of war with Japan, Collins was appointed Commodore Commanding China Force, the RN-RAN cruiser and destroyer force based in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, under the American-British-Dutch- Australian Command.

After the fall of Singapore and the Allied defeat in the Battle of the Java Sea, it became clear that the Dutch East Indies would be occupied by Japan. Collins organised the evacuation of Allied civilians and military personnel from Batavia, and was on one of the last ships to leave, before the city fell, in March 1942. As a result, he was Mentioned in Despatches, and was later made a Commander of the Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau. Collins was then appointed Senior Naval Officer, Western Australia, based at Fremantle. During 1943, Collins commanded and took part in the Bougainville campaign, the Battle of Cape Gloucester, and operations off the Admiralty Islands and Hollandia (Dutch New Guinea). In mid-1944, Collins was made commander of the Australian-US Navy Task Force 74, and commander of the Australian Naval Squadron, with as his flagship. He became the first graduate of the RAN College to command a naval squadron in action, during the bombardment of Noemfoor, on 2 July 1944. Collins was badly wounded in the first kamikaze attack in history, which hit Australia on 21 October 1944, in the lead up to the Battle of Leyte Gulf. He did not resume his command until July 1945. When the war ended Collins was the RAN's representative at the surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay. Post-war service and legacy Collins was appointed Chief of Naval Staff in 1948, succeeding Sir Louis Keppel Hamilton, and held the position until 1955. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1951 New Year Honours. He later served as Australia's High Commissioner to New Zealand (1956‚Äì62). The latest class of Australian submarine, the Collins class bears his name. The lead submarine, , was launched by his widow on 28 August 1993. Collins Road, a street in the Sydney suburb of St Ives and in the town of Narooma was also named in his honour.Australia's Argonauts: The remarkable story of the first class to enter the Royal Australian Naval College, Echo Books, Canberra, 2016, p.580 ReferencesExternal links *\\"Vice Admiral John Augustine Collins, KBE, CB\\" (Who‚Äôs who in Australian Military History, Australian War Memorial) Category:1899 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Australian Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Australian Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Australian military personnel of World War I Category:Commanders of the Order of Orange- Nassau Category:Graduates of the Royal Australian Naval College Category:High Commissioners of Australia to New Zealand Category:Officers of the Legion of Merit Category:People educated at Parade College Category:People from Tasmania Category:Royal Australian Navy admirals Category:Royal Australian Navy personnel of World War II ","title":"John Augustine Collins"},{"id":"438476","text":"The path integral formulation is a description in quantum mechanics that generalizes the action principle of classical mechanics. It replaces the classical notion of a single, unique classical trajectory for a system with a sum, or functional integral, over an infinity of quantum-mechanically possible trajectories to compute a quantum amplitude. This formulation has proven crucial to the subsequent development of theoretical physics, because manifest Lorentz covariance (time and space components of quantities enter equations in the same way) is easier to achieve than in the operator formalism of canonical quantization. Unlike previous methods, the path integral allows one to easily change coordinates between very different canonical descriptions of the same quantum system. Another advantage is that it is in practice easier to guess the correct form of the Lagrangian of a theory, which naturally enters the path integrals (for interactions of a certain type, these are coordinate space or Feynman path integrals), than the Hamiltonian. Possible downsides of the approach include that unitarity (this is related to conservation of probability; the probabilities of all physically possible outcomes must add up to one) of the S-matrix is obscure in the formulation. The path-integral approach has been proved to be equivalent to the other formalisms of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Thus, by deriving either approach from the other, problems associated with one or the other approach (as exemplified by Lorentz covariance or unitarity) go away. The path integral also relates quantum and stochastic processes, and this provided the basis for the grand synthesis of the 1970s, which unified quantum field theory with the statistical field theory of a fluctuating field near a second-order phase transition. The Schr√∂dinger equation is a diffusion equation with an imaginary diffusion constant, and the path integral is an analytic continuation of a method for summing up all possible random walks. PDF:Dynamic Vortex Mott Transition The basic idea of the path integral formulation can be traced back to Norbert Wiener, who introduced the Wiener integral for solving problems in diffusion and Brownian motion. This idea was extended to the use of the Lagrangian in quantum mechanics by Paul Dirac in his 1933 article. PDF:The Lagrangian in Quantum Mechanics The complete method was developed in 1948 by Richard Feynman. Some preliminaries were worked out earlier in his doctoral work under the supervision of John Archibald Wheeler. The original motivation stemmed from the desire to obtain a quantum-mechanical formulation for the Wheeler‚ÄìFeynman absorber theory using a Lagrangian (rather than a Hamiltonian) as a starting point. These are five of the infinitely many paths available for a particle to move from point A at time t to point B at time t‚Äô(>t). Paths which self-intersect or go backwards in time are not allowed.  Quantum action principle  In quantum mechanics, as in classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is the generator of time translations. This means that the state at a slightly later time differs from the state at the current time by the result of acting with the Hamiltonian operator (multiplied by the negative imaginary unit, ). For states with a definite energy, this is a statement of the de Broglie relation between frequency and energy, and the general relation is consistent with that plus the superposition principle. The Hamiltonian in classical mechanics is derived from a Lagrangian, which is a more fundamental quantity relative to special relativity. The Hamiltonian indicates how to march forward in time, but the time is different in different reference frames. The Lagrangian is a Lorentz scalar, while the Hamiltonian is the time component of a four-vector. So the Hamiltonian is different in different frames, and this type of symmetry is not apparent in the original formulation of quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian is a function of the position and momentum at one time, and it determines the position and momentum a little later. The Lagrangian is a function of the position now and the position a little later (or, equivalently for infinitesimal time separations, it is a function of the position and velocity). The relation between the two is by a Legendre transformation, and the condition that determines the classical equations of motion (the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations) is that the action has an extremum. In quantum mechanics, the Legendre transform is hard to interpret, because the motion is not over a definite trajectory. In classical mechanics, with discretization in time, the Legendre transform becomes : \\\\varepsilon H = p(t)\\\\big(q(t + \\\\varepsilon) - q(t)\\\\big) - \\\\varepsilon L and : p = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}}, where the partial derivative with respect to \\\\dot q holds fixed. The inverse Legendre transform is : \\\\varepsilon L = \\\\varepsilon p \\\\dot{q} - \\\\varepsilon H, where : \\\\dot q = \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial p}, and the partial derivative now is with respect to at fixed . In quantum mechanics, the state is a superposition of different states with different values of , or different values of , and the quantities and can be interpreted as noncommuting operators. The operator is only definite on states that are indefinite with respect to . So consider two states separated in time and act with the operator corresponding to the Lagrangian: : e^{i\\\\big[p \\\\big(q(t + \\\\varepsilon) - q(t)\\\\big) - \\\\varepsilon H(p, q) \\\\big]}. If the multiplications implicit in this formula are reinterpreted as matrix multiplications, the first factor is : e^{-ip q(t)}, and if this is also interpreted as a matrix multiplication, the sum over all states integrates over all , and so it takes the Fourier transform in to change basis to . That is the action on the Hilbert space ‚Äì change basis to at time . Next comes :e^{-i\\\\varepsilon H(p,q)}, or evolve an infinitesimal time into the future. Finally, the last factor in this interpretation is :e^{i p q(t + \\\\varepsilon)}, which means change basis back to at a later time. This is not very different from just ordinary time evolution: the factor contains all the dynamical information ‚Äì it pushes the state forward in time. The first part and the last part are just Fourier transforms to change to a pure basis from an intermediate basis. Another way of saying this is that since the Hamiltonian is naturally a function of and , exponentiating this quantity and changing basis from to at each step allows the matrix element of to be expressed as a simple function along each path. This function is the quantum analog of the classical action. This observation is due to Paul Dirac. Dirac further noted that one could square the time-evolution operator in the representation: : e^{i\\\\varepsilon S}, and this gives the time-evolution operator between time and time . While in the representation the quantity that is being summed over the intermediate states is an obscure matrix element, in the representation it is reinterpreted as a quantity associated to the path. In the limit that one takes a large power of this operator, one reconstructs the full quantum evolution between two states, the early one with a fixed value of and the later one with a fixed value of . The result is a sum over paths with a phase, which is the quantum action. Crucially, Dirac identified in this article the deep quantum-mechanical reason for the principle of least action controlling the classical limit (see quotation box).  Feynman's interpretation  Dirac's work did not provide a precise prescription to calculate the sum over paths, and he did not show that one could recover the Schr√∂dinger equation or the canonical commutation relations from this rule. This was done by Feynman.Both noted that in the limit of action that is large compared to the reduced Planck's constant (using natural units, ), or the classical limit, the path integral is dominated by solutions which are in the neighborhood of stationary points of the action. That is, the classical path arises naturally in the classical limit. Feynman showed that Dirac's quantum action was, for most cases of interest, simply equal to the classical action, appropriately discretized. This means that the classical action is the phase acquired by quantum evolution between two fixed endpoints. He proposed to recover all of quantum mechanics from the following postulates: # The probability for an event is given by the squared modulus of a complex number called the \\"probability amplitude\\". # The probability amplitude is given by adding together the contributions of all paths in configuration space. # The contribution of a path is proportional to , where is the action given by the time integral of the Lagrangian along the path. In order to find the overall probability amplitude for a given process, then, one adds up, or integrates, the amplitude of the 3rd postulate over the space of all possible paths of the system in between the initial and final states, including those that are absurd by classical standards. In calculating the probability amplitude for a single particle to go from one space-time coordinate to another, it is correct to include paths in which the particle describes elaborate curlicues, curves in which the particle shoots off into outer space and flies back again, and so forth. The path integral assigns to all these amplitudes equal weight but varying phase, or argument of the complex number. Contributions from paths wildly different from the classical trajectory may be suppressed by interference (see below). Feynman showed that this formulation of quantum mechanics is equivalent to the canonical approach to quantum mechanics when the Hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the momentum. An amplitude computed according to Feynman's principles will also obey the Schr√∂dinger equation for the Hamiltonian corresponding to the given action. The path integral formulation of quantum field theory represents the transition amplitude (corresponding to the classical correlation function) as a weighted sum of all possible histories of the system from the initial to the final state. A Feynman diagram is a graphical representation of a perturbative contribution to the transition amplitude.  Path integral in quantum mechanics = Time-slicing derivation  One common approach to deriving the path integral formula is to divide the time interval into small pieces. Once this is done, the Trotter product formula tells us that the noncommutativity of the kinetic and potential energy operators can be ignored. For a particle in a smooth potential, the path integral is approximated by zigzag paths, which in one dimension is a product of ordinary integrals. For the motion of the particle from position at time to at time , the time sequence :t_a = t_0 < t_1 < \\\\cdots < t_{n-1} < t_n < t_{n+1} = t_b can be divided up into smaller segments , where , of fixed duration :\\\\varepsilon = \\\\Delta t = \\\\frac{t_b - t_a}{n + 1}. This process is called time-slicing. An approximation for the path integral can be computed as proportional to :\\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} \\\\cdots \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} \\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\int_{t_a}^{t_b} L\\\\big(x(t), v(t)\\\\big) \\\\,dt\\\\right) \\\\,dx_0 \\\\, \\\\cdots \\\\, dx_n, where is the Lagrangian of the one-dimensional system with position variable and velocity considered (see below), and corresponds to the position at the th time step, if the time integral is approximated by a sum of terms.For a simplified, step- by-step derivation of the above relation, see Path Integrals in Quantum Theories: A Pedagogic 1st Step. In the limit , this becomes a functional integral, which, apart from a nonessential factor, is directly the product of the probability amplitudes (more precisely, since one must work with a continuous spectrum, the respective densities) to find the quantum mechanical particle at in the initial state and at in the final state . Actually is the classical Lagrangian of the one-dimensional system considered, : L(x, \\\\dot x) = T-V=\\\\frac{1}{2}m\\\\dot{x}^2-V(x) and the abovementioned \\"zigzagging\\" corresponds to the appearance of the terms :\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\varepsilon \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n+1} L \\\\left(\\\\tilde x_j, \\\\frac{x_j - x_{j-1}}{\\\\varepsilon}, j \\\\right)\\\\right) in the Riemann sum approximating the time integral, which are finally integrated over to with the integration measure , is an arbitrary value of the interval corresponding to , e.g. its center, . Thus, in contrast to classical mechanics, not only does the stationary path contribute, but actually all virtual paths between the initial and the final point also contribute. Path integral formula In terms of the wave function in the position representation, the path integral formula reads as follows: :\\\\psi(x,t)=\\\\frac{1}{Z}\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{x}(0)=x}\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\, e^{iS[\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}]}\\\\psi_0(\\\\mathbf{x}(t))\\\\, where \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{x} denotes integration over all paths \\\\mathbf{x} with \\\\mathbf{x}(0)=x and where Z is a normalization factor. Here S is the action, given by :S[\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\dot\\\\mathbf{x}]=\\\\int dt\\\\, L(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\dot\\\\mathbf{x}(t)) The diagram shows the contribution to the path integral of a free particle for a set of paths.  Free particle  The path integral representation gives the quantum amplitude to go from point to point as an integral over all paths. For a free-particle action (for simplicity let , ) :S = \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\dot{x}^2}{2}\\\\, dt, the integral can be evaluated explicitly. To do this, it is convenient to start without the factor in the exponential, so that large deviations are suppressed by small numbers, not by cancelling oscillatory contributions. The amplitude (or Kernel) reads: :K(x - y; T) = \\\\int_{x(0) = x}^{x(T) = y} \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\int_0^T \\\\frac{\\\\dot{x}^2}{2} \\\\,dt\\\\right) \\\\,Dx. Splitting the integral into time slices: :K(x, y; T) = \\\\int_{x(0) = x}^{x(T) = y} \\\\prod_t \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\tfrac12 \\\\left(\\\\frac{x(t + \\\\varepsilon) - x(t)}{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\right)^2 \\\\varepsilon \\\\right) \\\\,Dx, where the is interpreted as a finite collection of integrations at each integer multiple of . Each factor in the product is a Gaussian as a function of centered at with variance . The multiple integrals are a repeated convolution of this Gaussian with copies of itself at adjacent times: :K(x - y; T) = G_\\\\varepsilon * G_\\\\varepsilon * \\\\cdots * G_\\\\varepsilon, where the number of convolutions is . The result is easy to evaluate by taking the Fourier transform of both sides, so that the convolutions become multiplications: :\\\\tilde{K}(p; T) = \\\\tilde{G}_\\\\varepsilon(p)^{T/\\\\varepsilon}. The Fourier transform of the Gaussian is another Gaussian of reciprocal variance: :\\\\tilde{G}_\\\\varepsilon(p) = e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon p^2}{2}}, and the result is :\\\\tilde{K}(p; T) = e^{-\\\\frac{T p^2}{2}}. The Fourier transform gives , and it is a Gaussian again with reciprocal variance: :K(x - y; T) \\\\propto e^{ -\\\\frac{(x - y)^2}{2T}}. The proportionality constant is not really determined by the time-slicing approach, only the ratio of values for different endpoint choices is determined. The proportionality constant should be chosen to ensure that between each two time slices the time evolution is quantum-mechanically unitary, but a more illuminating way to fix the normalization is to consider the path integral as a description of a stochastic process. The result has a probability interpretation. The sum over all paths of the exponential factor can be seen as the sum over each path of the probability of selecting that path. The probability is the product over each segment of the probability of selecting that segment, so that each segment is probabilistically independently chosen. The fact that the answer is a Gaussian spreading linearly in time is the central limit theorem, which can be interpreted as the first historical evaluation of a statistical path integral. The probability interpretation gives a natural normalization choice. The path integral should be defined so that :\\\\int K(x - y; T) \\\\,dy = 1. This condition normalizes the Gaussian and produces a kernel that obeys the diffusion equation: :\\\\frac{d}{dt} K(x; T) = \\\\frac{ abla^2}{2} K. For oscillatory path integrals, ones with an in the numerator, the time slicing produces convolved Gaussians, just as before. Now, however, the convolution product is marginally singular, since it requires careful limits to evaluate the oscillating integrals. To make the factors well defined, the easiest way is to add a small imaginary part to the time increment . This is closely related to Wick rotation. Then the same convolution argument as before gives the propagation kernel: :K(x - y; T) \\\\propto e^\\\\frac{i(x - y)^2}{2T}, which, with the same normalization as before (not the sum-squares normalization ‚Äì this function has a divergent norm), obeys a free Schr√∂dinger equation: :\\\\frac{d}{dt} K(x; T) = i \\\\frac{ abla^2}{2} K. This means that any superposition of s will also obey the same equation, by linearity. Defining :\\\\psi_t(y) = \\\\int \\\\psi_0(x) K(x - y; t) \\\\,dx = \\\\int \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\int_{x(0) = x}^{x(t) = y} e^{iS} \\\\,Dx, then obeys the free Schr√∂dinger equation just as does: :i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\psi_t = -\\\\frac{ abla^2}{2} \\\\psi_t.  Simple harmonic oscillator  The Lagrangian for the simple harmonic oscillator is :\\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\tfrac12 m \\\\dot{x}^2 - \\\\tfrac12 m \\\\omega^2 x^2. Write its trajectory as the classical trajectory plus some perturbation, and the action as . The classical trajectory can be written as :x_\\\\text{c}(t) = x_i \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\omega(t_f - t)}{\\\\sin\\\\omega(t_f - t_i)} + x_f \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\omega(t - t_i)}{\\\\sin\\\\omega(t_f - t_i)}. This trajectory yields the classical action : \\\\begin{align} S_\\\\text{c} & = \\\\int_{t_i}^{t_f} \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\,dt = \\\\int_{t_i}^{t_f} \\\\left(\\\\tfrac12 m\\\\dot{x}^2 - \\\\tfrac12 m\\\\omega^2 x^2 \\\\right) \\\\,dt [6pt] & = \\\\frac 1 2 m\\\\omega \\\\left( \\\\frac{(x_i^2 + x_f^2) \\\\cos\\\\omega(t_f - t_i) - 2 x_i x_f}{\\\\sin\\\\omega(t_f - t_i)} \\\\right)~. \\\\end{align} Next, expand the deviation from the classical path as a Fourier series, and calculate the contribution to the action , which gives :S = S_\\\\text{c} + \\\\sum_{n = 1}^\\\\infty \\\\tfrac12 a_n^2 \\\\frac{m}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{(n \\\\pi)^2}{t_f - t_i} - \\\\omega^2(t_f - t_i) \\\\right). This means that the propagator is : \\\\begin{align} K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) & = Q e^\\\\frac{i S_\\\\text{c}}{\\\\hbar} \\\\prod_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{j \\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\int da_j \\\\exp{\\\\left( \\\\frac{i}{2\\\\hbar}a_j^2 \\\\frac{m}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{(j \\\\pi)^2}{t_f - t_i} - \\\\omega^2(t_f - t_i) \\\\right) \\\\right)} [6pt] & = e^\\\\frac{i S_\\\\text{c}}{\\\\hbar} Q \\\\prod_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left( 1 - \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\omega(t_f - t_i)}{j \\\\pi} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right)^{-\\\\frac12} \\\\end{align} for some normalization : Q = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m}{2\\\\pi i \\\\hbar (t_f - t_i)}}~. Using the infinite-product representation of the sinc function, :\\\\prod_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{x^2}{j^2} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\pi x}{\\\\pi x}, the propagator can be written as : K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = Q e^\\\\frac{i S_\\\\text{c}}{\\\\hbar} \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{\\\\omega(t_f - t_i)}{\\\\sin\\\\omega(t_f - t_i)} } = e^\\\\frac{i S_c}{\\\\hbar} \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{m\\\\omega}{2\\\\pi i \\\\hbar \\\\sin\\\\omega(t_f - t_i)}}. Let . One may write this propagator in terms of energy eigenstates as : \\\\begin{align} K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) & = \\\\left( \\\\frac{m \\\\omega}{2 \\\\pi i \\\\hbar \\\\sin\\\\omega T } \\\\right)^\\\\frac12 \\\\exp{ \\\\left( \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\tfrac12 m \\\\omega \\\\frac{ (x_i^2 + x_f^2) \\\\cos \\\\omega T - 2 x_i x_f }{ \\\\sin \\\\omega T } \\\\right) } [6pt] & = \\\\sum_{n = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\exp{ \\\\left( - \\\\frac{i E_n T}{\\\\hbar} \\\\right) } \\\\psi_n(x_f) \\\\psi_n(x_i)^{*}~. \\\\end{align} Using the identities and , this amounts to :K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{m \\\\omega}{\\\\pi \\\\hbar} \\\\right)^\\\\frac12 e^\\\\frac{-i \\\\omega T} 2 \\\\left( 1 - e^{-2 i \\\\omega T} \\\\right)^{-\\\\frac12} \\\\exp{ \\\\left( - \\\\frac{m \\\\omega}{2 \\\\hbar} \\\\left( \\\\left(x_i^2 + x_f^2\\\\right) \\\\frac{ 1 + e^{-2 i \\\\omega T} }{ 1 - e^{- 2 i \\\\omega T}} - \\\\frac{4 x_i x_f e^{-i \\\\omega T}}{1 - e^{ - 2 i \\\\omega T} }\\\\right) \\\\right) }. One may absorb all terms after the first into , thereby obtaining : K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{m \\\\omega}{\\\\pi \\\\hbar} \\\\right)^\\\\frac12 e^\\\\frac{-i \\\\omega T } 2 \\\\cdot R(T). One may finally expand in powers of : All terms in this expansion get multiplied by the factor in the front, yielding terms of the form :e^\\\\frac{-i\\\\omega T}{2} e^{-i n\\\\omega T} = e^{-i \\\\omega T \\\\left( \\\\frac12 + n\\\\right) } \\\\quad\\\\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots. Comparison to the above eigenstate expansion yields the standard energy spectrum for the simple harmonic oscillator, :E_n = \\\\left( n + \\\\tfrac12 \\\\right) \\\\hbar \\\\omega~. Coulomb potential Feynman's time-sliced approximation does not, however, exist for the most important quantum- mechanical path integrals of atoms, due to the singularity of the Coulomb potential at the origin. Only after replacing the time by another path- dependent pseudo-time parameter :s = \\\\int \\\\frac{dt}{r(t)} the singularity is removed and a time-sliced approximation exists, which is exactly integrable, since it can be made harmonic by a simple coordinate transformation, as discovered in 1979 by ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± Duru and Hagen Kleinert. The combination of a path-dependent time transformation and a coordinate transformation is an important tool to solve many path integrals and is called generically the Duru‚ÄìKleinert transformation.  The Schr√∂dinger equation  The path integral reproduces the Schr√∂dinger equation for the initial and final state even when a potential is present. This is easiest to see by taking a path- integral over infinitesimally separated times. :\\\\psi(y;t+\\\\varepsilon) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\psi(x;t)\\\\int_{x(t)=x}^{x(t+\\\\varepsilon)=y} e^{i\\\\int\\\\limits_t^{t+\\\\varepsilon} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\dot{x}^2}{2} - V(x)\\\\right)\\\\, dt}\\\\, Dx(t) \\\\, dx\\\\qquad (1) Since the time separation is infinitesimal and the cancelling oscillations become severe for large values of , the path integral has most weight for close to . In this case, to lowest order the potential energy is constant, and only the kinetic energy contribution is nontrivial. (This separation of the kinetic and potential energy terms in the exponent is essentially the Trotter product formula.) The exponential of the action is :e^{-i\\\\varepsilon V(x)} e^{i\\\\frac{\\\\dot{x}^2}{2}\\\\varepsilon} The first term rotates the phase of locally by an amount proportional to the potential energy. The second term is the free particle propagator, corresponding to times a diffusion process. To lowest order in they are additive; in any case one has with (1): :\\\\psi(y;t+\\\\varepsilon) \\\\approx \\\\int \\\\psi(x;t) e^{-i\\\\varepsilon V(x)} e^\\\\frac{i(x-y)^2 }{ 2\\\\varepsilon} \\\\,dx\\\\,. As mentioned, the spread in is diffusive from the free particle propagation, with an extra infinitesimal rotation in phase which slowly varies from point to point from the potential: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\tfrac12 abla^2 - V(x)\\\\right)\\\\psi\\\\, and this is the Schr√∂dinger equation. The normalization of the path integral needs to be fixed in exactly the same way as in the free particle case. An arbitrary continuous potential does not affect the normalization, although singular potentials require careful treatment.  Equations of motion  Since the states obey the Schr√∂dinger equation, the path integral must reproduce the Heisenberg equations of motion for the averages of and variables, but it is instructive to see this directly. The direct approach shows that the expectation values calculated from the path integral reproduce the usual ones of quantum mechanics. Start by considering the path integral with some fixed initial state :\\\\int \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\int_{x(0)=x} e^{iS(x,\\\\dot{x})}\\\\, Dx\\\\, Now at each separate time is a separate integration variable. So it is legitimate to change variables in the integral by shifting: where is a different shift at each time but , since the endpoints are not integrated: :\\\\int \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\int_{u(0)=x} e^{iS(u+\\\\varepsilon,\\\\dot{u}+\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon})}\\\\, Du\\\\, The change in the integral from the shift is, to first infinitesimal order in : :\\\\int \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\int_{u(0)=x} \\\\left( \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\partial S }{ \\\\partial u } \\\\varepsilon + \\\\frac{ \\\\partial S }{ \\\\partial \\\\dot{u} } \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\, dt \\\\right) e^{iS} \\\\,Du\\\\, which, integrating by parts in , gives: :\\\\int \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\int_{u(0)=x} -\\\\left( \\\\int \\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{u}} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)\\\\varepsilon(t)\\\\, dt \\\\right) e^{iS}\\\\, Du\\\\, But this was just a shift of integration variables, which doesn't change the value of the integral for any choice of . The conclusion is that this first order variation is zero for an arbitrary initial state and at any arbitrary point in time: :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\psi_0\\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\delta S}{\\\\delta x}(t) \\\\right\\\\psi_0 \\\\right\\\\rangle = 0 this is the Heisenberg equation of motion. If the action contains terms which multiply and , at the same moment in time, the manipulations above are only heuristic, because the multiplication rules for these quantities is just as noncommuting in the path integral as it is in the operator formalism.  Stationary-phase approximation  If the variation in the action exceeds by many orders of magnitude, we typically have destructive interference other than in the vicinity of those trajectories satisfying the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation, which is now reinterpreted as the condition for constructive interference. This can be shown using the method of stationary phase applied to the propagator. As decreases, the exponential in the integral oscillates rapidly in the complex domain for any change in the action. Thus, in the limit that goes to zero, only points where the classical action does not vary contribute to the propagator.  Canonical commutation relations  The formulation of the path integral does not make it clear at first sight that the quantities and do not commute. In the path integral, these are just integration variables and they have no obvious ordering. Feynman discovered that the non-commutativity is still present. To see this, consider the simplest path integral, the brownian walk. This is not yet quantum mechanics, so in the path-integral the action is not multiplied by : :S= \\\\int \\\\left( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} \\\\right)^2\\\\, dt The quantity is fluctuating, and the derivative is defined as the limit of a discrete difference. :\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\\\frac{x(t+\\\\varepsilon) - x(t)} \\\\varepsilon The distance that a random walk moves is proportional to , so that: :x(t+\\\\varepsilon) - x(t) \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon} This shows that the random walk is not differentiable, since the ratio that defines the derivative diverges with probability one. The quantity is ambiguous, with two possible meanings: :[1] = x \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = x(t) \\\\frac{x(t+\\\\varepsilon) - x(t) }{\\\\varepsilon } :[2] = x \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = x(t+\\\\varepsilon) \\\\frac{x(t+\\\\varepsilon) - x(t) }{\\\\varepsilon} In elementary calculus, the two are only different by an amount which goes to 0 as goes to 0. But in this case, the difference between the two is not 0: :[2] - [1] = \\\\frac{\\\\big( x(t + \\\\varepsilon) - x(t)\\\\big )^2}{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\approx \\\\frac \\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon Let :f(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\big(x(t+\\\\varepsilon)- x(t)\\\\big)^2 }{\\\\varepsilon} Then is a rapidly fluctuating statistical quantity, whose average value is 1, i.e. a normalized \\"Gaussian process\\". The fluctuations of such a quantity can be described by a statistical Lagrangian :\\\\mathcal L = (f(t)-1)^2 \\\\,, and the equations of motion for derived from extremizing the action corresponding to just set it equal to 1. In physics, such a quantity is \\"equal to 1 as an operator identity\\". In mathematics, it \\"weakly converges to 1\\". In either case, it is 1 in any expectation value, or when averaged over any interval, or for all practical purpose. Defining the time order to be the operator order: :[x, \\\\dot x] = x \\\\frac{dx}{dt} - \\\\frac{dx}{dt} x = 1 This is called the It≈ç lemma in stochastic calculus, and the (euclideanized) canonical commutation relations in physics. For a general statistical action, a similar argument shows that :\\\\left[x , \\\\frac{\\\\partial S }{ \\\\partial \\\\dot x} \\\\right] = 1 and in quantum mechanics, the extra imaginary unit in the action converts this to the canonical commutation relation, :[x,p ] = i  Particle in curved space  For a particle in curved space the kinetic term depends on the position, and the above time slicing cannot be applied, this being a manifestation of the notorious operator ordering problem in Schr√∂dinger quantum mechanics. One may, however, solve this problem by transforming the time-sliced flat-space path integral to curved space using a multivalued coordinate transformation (nonholonomic mapping explained here).  Measure- theoretic factors  Sometimes (e.g. a particle moving in curved space) we also have measure-theoretic factors in the functional integral: :\\\\int \\\\mu[x] e^{iS[x]} \\\\,\\\\mathcal{D}x. This factor is needed to restore unitarity. For instance, if :S = \\\\int \\\\left( \\\\frac{m}{2} g_{ij} \\\\dot{x}^i \\\\dot{x}^j - V(x) \\\\right) \\\\,dt, then it means that each spatial slice is multiplied by the measure . This measure cannot be expressed as a functional multiplying the measure because they belong to entirely different classes.  Expectation values and matrix elements  Matrix elements of the kind \\\\langle x_fe^{-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{H}(t-t')} F(\\\\hat{x}) e^{-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{H}(t')}x_i\\\\rangle take the form :\\\\int_{x(0)=x_i}^{x(t)=x_f} \\\\mathcal{D}[x] F(x(t')) e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\int dt L(x(t),\\\\dot{x}(t))}. This generalizes to multiple operators, for example :\\\\langle x_fe^{-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{H}(t-t_1)} F_1(\\\\hat{x}) e^{-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{H}(t_1-t_2)} F_2(\\\\hat{x}) e^{-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{H}(t_2)}x_i\\\\rangle = \\\\int_{x(0)=x_i}^{x(t)=x_f} \\\\mathcal{D}[x] F_1(x(t_1)) F_2(x(t_2)) e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\int dt L(x(t),\\\\dot{x}(t))}, and to the general expectation value :\\\\langle F\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}[\\\\phi] F(\\\\phi) e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}S[\\\\phi]}}{\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}[\\\\phi] e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}S[\\\\phi]}}. Euclidean path integrals It is very common in path integrals to perform a Wick rotation from real to imaginary times. In the setting of quantum field theory, the Wick rotation changes the geometry of space-time from Lorentzian to Euclidean; as a result, Wick-rotated path integrals are often called Euclidean path integrals. Wick rotation and the Feynman‚ÄìKac formula If we replace t by -it, the time- evolution operator e^{-it\\\\hat{H}/\\\\hbar} is replaced by e^{-t\\\\hat{H}/\\\\hbar}. (This change is known as a Wick rotation.) If we repeat the derivation of the path-integral formula in this setting, we obtain :\\\\psi(x,t)=\\\\frac{1}{Z}\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{x}(0)=x} e^{-S_{\\\\mathrm{Euclidean}}(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}})/\\\\hbar}\\\\psi_0(\\\\mathbf{x}(t))\\\\, \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\,, where S_{\\\\mathrm{Euclidean}} is the Euclidean action, given by :S_{\\\\mathrm{Euclidean}}(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}})=\\\\int\\\\left[ \\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\dot\\\\mathbf{x}(t)^2+V(\\\\mathbf{x}(t))\\\\right] \\\\,dt. Note the sign change between this and the normal action, where the potential energy term is negative. (The term Euclidean is from the context of quantum field theory, where the change from real to imaginary time changes the space-time geometry from Lorentzian to Euclidean.) Now, the contribution of the kinetic energy to the path integral is as follows: :\\\\frac{1}{Z}\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{x}(0)=x} f(\\\\mathbf{x})e^{-\\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\int \\\\dot\\\\mathbf{x}^2dt}\\\\, \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\, where f(\\\\mathbf{x}) includes all the remaining dependence of the integrand on the path. This integral has a rigorous mathematical interpretation as integration against the Wiener measure, denoted \\\\mu_{x}. The Wiener measure, constructed by Norbert Wiener gives a rigorous foundation to Einstein's mathematical model of Brownian motion. The subscript x indicates that the measure \\\\mu_x is supported on paths \\\\mathbf{x} with \\\\mathbf{x}(0)=x. We then have a rigorous version of the Feynman path integral, known as the Feynman‚ÄìKac formula: :\\\\psi(x,t)=\\\\int e^{-\\\\int V(\\\\mathbf{x}(t)\\\\,dt/\\\\hbar}\\\\,\\\\psi_0(\\\\mathbf{x}(t)) \\\\,d\\\\mu_x(\\\\mathbf{x}), where now \\\\psi(x,t) satisfies the Wick-rotated version of the Schr√∂dinger equation, :\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\psi(x,t) = -\\\\hat H \\\\psi(x,t). Although the Wick-rotated Schr√∂dinger equation does not have a direct physical meaning, interesting properties of the Schr√∂dinger operator \\\\hat{H} can be extracted by studying it. Much of the study of quantum field theories from the path- integral perspective, in both the mathematics and physics literatures, is done in the Euclidean setting, that is, after a Wick rotation. In particular, there are various results showing that if a Euclidean field theory with suitable properties can be constructed, one can then undo the Wick rotation to recover the physical, Lorentzian theory. On the other hand, it is much more difficult to give a meaning to path integrals (even Euclidean path integrals) in quantum field theory than in quantum mechanics.For a brief account of the origins of these difficulties, see  The path integral and the partition function  The path integral is just the generalization of the integral above to all quantum mechanical problems‚Äî :Z = \\\\int e^\\\\frac{i\\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\mathbf{x}]}{\\\\hbar}\\\\, \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\quad\\\\text{where }\\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\mathbf{x}]=\\\\int_0^T L[\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\dot\\\\mathbf{x}(t)]\\\\, dt is the action of the classical problem in which one investigates the path starting at time and ending at time , and \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{x} denotes integration over all paths. In the classical limit, \\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\mathbf{x}]\\\\gg\\\\hbar, the path of minimum action dominates the integral, because the phase of any path away from this fluctuates rapidly and different contributions cancel. The connection with statistical mechanics follows. Considering only paths which begin and end in the same configuration, perform the Wick rotation , i.e., make time imaginary, and integrate over all possible beginning-ending configurations. The Wick-rotated path integral‚Äîdescribed in the previous subsection, with the ordinary action replaced by its \\"Euclidean\\" counterpart‚Äînow resembles the partition function of statistical mechanics defined in a canonical ensemble with inverse temperature proportional to imaginary time, . Strictly speaking, though, this is the partition function for a statistical field theory. Clearly, such a deep analogy between quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics cannot be dependent on the formulation. In the canonical formulation, one sees that the unitary evolution operator of a state is given by :\\\\alpha;t\\\\rangle=e^{-\\\\frac{iHt}{\\\\hbar}}\\\\alpha;0\\\\rangle where the state is evolved from time . If one makes a Wick rotation here, and finds the amplitude to go from any state, back to the same state in (imaginary) time is given by : Z = \\\\operatorname{Tr} \\\\left[e^\\\\frac{-HT}{\\\\hbar}\\\\right] which is precisely the partition function of statistical mechanics for the same system at temperature quoted earlier. One aspect of this equivalence was also known to Erwin Schr√∂dinger who remarked that the equation named after him looked like the diffusion equation after Wick rotation. Note, however, that the Euclidean path integral is actually in the form of a classical statistical mechanics model.  Quantum field theory  Both the Schr√∂dinger and Heisenberg approaches to quantum mechanics single out time and are not in the spirit of relativity. For example, the Heisenberg approach requires that scalar field operators obey the commutation relation :[\\\\varphi(x), \\\\partial_t \\\\varphi(y)] = i \\\\delta^3(x - y) for two simultaneous spatial positions and , and this is not a relativistically invariant concept. The results of a calculation are covariant, but the symmetry is not apparent in intermediate stages. If naive field-theory calculations did not produce infinite answers in the continuum limit, this would not have been such a big problem ‚Äì it would just have been a bad choice of coordinates. But the lack of symmetry means that the infinite quantities must be cut off, and the bad coordinates make it nearly impossible to cut off the theory without spoiling the symmetry. This makes it difficult to extract the physical predictions, which require a careful limiting procedure. The problem of lost symmetry also appears in classical mechanics, where the Hamiltonian formulation also superficially singles out time. The Lagrangian formulation makes the relativistic invariance apparent. In the same way, the path integral is manifestly relativistic. It reproduces the Schr√∂dinger equation, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the canonical commutation relations and shows that they are compatible with relativity. It extends the Heisenberg-type operator algebra to operator product rules, which are new relations difficult to see in the old formalism. Further, different choices of canonical variables lead to very different-seeming formulations of the same theory. The transformations between the variables can be very complicated, but the path integral makes them into reasonably straightforward changes of integration variables. For these reasons, the Feynman path integral has made earlier formalisms largely obsolete. The price of a path integral representation is that the unitarity of a theory is no longer self-evident, but it can be proven by changing variables to some canonical representation. The path integral itself also deals with larger mathematical spaces than is usual, which requires more careful mathematics, not all of which has been fully worked out. The path integral historically was not immediately accepted, partly because it took many years to incorporate fermions properly. This required physicists to invent an entirely new mathematical object ‚Äì the Grassmann variable ‚Äì which also allowed changes of variables to be done naturally, as well as allowing constrained quantization. The integration variables in the path integral are subtly non-commuting. The value of the product of two field operators at what looks like the same point depends on how the two points are ordered in space and time. This makes some naive identities fail.  The propagator  In relativistic theories, there is both a particle and field representation for every theory. The field representation is a sum over all field configurations, and the particle representation is a sum over different particle paths. The nonrelativistic formulation is traditionally given in terms of particle paths, not fields. There, the path integral in the usual variables, with fixed boundary conditions, gives the probability amplitude for a particle to go from point to point in time : :K(x, y; T) = \\\\langle y; T \\\\mid x; 0 \\\\rangle = \\\\int_{x(0)=x}^{x(T)=y} e^{i S[x]} \\\\,Dx. This is called the propagator. Superposing different values of the initial position with an arbitrary initial state constructs the final state: :\\\\psi_T(y) = \\\\int_x \\\\psi_0(x) K(x, y; T) \\\\,dx = \\\\int^{x(T)=y} \\\\psi_0(x(0)) e^{i S[x]} \\\\,Dx. For a spatially homogeneous system, where is only a function of , the integral is a convolution, the final state is the initial state convolved with the propagator: :\\\\psi_T = \\\\psi_0 * K(;T). For a free particle of mass , the propagator can be evaluated either explicitly from the path integral or by noting that the Schr√∂dinger equation is a diffusion equation in imaginary time, and the solution must be a normalized Gaussian: :K(x, y; T) \\\\propto e^\\\\frac{i m(x - y)^2}{2T}. Taking the Fourier transform in produces another Gaussian: :K(p; T) = e^\\\\frac{i T p^2}{2m}, and in -space the proportionality factor here is constant in time, as will be verified in a moment. The Fourier transform in time, extending to be zero for negative times, gives Green's function, or the frequency-space propagator: :G_\\\\text{F}(p, E) = \\\\frac{-i}{E - \\\\frac{\\\\vec{p}^2}{2m} + i\\\\varepsilon}, which is the reciprocal of the operator that annihilates the wavefunction in the Schr√∂dinger equation, which wouldn't have come out right if the proportionality factor weren't constant in the -space representation. The infinitesimal term in the denominator is a small positive number, which guarantees that the inverse Fourier transform in will be nonzero only for future times. For past times, the inverse Fourier transform contour closes toward values of where there is no singularity. This guarantees that propagates the particle into the future and is the reason for the subscript \\"F\\" on . The infinitesimal term can be interpreted as an infinitesimal rotation toward imaginary time. It is also possible to reexpress the nonrelativistic time evolution in terms of propagators going toward the past, since the Schr√∂dinger equation is time-reversible. The past propagator is the same as the future propagator except for the obvious difference that it vanishes in the future, and in the Gaussian is replaced by . In this case, the interpretation is that these are the quantities to convolve the final wavefunction so as to get the initial wavefunction: :G_\\\\text{B}(p, E) = \\\\frac{-i}{-E - \\\\frac{i\\\\vec{p}^2}{2m} + i\\\\varepsilon}. Given the nearly identical only change is the sign of and , the parameter in Green's function can either be the energy if the paths are going toward the future, or the negative of the energy if the paths are going toward the past. For a nonrelativistic theory, the time as measured along the path of a moving particle and the time as measured by an outside observer are the same. In relativity, this is no longer true. For a relativistic theory the propagator should be defined as the sum over all paths that travel between two points in a fixed proper time, as measured along the path (these paths describe the trajectory of a particle in space and in time): :K(x - y, \\\\Tau) = \\\\int_{x(0)=x}^{x(\\\\Tau)=y} e^{i \\\\int_0^\\\\Tau \\\\sqrt{{\\\\dot x}^2} - \\\\alpha \\\\,d\\\\tau}. The integral above is not trivial to interpret because of the square root. Fortunately, there is a heuristic trick. The sum is over the relativistic arc length of the path of an oscillating quantity, and like the nonrelativistic path integral should be interpreted as slightly rotated into imaginary time. The function can be evaluated when the sum is over paths in Euclidean space: :K(x - y, \\\\Tau) = e^{-\\\\alpha \\\\Tau} \\\\int_{x(0)=x}^{x(\\\\Tau)=y} e^{-L}. This describes a sum over all paths of length of the exponential of minus the length. This can be given a probability interpretation. The sum over all paths is a probability average over a path constructed step by step. The total number of steps is proportional to , and each step is less likely the longer it is. By the central limit theorem, the result of many independent steps is a Gaussian of variance proportional to : :K(x - y,\\\\Tau) = e^{-\\\\alpha \\\\Tau} e^{-\\\\frac{(x - y)^2}{\\\\Tau}}. The usual definition of the relativistic propagator only asks for the amplitude is to travel from to , after summing over all the possible proper times it could take: :K(x - y) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty K(x - y, \\\\Tau) W(\\\\Tau) \\\\,d\\\\Tau, where is a weight factor, the relative importance of paths of different proper time. By the translation symmetry in proper time, this weight can only be an exponential factor and can be absorbed into the constant : :K(x - y) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-\\\\frac{(x - y)^2}{\\\\Tau} -\\\\alpha \\\\Tau} \\\\,d\\\\Tau. This is the Schwinger representation. Taking a Fourier transform over the variable can be done for each value of separately, and because each separate contribution is a Gaussian, gives whose Fourier transform is another Gaussian with reciprocal width. So in -space, the propagator can be reexpressed simply: :K(p) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-\\\\Tau p^2 - \\\\Tau \\\\alpha} \\\\,d\\\\Tau = \\\\frac{1}{p^2 + \\\\alpha}, which is the Euclidean propagator for a scalar particle. Rotating to be imaginary gives the usual relativistic propagator, up to a factor of and an ambiguity, which will be clarified below: :K(p) = \\\\frac{i}{p_0^2 - \\\\vec{p}^2 - m^2}. This expression can be interpreted in the nonrelativistic limit, where it is convenient to split it by partial fractions: :2 p_0 K(p) = \\\\frac{i}{p_0 - \\\\sqrt{\\\\vec{p}^2 + m^2}} + \\\\frac{i}{p_0 + \\\\sqrt{\\\\vec{p}^2 + m^2}}. For states where one nonrelativistic particle is present, the initial wavefunction has a frequency distribution concentrated near . When convolving with the propagator, which in space just means multiplying by the propagator, the second term is suppressed and the first term is enhanced. For frequencies near , the dominant first term has the form :2m K_\\\\text{NR}(p) = \\\\frac{i}{(p_0 - m) - \\\\frac{\\\\vec{p}^2}{2m}}. This is the expression for the nonrelativistic Green's function of a free Schr√∂dinger particle. The second term has a nonrelativistic limit also, but this limit is concentrated on frequencies that are negative. The second pole is dominated by contributions from paths where the proper time and the coordinate time are ticking in an opposite sense, which means that the second term is to be interpreted as the antiparticle. The nonrelativistic analysis shows that with this form the antiparticle still has positive energy. The proper way to express this mathematically is that, adding a small suppression factor in proper time, the limit where of the first term must vanish, while the limit of the second term must vanish. In the Fourier transform, this means shifting the pole in slightly, so that the inverse Fourier transform will pick up a small decay factor in one of the time directions: :K(p) = \\\\frac{i}{p_0 - \\\\sqrt{\\\\vec{p}^2 + m^2} + i\\\\varepsilon} + \\\\frac{i}{p_0 - \\\\sqrt{\\\\vec{p}^2+m^2} - i\\\\varepsilon}. Without these terms, the pole contribution could not be unambiguously evaluated when taking the inverse Fourier transform of . The terms can be recombined: :K(p) = \\\\frac{i}{p^2 - m^2 + i\\\\varepsilon}, which when factored, produces opposite-sign infinitesimal terms in each factor. This is the mathematically precise form of the relativistic particle propagator, free of any ambiguities. The term introduces a small imaginary part to the , which in the Minkowski version is a small exponential suppression of long paths. So in the relativistic case, the Feynman path-integral representation of the propagator includes paths going backwards in time, which describe antiparticles. The paths that contribute to the relativistic propagator go forward and backwards in time, and the interpretation of this is that the amplitude for a free particle to travel between two points includes amplitudes for the particle to fluctuate into an antiparticle, travel back in time, then forward again. Unlike the nonrelativistic case, it is impossible to produce a relativistic theory of local particle propagation without including antiparticles. All local differential operators have inverses that are nonzero outside the light cone, meaning that it is impossible to keep a particle from travelling faster than light. Such a particle cannot have a Green's function which is only nonzero in the future in a relativistically invariant theory.  Functionals of fields  However, the path integral formulation is also extremely important in direct application to quantum field theory, in which the \\"paths\\" or histories being considered are not the motions of a single particle, but the possible time evolutions of a field over all space. The action is referred to technically as a functional of the field: , where the field is itself a function of space and time, and the square brackets are a reminder that the action depends on all the field's values everywhere, not just some particular value. One such given function of spacetime is called a field configuration. In principle, one integrates Feynman's amplitude over the class of all possible field configurations. Much of the formal study of QFT is devoted to the properties of the resulting functional integral, and much effort (not yet entirely successful) has been made toward making these functional integrals mathematically precise. Such a functional integral is extremely similar to the partition function in statistical mechanics. Indeed, it is sometimes called a partition function, and the two are essentially mathematically identical except for the factor of in the exponent in Feynman's postulate 3. Analytically continuing the integral to an imaginary time variable (called a Wick rotation) makes the functional integral even more like a statistical partition function and also tames some of the mathematical difficulties of working with these integrals.  Expectation values  In quantum field theory, if the action is given by the functional of field configurations (which only depends locally on the fields), then the time- ordered vacuum expectation value of polynomially bounded functional , , is given by :\\\\langle F \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\int\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\varphi F[\\\\varphi]e^{i\\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\varphi]}}{\\\\int\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\varphi e^{i\\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\varphi]}}. The symbol here is a concise way to represent the infinite-dimensional integral over all possible field configurations on all of space-time. As stated above, the unadorned path integral in the denominator ensures proper normalization.  As a probability  Strictly speaking, the only question that can be asked in physics is: What fraction of states satisfying condition also satisfy condition ? The answer to this is a number between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a conditional probability, written as . In terms of path integration, since , this means :\\\\operatorname{P}(B\\\\mid A) = \\\\frac {\\\\sum_{F \\\\subset A \\\\cap B}\\\\left \\\\int\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\varphi O_\\\\text{in}[\\\\varphi]e^{i\\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\varphi]} F[\\\\varphi]\\\\right^2} {\\\\sum_{F \\\\subset A} \\\\left\\\\int\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\varphi O_\\\\text{in}[\\\\varphi] e^{i\\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\varphi]} F[\\\\varphi]\\\\right^2}, where the functional is the superposition of all incoming states that could lead to the states we are interested in. In particular, this could be a state corresponding to the state of the Universe just after the Big Bang, although for actual calculation this can be simplified using heuristic methods. Since this expression is a quotient of path integrals, it is naturally normalised.  Schwinger‚ÄìDyson equations  Since this formulation of quantum mechanics is analogous to classical action principle, one might expect that identities concerning the action in classical mechanics would have quantum counterparts derivable from a functional integral. This is often the case. In the language of functional analysis, we can write the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations as :\\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\varphi]}{\\\\delta \\\\varphi} = 0 (the left-hand side is a functional derivative; the equation means that the action is stationary under small changes in the field configuration). The quantum analogues of these equations are called the Schwinger‚ÄìDyson equations. If the functional measure turns out to be translationally invariant (we'll assume this for the rest of this article, although this does not hold for, let's say nonlinear sigma models), and if we assume that after a Wick rotation :e^{i\\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\varphi]}, which now becomes :e^{-H[\\\\varphi]} for some , it goes to zero faster than a reciprocal of any polynomial for large values of , then we can integrate by parts (after a Wick rotation, followed by a Wick rotation back) to get the following Schwinger‚ÄìDyson equations for the expectation: :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\delta F[\\\\varphi]}{\\\\delta \\\\varphi} \\\\right\\\\rangle = -i \\\\left\\\\langle F[\\\\varphi]\\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\varphi]}{\\\\delta\\\\varphi} \\\\right\\\\rangle for any polynomially- bounded functional . In the deWitt notation this looks likeJean Zinn-Justin (2009), Scholarpedia 4(2):8674 . :\\\\left\\\\langle F_{,i} \\\\right\\\\rangle = -i \\\\left\\\\langle F \\\\mathcal{S}_{,i} \\\\right\\\\rangle. These equations are the analog of the on-shell EL equations. The time ordering is taken before the time derivatives inside the . If (called the source field) is an element of the dual space of the field configurations (which has at least an affine structure because of the assumption of the translational invariance for the functional measure), then the generating functional of the source fields is defined to be :Z[J] = \\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\varphi e^{i\\\\left(\\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\varphi] + \\\\langle J,\\\\varphi \\\\rangle\\\\right)}. Note that :\\\\frac{\\\\delta^n Z}{\\\\delta J(x_1) \\\\cdots \\\\delta J(x_n)}[J] = i^n \\\\, Z[J] \\\\, \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\varphi(x_1)\\\\cdots \\\\varphi(x_n)\\\\right\\\\rangle_J, or :Z^{,i_1\\\\cdots i_n}[J] = i^n Z[J] \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\varphi^{i_1}\\\\cdots \\\\varphi^{i_n}\\\\right\\\\rangle_J, where :\\\\langle F \\\\rangle_J = \\\\frac{\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\varphi F[\\\\varphi]e^{i\\\\left(\\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\varphi] + \\\\langle J,\\\\varphi \\\\rangle\\\\right)}}{\\\\int\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\varphi e^{i\\\\left(\\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\varphi] + \\\\langle J,\\\\varphi \\\\rangle\\\\right)}}. Basically, if is viewed as a functional distribution (this shouldn't be taken too literally as an interpretation of QFT, unlike its Wick-rotated statistical mechanics analogue, because we have time ordering complications here!), then are its moments, and is its Fourier transform. If is a functional of , then for an operator , is defined to be the operator that substitutes for . For example, if :F[\\\\varphi] = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{k_1}}{\\\\partial x_1^{k_1}}\\\\varphi(x_1)\\\\cdots \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{k_n}}{\\\\partial x_n^{k_n}}\\\\varphi(x_n), and is a functional of , then :F\\\\left[-i\\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta J}\\\\right] G[J] = (-i)^n \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{k_1}}{\\\\partial x_1^{k_1}}\\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta J(x_1)} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{k_n}}{\\\\partial x_n^{k_n}}\\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta J(x_n)} G[J]. Then, from the properties of the functional integrals :\\\\left \\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\mathcal{S}}{\\\\delta \\\\varphi(x)} [\\\\varphi] + J(x)\\\\right\\\\rangle_J = 0 we get the \\"master\\" Schwinger‚ÄìDyson equation: :\\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\mathcal{S}}{\\\\delta \\\\varphi(x)}\\\\left[-i \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta J}\\\\right]Z[J] + J(x)Z[J] = 0, or :\\\\mathcal{S}_{,i}[-i\\\\partial]Z + J_i Z = 0. If the functional measure is not translationally invariant, it might be possible to express it as the product , where is a functional and is a translationally invariant measure. This is true, for example, for nonlinear sigma models where the target space is diffeomorphic to . However, if the target manifold is some topologically nontrivial space, the concept of a translation does not even make any sense. In that case, we would have to replace the in this equation by another functional :\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{S}} = \\\\mathcal{S} - i\\\\ln M. If we expand this equation as a Taylor series about J 0, we get the entire set of Schwinger‚ÄìDyson equations.  Localization  The path integrals are usually thought of as being the sum of all paths through an infinite space‚Äìtime. However, in local quantum field theory we would restrict everything to lie within a finite causally complete region, for example inside a double light- cone. This gives a more mathematically precise and physically rigorous definition of quantum field theory.  Ward‚ÄìTakahashi identities  Now how about the on shell Noether's theorem for the classical case? Does it have a quantum analog as well? Yes, but with a caveat. The functional measure would have to be invariant under the one parameter group of symmetry transformation as well. Let's just assume for simplicity here that the symmetry in question is local (not local in the sense of a gauge symmetry, but in the sense that the transformed value of the field at any given point under an infinitesimal transformation would only depend on the field configuration over an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point in question). Let's also assume that the action is local in the sense that it is the integral over spacetime of a Lagrangian, and that :Q[\\\\mathcal{L}(x)]=\\\\partial_\\\\mu f^\\\\mu (x) for some function where only depends locally on (and possibly the spacetime position). If we don't assume any special boundary conditions, this would not be a \\"true\\" symmetry in the true sense of the term in general unless or something. Here, is a derivation which generates the one parameter group in question. We could have antiderivations as well, such as BRST and supersymmetry. Let's also assume :\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\varphi\\\\, Q[F][\\\\varphi]=0 for any polynomially-bounded functional . This property is called the invariance of the measure. And this does not hold in general. See anomaly (physics) for more details. Then, :\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\varphi\\\\, Q\\\\left[F e^{iS}\\\\right][\\\\varphi]=0, which implies :\\\\langle Q[F]\\\\rangle +i\\\\left\\\\langle F\\\\int_{\\\\partial V} f^\\\\mu\\\\, ds_\\\\mu\\\\right\\\\rangle=0 where the integral is over the boundary. This is the quantum analog of Noether's theorem. Now, let's assume even further that is a local integral :Q=\\\\int d^dx\\\\, q(x) where :q(x)[\\\\varphi(y)] = \\\\delta^{(d)}(X-y)Q[\\\\varphi(y)] \\\\, so that :q(x)[S]=\\\\partial_\\\\mu j^\\\\mu (x) \\\\, where :j^{\\\\mu}(x)=f^\\\\mu(x)-\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial (\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\varphi)}\\\\mathcal{L}(x) Q[\\\\varphi] \\\\, (this is assuming the Lagrangian only depends on and its first partial derivatives! More general Lagrangians would require a modification to this definition!). We're not insisting that is the generator of a symmetry (i.e. we are not insisting upon the gauge principle), but just that is. And we also assume the even stronger assumption that the functional measure is locally invariant: :\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\varphi\\\\, q(x)[F][\\\\varphi]=0. Then, we would have :\\\\langle q(x)[F] \\\\rangle +i\\\\langle F q(x)[S]\\\\rangle=\\\\langle q(x)[F]\\\\rangle +i\\\\left\\\\langle F\\\\partial_\\\\mu j^\\\\mu(x)\\\\right\\\\rangle=0. Alternatively, :q(x)[S]\\\\left[-i \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta J}\\\\right]Z[J]+J(x)Q[\\\\varphi(x)]\\\\left[-i \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta J}\\\\right]Z[J]=\\\\partial_\\\\mu j^\\\\mu(x)\\\\left[-i \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta J}\\\\right]Z[J]+J(x)Q[\\\\varphi(x)]\\\\left[-i \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta J}\\\\right]Z[J]=0. The above two equations are the Ward‚ÄìTakahashi identities. Now for the case where , we can forget about all the boundary conditions and locality assumptions. We'd simply have :\\\\left\\\\langle Q[F]\\\\right\\\\rangle =0. Alternatively, :\\\\int d^dx\\\\, J(x)Q[\\\\varphi(x)]\\\\left[-i \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta J}\\\\right]Z[J]=0.  Caveats = The need for regulators and renormalization  Path integrals as they are defined here require the introduction of regulators. Changing the scale of the regulator leads to the renormalization group. In fact, renormalization is the major obstruction to making path integrals well-defined.  Ordering prescription  Regardless of whether one works in configuration space or phase space, when equating the operator formalism and the path integral formulation, an ordering prescription is required to resolve the ambiguity in the correspondence between non- commutative operators and the commutative functions that appear in path integrands. For example, the operator \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\hat{q}\\\\hat{p}+\\\\hat{p}\\\\hat{q}) can be translated back as either qp-\\\\frac{i\\\\hbar}{2}, qp+\\\\frac{i\\\\hbar}{2}, or qp depending of whether one chooses the \\\\hat{q}\\\\hat{p}, \\\\hat{p}\\\\hat{q}, or Weyl ordering prescription; conversely, qp can be translated to either \\\\hat{q}\\\\hat{p}, \\\\hat{p}\\\\hat{q}, or \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\hat{q}\\\\hat{p}+\\\\hat{p}\\\\hat{q}) for the same respective choice of ordering prescription.  The path integral in quantum-mechanical interpretation  In one interpretation of quantum mechanics, the \\"sum over histories\\" interpretation, the path integral is taken to be fundamental, and reality is viewed as a single indistinguishable \\"class\\" of paths that all share the same events. For this interpretation, it is crucial to understand what exactly an event is. The sum-over-histories method gives identical results to canonical quantum mechanics, and Sinha and Sorkin claim the interpretation explains the Einstein‚ÄìPodolsky‚ÄìRosen paradox without resorting to nonlocality. Some advocates of interpretations of quantum mechanics emphasizing decoherence have attempted to make more rigorous the notion of extracting a classical-like \\"coarse-grained\\" history from the space of all possible histories.  Quantum gravity  Whereas in quantum mechanics the path integral formulation is fully equivalent to other formulations, it may be that it can be extended to quantum gravity, which would make it different from the Hilbert space model. Feynman had some success in this direction, and his work has been extended by Hawking and others. Approaches that use this method include causal dynamical triangulations and spinfoam models.  Quantum tunneling  Quantum tunnelling can be modeled by using the path integral formation to determine the action of the trajectory through a potential barrier. Using the WKB approximation, the tunneling rate () can be determined to be of the form : \\\\Gamma = A_\\\\mathrm{o} \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{S_\\\\mathrm{eff}}{\\\\hbar}\\\\right) with the effective action and pre- exponential factor . This form is specifically useful in a dissipative system, in which the systems and surroundings must be modeled together. Using the Langevin equation to model Brownian motion, the path integral formation can be used to determine an effective action and pre-exponential model to see the effect of dissipation on tunnelling. From this model, tunneling rates of macroscopic systems (at finite temperatures) can be predicted.

The river is approximately 500 kilometers (310 mi) long and rises on Mount Superbus, South East Queensland's highest peak, on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, approximately from the east coast of Queensland, and then flows north west across the Darling Downs, then west.Shaw, John H., Collins Australian Encyclopedia, Collins, Sydney, 1984, The Condamine River is a tributary of the Darling River. Course and features Felton, 2014 The headwaters of the river rise on the slopes of Mount Superbus, part of the Main Range, before passing through Cambanoora Gorge. The river flows through the towns of , , and Chinchilla and the tributary Gowrie Creek drains the slopes around Toowoomba. At Surat the Condamine turns to the south-west and becomes known as the Balonne River. The Condamine descends over its course, with a catchment area of . The water basin contains more than 1,800 wetlands. The Balonne River forks near Dirranbandi with a western branch being called the Culgoa River which, in turn, flows into the Darling River. The eastern branch of the Balonne River in turn branches again - into the Bokhara River on the right and the Narran River on the left (eastern) side. These rivers join with the Barwon River west of Brewarrina which also flows into the Darling River. Towns the Balonne passes through include St George, Dirranbandi and Surat. In this area Bungil Creek joins the Balonne River. Water storage The Condamine River near Chinchilla in 2012 Water from the Condamine River is used for town water supply and for irrigation. Leslie Dam on Sandy Creek, a tributary of the Condamine, is the main water reservoir for Warwick. Talgai Weir is a small weir that can hold near Clifton. Other water storage facilities on the Condamine River include the Yarramalong Weir, Lemon Tree Weir, Loudoun Weir, Tipton Weir and the Cecil Plains Weir. The Condamine River is reduced to a series of drying ponds during droughts in Australia.  Chinchilla Weir  The Chinchilla Weir was built in 1973 and is located on the Condamine River, eight kilometres south of the town of Chinchilla. The weir has the dual purpose of providing supply of irrigation water along the alluvial flats of the Condamine River and of augmenting the water supply to the town of Chinchilla. Chinchilla Weir is a concrete faced earthfill structure and is known for the unique curved design of its wall. The weir is the only storage for the Chinchilla Weir Water Supply Scheme. At the official opening of the Weir in 1974, approximately 5000 people were counted through the gates. Chinchilla Weir remains a freshwater playground for locals and visitors with waterskiing, canoeing, swimming and fishing being popular activities. History Parts of the water catchment were settled by the Bundjalung people. The Condamine River was named by Allan Cunningham in 1827 for Thomas de la Condamine, a former aide-de-camp to Governor Ralph Darling who became the colony's first Collector of Internal Revenue. Patrick Leslie was the first white settler in the area. He established Canning Downs in 1840, near Warwick. Major Thomas Mitchell crossed the Balonne River on St George's Day, 23 April 1846. The next year 1847 Ludwig Leichhardt went to examine the course of the Condamine River. Railway bridge construction at Warwick, 1882 Flooded Victoria Street, Warwick, 2010 In 1985, it was proposed by the Water Research Foundation of Australia to transfer water from the Clarence River to the Condamine water basin. The Condamine River and its catchment area were involved in the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods. During the floods the river reached a record peak at Condamine of and another peak of . Coal Seam Gas industry The Coal Seam Gas industry (often referred to as Coal Bed Methane) started exploring for unconventional gas in the Chinchilla region, through which the Condamine River flows, around 2000 when Bob Bryan formed The Queensland Gas Company (QGC). From humble beginnings supplying gas into the domestic market, the industry grew quickly with the advent of the CSG/LNG industry and building of export facilities in Gladstone. The gas is found in the coal seams and is adsorbed to the coal by water pressure. To extract gas from coal seams it is necessary to remove the water from the coal seams to allow the gas to flow. The de-watering of the Walloon Coal Measures has been raised as a concern by landholders, as stock water bores drilled into the coal seams can be affected by reduced water flows or gas. Under Queensland law, gas companies are required to \\"make good\\" if there is an impairment on a landholder's bore. The Walloon Coal Measures are hydraulically connected to the aquifers of the Great Artesian Basin (within the Surat Basin) and in some locations immediately underlies the Condamine Alluvium. Methane gas seeps In 2012 methane gas was observed escaping from the river. The gas that is seeping is derived either from the underlying Walloon Coal Measures and/or the Springbok Sandstone. The Queensland Government undertook an investigation into the gas seeps and the technical study concluded that the bubbling was unlikely to be caused by coal seam gas (CSG) activities in the region, but that further studies were required. In relation to the presence of methane in the river, the report concluded that ‚Äú‚Ä¶there is no safety risk or evidence of environmental harm occurring in the immediate area from the Condamine River gas seeps.\\" In April 2016 the Condamine River seeps were brought to the forefront of media attention by New South Wales Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham, when he allegedly set alight the methane gas bubbling from the riverbed. He claimed that \\"hydraulic fracturing\\" was the likely cause for the problem, but to date there is no direct link. In 2017 CSIRO researchers with expertise in hydrogeology, geology, ecology and biogeochemistry assessed the Condamine River to determine what is currently know about the methane seeps in the River including natural and human causes, and the potential human and environmental health and safety impacts of methane escaping from underground. They concluded that there could be a number of reasons for the methane releases, but conceded that \\"depressurisation of the Walloon Coal Measures during gas production could generate horizontal migration of methane gas. However, this flux of methane is likely to be small because of the shallow dip of the coal beds and the distance to gas production fields.\\" Other reasons for variation in bubbles includes changes in water flow, or flooding changing groundwater patterns. Hydraulic fracturing is not considered to be the cause as there has been no hydraulic fracturing in those fields. Natural gas seeps are not altogether uncommon in Queensland, but there are no recorded instances of bubbles occurring in a river. The Queensland Gasfields Commission (a government agency) identified 17 soil gas surveys undertaken during the 1980s and 1990s, from locations around the state that record naturally occurring methane releases. The nearest one to the bubbling in the Condamine river was 16 km distant and not linked to the river. These measured low levels of mixed gas ranging from less than 10 parts per million (ppm) to 240ppm occurring in the subsoil at depths of up to one meter. In 2017, the gas company that holds the tenure over this area of the river reported a 90% reduction in the level of the seep compared to the peak rate recorded in early-2016. This was done by intercepting and producing the gas before it reached the river, effectively taking it out of the system.

It is a bestselling historical novel that tells an alternative account of the story in the American novel Gone with the Wind (1936) by Margaret Mitchell. While the story of Gone with the Wind focuses on the life of the daughter of a wealthy slave owner, Scarlett O'Hara, The Wind Done Gone tells the story of the life of one of her slaves, Cynara, during the same time period and events. The title is an African American Vernacular English play on the original's title. Cynara's name comes from the Ernest Dowson poem Non sum qual√≠s eram bonae sub regno Cynarae, a line from which (\\"I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind\\") was the origin of Mitchell's novel's title.  Plot summary  Gone with the Wind revolves around Scarlett O'Hara, a pampered Southern white woman, who lives through the American Civil War and Reconstruction. The Wind Done Gone is the same story, but told from the viewpoint of Cynara, a mulatto slave on Scarlett's plantation and the daughter of Scarlett's father and Mammy. Sold from the O'Haras, Cynara eventually makes her way back to Atlanta and becomes the mistress of a white businessman. She later leaves him for a black aspiring politician, eventually moving with him to Reconstruction Washington, D.C. Characters * Cynara‚ÄîThe narrator of the novel, the recently freed slave is the daughter of white plantation owner Planter and his slave Mammy. She has a lifelong rivalry with her half-sister Other, sparked by jealousy that Mammy paid more attention to the white baby. They both came to love R. * Mammy‚ÄîCynara's mother and Other's wet nurse, Mammy doted on Other while neglecting her own daughter. Her masters believe she is a loyal slave, but the other slaves suspect that she killed Lady and Planter's male children‚Äîgiven to her to nurse‚Äîso that Planter would be Cotton Farm's last white master. Her real name, Pallas, is so rarely used that her daughter didn't learn it until after her death. A clear parallel to Gone with the Winds Mammy, she is the only major character called by the same name in both books. * Other‚ÄîThe daughter of Planter and Lady, Other formed a strong bond with her wet nurse Mammy. When her youngest daughter dies in an accident and her husband R. leaves her, she returns to Mammy and the Cotton Farm. Parallel to Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind. * R.‚ÄîOther's husband R. leaves his wife and takes Cynara as a mistress and kept woman. Cynara sees him as a prize that she can win in her rivalry with her half-sister Other. While R. loves Cynara for her beauty, he never tries to understand her. Parallel to Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind. * Beauty‚ÄîA brothel owner who once owned Cynara, Beauty is a source of advice for the young woman. Although she had an affair with R., Cynara believes she is a lesbian. Parallel to Belle Watling in Gone with the Wind. * Garlic‚ÄîPlanter's manservant Garlic is the architect of his master's success, his master's marriage and the house Tata. He used his wits and patience to manipulate Planter, with the goal of becoming the estate's real master. Cynara suspects that he may also be the mastermind behind Planter's death. Parallel to Pork in Gone with the Wind. * Lady‚ÄîAfter the death of her cousin Filipe, her only love, Lady joined Planter in a chaste marriage. Hurt by the close relationship between Other and Mammy, she would sometimes care for and breast-feed Cynara. She kept a secret that could destroy her family: she learned that one of her distant ancestors was black, which by the one-drop rule made her and her children Negro. Parallel to Ellen O'Hara in Gone with the Wind. * Planter‚ÄîThough he doted on his daughter Cynara when she was young, he gave her away to another family when he realized that she was Other's rival. His passion was for Mammy, not for his wife. Parallel to Gerald O'Hara in Gone with the Wind. * The Dreamy Gentleman‚ÄîThe unobtainable knight of Other's dreams, the Dreamy Gentleman chose to marry his plain cousin Mealy Mouth and live respectably. As a homosexual, he was horrified by Other's advances; he secretly loved Miss Priss' brother. When his lover revealed the affair to his wife, Mealy Mouth had the slave whipped to death. Parallel to Ashley Wilkes in Gone with the Wind. * Miss Priss‚ÄîGarlic's daughter holds a grudge against Mealy Mouth, whom she blames for two of her brothers' deaths. One of her brothers was whipped to death when Mealy Mouth discovered his affair with her husband. The other starved to death as a baby when his mother became wet nurse to Mealy Mouth's child. The whites believe she was psychologically broken by her brothers' deaths, but the slaves believe that she is a crafty woman who is responsible for Mealy Mouth's death. Probable parallel to Prissy in Gone with the Wind. Similarity to characters in Gone with the Wind The book consciously avoids using the names of Mitchell's characters or locations. Cynara refers to her sister as \\"Other\\", rather than Scarlett, and to Other's husband as \\"R\\" (and later, \\"Debt Chauffeur\\") instead of Rhett Butler. Other is in love with \\"Dreamy Gentleman\\" (Ashley Wilkes), although he is married to \\"Mealy Mouth\\" (Melanie Wilkes). The magnificence of the O'Haras' house, Tara, is reduced to \\"Tata\\" or \\"Cotton Farm\\", and Twelve Oaks is renamed for its builders, \\"Twelve Slaves Strong as Trees\\".  Legal controversy  The estate of Margaret Mitchell sued Randall and her publishing company, Houghton Mifflin, on the grounds that The Wind Done Gone was too similar to Gone with the Wind, thus infringing its copyright.Lawrence Lessig, The Future of Ideas, p. 198. The case attracted numerous comments from leading scholars, authors, and activists, regarding what Mitchell's attitudes would have been and how much The Wind Done Gone copies from its predecessor. After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated an injunction against publishing the book in Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin (2001), the case was settled in 2002 when Houghton Mifflin agreed to make an unspecified donation to Morehouse College in exchange for Mitchell's estate dropping the litigation. The cover of the book bears a seal identifying it as \\"The Unauthorized Parody.\\" It is parody in the broad legal sense: a work that comments on or criticizes a prior work. This characterization was important in the Suntrust case.

He came to prominence during the 1970s for leading the New South Wales Builders' Labourers Federation (BLF) in the famous green bans, whereby the BLF led a successful campaign to protect the built and natural environment of Sydney from excessive and inappropriate development. Mundey was the patron of the Historic Houses Association of Australia. Early years John Bernard \\"Jack\\" Mundey was born on 17 October 1929 in Malanda, Queensland on the Johnstone River in the Atherton Tablelands, some 100 km west of Cairns. He was one of five siblings born to Catholic parents of Irish descent. His father was a lifetime Labor voter. His mother died when he was six. He was educated at Malanda Primary School and at St Augustine's, Cairns. He ran away from the latter due to its \\"authoritarian methods\\" of discipline. Mundey moved to Sydney when he was 19, and became a metalworker and later a builder's labourer, joining successively the Federated Ironworkers' Association and the Builders Labourers Federation. He also played rugby league for Parramatta under Vic Hey for three years. He joined the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) in 1957. Mundey's first wife was Stephanie Lennon; the couple had a son, Michael. 15 months after her son's birth, Stephanie Mundey died at a young age from a brain tumour. Mundey remarried, in 1965, to Judith Ann Willcocks, known as Judy Mundey. During the 1960s, Mundey was a crusading unionist and an advocate on a wide range of issues from safety reforms on building sites to wider issues such as feminism, gay rights and international politics. Mundey considered all these matters appropriate targets for union activism. His second wife, Judy, joined him in these campaigns and later rose to become national president of the CPA. Green bans In 1968, Mundey was elected secretary of the NSW Builders' Labourers Federation (BLF). From this position, he became a highly visible individual who, with his union and supportive community members, was responsible for the green bans that saved much of Sydney's heritage and built environment. He insisted that the priorities of development be reversed such that the open community spaces and heritage buildings be preserved and that affordable public housing was more important than accumulating empty or underused commercial buildings. In 1975, Mundey and other New South Wales leaders of the BLF were expelled from the union by the federal leadership under Norm Gallagher, who was later to be convicted of corrupt dealings with developers. A plaque in Annandale commemorating the work of Mundey and the union Politics Mundey was the lead Legislative Council candidate of the Communist Party of Australia at the 1978 New South Wales state election. His party polled almost 80,000 votes ‚Äì 2.9 percent of the statewide total ‚Äì and outpolled the Australian Democrats. Mundey came close to winning a seat, and was the last candidate excluded from the count. Mundey was elected to the City of Sydney council in 1984, ending his term in 1987. In 2003, Mundey joined the Australian Greens, citing their opposition to the Iraq War and their environmental stance.He remained a member until his death. According to Senator Bob Brown, parliamentary leader of the Australian Greens, speaking to the Australian Senate on 21 March 1997, the use of the term \\"Green\\" as a political category actually derives from the green bans, by way of Petra Kelly's visit to Sydney in 1977.Meredith Burgmann and Verity Burgmann, Green Bans, Red Union: The Saving of a City second edition, Sydney: NewSouth Publishing, 2017: 9-10. Later life Mundey's only child, his son Michael, was killed in a car accident. Mundey's autobiography, Green Bans and Beyond, was published in 1981. Foundation of Australia plaque, Loftus Street, Circular Quay In 1981 Mundey joined the Quayhole Committee in their effort to save the landing site of the First Fleet, \\"The Gateway Site‚Äù, at Circular Quay, where Captain Arthur Phillip raised the Union Jack on 26 January 1788, establishing \\"The Foundation of Australia\\" and hence the commemoration date of Australia Day. Watercolour Drawing of Memorial Park proposal for the First Fleet Landing Site (The Gateway Site) at Circular Quay. In a radio interview Mundey referred to the Quayhole Committee as \\"Visionary Architects\\" for their proposal. Later he was elevated to chairman of the planning committee of Sydney City Council from May 1984 to September 1985. Mundey was an alderman on Sydney council for one term from 1984-87. In 1994 the Anti-Wall Committee was formed to protect the Sydney Opera House from nearby urban development. In 1988, the University of Western Sydney made Mundey an honorary Doctor of Letters and an honorary Doctor of Science in recognition of his service to the environment for the previous 30 years. Mundey was made a life member of the Australian Conservation Foundation in the 1990s. In 1995, in keeping with his continued interest in Sydney and the state's urban environment and heritage, he was appointed chair of the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales, and he was also the patron of the Historic Houses Association of Australia. In February 2007, the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales renamed a portion of Argyle Street in The Rocks \\"Jack Mundey Place\\" in recognition of his leadership \\"in the fight to preserve such significant sites in the historic Rocks area.\\" During mid 2009, the NSW State Labor Government headed by Premier Nathan Rees, announced the now cancelled CBD Metro rail project for Sydney. Mundey would once again enter the fray to help fight the demolition of historic buildings and space, this time in Sydney's Pyrmont & Rozelle. The then State Labor Government had planned to build a metro style railway between the existing city circle, over to Rozelle. This involved demolishing numerous buildings and businesses along the way. Ultimately, the CBD Metro project would be fully deferred and cancelled, after a storm of protest. In 2014, Mundey was named Patron of the Friends of Millers Point as he joined the fight to save the Sirius building which was built for the people of The Rocks when the green bans saved them from eviction and The Rocks from demolition forty years earlier.

She was launched on 3 December 1942 by Lady Davidson, wife of the general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, and commissioned into the RAN on 30 April 1943. Compared to other Bathurst class corvettes, Cootamundra is slightly longer ( as opposed to ) and has a slightly shallower draught ( compared to ). Operational history=World War II After commissioning, Cootamundra was assigned to convoy escort duties along the east coast of Australia. On 15 June, a thirteen-ship convoy heading for Brisbane and escorted by Cootamundra and sister ships Bundaberg, Deloraine, Kalgoorlie, and Warrnambool, was attacked off Smoky Cape. The United States Army Transport Portmar and the US Navy Landing ship LST-469 were torpedoed by Japanese submarine I-174: the former sinking in minutes with the loss of only two lives, while 26 were killed aboard the latter ship, which survived and was towed to port.Gill (1968). Pages 261‚Äì262. This was the last submarine attack to be made on the east coast of Australia during World War II. Cootamundra was reassigned to Darwin in early June, and began to escort shipping between Darwin and Thursday Island. On 6 August, while escorting the merchantman SS Macumba, the two ships were attacked by two Japanese aircraft. Macumba‚Äôs engine room was destroyed, and despite efforts to tow the ship to safety, the merchantman's crew were taken aboard the corvette that evening and the ship was allowed to sink. Cootamundra remained in her role until April 1944, when she sailed to Sydney for refit. The refit finished at the end of May, and after a brief period operating as an escort from Darwin, Cootamundra was reassigned to New Guinea waters. The corvette served as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship from 5 July until the end of World War II. The corvette was awarded three battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Darwin 1943\\", \\"Pacific 1943‚Äì45\\", and \\"New Guinea 1944\\". Post-war Following the end of the war, Cootamundra was used to transport Allied prisoners-of-war back to Australia, and carry an occupation force to Ambon, before leaving New Guinea waters on 29 September 1945 while towing HMAS Leilani. The corvette arrived in Melbourne on 26 November 1945, where she was decommissioned into reserve. On 12 December 1951, Cootamundra was re-commissioned as a training ship. In 1954, the corvette visited New Zealand. In 1957, she was assigned to northern Australian waters, to supervise the Japanese pearling fleet. Decommissioning and fate Cootamundra was decommissioned for the second time on 8 June 1959. She was marked for disposal on 27 September 1961, and was sold for scrap on 28 March 1962.

It overlaps with other conservative Christian movements including Evangelicalism, and the Holiness movement. Its members have stated their commitment to work to change their home denominations from within rather than establishing new ones, even if they are unable to regain full control.The Confessing Movement places particular weight on the role of evangelism and traditional Bible teachings concerning the deity of Christ and holds conservative, historical Christian views on sexuality, especially homosexuality. Confessing Movement in the churches A large group of laity and a somewhat smaller group of clergy within the mainline churches hold that their denominations have been \\"hijacked\\" by those who, in their view, have 'forsaken Christianity' for moral relativism to accommodate democratic pluralist society in America. They reject church leaders such as United Methodist Bishop Joseph Sprague of Chicago and Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong as apostate. Although tension between theological modernizers and traditionalists in American Protestantism date has existed for generations, the formation of the Confessing Movement was triggered by changing positions on sexual orientation and especially the ordination of \\"practicing homosexuals\\" as clergy. Other issues influencing some groups were the ordination of women, and the decline in attendance of many of the mainline denominations through the 1950s to the 1980s in the US with leaders of the Confessing Movement arguing that the shrinking of mainline church membership resulted Christianity from conservative members leaving for growing evangelical churches rather than liberal members disengaging. Global=Methodist The Confessing Movement within the United Methodist Church quotes Methodism's founder, John Wesley, who said: Leaders have included Thomas C. Oden, Maxie Dunnam, Bill Hinson, John Ed Mathison, Karen Covey Moore, William J. Abraham, and James Heidinger. The movement has been very successful in maintaining doctrinal standards and traditional United Methodist positions on theology and practice at the General Conferences in Cleveland (2000), Pittsburgh (2004), and Fort Worth (2008). At the 2008 conference for instance delegates voted to retain language in the Social Creed defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman. General Conference closes with message of hope after addressing budget, social issues They also maintained the traditional teaching, that although homosexuals \\"are individuals of sacred worth\\", homosexual practice is \\"incompatible with Christian teaching.\\" United Methodists uphold homosexuality stance After the 2019 United Methodist General Conference, the denomination became sharply divided over the issue of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. Because of this split, there has been speculation about the UMC separating or dividing into two or more denominations. An exit plan for dissatisfied congregations was passed by the 2019 General Conference and upheld by the Judicial Council (top court of the United Methodist Conference). In addition, there are proposals for annual conferences to take place for the purpose of regular doctrinal evaluation. Other organizations aligned with The Confessing Movement within The United Methodist Church include Concerned Methodists, Good News, United Methodist Action, the Independent Committee on Alcohol and Drugs for United Methodists, Transforming Congregations, the Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality (Lifewatch), and Renew Network. Apart from these traditionalist organizations within the United Methodist Church, other theologically traditional Methodist denominations holding views similar to those espoused by the Confessing Movement include the Free Methodist Church, Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, Primitive Methodist Church, and the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches. United States of America=Presbyterian One of the fastest growing Confessing Movements is within the Presbyterian Church (USA). In February, 2002 more than 800 laity, pastors, deacons, and elders gathered in Atlanta, Georgia for the first National Celebration of Confessing Churches. Participating churches affirm that Christ is the only way of salvation, that the Bible is infallible in its teachings, and that sexual relations are exclusively for marriage. More than 1,300 of the denomination's 11,000 congregations have adopted such declarations and become part of a loosely knit Confessing Church Movement. The books Union in Christ: A Declaration for the Church (1999) and A Passion for the Gospel: Confessing Jesus Christ for the 21st Century (2000), both by Mark Achtemeier and Andrew Purves have served as rallying cries for Confessing Presbyterians. Episcopalian / Anglican  The newly formed American Anglican Council, which includes members of both the mainline Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church in North America [an Anglican realignment ecclesiastical province], states: Lutheran Conservative traditions have always been strong in the Lutheran synods of North America. Over the last two centuries, most of the many new synods were started by members who felt their synod was straying from Christian orthodoxy. There are several reform movements that have been founded in recent years to effect change within existing Lutheran denominations. The largest of these organizations is the WordAlone Network, organized in 2000 in opposition to the Concordat/Called to Common Mission agreement with the Episcopal Church USA. Under that agreement, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) agreed to undertake the Episcopal practice of being governed by bishops in the historic episcopate. Many Lutherans saw this as contrary to Lutheran theology and organized in opposition to it. While the WordAlone Network has worked to reform church governance, sometimes with little visible reward for their effort, they succeeded at the 2005 Churchwide Assembly of the ELCA in slowing the efforts of those who sought to revise the understanding of homosexuality within the ELCA. This was accomplished in cooperation with others who did not oppose the historic episcopate through the Solid Rock Lutherans organization. WordAlone has also been an incubator for launching related groups working to reform the church. They include a new publisher of a Lutheran hymnal (Reclaim Lutheran Worship), LC3, and Lutheran CORE. The most successful WordAlone outgrowth is Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ (LCMC), a post-denominational association of 724 congregations in ten countries, with 656 of them in the United States. The Evangelical Lutheran Confessing Fellowship (ELCF) is one of the more recent of these \\"reform\\" movements, inspired by the other Protestant \\"confessing movements\\" described in this article. The ELCF was organized in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in February, 2002 by about 60 pastors and laypersons who belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The goal of the movement is to remain faithful to the orthodox or traditional teachings of the church, especially with regard to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, the unique Lordship of Jesus Christ, the authority of scripture, and human sexual intimacy. Its efforts have been to persuade the ELCA to return to orthodox positions with regard to its theology and teachings, rather than separation from the ELCA. According to their initial press release, a primary goal is to head off apparent movement toward formal recognition and ordination of homosexual clergy. In 2005, the proposals to allow ordination of homosexual clergy and blessing of homosexual relationships were defeated at the ELCA's national convention. In 2005 the Lutheran Coalition for Reform (Lutheran CORE) was formed to organize groups and individuals within the ELCA to uphold the traditional church teachings on the scriptures, marriage, and sexuality. The decisions of the 2009 ELCA Churchwide Assembly to allow pastors to be in same-sex relationships and still preach the ministry caused Lutheran CORE to begin working towards focusing on helping alternative confessing fellowships for Lutherans no matter what church affiliations. Lutheran CORE still maintains membership within the ELCA and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada though they also have affiliations with LC-MC and the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, among others; Lutheran CORE was also instrumental in the formation of the North American Lutheran Church in 2010 of Lutheran CORE congregations that no longer wished to be part of the ELCA or ELCiC. United Church of Christ In the United Church of Christ the first confessing movement founded was the Biblical Witness Fellowship, formed in 1977 after a General Synod sexuality study that, to the founders, seemed to take a decidedly permissive attitude toward non-marital sex and homosexuality. The BWF advocates a dual goal of local church renewal and national level reformation. Under the leadership of executive director David Runnion-Bareford, a Candia, New Hampshire, pastor, this movement has presented reformation initiatives before each of the last five Synods of the UCC, including a successful reaffirmation of the Lordship of Jesus Christ and the denomination's historic symbol, the \\"Cross Triumphant,\\" in 2005. \\"Focus Renewal Ministries\\" was founded as a charismatic expression within the United Church of Christ, although its membership is small. More recently, some UCC conservatives began a \\"Faithful and Welcoming\\" movement, led by the Rev. Bob Thompson, pastor of Hickory, North Carolina's Corinth Reformed UCC. Like the founding of the BWF, that initiative followed the controversial General Synod of 2005 (in which the denomination in effect endorsed the efforts of same-sex couples to marry) and seeks to keep churches from leaving the denomination. Generally speaking, the F&W; movement is perceived as less strident than the BWF, which has close relationships with established para-denominational evangelical organizations such as Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Massachusetts. However, the UCC's renewal advocates have been far less successful than their counterparts in other mainline bodies: according to Faithful and Welcoming, over 250 congregations have withdrawn from the denomination since 2005, and despite the work mentioned above, the national leadership, and probably a majority of the remaining congregations, are resolute in their support of liberal theological and social stands. It is thus likely that laypeople and clergy espousing the aims of BWF, FRM, and F&W; will remain small minorities in the denomination for the foreseeable future. Given this scenario, many more of the remaining advocates may well defect to more conservative groups also, leaving the UCC as perhaps the U.S.'s most politically and theologically liberal Christian group. Australia=Uniting Church in Australia The Assembly of Confessing Congregations of the Uniting Church in Australia formed in 2006. It is the result of the coming together of two groups: the Reforming Alliance (est. 2003 in response decision by the UCA's 2003 Assembly not ban outright on the ordination of practicing homosexuals,) and the Evangelical Members within the Uniting Church in Australia (EMU) (est. in the early 1990s as a conservative response to what was seen as the church's growing liberalism).

A DBCS supports national languages that contain many unique characters or symbols (the maximum number of characters that can be represented with one byte is 256 characters, while two bytes can represent up to 65,536 characters). Examples of such languages include Japanese and Chinese. Korean Hangul does not contain as many characters, but KS X 1001 supports both Hangul and Hanja, and uses two bytes per character. In CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) computing The term DBCS traditionally refers to a character encoding where each graphic character is encoded in two bytes. In an 8-bit code, such as Big-5 or Shift JIS, a character from the DBCS is represented with a lead (first) byte with the most significant bit set (i.e., being greater than seven bits), and paired up with a single-byte character-set (SBCS). For the practical reason of maintaining compatibility with unmodified, off-the-shelf software, the SBCS is associated with half-width characters and the DBCS with full-width characters. In a 7-bit code such as ISO-2022-JP, escape sequences or shift codes are used to switch between the SBCS and DBCS. Sometimes, the use of the term \\"DBCS\\" can imply an underlying structure that does not comply with ISO 2022. For example, \\"DBCS\\" can sometimes mean a double-byte encoding that is specifically not Extended Unix Code (EUC). This original meaning of DBCS is different from what some consider correct usage today. Some insist that these character encodings be properly called multi-byte character sets (MBCS) or variable-width encodings, because character encodings such as EUC-JP, EUC-KR, EUC-TW, GB18030, and UTF-8 use more than two bytes for some characters, and they support one byte for other characters. Ambiguity  Some people use DBCS to mean the UTF-16 and UTF-8 encodings, while other people use the term DBCS to mean older (pre- Unicode) character encodings that use more than one byte per character. Shift JIS, GB2312 and Big5 are a few character encodings that can contain more than one byte per character, but even using the term DBCS for these character encodings is incorrect terminology because these character encodings are really variable-width encodings. Some IBM mainframes do have true DBCS code pages, which contain only the double byte portion of a multi-byte code page. If a person uses the term \\"DBCS enablement\\" for software internationalization, they are using ambiguous terminology. They either mean they want to write software for East Asian markets using older technology with code pages, or they are planning on using Unicode. Sometimes this term also implies translation into an East Asian language. Usually \\"Unicode enablement\\" means internationalizing software by using Unicode, and \\"DBCS enablement\\" means using incompatible character encodings that exist between the various countries in East Asia for internationalizing software. Since Unicode, unlike many other character encodings, supports all the major languages in East Asia, it is generally easier to enable and maintain software that uses Unicode. DBCS (non-Unicode) enablement is usually only desired when much older operating systems or applications do not support Unicode. TBCS A triple-byte character set (TBCS) is a character encoding in which characters (including control characters) are encoded in three bytes.

While the four G-boats were nominally all of a class, they differed enough in significant details that they are sometimes considered to be four unique boats, each in a class by herself. Construction history G-1 was named Seal when her keel was laid down on 2 February 1909 by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Newport News, Virginia, under a subcontract from the Lake Torpedo Boat Company, making her the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the seal, a sea mammal valued for its skin and oil. She was launched on 8 February 1911, sponsored by Miss Margaret V. Lake, daughter of Simon Lake, the submarine pioneer. She was renamed G-1 on 17 November 1911, and commissioned in the New York Navy Yard on 28 October 1912 with Lieutenant Kenneth Whiting in command. Seal was the first contract the Lake Torpedo Boat Company secured from the United States Government, but the contract's requirements were among the most severe ever required of a shipbuilder. The Company did not receive any payment on account during her construction and her required performances had never been approached by any other submarine in the world. G-1 met and exceeded those requirements and introduced several innovations. In addition to a pair of fixed torpedo tubes in the bow that required the vessel herself to be trained, G-1 carried four torpedo tubes in a mount on her deck that could be trained in the same manner as a deck gun on a surface vessel while the boat was submerged, thus allowing a \\"broadside\\" shot of one or more torpedoes. Service history After fitting out in New York City, G-1 proceeded to the Naval Torpedo Station, Rhode Island, arriving there on 30 January 1913. Attached to the Atlantic Submarine Flotilla, G-1 spent the next year and a half conducting dive training and torpedo firing exercises in Long Island Sound and Narragansett Bay. In preparation for her final acceptance trials in October 1913, the boat made a record dive of in Long Island Sound. Financial considerations led to G-1 being put in reserve at New York City on 15 June 1914. G-1 was placed in full commission at New York City on 6 February 1915 with Lieutenant, junior grade Joseph M. Deem in command. In company with sister ship , tender and tug , G-1 sailed south on 25 March into Chesapeake Bay and down the seaboard for Norfolk, Virginia. Arriving there two days later, she conducted maneuvers in Hampton Roads as part of the Third Division, Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. On 2 April, while off Old Point Comfort, G-1 grazed steam ship Ocean View, wrecking the submersible's wooden false bow. After a short period at Norfolk for repairs, the division cruised south to Charleston, South Carolina, mooring there on 17 April. Heavy seas encountered during this coastwise passage caused the two G-class submarines to roll heavily, spring oil leaks, and pop engine rivets. Following a three-week yard period in Charleston, the two boats ‚Äî accompanied by Fulton and gunboat ‚Äî proceeded back to New York City on 6 May, arriving there three days later. Upon arrival, retired Rear Admiral Yates Stirling, Jr., senior aide on the staff of Commander, Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, inspected the boat and concluded the G-boats were crude and inefficient in comparison to current designs. Deeming their military value negligible, he urged that a field of scientific or experimental use be found for them. Training ship USS G-1 G-1 departed New York on 23 May 1915 and proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, where she became a school ship on the torpedo range. She also carried out harbor defense and patrol battle problems in Narragansett Bay. Aside from minor repairs at New York in June, this duty continued until 3 October, when she set course ‚Äî along with tender ‚Äî for a training cruise to Chesapeake Bay. After making a few days of practice attack runs against the monitor off Fisherman's Island, the boat returned to Newport on 12 October for inspection and crew changes; a week later, she shifted to Naval Submarine Base New London, the new submarine base at New London, Connecticut. On 4 December, while the crew of G-1 was charging batteries, a circulating pump broke down and severely overheated the port engine. That mishap ‚Äî combined with a steering gear overhaul at New York ‚Äî kept ship's force busy in the yard for the next thirteen months. While there, G-1 was assigned (SS-19¬Ω) as her official hull number on 12 June 1916. Finally, after a few days of familiarization training, the crew sailed the boat to New London on 23 January 1917. Once there, G-1 began her new career as an experimental and instructional submersible. She acted as a schoolship for the newly established Submarine Base and Submarine School at New London, training officers and men of the newly expanded submarine force. Concurrently, given the entry of the United States into World War I, G-1 tested submarine nets and detector devices for the Experiment Board. She served in a similar capacity at Nahant, Massachusetts, and Provincetown, Massachusetts, assisting the destroyer and steam yacht in the development and use of sound detection devices and experiments with the \\"K tube,\\" a communications device. With German U-boats reported off the coast in June 1918, the submarine spent two four-day periscope and listening patrols off Nantucket, Massachusetts, as a defense screen for shipping. Following the end of the war, G-1 conducted daily operations with enlisted students in connection with the Listener and Hydrophone School at New London. In August 1919, after a failed inspection by the Board of Inspection and Survey, the boat was laid up at New London in preparation for disposal. Towed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 30 January 1920 she was stripped of useful material and decommissioned on 6 March. She was designated as a target for depth charge experiments under the cognizance of the Bureau of Ordnance on 9 June. In 1920, G-1 was redesignated SS-20 even though that hull classification symbol and number had already been given to (ex-Carp). F-1 had sunk in a collision with F-3 in 1917, so there was no overlap in time of service. Target ship The minesweeper towed G-1 back to Narragansett Bay in May 1921. Grebe made eight experimental depth charge attacks on G-1 while the boat lay off Taylor's Point on 21 June. Damaged and flooded by those explosions, the battered submarine settled to the bottom in of water. Several attempts to raise her failed and her wreck was officially abandoned. G-1 was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 August 1921.

It was composed in 1906 by Charles A. Zimmermann with lyrics by Alfred Hart Miles. When he composed \\"Anchors Aweigh,\\" Zimmermann was a lieutenant and had been bandmaster of the United States Naval Academy Band since 1887. Miles was Midshipman First Class at the Academy, in the class of 1907, and had asked Zimmermann to assist him in composing a song for that class, to be used as a football march. Another Academy Midshipman, Royal Lovell (class of 1926), later wrote what would be adopted into the song as its third verse. Etymology Old Dutch sailors' expression, to get the anchors lifted. Dutch and Flemish were dominating sailors' expressions all over the world. To \\"weigh anchor\\" is to bring it aboard a vessel in preparation for departure. The phrase \\"anchors aweigh\\" is a report that the anchors are clear of the sea bottom and, therefore, the ship is officially under way. \\"Anchors aweigh\\" is often misspelled as \\"Anchor's away,\\" leading to confusion of the terms and the misunderstanding that it means \\"to drop anchor.\\" Another confusion is evident in the spellings encountered both with and without an apostrophe. Here, it is a matter of distinguishing the singular anchor + contraction of \\"is\\" (that is, \\"anchor's aweigh\\") from the plural (anchors aweigh), meaning all anchors of the ship are raised. Although the original (now archaic) \\"aweigh\\" is verbal and transitive, the \\"aweigh\\" used now is adjectival/adverbial in nature and meaning. \\"Weigh\\" as a verb means to \\"bear\\" or \\"move,\\" thus giving it several shades of meaning and derivation, including \\"weight\\" or \\"heaviness.\\" History U.S. Navy recruits singing the post-1997 lyrics of \\"Anchors Aweigh\\" as they walk through a tunnel at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes in Illinois. The song was first played during the Army‚ÄìNavy football game on December 1, 1906, at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Navy won the game 10‚Äì0 before a crowd in excess of 30,000, their first win in the match up since 1900. The song was gradually adopted as the song of the U.S. Navy; although there is a pending proposal to make it the official song, and to incorporate protocol into Navy regulations for its performance, its status remains unofficial. Its lyrics were considered too specific to the Academy and not representative of the Navy at large, and so were rewritten by George D. Lottman (note the reference to \\"farewell to college joys\\"). Its melody was also slightly rewritten by Domenico Savino. The song has a joyful, brisk melody, and it has been adopted by several other navies around the world, such as the Finnish Navy. In addition to being bandmaster at the Naval Academy, Zimmerman was also the organist at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Annapolis, and the opening notes of the melody to Anchors Aweigh bear a marked similarity (although in a different tempo) to the opening of the ancient Marian hymn Salve Regina, with which Zimmerman would have been thoroughly familiar. During World War II, members of the Navy Women's Reserve, known more popularly as the WAVES, wrote WAVES of the Navy to harmonize with Anchors Aweigh.Ebbert, Jean; Hall, Marie- Beth (1993).

Cubbie Station, located on the Culgoa River, is situated adjacent to a large diversion channel which permits the farm, under licence to store of river water. According to downstream farmers in 2008, large cotton farms, such as Cubbie Station, have reduced the traditional flow of the Culgoa River by one third. By 2009, downstream farmers where claiming that due to upstream water entitlements on the Culgoa River, since 2000, the Lower Balonne floodplain had not received enough water to flood the plains. Prior to the granting of these rights, the Lower Balonne River flooded every two or three years; impacting the sustainability of flora, fauna, birdlife, and economic returns from grazing livestock and cropping. Little Culgoa Creek, an anabranch of the Culgoa River, leaves the river near Goodooga and returns to the river near Brenda Gate.

It is set between Blackadder the Third (1987) and Blackadder Goes Forth (1989), and is narrated by Hugh Laurie. Produced by the BBC, it was first broadcast on BBC1 on 23 December 1988. Plot Ebenezer Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), the Victorian proprietor of a \\"moustache shop\\", is the nicest man in England. He is everything that Ebenezer Scrooge was by the end of the original story: generous and kind to everybody, and sensitive to the misery of others. As a result, people take advantage of his kindness ‚Äì Mrs. Scratchit and an orphan take all his money, and a beadle takes his food. All but Mr. Baldrick (Tony Robinson) view him as a victim. His business turns no profit, all his earnings go to charity and to con artists, and despite his positive attitude, he lives a lonely, miserable life. One Christmas Eve, Blackadder's destiny changes when the Spirit of Christmas (Robbie Coltrane) visits him to congratulate him for his ways. The Spirit lets him see two shades of the past: his Blackadder ancestors, the protagonists of Blackadder II and Blackadder the Third. Instead of providing positive reinforcement that Ebenezer is better than his forefathers, these visions lead him to admire them and their wit. He asks the Spirit to show him what could happen if he became like them. He sees a vision of a distant future where his descendant, Grand Admiral Blackadder, is a successful and ruthless official of a galactic empire, about to marry the similarly ruthless and insanely ambitious Queen Asphyxia XIX (Miranda Richardson) after murdering her \\"triple husbandoid\\". The future Baldrick, wearing a loincloth, is Blackadder's slave. Blackadder asks the Spirit what will happen if he stays as he is. He is shown an alternative future in which his descendant is the loincloth-clad slave of the incompetent Admiral Baldrick. Contrary to the Spirit's intended point, Blackadder takes \\"the very clear lesson that bad guys have all the fun\\". On Christmas morning, he wakes up a different man: bitter, vengeful, greedy, and insulting to everyone he meets. Now feeling in control of his life, he misses an opportunity when he insults two strangers who claim to be Queen Victoria (Miriam Margolyes) and Prince Albert (Jim Broadbent) and throws them out of his home. The episode ends on Blackadder's extravagant Christmas dinner, which is ruined when Baldrick shows him the royal seal left behind by the strangers, proving Baldrick's story that the Queen and Prince Albert had planned to award Blackadder a gift of ¬£50,000 and the title of Baron Blackadder for being the \\"nicest man in England\\".  Edited version  Most versions of this special edit Baldrick's speech about a dog being used as Jesus for the Nativity play to remove a line in which Baldrick says the dog will be nailed to a cross for Easter. The earliest known case of this edit was on its first rerun in December 1989. The same version was used for later terrestrial broadcasts when the special aired on Christmas in the years 1998, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2012. The edited version is also seen in the Blackadder Ultimate Edition DVD set, on the UK channel Gold since 2018 (the uncut version was screened until 2017) and, as of 2016, is on Hulu Plus.

She was present at the bombing of Darwin and survived unscathed. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Deloraine) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Launching of HMAS Deloraine Deloraine was laid down at Morts Dock & Engineering Co in Balmain, New South Wales on 19 March 1941. She was launched on 26 July 1941 by Dame Mary Hughes, wife of the Minister for the Navy, and commissioned into the RAN on 22 November 1941. Operational history=World War II After commissioning, Deloraine sailed to Darwin, where she was based for the first part of her career as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol vessel. On 20 January 1942, the United States destroyer USS Edsall, escorting the American oiler USS Trinity (AO-13), reported a Japanese submarine was in the area after an unsuccessful attack on the oiler. The submarine, I-124 of the Imperial Japanese Navy, tried and failed to torpedo Deloraine at 1:35 pm, with Deloraine locating the submarine on asdic. After two depth-charge attacks the submarine briefly broke the surface. Deloraine then observed 'large bubbles of oil and air'. Sister ships Katoomba and Lithgow arrived in the area; the two ships continuing to patrol and depth-charge the area while Deloraine reloaded. They were successful, and the four ships were jointly credited with the kill of I-124‚Äîthe first enemy submarine to be sunk in Australian waters, going down with 80 lives.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 183‚Äì4. HMAS Deloraine (foreground) during the Japanese air raids on Darwin The ship was present in Darwin Harbour during the Japanese bombing of Darwin in February 1942. She was undamaged by the attack and assisted in rescue and recovery operations. On 5 March, Deloraine was attacked on several occasions by a Japanese flying boat, but was again undamaged. In July 1942, the corvette returned to Sydney, and spent the next twenty months escorting supply convoys from Sydney to Newcastle, Brisbane, and New Guinea. In April 1943, Deloraine rescued 19 survivors from the torpedoed merchant ship Lydia M. Child. On 16 June 1943, Portmar and LST-469 were torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine while travelling in Convoy GP55: the only two ships lost in the convoys Deloraine was attached to during her service history. In May 1944, Deloraine was redeployed to New Guinea waters for escort, patrol, and troop transport duties. She carried out bombardments in support of several Allied landings in New Guinea. At the end of April 1945, the corvette sailed to Brisbane for refits: hostilities ended while she was in dock. The corvette was awarded three battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Darwin 1942\\", \\"Pacific 1942‚Äì45\\", and \\"New Guinea 1943‚Äì44\\". Post-war After refitting, Deloraine was used to transport an occupation force from Morotai to Menado, then returned to Sydney and commenced clearing minefields off the New South Wales coast. For the first half of 1946, Deloraine was assigned to New Britain, again clearing minefields. She was paid off into reserve on 4 November 1945, but was recommissioned on 16 December, and recommenced minesweeping duties along the Australian coast. Decommissioning and fate Deloraine was paid off into reserve at Fremantle, Western Australia on 30 June 1948. She was sold for scrap to the Hong Kong Delta Shipping Company on 8 August 1956.

The river was named by William Landsborough in 1866 for Lady Diamantina Bowen (n√©e Roma), wife of Sir George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland.Diamantina History retrieved 7 May 2008 It has three major tributaries the Western River, Mayne River and Farrars Creek. Geography Rising north-west of in the Swords Range in Queensland, the river flows in a south-westerly direction through central Queensland and the Channel Country to form the Warburton River at its confluence with the Georgina River.Diamantina River, Diamantina Shire , retrieved 7 May 2008Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online retrieved 7 May 2008 In extremely wet years, the Warburton River flows as far as Lake Eyre.Floods of Lake Erie, retrieved 7 May 2008 The length of the Diamantina River is approximately , and the basin is approximately ,Australian Natural Resources Atlas retrieved 7 May 2008 of which are used for agriculture. Most of the basin of the Diamantina is very flat--even the highest points in the northeast do not reach above sea level and Lake Eyre itself is below sea level. Apart from a few streams near Winton (the largest town in the basin) almost all rivers in the basin flow southwestwards towards Birdsville. The Diamantina River has no main channel, rather it is a series of wide relatively shallow channels. The major feature of the river's sluggish course is Diamantina National Park about halfway between Winton and Birdsville. Apart from the national park, almost all land in the basin is used for grazing cattle and sheep, though numbers fluctuate greatly and considerable skill is required on the part of graziers. The variable drought and flood cycles of the area make the river ephemeral with many semi-permanent waterholes. The highest recorded flow rate of the river was at Birdsville in 1974 with was measured. The Diamantina runs along the northern and eastern rim of a roughly circular zone measuring some 130 km across that has been identified by Geoscience Australia as a crustal anomaly. Proof is currently lacking as to the cause, but it is believed likely that the anomaly was caused by an asteroid strike that happened about 300 million years ago. Environment=Climate The climate of the basin is hot and arid. In January, temperatures throughout the basin average around during the day and decline only to about at night. In winter, they typically range from during the day to at night. On occasions, however, frost has been reported in all areas of the basin: Winton has recorded minima as low as . =Precipitation= Rainfall is heavily concentrated between December and March: averages for these four months range from at Winton and Kynuna to around at Birdsville. In the rest of the year rainfall is very scanty and only on the rarest occasions are significant falls reported: throughout most of the basin the average rainfall between May and September totals around . However, the rainfall of the basin, as with all of the Lake Eyre Basin, is exceedingly erratic and catastrophic droughts and floods tend to be the normal state of affairs throughout this region. In the northern part of the basin, annual rainfalls as high as were reported in 1894, 1950, 1974 and 2000, whilst even in Birdsville annual totals as high as have been reported. During floods the river can be as wide as across. In dry years such as 1902, 1905, 1928, 1961, 1965 and 2002, almost the whole basin reported totals . There can also be significant variation from station to station over small areas: although the annual averages and variability at Winton and Kynuna are almost alike, the actual totals at the two stations can differ by as much as in some years due to isolated very heavy rainfalls. Soils The soils in the region are mainly grey and brown vertisols, with some fluvents in the drier areas. Although they do not have high phosphate contents, they have adequate levels of most other nutrients: consequently when rainfall is abundant the grasses within the basin are extremely nutritious, especially in the lower reaches of the river around Birdsville, which is a primary region for cattle fattening in years when rainfall further north is adequate to flood the region. Wildlife The floodplain of the lower reaches of the Diamantina has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it has been estimated to support at least 450,000 waterbirds when in flood, as well as globally significant numbers of the nankeen night-heron, royal spoonbill, little curlew, Australian bustard, grey grasswren, inland dotterel, cinnamon quail-thrush and pied honeyeater. History The river is ephemeral but floods periodically following heavy rainfall events in the catchment. During the floods of 1940 the mailman, Harry Ding, completed his round using a motorboat and Cooper Creek was measured at around wide. In 1950 flooding covered some , with the river described as a raging torrent wide. Karuwali (also known as Garuwali, Dieri) is a language of far western Queensland. The Karuwali language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Diamantina Shire Council, including the localities of Betoota and Haddon Corner.

Attempting to apply the principles of welfare economics gives rise to the field of public economics, the study of how government might intervene to improve social welfare. Welfare economics also provides the theoretical foundations for particular instruments of public economics, including cost‚Äìbenefit analysis, while the combination of welfare economics and insights from behavioral economics has led to the creation of a new subfield, behavioral welfare economics. The field of welfare economics is associated with two fundamental theorems. The first states that given certain assumptions, competitive markets produce (Pareto) efficient outcomes; it captures the logic of Adam Smith's invisible hand. The second states that given further restrictions, any Pareto efficient outcome can be supported as a competitive market equilibrium. Thus a social planner could use a social welfare function to pick the most equitable efficient outcome, then use lump sum transfers followed by competitive trade to bring it about. Because of welfare economics' close ties to social choice theory, Arrow's impossibility theorem is sometimes listed as a third fundamental theorem. A typical methodology begins with the derivation (or assumption) of a social welfare function, which can then be used to rank economically feasible allocations of resources in terms of the social welfare they entail. Such functions typically include measures of economic efficiency and equity, though more recent attempts to quantify social welfare have included a broader range of measures including economic freedom (as in the capability approach).  Approaches to welfare economics = Cardinal utility  The early Neoclassical approach was developed by Edgeworth, Sidgwick, Marshall, and Pigou. It assumes the following: * Utility is cardinal, that is, scale-measurable by observation or judgment. * Preferences are exogenously given and stable. * Additional consumption provides smaller and smaller increases in utility (diminishing marginal utility). * All individuals have interpersonally commensurable utility functions (an assumption that Edgeworth avoided in his Mathematical Psychics). With these assumptions, it is possible to construct a social welfare function simply by summing all the individual utility functions. Note that such a measure would still be concerned with the distribution of income (distributive efficiency) but not the distribution of final utilities. In normative terms, such authors were writing in the Benthamite tradition.  Ordinal utility  The New Welfare Economics approach is based on the work of Pareto, Hicks, and Kaldor. It explicitly recognizes the differences between the efficiency aspect of the discipline and the distribution aspect and treats them differently. Questions of efficiency are assessed with criteria such as Pareto efficiency and the Kaldor‚ÄìHicks compensation tests, while questions of income distribution are covered in social welfare function specification. Further, efficiency dispenses with cardinal measures of utility, replacing it with ordinal utility, which merely ranks commodity bundles (with an indifference-curve map, for example).  Criteria = Efficiency  Situations are considered to have distributive efficiency when goods are distributed to the people who can gain the most utility from them. Many economists use Pareto efficiency as their efficiency goal. According to this measure of social welfare, a situation is optimal only if no individuals can be made better off without making someone else worse off. This ideal state of affairs can only come about if four criteria are met: * The marginal rates of substitution in consumption are identical for all consumers. This occurs when no consumer can be made better off without making others worse off. * The marginal rate of transformation in production is identical for all products. This occurs when it is impossible to increase the production of any good without reducing the production of other goods. * The marginal resource cost is equal to the marginal revenue product for all production processes. This takes place when marginal physical product of a factor must be the same for all firms producing a good. * The marginal rates of substitution in consumption are equal to the marginal rates of transformation in production, such as where production processes must match consumer wants. There are a number of conditions that, most economists agree, may lead to inefficiency. They include: * Imperfect market structures, such as a monopoly, monopsony, oligopoly, oligopsony, and monopolistic competition. * Factor allocation inefficiencies in production theory basics. * Market failures and externalities; there is also social cost. * Price discrimination and price skimming. * Asymmetric information, principal‚Äìagent problems. * Long run declining average costs in a natural monopoly. * Certain types of taxes and tariffs. To determine whether an activity is moving the economy towards Pareto efficiency, two compensation tests have been developed. Any change usually makes some people better off while making others worse off, so these tests ask what would happen if the winners were to compensate the losers. Using the Kaldor criterion, an activity will contribute to Pareto optimality if the maximum amount the gainers are prepared to pay is greater than the minimum amount that the losers are prepared to accept. Under the Hicks criterion, an activity will contribute to Pareto optimality if the maximum amount the losers are prepared to offer to the gainers in order to prevent the change is less than the minimum amount the gainers are prepared to accept as a bribe to forgo the change. The Hicks compensation test is from the losers' point of view, while the Kaldor compensation test is from the gainers' point of view. If both conditions are satisfied, both gainers and losers will agree that the proposed activity will move the economy toward Pareto optimality. This is referred to as Kaldor‚ÄìHicks efficiency or the Scitovsky paradox. Equity There are many combinations of consumer utility, production mixes, and factor input combinations consistent with efficiency. In fact, there are an infinity of consumption and production equilibria that yield Pareto optimal results. There are as many optima as there are points on the aggregate production‚Äìpossibility frontier. Hence, Pareto efficiency is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for social welfare. Each Pareto optimum corresponds to a different income distribution in the economy. Some may involve great inequalities of income. So how do we decide which Pareto optimum is most desirable? This decision is made, either tacitly or overtly, when we specify the social welfare function. This function embodies value judgements about interpersonal utility. The social welfare function shows the relative importance of the individuals that comprise society. A utilitarian welfare function (also called a Benthamite welfare function) sums the utility of each individual in order to obtain society's overall welfare. All people are treated the same, regardless of their initial level of utility. One extra unit of utility for a starving person is not seen to be of any greater value than an extra unit of utility for a millionaire. At the other extreme is the Max-Min, or Rawlsian utility function . According to the Max-Min criterion, welfare is maximized when the utility of those society members that have the least is the greatest. No economic activity will increase social welfare unless it improves the position of the society member that is the worst off. Most economists specify social welfare functions that are intermediate between these two extremes. The social welfare function is typically translated into social indifference curves so that they can be used in the same graphic space as the other functions that they interact with. A utilitarian social indifference curve is linear and downward sloping to the right. The Max-Min social indifference curve takes the shape of two straight lines joined so as they form a 90-degree angle. A social indifference curve drawn from an intermediate social welfare function is a curve that slopes downward to the right. Image:social indifference curves small.png The intermediate form of social indifference curve can be interpreted as showing that as inequality increases, a larger improvement in the utility of relatively rich individuals is needed to compensate for the loss in utility of relatively poor individuals. A crude social welfare function can be constructed by measuring the subjective dollar value of goods and services distributed to participants in the economy (see also consumer surplus).  Fundamental theorems  The field of welfare economics is associated with two fundamental theorems. The first states that given certain assumptions, competitive markets (price equilibria with transfers, e.g. Walrasian equilibria) produce Pareto efficient outcomes. The assumptions required are generally characterised as \\"very weak\\". More specifically, the existence of competitive equilibrium implies both price-taking behaviour and complete markets, but the only additional assumption is the local non-satiation of agents' preferences ‚Äì that consumers would like, at the margin, to have slightly more of any given good. The first fundamental theorem is said to capture the logic of Adam Smith's invisible hand, though in general there is no reason to suppose that the \\"best\\" Pareto efficient point (of which there are a set) will be selected by the market without intervention, only that some such point will be. The second fundamental theorem states that given further restrictions, any Pareto efficient outcome can be supported as a competitive market equilibrium. These restrictions are stronger than for the first fundamental theorem, with convexity of preferences and production functions a sufficient but not necessary condition. A direct consequence of the second theorem is that a benevolent social planner could use a system of lump sum transfers to ensure that the \\"best\\" Pareto efficient allocation was supported as a competitive equilibrium for some set of prices. More generally, it suggests that redistribution should, if possible, be achieved without affecting prices (which should continue to reflect relative scarcity), thus ensuring that the final (post-trade) result is efficient. Put into practice, such a policy might resemble predistribution. Because of welfare economics' close ties to social choice theory, Arrow's impossibility theorem is sometimes listed as a third fundamental theorem. Social welfare maximization Utility functions can be derived from the points on a contract curve. Numerous utility functions can be derived, one for each point on the production possibility frontier (PQ in the diagram above). A social utility frontier (also called a grand utility frontier) can be obtained from the outer envelope of all these utility functions. Each point on a social utility frontier represents an efficient allocation of an economy's resources; that is, it is a Pareto optimum in factor allocation, in production, in consumption, and in the interaction of production and consumption (supply and demand). In the diagram below, the curve MN is a social utility frontier. Point D corresponds with point C from the earlier diagram. Point D is on the social utility frontier because the marginal rate of substitution at point C is equal to the marginal rate of transformation at point A. Point E corresponds with point B in the previous diagram, and lies inside the social utility frontier (indicating inefficiency) because the MRS at point C is not equal to the MRT at point A. File:Social indifference curve diagram.svg Although all the points on the grand social utility frontier are Pareto efficient, only one point identifies where social welfare is maximized. Such point is called \\"the point of bliss\\". This point is Z where the social utility frontier MN is tangent to the highest possible social indifference curve labelled SI. Criticisms Some, such as economists in the tradition of the Austrian School, doubt whether a cardinal utility function, or cardinal social welfare function, is of any value. The reason given is that it is difficult to aggregate the utilities of various people that have differing marginal utility of money, such as the wealthy and the poor. Also, the economists of the Austrian School question the relevance of Pareto optimal allocation considering situations where the framework of means and ends is not perfectly known, since neoclassical theory always assumes that the ends-means framework is perfectly defined. The value of ordinal utility functions has been questioned. Economists have proposed other means of measuring well-being as an alternative to price indices like willingness to pay using revealed or stated preference method. This includes subjective well-being functions based on individuals' ratings of their happiness or life satisfaction rather than on their preferences . Price-based measures are seen as promoting consumerism and productivism by many. It is possible to do welfare economics without the use of prices; however, this is not always done. Value assumptions explicit in the social welfare function used and implicit in the efficiency criterion chosen tend to make welfare economics a normative and perhaps subjective field. This can make it controversial. However, perhaps most significant of all are concerns about the limits of a utilitarian approach to welfare economics. According to this line of argument, utility is not the only thing that matters and so a comprehensive approach to welfare economics should include other factors. The capability approach is a theoretical framework that entails two core normative claims: first, the claim that the freedom to achieve well-being is of primary moral importance, and second, that freedom to achieve well-being is to be understood in terms of people's capabilities, that is, their real opportunities to do and be what they have reason to value.

Smoking fetishism (also known as capnolagnia) is a sexual fetish based on the pulmonary consumption (smoking) of tobacco, most often via cigarettes, cigars, and also, pipes and hookahs to some extent. As a fetish, its mechanisms regard sexual arousal from the observation or imagination of a person smoking, sometimes including oneself. Background Capnolagnia is not considered a disease but an unusual sexual practice, and many of the fetishists do not seek medical help unless this behavior strongly interferes with their daily lives. The majority of people simply learn to accept their fetish and manage to achieve gratification in an appropriate manner. A 2003 study found that the fetish was not previously the subject of academic study but had been mentioned in \\"a few newspapers\\".Ribisl KM, Lee RE, Henriksen L, Haladjian HH, \\"A content analysis of Web sites promoting smoking culture and lifestyle\\", Health Educ Behav. 2003 Feb;30(1):64-78 Causes The mannerism of the smoker, as shown here, may also elicit sexual arousal. Like any fetish, the causes and mechanisms of a smoking fetish vary widely, with roots of sexual association in early childhood and adolescence. Typical causes and hypotheses include: * aesthetics: mere attraction to, and gratification of, the visual aspect of smoke as it exits the mouth * childhood: experience or interaction with one or more attractive smoking individuals during childhood * impulsivity: perceived symbolism of an audacious or impulsivity personality, insinuating promiscuity * mannerism: masculine or feminine body language of smokers * media: early exposure to sexualized depictions of smokers, especially from advertising media, the film noir era, and pornography * persuasion: perceived power of convincing or urging another individual to smoke * psychosexual development: phenomena in the oral and phallic stages of childhood development, based on Freudian theory * sadomasochism: pleasure from infliction of bodily harm caused by smoking, often called \\"lung damage\\" * self-confidence: perceived confidence or masculinity of the smoker, regarding taboo or wealth * taboo: perceived independence or rebellion regarding the act of smoking, amongst cultural adversity to smokers * wealth: attraction to individuals who are wealthy enough to fund a cigarette or cigar habit Diagnosis The diagnostic criteria for fetishism are: * Unusual sexual fantasies, drives or behavior occur over a time span of at least six months. Sometimes unusual sexual fantasies occur and vanish by themselves; in this case any medical treatment is not necessary. * The affected person, her object or another person experience impairment or distress in multiple functional areas. Functional area refers to different aspects of life such as private social contacts, job, etc. It is sufficient for the diagnosis if one of the participants is being hurt or mistreated in any other way. People who experience one or more of the symptoms below are considered to have a smoking fetish: * Sexual interest in smoking or watching other people smoking. * Recurring intense sexual fantasies involving smoking or watching other people smoking. * Recurring intense sexual urges involving smoking or watching other people smoking.

It has since merged, in 1987, with the L5 Society founded by fans of the Space Colonization and Industrialization work of Dr. Gerard K. O'Neill, to become the present-day National Space Society. Founding In its earliest stages of formation in June 1974, NSI was first known as the \\"National Space Association\\", but was renamed from \\"Association\\" to \\"Institute\\" in April 1975. Von Braun was the NSI's first president, but shortly became chairman, with journalist and former ABC-TV 20/20 host Hugh Downs as president. Charles C. Hewitt was the first executive director. Downs later recalled the beginning of the organization: At the first annual meeting of the organization, in July 1975, von Braun said: Initial members serving on the NSI board of directors and governors were a veritable \\"Who's Who\\" list that included comedian and entertainer Bob Hope, singer/songwriter John Denver, oceanographer Jacques- Yves Cousteau, \\"Original 7\\" Project Mercury astronaut and Senator John H. Glenn, Jr., Apollo 8 astronaut Frank Borman, Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, Dr. Michael DeBakey, \\"Star Trek\\" creator Gene Roddenberry and actress Nichelle Nichols. Toward the end of 1975, von Braun commented on the state of the general public's interest in the space program. Relationship with Omni magazine After some years of publishing a newsletter that became known as INSIght, the Institute entered into an arrangement with the publishers of Omni magazine whereby all members except life members would receive that magazine as part of their membership. Omni editor Ben Bova joined the NSI board, then became vice president and finally succeeded Downs as president. He continued as president after the Omni arrangement was discontinued and an agreement was made with Palmer Publications to make their monthly general space interest magazine Space World the official NSI member magazine. When von Braun died in June 1977, Hugh Downs became Chairman of the Board and, after a time, Ben Bova assumed the presidency. After Hewitt departed in 1980, Courtney Stadd served for a period as General Manager. The Institute was then led until 1984 by executive director Dr. Mark R. Chartrand, followed by Dr. Glen P. Wilson. Merger Under Bova and Wilson, the arrangements for merger with the L5 Society were concluded, and the name change to National Space Society was announced in advance of the merger, with vague explanations to the members. Since the merger, it has been claimed that the name change took place upon the merger, but the historical record to the contrary is clear. Following the merger, Wilson was succeeded by his assistant, Lori Garver. The merged organization has continued to use the NSS name and logo after a joint membership vote was taken in 1987 to determine whether or not to change it to the \\"Space Frontier Society.\\" A more complete history of the National Space Institute is contained in a series of articles published in the November/December 1994 issue of Ad Astra, the magazine of the NSS.

In 1998, Dresser merged with its main rival Halliburton, Halliburton sold many of former Dresser non \\"oil patch\\" divisions, retaining the M W Kellogg Engineering and Construction Company and the Dresser oil-patch products and services that complemented Halliburton's energy and natural resource businesses. In 2001 Halliburton sold five separate, but somewhat related former Dresser non \\"oil patch\\" divisions, to an investment banking firm. Those five operations later took the name \\"Dresser Inc.\\" In October 2010, Dresser Inc., was acquired by General Electric. It is headquartered in Addison, Texas.\\"Contact Dresser .\\" Dresser Industries. Retrieved on January 7, 2010. History Solomon Robert Dresser invented a \\"packer\\", using rubber for a tight fit, and after taking out a patent on May 11, 1880, he began advertising and selling his product, the Dresser Cap Packer, from Bradford, Pennsylvania, in the heart of the oilfields. Dresser's packer was one of many available on the market, and it was another invention that saw a substantial expansion of the company. A flexible coupling, the Dresser Joint, that he built in 1885 to join pipes together in such a way that they would not leak natural gas. This coupling also used rubber for a tight fit, and it was so successful that it permitted for the first time the long-range transmission of natural gas from the gas fields where it was extracted to the cities which were the main gas consumers. As the natural gas industry prospered and expanded after 1900, Dresser's company grew as pipelines were built over great distances. By 1927 the company's annual sales had reached US$3.7 million and it was employing 400 workers. Public offering Following Dresser's death, his descendants decided to sell it, and in 1928 the Wall Street investment-banking firm of W. A. Harriman and Company, Inc., converted the firm into a public company by issuing 300,000 shares of stock. H. Neil Mallon was selected as president and chief executive officer; he held that position until his retirement in 1962. Under Mallon, Dresser began a program of acquisitions designed to help it survive the threat posed to its core business by the introduction of welding for joining pipes together. Starting in 1930 Dresser began acquiring companies that manufactured valves, heaters, pumps, engines and compressors and the company diversified into such products as oil derricks, blowers, drill bits, refractories, and drilling mud. Acquisitions/Divestitures In 1950, the company headquarters moved to Dallas to be near the center of the nation's major oil and gas fields. It continued to purchase well-known companies involved in manufacturing such things as overhead cranes, gasoline-dispensing pumps, and heavy equipment for mining and construction. During the 1980s, as the oil industry began to decline, Dresser's chairman, John Murphy, began to streamline the organization of the company, eliminating its insurance, mining, and construction-equipment divisions.See also \\"Initiatives In Energy, Dresser Industries, Inc., 1880-1978\\" by Darwin Payne, Simon and Schuster, New York, NY. In 1968, the Wayne Oil Tank and Pump Company, established in 1891,Dresser Wayne Celebrates Milestone With 500,000th Fuel Dispenser, National Association of Convenience Stores, 9 August 2010 (retrieved 20 August 2010) merges with Dresser, becoming the Dresser-Wayne Company.GAS PUMP COMPANY HISTORIES, Petrolian Collectibles (retrieved 20 August 2010) Dresser Industries brought together Lane-Wells and the Pan Geo Atlas Corporation (PGAC) to form Dresser Atlas. PGAC's expertise in openhole logging and its international operations made it an ideal merger partner to form an integrated wireline services company. Since its inception, Lane-Wells had generated most of its income from perforating services, but log interpretation had narrowed down producing zones, resulting in fewer perforations and less revenue. Greatly expanded wireline logging capabilities helped the combined company continue to grow. In 1974, the company acquired Galion Iron Works and the operating assets of the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company, Inc. In 1982, the company acquired International Harvester's construction equipment business. In 1984 the company acquired the earthmoving and mining product lines from American Standard's WABCO division, for a bargain price of $66.3 million. On January 1, 1987 Dresser Industries and Ingersoll-Rand merged their common businesses to form Dresser-Rand Group with headquarters in Corning, New York. The newly formed company had 10 manufacturing and testing facilities, 70 sales offices, 30 service centers and more than 7,300 employees. The partnership started as a 50-50 relationship, but later Dresser took a 51% share of the assets while Ingersoll-Rand had 49%. Komatsu Limited and Dresser Industries established Komatsu Dresser to make mining tractors, construction equipment and related equipment.Will, Oscar H. (2007) Payline: International Harvester's Construction Equipment Division MBI, St. Paul, Minnesota, page 144, This 50-50 ownership lasted from September 1988 to August 1994, when Komatsu bought out Dresser's share. By 1993, it generated sales of more than US$4 billion, and employed 31,800 people in fifty countries. The company had three major divisions: Oil Field Products and Services, Industrial Operations, and Energy Processing and Conversion Equipment. It spun off some of its manufacturing divisions, but crucially agreed to retain asbestos claims filed before the spinoff. In 1994, the company expanded through acquisitions of Wheatley TXT (a manufacturer of pumps, valves, and metering equipment) and the Baroid Corporation (an oil-services firm in Houston that had been a direct competitor). To comply with federal antitrust regulations, Dresser sold off its interest in M-I Drilling Fluids Company and Western Atlas International. Upon completion of the Baroid merger, Dresser became the third-largest oil- services company in the world. Merger with Halliburton In 1998, Dresser merged with its main rival Halliburton and became known as Halliburton Company. Dick Cheney negotiated the US$7.7 billion deal, reportedly having done so during a weekend of quail-hunting. In 2001, Halliburton was forced to settle the asbestos lawsuits that it acquired including the landmark case Bell v. Dresser Industries as a result of purchasing Dresser, causing the company's stock price to fall by eighty percent in just over a year. The ‚Ä≥New‚Ä≥ Dresser In April 2001, the Dresser division (excluding the former Kellogg division) entered an agreement to separate itself once again from Halliburton by management purchasing its equity, the new company to be called Dresser, Inc. Dresser, Inc. was a leading global multi-national owned by First Reserve Corporation and company management. In February 2011, General Electric Co. agreed to buy oil-field equipment maker Dresser Inc. for $3 billion, expanding its biggest industrial unit. GE acquired Dresser from funds managed by Riverstone Holdings LLC and First Reserve Corporation. The move significantly expanded GE's offerings for energy and industrial customers worldwide and is the latest in a series of acquisitions over the last 10 years that have transformed GE's global energy portfolio. The Dresser brand sells, services, and supports products that include: actuators, valves, meters, instruments, regulators, switches, natural gas-fueled engines, piping specialties, retail and fleet fuel dispensers, blowers, and point-of-sale systems. The Dresser brand operates in more than 60 countries with four principal business segments: Measurement and Distribution Systems, Flow Technologies, Infrastructure Solutions, and Power and Compression Systems. It retains trade names of Masoneilan, Consolidated, Becker, Mooney, ROOTS, and Wayne fuel pumps.

It existed unofficially from 1806, and was formally established by law in 1814, the first general staff in existence. It was distinguished by the formal selection of its officers by intelligence and proven merit rather than patronage or wealth, and by the exhaustive and rigorously structured training which its staff officers undertook. Its rise and development gave the German armed forces a decisive strategic advantage over their adversaries for nearly a century and a half. The Prussian General Staff also enjoyed greater freedom from political control than its contemporaries, and this autonomy was enshrined in law on the unification of Germany and the establishment of the German Empire in 1871. It came to be regarded as the home of German militarism in the aftermath of World War I, and the victors attempted to suppress the institution. It nevertheless survived to play its accustomed part in the German re-armament and World War II. In a broader sense, the Prussian General Staff corps consisted of those officers qualified to perform staff duties, and formed a unique military fraternity. Their exhaustive training was designed not only to weed out the less motivated or less able candidates, but also to produce a body of professional military experts with common methods and outlook. General Staff‚Äìqualified officers alternated between line and staff duties but remained lifelong members of this special organization. Until the end of the German Empire, social and political convention often placed members of noble or royal households in command of its armies or corps but the actual responsibility for the planning and conduct of operations lay with the formation's staff officers. For other European armies which lacked this professionally trained staff corps, the same conventions were often a recipe for disaster. Even the Army of the Second French Empire, whose senior officers had supposedly reached high rank as a result of bravery and success on the battlefield, was crushed by the Prussian and other German armies during the Franco-Prussian War in the campaigns of 1870‚Äì1871, which highlighted their poor administration and planning, and lack of professional education. The Chief of Staff of a Prussian formation in the field had the right to disagree, in writing, with the plans or orders of the commander of the formation, and appeal to the commander of the next highest formation (which might ultimately be the King, or Emperor, who would be guided by the Head of the Great General Staff). This served as a check on incompetence and also served for the objecting officer to officially disassociate himself with a flawed plan. Only the most stubborn commanders would not give way before this threat. For these reasons, Prussian and German military victories were often credited professionally to the Chief of Staff, rather than to the nominal commander of an army. Often the commander of an army was himself a member of the General Staff, but it was now institutionally recognized that not only was command leadership important, but effective staff work was a significant key to success in both pre-war planning and in wartime operations. History=Early history Before the nineteenth century, success on the battlefield largely depended on the military competence of the sovereign. Duke Frederick William introduced the term Generalstabsdienst (General Staff Service) for the Prusso-Brandenburgian army in 1640. While Frederick the Great brought success to the Prussian arms, his successors lacked his talent, so generalship in the Army declined, even though they were assisted by a Quartermaster General Staff of adjutants and engineers established by Frederick the Great. Reformers in the army began to write and lecture on the need to preserve and somehow institutionalize the military talent that Frederick had assembled in his army. They argued that a carefully assembled cadre of talented officer staff could plan logistics and train the Army in peace as well as in war. In the last years of the eighteenth century, it became the practice to assign military experts to assist the generals of Prussia's Army, largely at the instigation of comparatively junior but gifted officers such as Gerhard von Scharnhorst and August von Gneisenau. Nevertheless, such measures were insufficient to overcome the inefficiency of the Army, which was commanded by aged veterans of the campaigns of Frederick the Great, almost half a century earlier. In 1806, the Prussian Army was routed by French Armies led by Napoleon's marshals at the Battle of Jena. In the aftermath of this debacle, the Prussian Army and state largely collapsed. \\"Seldom in history has an army been reduced to impotence more swiftly or decisively.\\"Chandler 1996, p. 502. After the Peace of Tilsit in 1807, King Frederick William III appointed Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Prime Minister Baron vom und zum Stein and several promising young officers to his Military Reorganization Commission.Dupuy 1977, p. 20. This Commission acted as a general staff to plan and implement the reconstruction of the Prussian Army. They persuaded the king that to match the French commanders, who rose by merit, each Prussian commander of an Army, Corps and Division should have a staff-trained officer assigned as his Adjutant. Scharnhorst intended them to \\"support incompetent Generals, providing the talents that might otherwise be wanting among leaders and commanders\\".Boot 2006, p. 122. The unlikely pairing of the erratic but popular Field Marshal Bl√ºcher as Commander in Chief with Lieutenant General Gneisenau as his Chief of Staff showed this system to its best advantage: Bl√ºcher lauded Gneisenau for his role in maneuvering the Prussian Army during a difficult retreat through the Harz mountains. Gneisenau is recognized as the first \\"great Chief of Staff\\". He institutionalized the right of the commander's adviser to take part in command and control by advising the commander until he makes a decision. Gneisenau also founded mission tactics (Auftragstaktik), in which the commander determines the objective of an operation and allocates the forces used, while the subordinate on the spot determines how the objective will be attained.Delbr√ºck 1894 In 1816, the reformer Karl von Grolman organised the Staff into Eastern (Russia), Southern (Austria), and Western (France and the other German states) Divisions.Dupuy (1977), p. 38. Sixteen staff officers served in the Prussian Ministry of War and six staff officers worked in the main embassies. Each army corps had one Chief of Staff and two other staff officers. In 1821 the Quartermaster General Staff was renamed to the General Staff, and its officers were identified by distinctive uniform markings, including a crimson trouser stripe. Staff positions did not depend on lineage. \\"General von Krauseneck, who was the Chief of the General Staff from 1829 to 1848, was the son of a Brandenburg organ player and had been promoted from the ranks. General von Rheyer, Chief of the Prussian General Staff from 1848 to 1857 was a shepherd in his youth.\\" The General Staff continually planned for likely and unlikely scenarios. In 1843, when Europe had been largely at peace for nearly thirty years and most major nations had no plans for war, observers noted sheaves of orders at the Prussian War Ministry, already made out to cover all foreseeable contingencies and requiring only a signature and a date stamp to be put into effect. Selection and education of staff officers The Military Reorganization Commission opened military schools in K√∂nigsberg and Breslau. On 15 October 1810 Scharnhorst opened the General War School (Allgemeine Kriegsschule), on the same day that the new the University of Berlin opened nearby.Dupuy pp. 24‚Äì25, 28. The General War School trained selected officers for three years. One of its first directors was Carl von Clausewitz, who served until 1830. His monumental work On War (Vom Kriege) was published posthumously. From his studies and experiences during the Napoleonic Wars, he wrote a syllabus which became the staff's central doctrine. This standardization of doctrine which was an attempt to grasp the philosophy underlying warfare, rather than setting a narrow set of rules such as those laid down by Antoine-Henri Jomini was one of the distinguishing features of the Prussian General Staff. > Every General Staff officer had to be able, at any time, to take over the > work of another and apply to it the same body of basic ideas and the same > principles of operational and tactical thought. On October 1, 1859, the General War School was renamed the War Academy (Kriegsakademie), which was supervised by the Inspector-General of Military Education. Students at the War Academy attended about 20 hours of lectures per week. Instruction was by professors from Berlin University and officers serving on the Great General Staff, who thereby enhanced their own educations. In 1872 the War Academy was taken from the Inspector of Military Education and placed under the Chief of the General Staff. The spirit of the Academy was articulated by Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke, who emphasized the importance \\"of an active process of mental give and take between teacher and pupils, so as to stimulate the pupils to become fellow-workers\\".Wilkinson 1895, p. 160. Admission to the Academy was highly selective. Officers with at least five years service who wanted to become General Staff officers prepared themselves for the entrance examination, which included tactics, surveying, geography, mathematics and French, with questions set to test understanding rather than rote memory.Wilkinson 1895, pp. 151‚Äì152. The graders of the essays did not know the names or regiments of the candidates. From hundreds of applicants, about one hundred were accepted every year to enter the first-year course at the Academy. Those who performed satisfactorily were promoted to the second and then the third year. In the first year, fourteen hours of lectures each week were on military subjects, including military history, while seventeen hours were non-military, which included general history, mathematics, science and a choice of French or Russian. Roughly the same time allocations were used in the last two years.Wilkinson (1895), p. 162. Lectures were supplemented by visits to fortifications, arms factories and exercises of the railway regiment. During the three month summer breaks the students attended manoeuvres and were taken on field tactical exercises in which they commanded imaginary units. At the end of the course they took their second examination. Only about thirty students passed this extremely difficult test. They were then assigned (kommandiert) to the Great General Staff, while retaining their regimental attachments. After two years they took their third and final examination, after which five to eight officers were permanently posted to fill vacancies in the General Staff a remarkable winnowing from the many who had entered the competition. Occasionally, an exceptional officer was appointed without this training: for example Max Bauer, who was trained as an artilleryman, became a prominent member of the Great General Staff, with the reputation of being the smartest man in the army.Vogt 1974, p. 3. Some graduates were not enthusiastic about the first year of their training. For example, Paul von Hindenburg thought that the history of ancient battles should be minimized to give more time to modern, and that trigonometry was only useful to those who would be surveyors. The final two years satisfied him. While at the Academy he was invited into the social circle of Prince Alexander of Prussia, where he came \\"in touch with men of science as well as those in the state and court service.Hindenburg 1921, p. 66. After its defeat in the war against Prussia of 1866, Bavaria established its own War Academy and continued to train its own staff officers after the foundation of the German Empire in 1870. Size of the staff The General Staff of that time was a small, elite body, numbering as few as fifty officers and rarely exceeding one hundred officers. Only one or two officers were permanently assigned to the General Staff, described in official returns as des Generalstabs (\\"of the General Staff\\") at any time; most were attached to the General Staff while remaining affiliated to their parent regiments, usually for several years at a time, and were listed as im Generalstab (\\"on the General Staff\\"). When the General Staff was required to take the field during major campaigns, it remained a small but effective body. During the Franco- Prussian War for example, the staff that accompanied the headquarters of the King (as commander-in-chief) and was responsible for the direction of armies that totaled 850,000 men, consisted of the Chief of Staff, a Quartermaster- General and an Intendant-General whose duties were not directly concerned with military operations, three heads of departments, eleven other officers, ten draughtsmen, seven clerks and fifty-nine other ranks (orderlies, messengers, etc.).Howard 1961, pp.60‚Äì61 Nor was there ever a large pool of officers to draw upon to perform General Staff duties. In 1871, there were only 375 officers fully qualified to serve on the General Staff, even after an emergency expansion during the Franco-Prussian War. In 1914, there were 625 General Staff-qualified officers for armies which had almost doubled in size since 1871.Stone 2011, p. 29. Moltke the Elder General Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, Chief of the General Staff from 1857 to 1888 In 1857, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, a widely travelled officer who was a confidante of King William I, was appointed Chief of the General Staff. Under his control, the existing staff system was expanded and consolidated. Each year, Moltke selected the best twelve graduates from the Kriegsakademie for his personal training as General Staff officers. They attended theoretical studies, annual manoeuvres, \\"war rides\\" (a system of tactical exercises without troops in the field) under Moltke himself, and war games and map exercises known as Kriegsspiele.McElwee, p.67Howard, p.25 Although these officers subsequently alternated between regimental and staff duties, they could be relied upon to think and act exactly as Moltke had taught them when they became the Chiefs of Staff of major formations. Moltke himself referred to them as the \\"nervous system\\" of the Prussian Army. In the victories which the Prussian Army was to gain against Austrian Empire and France, Moltke needed only to issue brief directives to the main formations, leaving the staffs at the subordinate headquarters to implement the details according to the doctrines and methods he had laid down, while the Supreme Commands of his opponents became bogged down in a mountain of paperwork and trivia as they tried to control the entire army from a single overworked headquarters.McElwee, p.50 Moltke's wide experience also prompted the General Staff to consider fields of study outside the purely military, and rapidly adapt them to military use. Immediately upon his appointment, he established the Abteilung (section or department) which studied and promoted the development of railway networks within Prussia and incorporated them into its deployment plans. He also formed telegraphic, and other scientific and technical departments within the General StaffMcElwee, p. 107 and a Historical division, which analysed past and current conflicts and published accounts of them and lessons learned. The General Staff reformed by Moltke was the most effective in Europe, an autonomous institution dedicated solely to the efficient execution of war, unlike in other countries, whose staffs were often fettered by meddling courtiers, parliaments and government officials. On the contrary, the General Staff itself had a powerful effect on Prussian, and later German, politics.Wawro, pp. 283‚Äì284 =War with Denmark= The Second Schleswig War (1864), the political origins of which lay in Denmark's conflict with Prussia and Austria over the Schleswig-Holstein Question, vindicated Moltke's concepts of operations and led to an overhaul of the command arrangements of the Prussian Army. Moltke envisaged a rapid attack to prevent the Danes falling back behind water obstacles which the Prussian Navy could not overcome. A rigid system of seniority placed Friedrich Graf von Wrangel, widely regarded as being in his dotage, in command. He ignored all of Moltke's directives and his own staff's advice, and by allowing the Danish Army to withdraw at its leisure he prolonged the war for several months. The resulting post mortem was to ensure a better (though not infallible) system for appointing commanders. =Seven Weeks' War= The War between Prussia and Austria (1866) became almost inevitable after the end of hostilities with Denmark. Many Prussians regarded the war as a sad necessity. Moltke, describing his reasons for confidence to War Minister Albrecht von Roon, stated \\"We have the inestimable advantage of being able to carry our Field Army of 285,000 men over five railway lines and of virtually concentrating them in twenty-five days ... Austria has only one railway line and it will take her forty-five days to assemble 200,000 men.\\" Although there were inevitable mistakes and confusion on the battlefield, Moltke's pre-war calculations were proved correct, and the Austrian army was brought to battle at K√∂niggr√§tz and destroyed. In contrast to the Prussian staff, Austrian staff officers gained their posts either by membership of the Austrian nobility and a desire to avoid tedious regimental duties, or after uninspiring training which made them into plodding, rule-bound clerks.McElwee, pp.54, 299‚Äì300 In all aspects of preparation, planning and execution, their muddled efforts compared badly with that of their Prussian counterparts. =Prussian staff analysis and army improvements= In reviewing Prussian deficiencies against the Austrians, the General Staff made several improvements to increase the strategic and tactical proficiency of the King's army. Cavalry would no longer be held in reserve, but would actively screen the army's movements at all levels, make first contact with the enemy, and constantly observe hostile activities. Newly developed rifled artillery would no longer be placed in the rear of the order of march for employment behind the infantry; instead, a significant detachment would travel with the advanced guard of the leading corps or other major element, and the remainder would march with the front of the main body, providing immediate artillery coverage of the advanced guard on contact and of the main body during subsequent deployment on the field. A renewed emphasis was placed on maintaining contact with subordinate and superior commands, so that commanders always were informed of units' locations on the battlefield, reducing the \\"fog of war\\" effect. Finally, the introduction of the breech-loading infantry rifle marked a revolution in weapons effect, so that Moltke made the following analysis in 1865: > The attack of a position is becoming notably more difficult than its > defense. The defensive during the first phase of battle offers a decisive > superiority. The task of a skillful offensive will consist of forcing our > foe to attack a position chosen by us, and only when casualties, > demoralization, and exhaustion have drained his strength will we ourselves > take up the tactical offensive.... Our strategy must be offensive, our > tactics defensive.Dupuy, pp. 88‚Äì92 =Franco-Prussian War= The government of Napoleon III was undoubtedly startled by the Prussian victory over Austria, and urgently sought to reform their army to face the conflict with Prussia which seemed inevitable and imminent. Their senior officers entirely failed to grasp the methods of the Prussian General Staff. The Chief of Staff of the French Army, Marechal Edmond Leboeuf, fatuously stated in 1870 that the French Army was ready for war, \\"down to the last gaiter button.\\" In the event, at the outset of the Franco- Prussian War, 462,000 German soldiers concentrated flawlessly on the French frontier while only 270,000 French soldiers could be moved to face them, the French army having lost 100,000 stragglers before a shot was fired through poor planning and administration. (Most of these were reservists who had not been able to join their units before the units were hastily dispatched to join the armies forming up near the frontier.)McElwee, p. 46 During the war, there were again the inevitable mistakes due to the \\"fog of war\\", but German formations moved with a speed and precision which French staff officers, accustomed only to moving battalion-sized punitive columns, could not match. In the French (and British) armies of the time, there was an anti-intellectual prejudice in favour of brave and unimaginative regimental officers over intelligent and well-trained staff officers. The French Army paid dearly for this bias in 1870 and 1871. The end result of strategic preparation by Moltke and diplomatic overtures by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was the unification of all the independent German states and the creation of a German Empire under Prussian control. King Wilhelm I was proclaimed \\"German Emperor\\" on 18 January 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles following the Prussian victory. This victory surprised many military professionals around the world, since France had been considered a great military power, while Prussia was widely considered a lesser power, despite its military successes under Friedrich Wilhelm III, in 1813‚Äì15 over Napoleon, and more recently over Austria during the Seven Weeks' War of 1866.Dupuy, pp. 77‚Äì88 Most states hastened to adopt Prussian staff methods and structures, with mixed success.Dupuy, pp. 113‚Äì114 Concurrently, Moltke pushed for reassessment and self-improvement of Prussian military units to maintain tactical superiority relative to other nations' units, formalising the concept of Auftragstaktik or mission-oriented tactics, to promote initiative as a well-defined leadership doctrine at all levels of command. In every Prussian tactical manual published after the Franco-Prussian War was written: > A favorable situation will never be exploited if commanders wait for orders. > The highest commander and the youngest soldier must always be conscious of > the fact that omission and inactivity are worse than resorting to the wrong > expedient.Dupuy, p. 116 From unification to World War I William II with his generals With unification the Prussian General Staff became the Imperial German General Staff, with seconded general staff officers from Saxony, W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria, and was responsible for military planning for the German Empire. They began preparing for what seemed to be another inevitable war with France, which was intent on revenge and recovery of the provinces annexed by Germany. Bismarck's diplomatic skill had prevented any hostile European coalition forming against Germany, but the young Kaiser William II replaced him in 1890 and turned away from their friendly accommodation with Russia in favor of an alliance with Austria-Hungary. Before long France and Russia allied. Therefore, encircled Germany faced the possibility of war on both Eastern and Western fronts. To meet this threat, Chief of Staff Alfred von Schlieffen and his successor, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, drew up and continually refined the Schlieffen Plan to meet this eventuality.Zuber (1911), passim The Plan committed Germany to an early offensive against France while Russia was still mobilising and also required the invasion of neutral Belgium. In Bismarck's German constitution the kaiser commanded the army and also appointed the chancellor and his cabinet, who had no control of the military. The elected representatives in the Reichstag were needed to pass budgets, but aside from this had no power over the conduct of the government. This was one of the seeds of the mass destruction of the First World War, as military planning was not subject to political control. Thus, the Schlieffen Plan was adopted without political input, even though it required the violation of the neutrality of Belgium, which the Germans had guaranteed by treaty. Nor was the German Navy's high command informed. It failed to take adequate account of logistics and the inability of horse-drawn transport to supply troops far from rail-heads.van Creveld 1977, pp. 109‚Äì141. The plan has been accused of being too rigid. The philosopher Manuel de Landa argues that the Prussian army now favored the Jominian theory, which gave preeminence to the Army and to its autonomy, compared to the civilian control advocated by Clausewitz.Landa 1991. To an extent, the General Staff became obsessed with perfecting the methods which had gained victory in the late nineteenth century. Although he maintained an icy formal demeanor, Moltke the Elder had been a flexible and innovative thinker in many fields. Schlieffen, by comparison, was a single- minded, brilliant military specialist. Nor had the General Staff, before the war, considered the use of potential allies such as Turkey, or dissident factions within the French, British and Russian empires, to distract or weaken the Allied war effort. \\"A swift victory over the main armies in the main theatre of war was the German General Staff's solution for all outside difficulties, and absolved them from thinking of war in its wider aspects.\\" Liddell Hart 1930, p. 45. The General Staff mistakenly predicted that China would win the First Sino-Japanese War.Fairbank et.al. 1978. =Organization= The General Staff was divided between the central Gro√üer Generalstab in Berlin and the general staffs of the corps and division HQs. The head of the Gro√üer Generalstab was the \\"Chief of the General Staff\\" and was also the technical superior of all general staff officers. The Chief of the General Staff's chief deputy held the title of Generalquartiermeister. Beneath them were the five Oberquartiermeisters, who supervised the heads of the General Staff departments. The Railroad Department had the largest number of officers assigned, while the Second Department was the most important.Zabecki, p. 7 * Chief of the General Staff ** Central Department ** 6th Department: Annual Maneuver ** Military History Department II: Older wars * Oberquartiermeister I ** 2nd Department: Operations ** Railroad Department ** 4th Department: Foreign Fortifications * Oberquartiermeister II ** 3rd Department: France and Great Britain ** 9th Department: Netherland, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, German Colonies * Oberquartiermeister III ** 5th Department: Operational studies ** 8th Department: Kriegsakademie * Oberquartiermeister IV ** 1st Department: Scandinavia, Russia, Turkey ** 10th Department: Austria-Hungary and the Balkans * Oberquartiermeister V ** Military History Department I: Recent wars ** Archives and Library World War I The German General Staff in Kassel, November 1918 In August 1914, following the pre-war mobilization plan, most of the General Staff, including the Oberquartiermeisters, were reassigned to the headquarters of the Armies and Corps. The remaining core became the \\"General Staff of the Field Army\\", part of the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, Supreme Army Command). The General Staff was streamlined into only three departments; Operations, Intelligence and Political Affairs. The need for the system was promptly demonstrated when Supreme Commander Kaiser Wilhelm II proposed to concentrate against Russia, not France. Chief of the General Staff Helmuth von Moltke the Younger and Generalquartiermeister, Hermann von Stein convinced him that this was unthinkable because the thousands of orders could be quickly rewritten and because the French with their quicker mobilization and excellent railways would be attacking a German border in force long before the Russians. One of the eight German Armies was commanded by Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, paired with Konstantin Schmidt von Knobelsdorf, a senior general staff officer the kaiser instructed his thirty-two-year-old son: \\"whatever he advises you must do\\".Jonas 1961, p. 92 The system also removed uncertainty about the competence of Army Commanders Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria and Albrecht, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, though both were well-trained soldiers. Other armies were commanded by highly experienced staff officers, for example Paul von Hindenburg was given command of the Eighth Army, the only one facing the Russians invading East Prussia, with Erich Ludendorff as chief of staff. The interactions between a commander and his chief of staff were elucidated by a successful practitioner of both roles, Hans von Seeckt > The decision is taken in private, and when the two men come out, there is > only one decision. They have amalgamated it; they share one mind with each > other. Should the opinions have differed, in the evening of this happy day > in a military marriage the two halves will no longer know who gave in. The > outside world and military history will not have knowledge of a domestic > quarrel. The competence of command and control is based on this fusion of > the two personalities. It does not matter if the order bears the commander's > signature, or if the Chief of Staff has signed it for the High Command > (today 'For the commander') according to our old custom. The commander > always issues his orders through his Chief of Staff, and even the most > senior subordinate leader must submit himself to his orders without > objection, because his orders will always be given on behalf of the supreme > commander.Seeckt 1929, p. 163. The Schlieffen Plan was scuttled when the shaken Moltke ordered the German right wing in France to retire during the First Battle of the Marne.Herwig 2009 Soon Moltke was replaced by Erich von Falkenhayn who was already the Prussian war minister. After failing to dislodge the Entente in Flanders, he put the Western Front on the defensive. He was replaced at the war ministry in early 1915, and in 1916 Hindenburg and Ludendorff took over as advisers to the supreme commander. They led OHL in aggressively intervening in German political and economic life, changing the original goal of defending Germany's borders to conquest and expansion. A consequence of wartime attrition was the premature deployment of Kriegsakademie students to army and corps general staffs, some of them before reaching their second year curriculum. Later, standards for General Staff assignment were altered due to the closure of the Kriegsakademie, to allow examined officers to serve as staff apprentices, raising concerns that these new General Staff Corps officers were not evaluated or trained at the level of those they were replacing.Dupuy 1977, pp. 186‚Äì187. Superior German staff work at division, corps and army level throughout the war was a major contributor to their run of successes. At the beginning of 1918 having defeated the Russians Hindenburg and Ludendorff resolved to win in the west. Tactically, their staff work was brilliant. Using only weapons that had failed at Verdun, they devised a long, comprehensive list of measures to smash through enemy field fortifications, which were then taught to all ranks in the attacking units. The German Army had tactical success during the Spring Offensive, but the Allies held strategic points. They were sure that a series of successful breakthroughs would snap their enemy's resolve, ignoring the fact that each victory sapped German strength, while their foes were continually strengthened by Americans flooding into France. The Germans were overwhelmed during the Hundred Days Offensive, and eventually agreed to an Armistice of 11 November 1918 with the Allies. Interwar period The victors' fear was encapsulated by the clause in the Treaty of Versailles: \\"The Great German General Staff and all similar organisations shall be dissolved and may not be reconstituted in any form.\\"en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles/Part_V#Article_160 The German Army was permitted to have only 4,000 officers. The Weimar Republics army, the Reichswehr, was led by Hans von Seeckt. He camouflaged the general staff by renaming it the Truppenamt (\\"troop office\\"), and selected many general staff officers to fill the available places. The War Academy (Kriegsakademie) was abolished, but training of general staff officers continued, dispersed among the Wehrkreise (Military District) headquarters but overseen by tutors from the Truppenamt.Stone 2011, pp.48‚Äì49. General staff officers continued to play major roles in the nation, most strikingly when former chief of staff Paul von Hindenburg was elected president in 1925. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor in 1933, he instructed the Truppenamt/General Staff to ignore the Versailles restrictions, he would create a greatly expanded Wehrmacht from the army, navy, and air-force. A new War Academy (Kriegsakademie) was established in 1935. The General Staff advised Hitler that the German Army could not be fully modernized until 1944 or 1945. When Hitler went to war in 1939 the tank columns were still followed by horse-drawn artillery pieces. Throughout the war German industry was unable to furnish small arms in sufficient quantities, forcing the Army to rely heavily on older weapons, prizes of war, and adaptations of former designs produced in conquered countries, thus producing an arsenal filled with an array of incompatible pieces, unlike the smaller number of standard small arms used by the Allies. Initially the Army's leaders feared that their leading role as the defenders of Germany would be challenged by the unruly SA, the Nazi party's political militia. When Hitler suppressed the SA in the Night of the Long Knives, the army stood aside and effectually acquiesced in the extrajudicial murders involved, including those of army officers.Stone 2011, pp. 61‚Äì65 While the General Staff welcomed Hitler's expansion of the army, they were opposed to many of his wilder schemes and continually urged caution. When several of Hitler's early moves such as the Occupation of the Rhineland, the Anschluss with Austria and the occupation of the Sudetenland succeeded despite advice from the General Staff that these might bring about a premature war with France and Britain, Hitler was further convinced that his intuition was superior to the General Staff's intellectual analysis. When Hindenburg died, the Army replaced their oath to the constitution with one to the F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler. Hitler was soon able to curtail the Army's traditional independence, by the fortuitous disgrace of the commander in chief of the armed forces, Werner von Blomberg, and false accusations of homosexuality against the commander in chief of the army, Werner von Fritsch. (The combined scandals were known as the Blomberg-Fritsch Affair.) The armed forces command structure was changed by Hitler in 1938, with an Armed Forces HQ (the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, usually contracted to OKW) placed over the army command (Oberkommando des Heeres or OKH) and the other service commands and almost entirely displacing the Reich War Ministry.Stone 2011, pp.76‚Äì77 However, OKW from its inception had generally weaker, more pliant staff officers than OKH and the Luftwaffe. A weakness of both the Kriegsakademie curriculum and General Staff doctrine was that it focused primarily on tactical and operational matters. There was no institution comparable to the United States National War College or the British Imperial Defence College where higher- ranking officers of all services could study wider economic, political and diplomatic issues related to broad strategy. Since commanders were no longer selected by pedigree, the chiefs of staff were no longer joint commanders. Their role was > The commander must be supported by obedient, independent and critical > advising General Staff officers (Fuehrergehilfen). They provide him with > information and advice, prepare decisions, turn them into orders and > measures and supervise their execution. If necessary, they urge the > commander to decide and act. Their thinking and actions must be guided by > his will and intentions and must be determined by his decisions and orders. World War II Towards the end of the War of 1914 to 1918, the General Staff had almost wholly usurped the political power of the state. At the beginning of World War II, by contrast, its influence was less than it had been at the outset of the First World War and actually declined during the war. In part this was due to the increasing pre-eminence of the other branches of the German armed forces, in particular of the Luftwaffe. The commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, Hitler's friend and political colleague Hermann G√∂ring, always had personal influence with Hitler which no Army leader had. Another was the increasing tension between OKH and OKW. While the need for a joint headquarters to coordinate the work of all the services was desirable in theory, for example to determine industrial and manpower priorities and avoid duplication of effort, OKW was increasingly used as an alternate Army planning staff by Hitler. At the same time, OKW failed in its task of overseeing the overall war effort, resulting in wasteful diversion of resources to several competing and unregulated forces (such as the SS) responsible only to themselves or to Hitler alone.Stone, pp.350‚Äì351 After 1941, OKH was largely responsible for operations on the Eastern Front only (and administration of the army as a whole), while OKW directed operations on the other fronts. There were now effectively two general staffs, often competing with each other, with arbitration of all disputes in the hands of Hitler, further increasing his personal power. Finally, in late 1941, Hitler dismissed Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, the commander in chief of the Army, and assumed direct command of the Army himself. From this time onwards, neither OKW nor OKH could independently plan or conduct operations, but merely implemented Hitler's often flawed commands.Stone, pp.228‚Äì229 At a lower level, training of General Staff officers continued, but the course was still almost as long, intense, and exclusive as in peacetime.Stone, pp.314‚Äì315 Properly-trained staff officers became increasingly scarce, and in some cases newly qualified staff officers lacked the dedication or moral courage of their predecessors.Stone, p.316 =20 July plot= Before and during the early part of the war, some General Staff officers, notably the Chief, Franz Halder, considered a coup d'√©tat to remove Hitler from power, and avoid what they believed would be a disastrous and premature war. They planned a coup as response to Hitler ordering war on Czechoslovakia to seize the Sudetenland, when Britain and France were opposed. But France and Britain capitulated at Munich, which removed the danger of war and justified Hitler's policy; the dissidents let the matter drop.Stone, pp.108‚Äì112 In November 1939, Halder, still fearing the war would end in disaster, discussed a coup with Army C-in-C von Brauchitsch and Carl Goerdeler of the Schwarze Kapelle, but finally decided Hitler was untouchable until Germany met a \\"setback\\". Opposition to Hitler nevertheless continued, including among the General Staff officers of the Ersatzheer (\\"Replacement Army\\"), which had charge of all new troops being organized in Germany for the field army. They set up Operation Valkyrie, in which Ersatzheer detachments would take control of Germany. On 20 July 1944, the conspirators tried to kill Hitler, thought they had succeeded, and initiated Valkyrie. But most line officers and the bulk of the General Staff refused to obey the Valkyrie plotters; when Hitler was known to be alive, the coup collapsed entirely. However, many General Staff officers were clearly implicated in the plot, and the General Staff was revealed as a center of dissent. In the months after 20 July, several dozen General Staff officers were arrested and in most cases executed. Also, Luftwaffe, SS, or \\"National Socialist Leadership Officers\\" were appointed to positions normally occupied by General Staff officers in new or rebuilt formations.Stone, pp.301‚Äì310 Bundeswehr On May 15, 1957, the first Chief of Staff of the Bundeswehr, General Heusinger, spoke at the opening of the new Army Academy (Heeresakademie), pointing out that General Staff officers are \\"the defenders and guardians of the values of German military tradition\\", extending back 147 years. German students are admitted to the Army Academy after studying at a Federal Armed Forces University (Universit√§t der Bundeswehr) in Hamburg or Munich, followed by several years of line duty. Officers from other NATO countries are their classmates. The Academy also teaches a 10-month Army General Staff Officer Course for officers from non-NATO countries. In the Bundeswehr there are General Staff officers, but no General Staff officer branch or corps. The Chief of Staff of the Federal Armed Forces is the supreme military representative of the Bundeswehr and the principal military adviser to the Government. In the event of war the Federal Republic of Germany is the only NATO country which immediately relinquishes operational command over all combat units of her armed forces to NATO commanders. Hence the Bundeswehr does no operational defense planning, which was the classic task of former German General Staffs. Therefore, the role of the General Staff officer is as the adviser to an operational commander, \\"his main task is to advise his commander in all matters, and he is entitled to the commander's attention\\". Most General Staff officers are graduates of the Federal Armed Forces Command and General Staff Academy (F√ºhrungsakademie) in Hamburg. General Staff officers are rotated through line commands to keep them familiar with everyday unit problems. General Staff officers are identified by crimson facings on their uniforms and by inserting \\"i. G.\\" (im Generalstabsdienst) after their rank. Less than four per cent of officers are members of the General Staff. There are five General Staff officers in each Bundeswehr division. At the headquarters of Allied Forces Central Europe in Brunssum Netherlands there are roughly one hundred German officers, but only seventeen are General Staff officers. The Bundeswehr retains the German army's tradition of mission- oriented command and control (Auftragstaktik). Moreover, \\"lower-rank officers are frequently superiors of higher-rank officers\\".

They are observed in the atmospheres and oceans of planets owing to the rotation of the planet. Atmospheric Rossby waves on Earth are giant meanders in high-altitude winds that have a major influence on weather. These waves are associated with pressure systems and the jet stream. Oceanic Rossby waves move along the thermocline: the boundary between the warm upper layer and the cold deeper part of the ocean. Rossby wave types=Atmospheric waves Meanders of the northern hemisphere's jet stream developing (a, b) and finally detaching a \\"drop\\" of cold air (c). Orange: warmer masses of air; pink: jet stream; blue: colder masses of air. Atmospheric Rossby waves result from the conservation of potential vorticity and are influenced by the Coriolis force and pressure gradient. The rotation causes fluids to turn to the right as they move in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. For example, a fluid that moves from the equator toward the north pole will deviate toward the east; a fluid moving toward the equator from the north will deviate toward the west. These deviations are caused by the Coriolis force and conservation of potential vorticity which leads to changes of relative vorticity. This is analogous to conservation of angular momentum in mechanics. In planetary atmospheres, including Earth, Rossby waves are due to the variation in the Coriolis effect with latitude. Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby first identified such waves in the Earth's atmosphere in 1939 and went on to explain their motion. One can identify a terrestrial Rossby wave as its phase velocity, marked by its wave crest, always has a westward component. However, the collected set of Rossby waves may appear to move in either direction with what is known as its group velocity. In general, shorter waves have an eastward group velocity and long waves a westward group velocity. The terms \\"barotropic\\" and \\"baroclinic\\" are used to distinguish the vertical structure of Rossby waves. Barotropic Rossby waves do not vary in the vertical, and have the fastest propagation speeds. The baroclinic wave modes, on the other hand, do vary in the vertical. They are also slower, with speeds of only a few centimeters per second or less. Most investigations of Rossby waves have been done on those in Earth's atmosphere. Rossby waves in the Earth's atmosphere are easy to observe as (usually 4-6) large-scale meanders of the jet stream. When these deviations become very pronounced, masses of cold or warm air detach, and become low- strength cyclones and anticyclones, respectively, and are responsible for day- to-day weather patterns at mid-latitudes. The action of Rossby waves partially explains why eastern continental edges in the Northern Hemisphere, such as the Northeast United States and Eastern Canada, are colder than Western Europe at the same latitudes. =Poleward-propagating atmospheric waves= Deep convection (heat transfer) to the troposphere is enhanced over very warm sea surfaces in the tropics, such as during El Ni√±o events. This tropical forcing generates atmospheric Rossby waves that have a poleward and eastward migration. Poleward-propagating Rossby waves explain many of the observed statistical connections between low- and high-latitude climates. One such phenomenon is sudden stratospheric warming. Poleward-propagating Rossby waves are an important and unambiguous part of the variability in the Northern Hemisphere, as expressed in the Pacific North America pattern. Similar mechanisms apply in the Southern Hemisphere and partly explain the strong variability in the Amundsen Sea region of Antarctica. In 2011, a Nature Geoscience study using general circulation models linked Pacific Rossby waves generated by increasing central tropical Pacific temperatures to warming of the Amundsen Sea region, leading to winter and spring continental warming of Ellsworth Land and Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica via an increase in advection. =Rossby waves on other planets= Atmospheric Rossby waves, like Kelvin waves, can occur on any rotating planet with an atmosphere. The Y-shaped cloud feature on Venus is attributed to Kelvin and Rossby waves.Curt Covey and Gerald Schubert, \\"Planetary-Scale Waves in the Venus Atmosphere\\", Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, American Meteorological Society, Vol 39, No. 11, 1982. DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1982)039<2397:PSWITV>2.0.CO;2 Oceanic waves Oceanic Rossby waves are large-scale waves within an ocean basin. They have a low amplitude, in the order of centimetres (at the surface) to metres (at the thermocline), compared with atmospheric Rossby waves which are in the order of hundreds of kilometres. They may take months to cross an ocean basin. They gain momentum from wind stress at the ocean surface layer and are thought to communicate climatic changes due to variability in forcing, due to both the wind and buoyancy. Both barotropic and baroclinic waves cause variations of the sea surface height, although the length of the waves made them difficult to detect until the advent of satellite altimetry. Satellite observations have confirmed the existence of oceanic Rossby waves. Baroclinic waves also generate significant displacements of the oceanic thermocline, often of tens of meters. Satellite observations have revealed the stately progression of Rossby waves across all the ocean basins, particularly at low- and mid-latitudes. These waves can take months or even years to cross a basin like the Pacific. Rossby waves have been suggested as an important mechanism to account for the heating of the ocean on Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Waves in astrophysical discs Rossby wave instabilities are also thought to be found in astrophysical discs, for example, around newly forming stars.Lovelace, R.V.E., Li, H., Colgate, S.A., \\\\& Nelson, A.F. 1999, \\"Rossby Wave Instability of Keplerian Accretion Disks\\", ApJ, 513, 805-810,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9809321Li, H., Finn, J.M., Lovelace, R.V.E., \\\\& Colgate, S.A. 2000, \`\`Rossby Wave Instability of Thin Accretion Disks. II. Detailed Linear Theory, ApJ, 533, 1023‚Äì1034, https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9907279  Amplification of Rossby waves  It has been proposed that a number of regional weather extremes in the Northern Hemisphere associated with blocked atmospheric circulation patterns may have been caused by quasiresonant amplification of Rossby waves. Examples include the 2013 European floods, the 2012 China floods, the 2010 Russian heat wave, the 2010 Pakistan floods and the 2003 European heat wave. Even taking global warming into account, the 2003 heat wave would have been highly unlikely without such a mechanism. Normally freely travelling synoptic-scale Rossby waves and quasistationary planetary-scale Rossby waves exist in the mid- latitudes with only weak interactions. The hypothesis, proposed by Vladimir Petoukhov, Stefan Rahmstorf, Stefan Petri, and Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, is that under some circumstances these waves interact to produce the static pattern. For this to happen, they suggest, the zonal (east-west) wave number of both types of wave should be in the range 6‚Äì8, the synoptic waves should be arrested within the troposphere (so that energy does not escape to the stratosphere) and mid-latitude waveguides should trap the quasistationary components of the synoptic waves. In this case the planetary-scale waves may respond unusually strongly to orography and thermal sources and sinks because of \\"quasiresonance\\". A 2017 study by Mann, Rahmstorf, et al. connected the phenomenon of manmade Arctic amplification to planetary wave resonance and extreme weather events. Mathematical definitions=Free barotropic Rossby waves under a zonal flow with linearized vorticity equation To start with, a zonal mean flow, U, can be considered to be perturbed where U is constant in time and space. Let \\\\vec{u} = \\\\langle u, v\\\\rangle be the total horizontal wind field, where u and v are the components of the wind in the x- and y- directions, respectively. The total wind field can be written as a mean flow, U, with a small superimposed perturbation, u‚Ä≤ and v‚Ä≤. : u = U + u'(t,x,y)! : v = v'(t,x,y)! The perturbation is assumed to be much smaller than the mean zonal flow. : U \\\\gg u',v'! Relative vorticity Œ∑, u and v can be written in terms of the stream function \\\\psi (assuming non-divergent flow, for which the stream function completely describes the flow): : \\\\begin{align} u' & = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial y} [5pt] v' & = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial x} [5pt] \\\\eta & = abla \\\\times (u' \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\imath}}} + v' \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\jmath}}}) = - abla^2 \\\\psi \\\\end{align} Considering a parcel of air that has no relative vorticity before perturbation (uniform U has no vorticity) but with planetary vorticity f as a function of the latitude, perturbation will lead to a slight change of latitude, so the perturbed relative vorticity must change in order to conserve potential vorticity. Also the above approximation U >> u' ensures that the perturbation flow does not advect relative vorticity. :\\\\frac{d (\\\\eta + f) }{dt} = 0 = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\eta}{\\\\partial t} + U \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\eta}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\beta v' with \\\\beta = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y} . Plug in the definition of stream function to obtain: : 0 = \\\\frac{\\\\partial abla^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} + U \\\\frac{\\\\partial abla^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\beta \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial x} Using the method of undetermined coefficients one can consider a traveling wave solution with zonal and meridional wavenumbers k and ‚Ñì, respectively, and frequency \\\\omega: :\\\\psi = \\\\psi_0 e^{i(kx+\\\\ell y-\\\\omega t)}! This yields the dispersion relation: : \\\\omega = Uk - \\\\beta \\\\frac k {k^2+\\\\ell^2} The zonal (x-direction) phase speed and group velocity of the Rossby wave are then given by : \\\\begin{align} c & \\\\equiv \\\\frac \\\\omega k = U - \\\\frac \\\\beta {k^2+\\\\ell^2}, [5pt] c_g & \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\omega}{\\\\partial k}\\\\ = U - \\\\frac{\\\\beta (\\\\ell^2-k^2)}{(k^2+\\\\ell^2)^2}, \\\\end{align} where c is the phase speed, cg is the group speed, U is the mean westerly flow, \\\\beta is the Rossby parameter, k is the zonal wavenumber, and ‚Ñì is the meridional wavenumber. It is noted that the zonal phase speed of Rossby waves is always westward (traveling east to west) relative to mean flow U, but the zonal group speed of Rossby waves can be eastward or westward depending on wavenumber. Meaning of beta The Rossby parameter is defined: :\\\\beta = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y} = \\\\frac 1 a \\\\frac d {d\\\\varphi} (2 \\\\omega \\\\sin\\\\varphi) = \\\\frac{2\\\\omega \\\\cos\\\\varphi} a \\\\varphi is the latitude, œâ is the angular speed of the Earth's rotation, and a is the mean radius of the Earth. If \\\\beta = 0, there will be no Rossby Waves; Rossby Waves owe their origin to the gradient of the tangential speed of the planetary rotation (planetary vorticity). A \\"cylinder\\" planet has no Rossby Waves. It also means that at the equator of any rotating, sphere-like planet, including Earth, one will still have Rossby Waves, despite the fact that f = 0, because \\\\beta > 0. (Equatorial Rossby wave).

As a tumor grows, it rapidly outgrows its blood supply, leaving portions of the tumor with regions where the oxygen concentration is significantly lower than in healthy tissues. Hypoxic microenvironements in solid tumors are a result of available oxygen being consumed within 70 to 150 Œºm of tumour vasculature by rapidly proliferating tumor cells thus limiting the amount of oxygen available to diffuse further into the tumor tissue. In order to support continuous growth and proliferation in challenging hypoxic environments, cancer cells are found to alter their metabolism. Furthermore, hypoxia is known to change cell behavior and is associated with extracellular matrix remodeling and increased migratory and metastatic behavior. Changes in the glycolytic pathway A particular change in metabolism, historically known as the Warburg effect results in high rates of glycolysis in both normoxic and hypoxic cancer cells. Expression of genes responsible for glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters are enhanced by numerous oncogenes including RAS, SRC, and MYC. HIF-1 induced changes in gene expression HIF regulates interactions of cancer cells with ECM and ECM biosynthesis Traditionally, hypoxia leads to increased production of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), containing HIF-1Œ± and HIF-1Œ≤ subunits, that acts as a key regulatory transcription factor responsible for adaptive cellular changes. In humans, HIF-1 has been shown to up-regulate expression of genes affecting a range of target areas of physiology. These genes range from those involved in triggering an inflammatory response to those responsible for iron metabolism. Particularly notable when focusing on metabolism, HIF-1 is shown to affect glycolytic genes to cope with reductions in oxygen availability and consumption. These genes include: solute carrier family 2 (GLUT1), hexokinase (HK), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), phosphofructokinase (PFKL), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDO), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), enolase 1 (ENOA), pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 1 (PDK1) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A). In addition to alterations in oxygen concentration associated with hypoxic microenvironments, glucose concentration gradients found in tumors also influence the rate of aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis. A carbohydrate-response element (ChoRE) is responsible for regulating glycolytic enzyme gene expression in response to changing glucose concentrations through a binding interaction at the same consensus sequence as HIF-1. Interactions of HIF-1 and ChoRE with the DNA sequence 5‚Äô-RCGTG-3‚Äô leads to increased expression of genes listed above. GLUT1 transporter expression GLUT1 Glucose Transporter GLUT1 is a member of the GLUT transporter family of 14 hexose transporters responsible for facilitating the transport of hexose sugars along the concentration gradient. GLUT1 is the most abundantly expressed of the family thought to maintain basal glucose transport in almost all cell types. GLUT1 levels, in response to hypoxic conditions, have been shown to increase with changes at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, transport of GLUT1 has been shown to increase under these hypoxic conditions. With the role of transporting sugars from the extracellular to the intracellular environment, GLUT1, along with other members of the GLUT family, can be rate-controlling for cellular glycolytic metabolism. Having an increased level of GLUT1, in the case of hypoxic tumors, increases the flux of glucose into the cells allowing for a higher rate of glycolysis and thus greater risks of metastasis (as elaborated upon below). Hexokinase 2 expression Hexokinase (HK) is the first enzyme in the glycolytic pathway converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate through an ATP-dependent phosphorylation event. Important for glycolysis to proceed, the hexokinase reaction activates glucose for subsequent steps. In hypoxic tumors, hexokinase mRNA abundance is significantly increased as well as protein levels.Yasuda, Seiichi, et al. \\"Hexokinase II and VEGF expression in liver tumors: correlation with hypoxia-inducible factor-1Œ± and its significance.\\" Journal of Hepatology 40.1 (2004): 117-123. Increased expression of hexokinase 2, in some cases nearly 10-fold, allows for an increased flux of glucose through the glycolytic pathway subsequent to the increased uptake by GLUT1.< Phosphoglucose isomerase expression Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is a housekeeping cytosolic enzyme with roles in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. It is responsible for catalyzing the interconversion of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. Extracellularly, PGI is known as an autocrine motility factor (AMF) eliciting mitogenic, motogenic, differentiation functions as well as tumor progression and metastasis. Activation of PGI through proposed HIF-1 induced mechanisms results in increased conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and also contributes to cell motility and invasion during cancer metastasis. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatases expression Regulatory pathway of PFK-1 by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinases/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFBs) belong to a family of bifunctional ATP-dependent enzymes responsible for controlling the level of glycolysis intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. HIF-1-induced expression of these enzymes (PFK-2/FBPase-2) subsequently alters the balance of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate which plays an important role as an allosteric activator of phospho-fructokinase 1 (PFK-1). PFK-1 is an enzyme that controls one of the most critical steps of glycolysis. Regulation of PFK-1 is also mediated by the cellular energy status in result of ATP's inhibitory effect. Greater quantities of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in cancer cells, in result of HIF-1 expression of PFK-2/FBPase-2, thus activates PFK-1allowing for an increased glycolytic flux converting fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Allosteric regulation of glycolysis by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate allows cancer cells to maintain a glycolytic balance to match their bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands.  Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase expression  Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDO) belongs to a family include aldolase A, B and C. Unique in glycolysis, aldolase enzymes cleave fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two 3-C molecules including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). With the HIF-1 mediated expression of aldolase A under hypoxic conditions, the catalysis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate is increased thus leading to increased glycolytic flux. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression The glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is responsible for the oxidative conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GADP) to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG). Up- regulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression is maximal (4-5 fold) following hypoxic conditions of ~24 hours in vascular endothelial cells. Various models for the exact glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activation mechanisms have been proposed. Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 expression Hypoxia has been shown to induce a 10-fold accumulation of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK-1) mRNA in mouse hepatoma (Hepa 1c1c7) cells. Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 is an enzyme involved in the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-P-G) leading the production of ATP from ADP. Induction of gene expression by HIF-1 is thought to be dependent on the presence of aromatic hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT1). Arnt's N-terminal region and HIF-1 are thought to work together to induce transcription of phosphoglycerate kinase 1. Phosphoglycerate mutase expression Phosphoglycerate mutase B (PGM-B) is one of the latter glycolytic enzymes responsible for the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG). Both protein and mRNA levels were shown to increase 2-3-fold in research exposing fetal rat lung fibroblasts to hypoxic conditions. Increased levels appeared to be regulated at the transcriptional level as per many of the other glycolytic enzymes. Maximum up regulation was shown following 16 hours thus supporting its role in contributing to an increased glycolytic flux for adaption of cells to hypoxia. Enolase 1 expression Enolase 1, also known as Œ±-enolase, is encoded by the ENOA gene and is responsible for converting 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the glycolytic pathway. Both enolase 1 overexpression and its post-translational modifications could be of value for diagnostic and prognostic work in terms of cancer. Although the exact roles of post- translational modifications have not been completely elucidated, patterns are shown between certain cancer cell types suggesting they may have important influence on function, localization and immunogenicity. Aside from its role in promoting glycolytic flux and anearobic energy production, it has been shown to induce a specific humoral and cellular immune response. On all levels, hypoxia-induced over-expression of enolase 1 may possess important roles in hypoxic tumors including the most straightforward increase in anearobic respiration.  Pyruvate kinase expression  HIF-1 activated pyruvate kinase M comes in multiple isoforms known as PKM1 and PKM2. Pyruvate kinase is shown to convert phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate forming ATP from ADP. Along with phospho-fructokinase 1, pyruvate kinase is also allosterically activated by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. In cancer cells pyruvate kinase M2 has been shown to interact directly with HIF-1Œ± enhancing HIF-1 binding and p300 recruitment to hypoxia response elements. This positive feedback loop leads to HIF-1 transactivation and an amplified effect on glucose metabolism. Pyruvate kinase M2 is often considered the main regulator of cancer metabolism with roles in various parallel, feed-forward, positive and negative feedback mechanisms. The genetic difference between pyruvate kinase M1 and pyruvate kinase M2 is only 22 out of 531 amino acids which makes an immense difference. Pyruvate kinase M2 has metabolic activity regulated by post-translational modifications including acetylation, oxidation, phosphorylation, hydroxylation and sumoylation. These different modifications can cause the shift from the metabolically active tetrameric form to the in-active monomeric form. The well-known EGFR-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and death-associated protein kinase are both shown to bind and directly phosphorylate pyruvate kinase M2 leading to increased activity in the glycolysis pathway. In hypoxic conditions found in a solid tumor, pyruvate kinase M2 plays a large role in promoting anearobic energy production.  Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase expression  The areas surrounding the phosphorylation sites on pyruvate dehydrogenase are shown in red. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase phosphorylation of these sites leads to decreased dehydrogenase activity Pyruvate dehydrogenase directly follows the glycolytic pathway and is responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA which enters into the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle, although not directly requiring oxygen, requires the cycling of NADH to NAD+ as performed by the electron transport chain under aerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, such as those found in hypoxic tumors, the TCA cycle provides little ATP yield due to the lack of electron transport chain function. In order to direct the glycolytically produced pyruvate away from the TCA cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase is over-expressed in response to hypoxic conditions. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase is not a glycolytic enzymes but more of a glycolytic regulator. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, transcriptionally activated by HIF-1 in hypoxic conditions, are responsible for phosphorylating the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase ultimately suppressing its function. By inhibiting this specific pathway, the glycolytic products are directed away from the mitochondrial TCA cycle and towards lactate dehydrogenase.  Lactate dehydrogenase expression  Activated expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), parallels with deactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase mediated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Subsequent inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase following phosphorylation and increased expression of lactate dehydrogenase A shunts pyruvate away from the mitochondrial TCA cycle. In many different tumor types lactate dehydrogenase A is found at elevated levels and has even been linked to poor prognosis and a greater metastatic potential The high levels of lactate production surface the question of whether lactate has some influence on the aggressive behaviour shown in hypoxic tumors.  Overview of glycolytic changes and consequences  Overview of the HIF-1 effect on the expression of glycolytic enzymes Increased expression of almost every glycolytic enzyme is seen in hypoxic tumor conditions. The over- expression of these proteins is mediated by HIF-1 and completely alters normal cellular metabolism. With decreases in the rate of mitochondrial oxidation, lactate and protons begin to accumulate. High levels of glycolysis and the production of lactate, as shown in hypoxic tumor cells, is hallmark of cancer cells even in the presence of oxygen. To relieve tumors cells of acidosis, carbonic anhydrases appear to be highly expressed once again downstream of HIF-1 activation. These enzymes catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide into bicarbonate and protons. They also assist in acidifying the extracellular environment and maintaining a slightly alkaline intracellular compartments contributing to tumor cell survival. Lactate from the hypoxic tumor cells is excreted to the surrounding environment by carbonic anhydrase 9 and sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 MCT4. Local aerobic cancer cells are thought to take up this lactate forming a metabolic symbiosis.  Lactate and cancer  The Structure of Lactic Acid It is commonly accepted that cancer cells (both hypoxic and normoxic) produce large amounts of lactate in result of a large metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to altered glycolysis. The high levels of released lactate contribute to immune escape for the tumor cells. Activated T cells use glycolysis as an energy source and thus must regulate their own lactate levels. Traditionally done by a secretion method, immune cells in a lactate rich environment cannot rid themselves of their own lactate due to the concentration gradient. It is thought that leukocytes may be asphyxiated by lactate while low extracellular pHs may also reduce cytotoxic T-cell function. In endothelial cells it has also been shown that lactate stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production leading to enhanced cellular migration in result of lactate-induced angiogenesis Recent work has also uncovered that lactate uptake by MCT-1 in endothelial cells stimulates NF-Œ∫B activation and thus IL-8 expression. Release of lactate from tumor cells through MCT-4 was sufficient to stimulate angiogenesis and tumor growth through an IL-8-dependent mechanism. Lactate has demonstrated the ability to increase hyaluronan production leading to elevated expression of CD44. Hyaluronan is a glycosaminoglycan polymer critical for maintaining extracellular matrix integrity and modulating cell-cell interactions. Hyaluronan is tethered to cell surfaces by CD44 which are anchored in caveolin-rich lipid rafts. Cleavage and further degradation of hyaluronan is facilitated by Hyal2 and Hyal1, respectively. Increased levels of hyaluronan surrounding carcinomas leads to the promotion of cellular growth and motility. A lactate-sensitive response element for genes in fibroblasts involved in hyaluronan metabolism has been identified. Finally, it is also worth noting that lactate concentrations are positively correlated with radioresistance. Many anti-cancer therapies, including ionizing radiation and many chemotherapeutics, rely on the overproduction of reactive oxygen species to cause genomic instability. Lactate, as an antioxidant, may act to scrub down the levels of reactive oxygen species thus enhancing resistance to radiation and chemotherapy.  Acidic microenvironment and metastasis  It is thought that the low pH of hypoxic tumors in result of high levels of lactic acid can promote tumor cell invasion by destruction of adjacent non-cancerous tissue.> Carbonic anhydrase 9 involved in maintaining a slightly alkaline intracellular pH does so by removing carbonate from the extracellular space consequently acidifying the cells surroundings. Moreover, proton pumping from the hypoxic tumor cells further decreases the surrounding pH. On a completely different note, as briefly discussed above, the autocrine function of phosphoglucose isomerase also promotes cell motility and metastasis.  Metabolic symbiosis  Schematic highlighting the metabolic symbiosis formed between hypoxic and normoxic tumor cells With the hypoxic tumor cells consuming large amounts of glucose to maintain energy homeostasis, the tumor has found a way of using its resources most efficiently. The end glycolytic product of hypoxic tumors, lactate, is transported out of the hypoxic cell by monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) which is a hypoxia-induced transporter. The free lactate in the extracellular space is then taken up by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) which is a non-hypoxia induced transporter found on the surface of aerobic cells. This transporter allows aerobic cancer cells to efficiently take up lactate, convert it back to pyruvate with the oxygen-dependent expression of lactate dehydrogenase B (LDH-B), and use it as an energy source. This frees these cells from requiring large quantities of glucose allowing the hypoxic cells to take up the majority of the available resources. Tumor cells have also shown the remarkable ability to adapt to regional variation of oxygen availability. Cancer cells demonstrate the ability to be hypoxic at one point in time and aerobic at the next. This shows cyclic variations in oxygenation implying dynamic regulation of the metabolic symbiosis between lactate-producing and lactate-consuming states.  The pentose phosphate pathway  In order to meet the demands of rapid tumor growth, the tumor must find ways to support the synthesis of a complete daughter cell while facing depleting nutrient supplies. They must coordinate production of precursors for macromolecular synthesis as well as maintain cellular bioenergetics without impairing cell growth, proliferation and viability. One way of doing this is by shuffling glycolytic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate into the pentose phosphate pathway to give ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH. Ribose-5-phosphate acts as an intermediate for the production of nucleotides thus providing a connection between glycolysis and nucleotide synthesis in hypoxic tumor cells. In cases where glycolysis remains highly active in normoxic conditions, NADPH acts as a mediator of antioxidative reactions to protect cells from oxidative damage. Cancer treatments and tumor hypoxia= Radiotherapy  The presence or absence of oxygen has a strong influence on ionizing radiation to cause cell death of tumour and normal cells. This is called the oxygen effect. Under hypoxic conditions it has been shown that cells obtain radioresistance through HIF-1 mediated mechanisms. To overcome this problem, radiation oncologists have developed powerful tools and approaches such as simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy (SIB-IMRT), which enables a booster dose of radiation to be delivered to small target fractions in a malignant tumor, hypoxia-selective cytotoxins/drugs, and HIF-1 inhibitors. Moreover, it is possible to treat a hypoxic tumor by means of ion beam therapy, in particular with 12C. As ions' damage is direct, OER (Oxygen Enhancement Ratio) is 1, so the effect of oxygen it is not important. Other treatment options Bioreductive prodrugs play a significant part in dealing with these kinds of cells: they can kill the oxygen-deficient tumor cells selectively as hypoxia- activated prodrugs. Example drugs include Tirapazamine and Evofosfamide. The study of tumors in such conditions was pioneered by Dr L. H. Gray.  Targeting tumor hypoxia to overcome metastasis  An association between tumor hypoxia and metastatic progression has been shown through numerous publications. Drug development Several approaches have been taken to address tumor hypoxia. Some companies tried to develop drugs that are activated in hypoxic environments (Novacea, Inc. Proacta, Inc, and Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc), while others are currently seeking to reduce tumor hypoxia (Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and NuvOx Pharma, LLC). Several companies have tried to develop drugs that are activated in hypoxic environments. These drug candidates target levels of hypoxia that are common in tumors but are rare in normal tissues. The hypoxic zones of tumors generally evade traditional chemotherapeutic agents and ultimately contribute to relapse. In the literature, hypoxia has been demonstrated to be associated with a worse prognosis, making it a determinant of cancer progression and therapeutic response Several review articles summarize the current status of hypoxic cytotoxins (hypoxia activated prodrugs). Companies that have tried drugs that are activated in hypoxic environments included Novacea, Inc. Proacta, and Threshold Pharmaceuticals. Novacea Inc discontinued development of its hypoxia activated drug. Proacta's drug PR610 failed a Phase I clinical trial due to toxicity. Threshold Pharmaceuticals discontinued the hypoxia activated prodrug, TH-302, after Phase III trials failed to show statistically significant overall survival. Niacinamide, the active form of vitamin B3, acts as a chemo- and radio-sensitizing agent by enhancing tumor blood flow, thereby reducing tumor hypoxia. Niacinamide also inhibits poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP-1), enzymes involved in the rejoining of DNA strand breaks induced by radiation or chemotherapy. As of August 2016, no clinical trials appear to be in progress for this indication. Another approach to the treatment of tumor hypoxia is the use of an oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound to reoxygenate the hypoxic zones of tumors. The developer of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, tested its lead compound, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC), in a Phase II clinical trial in 59 patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme. The results of the Phase II showed that 36% of the full-dose TSC patients were alive at 2 years, compared with historical survival values ranging from 27% to 30% for the standard of care. The main endpoint of the trial was survival at two years, not overall survival. Another drug in development that is designed to reduce tumor hypoxia is NuvOx Pharma's NVX-108. NVX-108 is a formulation of the perfluorocarbon, dodecafluoropentane (DDFPe). NVX-108 is injected intravenously, flows through the lungs and picks up oxygen, then flows through the arteries and releases oxygen in the presence of hypoxic tissue. A Phase Ib/II clinical trial is in progress for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Early results have shown reversal of tumor hypoxia, and the trial continues to progress.

It aimed at determining the territories of the states in the Balkan Peninsula after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78 and came to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Berlin, which replaced the preliminary Treaty of San Stefano, which had been signed three months earlier between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Borders in the Balkan peninsula after the Treaty of Berlin (1878) German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who led the Congress, undertook to stabilise the Balkans, recognise the reduced power of the Ottoman Empire and balance the distinct interests of Britain, Russia and Austria-Hungary. At the same time, he tried to diminish Russian gains in the region and to prevent the rise of a Greater Bulgaria. As a result, Ottoman lands in Europe declined sharply, Bulgaria was established as an independent principality within the Ottoman Empire, Eastern Rumelia was restored to the Ottoman Empire under a special administration and the region of Macedonia was returned outright to the Ottoman Empire, which promised reform. Romania achieved full independence; it was forced to turn over part of Bessarabia to Russia but gained Northern Dobruja. Serbia and Montenegro finally gained complete independence but with smaller territories, with Austria-Hungary occupying the Sand≈æak (Ra≈°ka) region.Vincent Ferraro. The Austrian Occupation of Novibazar, 1878‚Äì1909 (based on Anderson, Frank Maloy and Amos Shartle Hershey, Handbook for the Diplomatic History of Europe, Asia, and Africa 1870‚Äì1914. National Board for Historical Service. Government Printing Office, Washington, 1918. Austria-Hungary also took over Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Britain took over Cyprus. The results were first hailed as a great achievement in peacemaking and stabilisation. However, most of the participants were not fully satisfied, and grievances on the results festered until they exploded in the First and the Second Balkan Wars in 1912‚Äì1913 and eventually the First World War in 1914. Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece all received gains that were far less than they thought that they deserved. The Ottoman Empire, then called the \\"sick man of Europe\\", was humiliated and significantly weakened, which made it more liable to domestic unrest and vulnerable to attack. Although Russia had been victorious in the war that occasioned the conference, it was humiliated there and resented its treatment. Austria-Hungary gained a great deal of territory, which angered the South Slavs and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bismarck became the target of hatred by Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and he later found that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria-Hungary in the Balkans.Jerome L. Blum, et al. The European World: A History (1970) p. 841 In the long run, tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary intensified, as did the nationality question in the Balkans. The Congress was aimed at revising the Treaty of San Stefano and at keeping Constantinople within Ottoman hands. It effectively disavowed Russia's victory over the decaying Ottoman Empire during the Russo-Turkish War. The Congress returned territories to the Ottoman Empire that the earlier treaty had given to the Principality of Bulgaria, most notably Macedonia, thus setting up a strong revanchist demand in Bulgaria, which led to the 1912 First Balkan War. Background Pro-Greek ethnic map of the Balkans by Ioannis Gennadius, published by the English cartographer E. Stanford in 1877 In the decades leading up to the congress, Russia and the Balkans had been gripped by Pan-Slavism, a movement to unite all the Balkan Slavs under one rule. That desire, which evolved similarly to the Pan-Germanism and Pan-Italianism, which had resulted in two unifications, took different forms in the various Slavic nations. In Imperial Russia, Pan-Slavism meant the creation of a unified Slavic state, under Russian direction, and was essentially a byword for Russian conquest of the Balkan peninsula.Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. Imperial Russian Foreign Policy. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, p. 228. The realisation of the goal would give Russia control of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, thus economic control of the Black Sea and substantially greater geopolitical power. In the Balkans, Pan-Slavism meant unifying the Balkan Slavs under the rule of a particular Balkan state, but the state that was meant to serve as the locus for unification was not always clear, as initiative wafted between Serbia and Bulgaria. The creation of a Bulgarian exarch by the Ottomans in 1870 had been intended to separate the Bulgarians religiously from the Greek patriarch and politically from Serbia. From the Balkan point of view, unification of the peninsula needed both a Piedmont as a base and a corresponding France as a sponsor. Though the views of how Balkan politics should proceed differed, both began with the deposition of the sultan as ruler of the Balkans and the ousting of the Ottomans from Europe. How and even whether that was to proceed would be the major question to be answered at the Congress of Berlin. Great powers in Balkans The Balkans were a major stage for competition between the European great powers in the second half of the 19th century. Britain and Russia had interests in the fate of the Balkans. Russia was interested in the region, both ideologically, as a pan-Slavist unifier, and practically, to secure greater control of the Mediterranean. Britain was interested in preventing Russia from accomplishing its goals. Furthermore, the Unifications of Italy and of Germany had stymied the ability of a third European power, Austria-Hungary, to expand its domain to the southwest any further. Germany, as the most powerful continental nation since the 1871 Franco-Prussian War had little direct interest in the settlement and so was the only power that could mediate the Balkan question credibly. Russia and Austria-Hungary, the two powers that were most invested in the fate of the Balkans, were allied with Germany in the conservative League of Three Emperors, which had been founded to preserve the monarchies of Continental Europe. The Congress of Berlin was thus mainly a dispute among supposed allies of Bismarck and his German Empire, the arbiter of the discussion, would thus have to choose before the end of the congress which of their allies to support. That decision was to have direct consequences on the future of European geopolitics. Ottoman brutality in the Serbian‚ÄìOttoman War and the violent suppression of the Herzegovina Uprising fomented political pressure within Russia, which saw itself as the protector of the Serbs, to act against the Ottoman Empire. David MacKenzie wrote that \\"sympathy for the Serbian Christians existed in Court circles, among nationalist diplomats, and in the lower classes, and was actively expressed through the Slav committees\\". Eventually, Russia sought and obtained Austria-Hungary's pledge of benevolent neutrality in the coming war, in return for ceding Bosnia Herzegovina to Austria-Hungary in the Budapest Convention of 1877. act: The Berlin Congress in effect postponed resolution of the Bosnian question and left Bosnia and Herzegovina under Habsburg control. This was the goal of Hungarian Count Gyula Andr√°ssy.Dimitrije Djordjevic, \\"The Berlin Congress of 1878 and the Origins Of World War I.\\" Serbian Studies (1998) 12 #1 pp 1-10. Treaty of San Stefano Ethnographic map by German geographer Heinrich Kiepert, 1878. This map received a good reception in contemporary Europe and was used as a reference at the Congress of Berlin. After the Bulgarian April Uprising in 1876 and the Russian victory in the Russo-Turkish War in 1877‚Äì1878, Russia had liberated almost all of the Ottoman European possessions. The Ottomans recognised Montenegro, Romania and Serbia as independent, and the territories of all three of them were expanded. Russia created a large Principality of Bulgaria as an autonomous vassal of the sultan. That expanded Russia's sphere of influence to encompass the entire Balkans, which alarmed other powers in Europe. Britain, which had threatened war with Russia if it occupied Constantinople,Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. Imperial Russian Foreign Policy. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, pp. 239‚Äì40. and France did not want another power meddling in either the Mediterranean or the Middle East, where both powers were prepared to make large colonial gains. Austria-Hungary desired Habsburg control over the Balkans, and Germany wanted to prevent its ally from going to war. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck thus called the Congress of Berlin to discuss the partition of the Ottoman Balkans among the European powers and to preserve the League of Three Emperors in the face of the spread of European liberalism. The Congress was attended by Britain, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Delegates from Greece, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro attended the sessions that concerned their states, but they were not members. The Congress was solicited by Russia's rivals, particularly Austria-Hungary and Britain, and was hosted in 1878 by Bismarck. It proposed and ratified the Treaty of Berlin. The meetings were held at Bismarck's Reich Chancellery, the former Radziwill Palace, from 13 June to 13 July 1878. The congress revised or eliminated 18 of the 29 articles in the Treaty of San Stefano. Furthermore, by using as a foundation the Treaties of Paris (1856) and of Washington (1871), the treaty rearranged the East. Other powers' fear of Russian influence Ethnic composition map of the Balkans by the German-English cartographer Ernst Georg Ravenstein of 1870 The principal mission of the participants at the Congress was to deal a fatal blow to the burgeoning movement of pan-Slavism. The movement caused serious concern in Berlin and even more so in Vienna, which was afraid that the repressed Slavic nationalities would revolt against the Habsburgs. The British and the French governments were nervous about both the diminishing influence of the Ottoman Empire and the cultural expansion of Russia to the south, where both Britain and France were poised to colonise Egypt and Palestine. By the Treaty of San Stefano, the Russians, led by Chancellor Alexander Gorchakov, had managed to create in Bulgaria an autonomous principality, under the nominal rule of the Ottoman Empire. That sparked the Great Game, the massive British fear of the growing Russian influence in the Middle East. The new principality, including a very large portion of Macedonia as well as access to the Aegean Sea, could easily threaten the Dardanelle Straits, which separate the Black Sea from the Mediterranean Sea. The arrangement was not acceptable to the British, who considered the entire Mediterranean to be a British sphere of influence and saw any Russian attempt to gain access there as a grave threat to British power. On 4 June, before the Congress opened on 13 June, British Prime Minister Lord Beaconsfield had already concluded the Cyprus Convention, a secret alliance with the Ottomans against Russia in which Britain was allowed to occupy the strategically-placed island of Cyprus. The agreement predetermined Beaconsfield's position during the Congress and led him to issue threats to unleash a war against Russia if it did not comply with Ottoman demands. Negotiations between Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Andr√°ssy and British Foreign Secretary Marquess of Salisbury had already \\"ended on 6 June by Britain agreeing to all the Austrian proposals relative to Bosnia- Herzegovina about to come before the congress while Austria would support British demands\\". Bismarck as host Bismarck manipulates the emperors of Austria, Germany & Russia like a ventriloquist's puppets. Borders of Bulgaria according to the preliminary Treaty of San Stefano (red stripes) and the superseding Treaty of Berlin (solid red) The Congress of Berlin is frequently viewed as the culmination of the battle between Chancellors Alexander Gorchakov of Russia and Otto von Bismarck of Germany. Both were able to persuade other European leaders that a free and independent Bulgaria would greatly improve the security risks posed by a disintegrating Ottoman Empire. According to historian Erich Eyck, Bismarck supported Russia's position that \\"Turkish rule over a Christian community (Bulgaria) was an anachronism which undoubtedly gave rise to insurrection and bloodshed and should therefore be ended\\".Erich Eyck, Bismarck and the German Empire (New York: W.W. Norton, 1964), pp. 245‚Äì46. He used the Great Eastern Crisis of 1875 as proof of growing animosity in the region. Bismarck's ultimate goal during the Congress of Berlin was not to upset Germany's status on the international platform. He did not wish to disrupt the League of the Three Emperors by choosing between Russia and Austria as an ally. To maintain peace in Europe, Bismarck sought to convince other European diplomats that dividing up the Balkans would foster greater stability. During the process, Russia began to feel cheated despite eventually gaining independence for Bulgaria. Problems in the alliances in Europe before the First World War were thus noticeable. One reason that Bismarck was able to mediate the various tensions at the Congress of Berlin was his diplomatic persona. He sought peace and stability when international affairs did not pertain to Germany directly. Since he viewed the current situation in Europe as favourable for Germany, any conflicts between the major European powers that threatened the status quo was against German interests. Also, at the Congress of Berlin, \\"Germany could not look for any advantage from the crisis\\" that had occurred in the Balkans in 1875. Therefore, Bismarck claimed impartiality on behalf of Germany at the Congress, which enabled him to preside over the negotiations with a keen eye for foul play. Though most of Europe went into the Congress expecting a diplomatic show, much like the Congress of Vienna, they were to be sadly disappointed. Bismarck, unhappy to be conducting the Congress in the heat of the summer, had a short temper and a low tolerance for malarky. Thus, any grandstanding was cut short by the testy German chancellor. The ambassadors from the small Balkan territories whose fate was being decided were barely even allowed to attend the diplomatic meetings, which were between mainly the representatives of the great powers. According to Henry Kissinger, the congress saw a shift in Bismarck's Realpolitik. Until then, as Germany had become too powerful for isolation, his policy was to maintain the League of the Three Emperors. Now that he could no longer rely on Russia's alliance, he began to form relations with as many potential enemies as possible.  Legacy  Bowing to Russia's pressure, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro were all declared independent principalities. Russia kept Southern Bessarabia, which it had annexed in the Russo-Turkish War, but the Bulgarian state that it had created was first bisected and then divided again into the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, both of which were given nominal autonomy, under the control of the Ottoman Empire.Oakes, Augustus, and R. B. Mowat. The Great European Treaties of the Nineteenth Century. Clarendon Press, 1918, pp. 332‚Äì60. Bulgaria was promised autonomy, and guarantees were made against Turkish interference, but they were largely ignored. Romania received Northern Dobruja. Montenegro obtained Nik≈°iƒá, along with the primary Albanian regions of Podgorica, Bar and Plav- Gusinje. The Ottoman government, or Porte, agreed to obey the specifications contained in the Organic Law of 1868 and to guarantee the civil rights of non- Muslim subjects. The region of Bosnia-Herzegovina was handed over to the administration of Austria-Hungary, which also obtained the right to garrison the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, a small border region between Montenegro and Serbia. Bosnia and Herzegovina were put on the fast track to eventual annexation. Russia agreed that Macedonia, the most important strategic section of the Balkans, was too multinational to be part of Bulgaria and permitted it to remain under the Ottoman Empire. Eastern Rumelia, which had its own large Turkish and Greek minorities, became an autonomous province under a Christian ruler, with its capital at Philippopolis. The remaining portions of the original \\"Greater Bulgaria\\" became the new state of Bulgaria. In Russia, the Congress of Berlin was considered to be a dismal failure. After finally defeating the Turks despite many past inconclusive Russo-Turkish wars, many Russians had expected \\"something colossal\\", a redrawing of the Balkan borders in support of Russian territorial ambitions. Instead, the victory resulted in an Austro-Hungarian gain on the Balkan front that was brought about by the rest of the European powers' preference for a powerful Austria-Hungarian Empire, which threatened basically no one, to a powerful Russia, which had been locked in competition with Britain in the so-called Great Game for most of the century. Gorchakov said, \\"I consider the Berlin Treaty the darkest page in my life\\". Most Russian people furious over the European repudiation of their political gains, and though there was some thought that it represented only a minor stumble on the road to Russian hegemony in the Balkans, it actually gave Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia over to Austria-Hungary's sphere of influence and essentially removed all Russian influence from the area.Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. Imperial Russian Foreign Policy. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, pp. 244‚Äì46. The Serbs were upset with \\"Russia... consenting to the cession of Bosnia to Austria\\": > Ristiƒá who was Serbia‚Äôs first plenipotentiary at Berlin tells how he asked > Jomini, one of the Russian delegates, what consolation remained to the > Serbs. Jomini replied that it would have to be the thought that 'the > situation was only temporary because within fifteen years at the latest we > shall be forced to fight Austria.' 'Vain consolation!' comments Ristiƒá. Italy was dissatisfied with the results of the Congress, and the tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire were left unresolved. Bosnia-Herzegovina would also prove to be problematic for the Austro-Hungarian Empire in later decades. The League of the Three Emperors, established in 1873, was destroyed since Russia saw lack of German support on the issue of Bulgaria's full independence as a breach of loyalty and the alliance. The border between Greece and Turkey was not resolved. In 1881, after protracted negotiations, a compromise border was accepted after a naval demonstration of the great powers had resulted in the cession of Thessaly and the Arta Prefecture to Greece. Thus, the Berlin Congress sowed the seeds of further conflicts, including the Balkan Wars and (ultimately) the First World War. In the 'Salisbury Circular' of 1 April 1878, the British Foreign Secretary, the Marquess of Salisbury, clarified the objections of him and the government to the Treaty of San Stefano because of the favorable position in which it left Russia.Walker, Christopher J. (1980), Armenia: The Survival of A Nation, London: Croom Helm, p. 112 In 1954, the British historian AJP Taylor wrote: \\"If the treaty of San Stefano had been maintained, both the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary might have survived to the present day. The British, except for Beaconsfield in his wilder moments, had expected less and were therefore less disappointed. Salisbury wrote at the end of 1878: We shall set up a rickety sort of Turkish rule again south of the Balkans. But it is a mere respite. There is no vitality left in them.\\"AJP Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1914‚Äì1918, Oxford University Press (1954) p. 253 Though the Congress of Berlin constituted a harsh blow to Pan-Slavism, it, by no means, solved the question of the area. The Slavs in the Balkans were still mostly under non-Slavic rule, split between the rule of Austria-Hungary and the ailing Ottoman Empire. The Slavic states of the Balkans had learned that banding together as Slavs benefited them less than playing to the desires of a neighboring great power. That damaged the unity of the Balkan Slavs and encouraged competition between the fledgling Slav states. The underlying tensions of the region would continue to simmer for thirty years until they again exploded in the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913. In 1914, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand the Austro- Hungarian heir, led to the First World War. In hindsight, the stated goal of maintaining peace and balance of powers in the Balkans obviously failed since the region would remain a source of conflict between the great powers well into the 20th century.

She has written a controversial book on Messianic Judaism, a belief system considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity, adhered to by groups that seek to combine Christianity and Judaism. She received her rabbinical ordination at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in 1988, and religiously affiliates with Reconstructionist Judaism. She received a Ph.D. in religion from Temple University in 1992. In the past she has taught at Villanova University, La Salle University, Philadelphia University, Rosemont College, and Gratz College. She looks at religion from a sociological standpoint, and sees that although Jewish community as a whole accepts Secular Humanistic Jews and Jewish Buddhists as still being \\"in the fold,\\" Messianic Jews are considered to be heretics. It was this puzzle in the behavior of the Jewish community‚Äîaccepting atheist and Buddhist Jews, while rejecting Jews practicing Christianity‚Äîthat led her to explore the Messianic Jewish community in a focused ethnographic study and to think through the issue of legitimacy surrounding Messianic Judaism. Book controversy Her book Messianic Judaism: A Rabbi's Journey through Religious Change in America has been the focus of a controversy. She concludes that given the Jewish community's tacit acceptance of other seemingly \\"heretical\\" Jews as part of the ethnic Jewish community, it would be difficult to find a consistently logical reason to reject Messianic Judaism, although she is quite clear that communities can draw boundaries as they see fit. Theologically, she affirms that Messianic Jews are adherents of Evangelical Christianity. This was reiterated in an interview with World: The Journal of the Unitarian Universalist Association (Nov/Dec 99), Harris-Shapiro reiterates that she views messianic Judaism as a form of Christianity. :World: Describe the Christianity practiced by Messianic Jews and in particular their appropriation of Jesus. :CHS: They practice evangelical Christianity. Like evangelical Christians, they believe Jesus was both God and man, came to earth, died for our sins, was resurrected on the third day, performed the miracles, and that the New Testament is literally true. Some also hold some fundamentalist beliefs about exactly how one interprets the New Testament. Some are very interested in the millennium, in prophecy, in when or if the rapture is going to happen. Many congregations, though not all, are Pentecostal--that is, they believe in gifts of the spirit such as speaking in tongues, charismatic healing, exorcising demons, and the real presence of Satan that has to be battled. :As for how they see Jesus, that's interesting. Although they accept the theological doctrine that Jesus is both God and human, they don't pray to him. They don't feel comfortable with that. Some Messianic rabbis have even had difficulty accepting Yeshua as God and have been kicked out of the movement.'' The idea that \\"messianic Judaism\\" could be considered a form of Judaism has been rejected by the overwhelming majority of Jewish historians and rabbis. Reform Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations called her conclusions absurd, writing that \\"there's no such thing as a 'messianic Jew.' The whole notion is a fraud.‚Ä¶There will be no compromise on that point.\\" In the same newspaper article on this book, Conservative Rabbi Jerome Epstein, vice president of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and Orthodox Rabbi Lawrence Shiffman, professor of Judaic Studies at New York University also stated that Harris-Shapiro was egregiously incorrect. Shiffman wrote that she \\"has been sucked into the very conception the missionaries want to create.\\" (Kessler, E. J. The Jewish Forward, June 4, 1999: page 1).

Educated at Cranbrook School, Kent, and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, Collins was ordained a priest in 1928 and served as chaplain of his old college and vice-principal of Westcott House, before becoming chaplain of Oriel College, Oxford, in 1937. He served as a chaplain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and was radicalised by the experience. In 1946, upon returning to Oxford, he founded the organization Christian Action to work for reconciliation with Germany. He was appointed as a canon of St Paul's Cathedral, London in 1948, an office he held for 33 years. Shortly afterwards he became disturbed by the newly developing apartheid system in South Africa. In 1951, Collins was one of the four founders of the charity War on Want which fights global poverty. In 1956, he committed Christian Action to raising funds for the defence of anti-apartheid activists accused of treason in South Africa and this gave rise to the Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa. The fund raised over ¬£75,000 to help defend the accused during the Treason Trial. Collins was strongly opposed to a proposed cricket tour by Frank Worrell‚Äôs West Indies to South Africa in 1959, leading a successful campaign to have it cancelled. Collins was strongly opposed to the spread of nuclear weapons and was one of many on the left in Britain who believed that it was unnecessary and wrong for Britain to own such weapons. He was one of the founders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He was also a member of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship, working with the Reverend Sidney Hinkes on anti-nuclear campaigns. The Canon Collins Educational & Legal Assistance Trust, formerly known as Canon Collins Trust for Southern Africa (CCETSA) is a charity founded in 1981. It was set up as the Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and Collins was its first chairman. In the days of apartheid it provided money to help South African and Namibian refugee students gain the higher education in the United Kingdom and in independent African states. It now provides scholarships for students within South Africa and in other African countries. Family Collins married Diana Clavering Elliot (1917‚Äì2003) in 1939; they had four sons including the judge Andrew Collins. In 1999 Diana Collins was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. References *COLLINS, Rev.

Originally ordained a Reform rabbi, Wine founded the Birmingham Temple, the first congregation of Humanistic Judaism in 1963, in Birmingham, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan (the temple later relocated to its current location in Farmington Hills, Michigan). In 1969 Wine founded the Society for Humanistic Judaism. He later was a founder of several other organizations related to Humanistic Judaism, a humanist movement within Judaism that emphasizes secular Jewish culture and Jewish history rather than belief in God as sources of Jewish identity. Wine was also the founder of several humanist organizations that are not specifically Jewish, such as the Humanist Institute and the International Association of Humanist Educators, Counselors, and Leaders, as well as the cofounder of Americans for Religious Liberty, which promotes separation of church and state. Wine was the provost of the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism at the time of his death. Wine lectured on a wide array of topics after 1976 under the auspices of the Center for New Thinking, which he also founded. The American Humanist Association named him Humanist of the Year for 2003. Life Wine was born in Detroit, Michigan. His parents immigrated to the United States from part of the Russian Empire that is now in Poland. His father, whose name was originally Herschel Wengrowski, joined family members in Detroit in 1906. Wine's mother, Tieblei Israelski, emigrated to Detroit in 1914. Wine attended Detroit public schools with almost completely Jewish student bodies. His religious upbringing was in Conservative Judaism, at Congregation Shaarey Zedek. His parents kept a kosher home and observed Shabbat. Wine attended the University of Michigan, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree and later a Master of Arts degree, both in philosophy. As an undergraduate student he was most sympathetic to empiricism, particularly its then-current manifestation logical positivism. At the same time, he was attracted to the humanistic outlook of some faculty members. Despite his movement away from theism, Wine decided to join the clergy rather than academia and in 1951 enrolled in the rabbinic program at Reform Judaism's Hebrew Union College. Wine volunteered for service as a chaplain in the U.S. Army after his ordination as a rabbi and served as associate rabbi at the Reform Temple Beth El in Detroit for six months while awaiting induction. Wine began his service as an Army chaplain in January 1957 and was stationed in Korea. In November 1958, he returned to Temple Beth El in Detroit. In the fall of 1959, he joined a group in Windsor, Ontario just across the Detroit River in Canada to organize a new Reform congregation, also called Beth El. In 1963, a disaffected group from Temple Beth El in Detroit contacted Wine and asked him to meet with them about forming a new Reform congregation in the northwestern suburbs of Detroit, where the members now lived. He began leading services for the new group, initially eight families, in September 1963 in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Working with members of this small group to develop language which reflected their true beliefs, Wine eventually made the decision to eliminate the word \\"God\\" from the services and instead to use new liturgy that extolled Jewish history, culture, and ethical values. This decision was to lay the foundation for the development of Humanistic Judaism as separate from Reform Judaism or any other existing Jewish stream. A storm of controversy arose when it became known that Wine, who had by then left Temple Beth El in Windsor, was leading a congregation that did not recognize God. The Detroit Free Press ran an article in December 1964 with the headline \\"Suburban Rabbi: 'I Am an Atheist.'\\" This was followed by stories in Time magazine and the New York Times. Wine explained that his views were not precisely atheistic. Rather, reflecting his acceptance of the basic outlook of the logical positivists, he declared that it was not possible empirically to prove or disprove the existence of God and, therefore, the concept was meaningless. He referred to this stance as \\"ignosticism\\" rather than atheism. The Masonic temple in Birmingham in which the congregation was meeting at the time, expelled the group early in 1965 because it had rejected God. The congregation, now known as the Birmingham Temple, purchased land in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and moved into a newly constructed building in 1971. The Torah scroll was placed in the library rather than at the usual place in the sanctuary. Instead, the sanctuary was adorned with a large sculpture spelling out in Hebrew the word Adam, meaning \\"man\\" or \\"people.\\" Wine served as the rabbi of the Birmingham Temple until his retirement in 2003, at which time he began devoting most of his efforts to his work as Dean for North America and Provost of the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism as well as to lecturing on a wide range of topics under the auspices of the Center for New Thinking, which he had founded in 1976. In 2003 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Wine's last work, A Provocative People: The Secular History of the Jews was published after his death. It was ended by his student Rabbi Adam Chalom. Organizational leadership As the outlook and practices of the Birmingham Temple attracted people in other locations, Wine assumed the responsibility for founding several organizations designed to link these adherents together. First, in 1969, the Society for Humanistic Judaism was formed by Wine's Birmingham Temple; a previously Reform congregation in Illinois headed by Rabbi Daniel Friedman, who had led the congregation from Reform to Humanistic Judaism after learning about Wine's work in Michigan; and a congregation in Westport, Connecticut which had been organized by a member of the Birmingham Temple who had moved to Connecticut. The Society for Humanistic Judaism now has over 30 constituent congregations in the United States and Canada, as well as individual members unaffiliated with any of these congregations. To fulfill the need of the Humanistic Judaism movement for trained leaders, Wine founded the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism in 1985. This educational institution was sponsored jointly by the Society for Humanistic Judaism and the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations. The rabbinic program of this Institute has educated and ordained seven rabbis in North America in addition to over 50 leaders (called madrikhim or madrikhot in Hebrew or vegvayzer in Yiddish) who have less training than rabbis but are certified by the Institute to officiate at weddings and other life cycle events. The Institute also has an active rabbinical program in Israel from which eight rabbis have graduated and been ordained. Wine also founded several organizations that are not specifically Jewish. In 1981, he and others created the Voice of Reason for the purpose of responding to the upsurge of right-wing political activism by religious leaders such as Rev. Jerry Falwell. In 1982, The Voice of Reason merged with the Center for Moral Democracy, which had been started by Ethical Culture leader Edward L. Ericson and others, to form a new organization, Americans for Religious Liberty, which continues as an advocacy group for the separation of church and state. In 1982, Wine founded the North American Committee for Humanism, a confederation of the six major humanist organizations in North America, and The Humanist Institute, a graduate school in New York for training humanist leaders. Wine served as President of both of these organizations from 1982 until 1993. In the Detroit area, Wine founded the Conference on Liberal Religion, an association of liberal religious professionals, in 1985 and an advocacy group called Clergy and Citizens United in 1995. An openly gay man, he was also a member of Triangle Foundation's Board of Advisors. Views While secular Jewish culture thrived in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, its principal manifestations, Yiddish-based schools and Zionism, were in decline by the beginning of the 1960s. Many nonreligious Jews were becoming unaffiliated with either religious or secular Jewish organizations. Recognizing that most Americans are members of thriving religious congregations, Wine concluded that a congregational format, emphasizing Jewish culture and history rather than a theistic outlook, could attract nonreligious Jews who were not served by other Jewish organizations. The goal was to provide members with a sense of community and all of the services that are provided by congregational life, but in a manner consistent with the nontheistic outlook of Wine and the others in his movement. Wine emphasized intellectual integrity, keeping words consistent with beliefs. For him and his congregants, this meant that references to a deity had to be excluded from the liturgy. As a result, Wine discarded virtually all previous Jewish liturgical writings. A typical passage developed by Wine for the Sabbath (Shabbat) is, in transliterated Hebrew and in English: Wine composed a poem that is considered to be the central expression of the outlook of Humanistic Judaism: Many of the Jewish holidays have been maintained within Wine's Humanistic Judaism, but the interpretations of the meanings of these holidays has been amended for consistency with the outlook of this movement. For example, Rosh Hashanah is said, within Humanistic Judaism, to be a time for renewal and reflection, focusing on the affirmation of human power and human dignity. Yom Kippur is, according to Wine and his movement, a celebration of inner strength and a time of self- forgiveness. Prayers and references to God are excluded from the services even for these holidays. The Torah and other traditional Jewish religious texts are, for Wine, important historical documents that need to be evaluated scientifically to determine their origins and degree of factuality. For him, writings of the Jews of the past 250 years have more philosophical and ethical validity than ancient writings because they are more likely to be infused with the values of the Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment, and the more general Western Enlightenment. Unlike other streams of Judaism, Humanistic Judaism does not condemn or discourage intermarriage, and its clergy are happy to officiate at weddings between Jews and non-Jews. Wine's view has been that criticizing people for marrying whomever they choose is not only unethical but also counterproductive to efforts to ensure Jewish continuity. For Wine and Humanistic Judaism, Jewish identity is largely a matter of self- identification. Wine has been closely affiliated with the non-Jewish Humanist movement. In responding to questions as to why a specifically Jewish organization should exist within Humanism, he has said that the history of the Jews is a clear demonstration that only people can solve human problems of survival and that there is no supernatural force that will come to our aid. Wine has written numerous books and articles. His Judaism Beyond God is a description of the history and outlook of the Humanistic Judaism movement. Celebrations: A Ceremonial and Philosophic Guide for Humanists and Humanistic Jews is, as its name indicates, a compendium of Wine's liturgical writings and \\"meditations,\\" intended for use at various holiday and life cycle ceremonies. Staying Sane in a Crazy World is a general self-help book, with advice on how reliance on reason can help us live meaningful and fulfilling lives. Rabbi Wine coined the word ignosticism. It is the view that a coherent definition of God must be presented before the question of the existence of God can be meaningfully discussed. Death On July 21, 2007, Wine and his longtime life partner Richard McMains were in a taxicab headed to a hotel from dinner in Essaouira, Morocco, when their cab was hit by another vehicle. Both Wine and the taxi driver were killed instantly in the car crash. McMains survived the collision, but he was seriously injured in the crash.

He served as the Colts' placekicker from 1998 to 2005 and was a member of the Dallas Cowboys during his final NFL season in 2006. He also played for four seasons in the Canadian Football League (CFL), where he spent three seasons with the Toronto Argonauts and one with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Vanderjagt retired as the NFL's most accurate field goal kicker at 86.5%, which is the ninth-highest completion percentage in league history. During his CFL career, Vanderjagt won two Grey Cups and received the Dick Suderman Trophy in 1996. His most successful NFL season was in 2003 when he became the first kicker to convert every field goal and point after touchdown during the regular season and playoffs, earning Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro honors in the process. He is also known for missing high-profile field goal attempts and provoking controversy with outspoken comments and antics. Early years Vanderjagt attended White Oaks Secondary School, where he was a four sport athlete (football, basketball, track and soccer). In 1988, he accepted a scholarship from Michigan State University as a quarterback and placekicker. However, he left Michigan State for Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, California, where he took over placekicking duties from exiting freshman Jack Garvin (who left for the UCLA). Vanderjagt punted and played quarterback for AHC until returning to Division I football, as solely a punter and placekicker, at West Virginia University for the 1991 and 1992 seasons. As a junior, he was the team's starting punter, registering 52 punts for 2,040 yards (39.2-yard avg.). In his final season he was switched to placekicker, ranking third in field goals made (15) and fourth in points scored (72) in the Big East Conference. Professional career=CFL 1993‚Äì1994, 1996‚Äì97 After graduating from WVU in 1993, he returned to Canada and started a career in the Canadian Football League. Between 1993 and 1996, he was cut by four different CFL teams, getting some playing time with the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1993. Not playing in the league in 1994 or 1995, Vanderjagt played for the Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League. Vanderjagt also played for the AFL's Minnesota Fighting Pike in the 1996 season before returning to the Toronto Argonauts (who had previously cut him twice) for their 1996 season. Over the next two seasons, Vanderjagt served as their regular placekicker and punter, as Argos won the Grey Cup in both 1996 and 1997; in those two games he was 9 of 9. For his 1996 Grey Cup efforts he was named the game's outstanding Canadian. He also led the CFL in yardage per punt in 1997. Following the 1997 season, Vanderjagt left the Argos to become a free agent, ultimately to play in the National Football League. Indianapolis Colts In 1998, Vanderjagt returned to the United States to join the Indianapolis Colts of the NFL, and was the team's placekicker through the 2005 season. He led the NFL in scoring in 1999. In a 2000 playoff game against Miami, Vanderjagt successfully converted a 50-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, but missed a 49-yard attempt in overtime. Miami scored on the next possession to win the game. Following the Colts' elimination from the postseason in 2002, Vanderjagt made critical comments about Colts quarterback Peyton Manning and head coach Tony Dungy to a Canadian television station. Vanderjagt questioned Manning's leadership skills and was critical of Dungy's temperament. During an interview at the 2003 Pro Bowl, Manning referred to Vanderjagt as the team's \\"idiot kicker\\" and accused him of being intoxicated during the interview. In 2003, Vanderjagt became the first kicker in the league's history to go an entire season, including the playoffs, without missing a field goal or point-after attempt. (In 1998, Minnesota kicker Gary Anderson was perfect in the regular season, but missed a field goal attempt in the playoffs.) In the process, he made his first Pro Bowl and was named first team All-Pro. He finished the regular season 37 for 37 in field goals and 46 for 46 in PATs. He was also perfect on three field-goal attempts and 12 PATs in the postseason. He did, however, miss a potential game tying 51-yard field goal in that season's Pro Bowl with three seconds left in a 55‚Äì52 loss to the NFC. In 2004, he kicked 20 field goals, the lowest number of his career. But he also had considerably fewer field goal chances that season (25), as the Colts offense scored 61 touchdowns (nearly four per game), with Peyton Manning throwing a then NFL record 49 TD passes. Vanderjagt's streak of 42 consecutive successful field goal attempts, the second longest in NFL history (the league does not include postseason or Pro Bowl games when compiling streaks), ended on September 9, 2004 when he missed a 48-yard attempt against the New England Patriots. The game was 2004's Monday Night Football opener, which the Colts lost 27‚Äì24. After the Colts routed the Denver Broncos in the wild-card round of the 2004 playoffs, he told reporters that the Colts' opponents in the next round of the playoffs, the Patriots, were \\"ripe for the picking,\\" and said \\"I think they're not as good as the beginning of the year and not as good as last year\\" (when they won the Super Bowl). Patriots safety Rodney Harrison fired back at him in an interview, calling him \\"Vanderjerk\\". Harrison's teammate, linebacker Willie McGinest, was more temperate in his response, but noted that \\"There's going to be a whole bunch of plays when he's not going to be out there [on the field]. The rest of his guys will be out there dealing with it.\\" The Patriots eventually defeated the Colts 20‚Äì3 and went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX. Vanderjagt indicated in a radio interview during the season that he might not return to the Colts for 2005, as his cap number was $2.8 million and the Colts might not be willing to pick up his salary for that season. He noted that he may return to the CFL, where his professional career began. However, he eventually signed a reworked deal and returned to the Colts. In the 2005‚Äì06 NFL Playoffs, against the eventual Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers, Vanderjagt missed a 46-yard field goal attempt wide right with 18 seconds remaining, when the Colts were behind 21‚Äì18, costing the Colts a chance at overtime and ending the team's season. Walking off the field after the kick, he took off his helmet and threw it to the ground in anger (which cost his team a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty). It was Vanderjagt's first field goal miss in the RCA Dome in the postseason. Shortly thereafter, on January 19, 2006, Vanderjagt appeared on a lighthearted segment of the Late Show with David Letterman, during which he successfully kicked a 46-yard field goal, outside Letterman's Manhattan studio. Letterman, an Indiana native and Colts fan, served as the holder. The appearance was said to be one of the reasons why Vanderjagt was not re-signed in 2006. During the 2006 offseason, Vanderjagt became a free agent and the Colts elected not to re-sign him. Instead, they signed free agent Adam Vinatieri, who had helped in the Patriots' recent Super Bowl titles. Following Vanderjagt's departure, the Colts would go on to win Super Bowl XLI that season. Dallas Cowboys In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Dallas Cowboys organization felt they could find placekickers without the need of paying a premium and adversely impacting the salary cap. On March 23, 2006, this philosophy ended when the Cowboys signed Vanderjagt to a three-year, $4.5 million contract that included a $2.5 million signing bonus. Vanderjagt suffered a groin injury that kept him out of action for two weeks in preseason. He returned for the final game against the Minnesota Vikings, but missed two field goals in overtime of 32 and 33 yards (both misses were wide right), forcing the contest to end in a tie. Rumors quickly spread that Vanderjagt would be released by the Cowboys before the start of the regular season, after head coach Bill Parcells was quoted saying \\"I think he has been a good kicker. But he keeps telling me that I don't have to worry about him. Well, I'm worried about him now.\\" However, he remained on the roster, when the team was forced to keep backup kicker Shaun Suisham for the first game of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Vanderjagt would appear in each of the Cowboys' subsequent games through Week 12. In Week 9, his potential game-winning field goal was blocked by the Washington Redskins as time expired. In Week 11 against his former team the Colts, he missed his only two field goal attempts, (both of these misses were also wide right) making it the first time since 2001 since he had done so. The fans were so upset, they booed a commercial he appeared in on stadium monitors. After he barely made a 22-yard field goal against Tampa Bay, the Cowboys had seen enough. On November 27, he was released and replaced with Mart√≠n Gram√°tica. During his time with the Cowboys, Vanderjagt made 13 of 18 field goal attempts and was 2-for-5 on field goals from 35 yards or more. Toronto Argonauts (second stint) On May 31, 2008, the Toronto Argonauts signed Vanderjagt and traded their veteran kicker Noel Prefontaine to the Edmonton Eskimos. Vanderjagt claimed he really wanted to return to Toronto and his hometown \\"regardless of what NFL team called\\" as he missed the sport, missed the area, and missed his friends and family, which include his wife Janalyn and their 9-year-old son Jay Michael. He was released by the Argonauts on his request on May 28, 2009. Personal life Vanderjagt appeared in a Walt Disney film called The Garbage Picking Field Goal Kicking Philadelphia Phenomenon, where he was a stunt double for Tony Danza as a place kicker for the Philadelphia Eagles.

During the 1987-88 season he held the World fastest Man title, breaking both the 100m and the 60m indoor World Records. He was stripped of his gold medals in the 100 metres at the 1987 World Championships and 1988 Summer Olympics after being disqualified for doping. Biography=Career background Benjamin Johnson was born in Falmouth, Jamaica, and immigrated to Canada in 1976, residing in Scarborough, Ontario. Johnson met coach Charlie Francis and joined the Scarborough Optimists track and field club, training at York University. Francis was a Canadian 100 metres sprint champion himself (1970, 1971 and 1973) and a member of the Canadian team for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Francis was also Canada's national sprint coach for nine years. Johnson's first international success came when he won 2 silver medals at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Australia. He finished behind Allan Wells of Scotland in the 100 metres with a time of 10.05 seconds and was a member of the Canadian 4 √ó 100 metres relay team which finished behind Nigeria. This success was not repeated at the 1983 World Championships in Helsinki, where he was eliminated in the semi-finals, finishing 6th with a time of 10.44, nor at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas where Johnson placed 5th in the 100 metres final with a time of 10.25. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he reached the 100 metres final; after a false start, he won the bronze medal behind Carl Lewis and Sam Graddy with a time of 10.22. He also won a bronze medal with the Canadian 4 √ó 100 m relay team of Johnson, Tony Sharpe, Desai Williams and Sterling Hinds, who ran a time of 38.70. By the end of the 1984 season, Johnson had established himself as Canada's top sprinter, and on August 22 in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, he bettered Williams' Canadian record of 10.17 by running 10.12. In 1985, after eight consecutive losses, Johnson finally beat Carl Lewis. Other success against Lewis included the 1986 Goodwill Games, where Johnson beat Lewis, running 9.95 for first place, against Lewis' third-place time of 10.06. He broke Houston McTear's seven-year-old world record in the 60 metres in 1986, with a time of 6.50 seconds. He also won Commonwealth gold at the 1986 games in Edinburgh, beating Linford Christie for the 100 metres title with a time of 10.07. Johnson also led the Canadian 4x100 metres relay team to gold, and won a bronze in the 200 metres. Also in 1986, Canadian sprinter Mike Dwyer expressed concern that the use of drugs had reached \\"epidemic proportions\\" among Canadian sprinters, particularly among those who trained in the Toronto area. Atlee Mahorn also speculated that many sprinters were on steroids.\\"Sprinter Says Drug Use at epidemic proportions\\". The Ottawa Citizen, Dec. 6, 1986. via Google News. On April 29, 1987, Johnson was invested as a Member of the Order of Canada. \\"World record holder for the indoor 60-meter run, this Ontarian has proved himself to be the world's fastest human being and has broken Canadian, Commonwealth and World Cup 100-meter records,\\" it read. \\"Recipient of the Norton Crowe Award for Male Athlete of the Year for 1985, 'Big Ben' was the winner of the 1986 Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada's top athlete.\\" By the time of the 1987 World Championships, Johnson had won his four previous races with Lewis and had established himself as the best 100 metres sprinter. At Rome, Johnson gained instant world fame and confirmed this status when he beat Lewis for the title, setting a new world record of 9.83 seconds as well, beating Calvin Smith's former record by a full tenth of a second. After Rome, Johnson became a lucrative marketing celebrity. According to coach Charlie Francis, after breaking the world record, Johnson earned about $480,000 a month in endorsements.Jad Adrian (June 7, 2011). \\"Interesting Facts about Ben Johnson (Sprinter)\\". www. adriansprints.com. Retrieved June 25, 2011. Johnson won both the Lou Marsh Trophy and Lionel Conacher Award, and was named the Associated Press Athlete of the Year for 1987. Following Johnson's defeat of Lewis in Rome, Lewis started trying to explain away his defeat. He first claimed that Johnson had false-started, then he alluded to a stomach virus which had weakened him. Finally, without naming names, Lewis said \\"There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. I don't think they are doing it without drugs.\\" This was the start of Lewis' calling on the sport of track and field to be cleaned up in terms of the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. While cynics noted that the problem had been in the sport for many years, they pointed out that it did not become a cause for Lewis until he was actually defeated, with some also pointing to Lewis's egotistical attitude and lack of humility. During a controversial interview with the BBC, Lewis said: > There are gold medallists at this meet who are on drugs, that [100 metres] > race will be looked at for many years, for more reasons than one. Johnson's response was: > When Carl Lewis was winning everything, I never said a word against him. And > when the next guy comes along and beats me, I won't complain about that > either. This set up the rivalry leading into the 1988 Olympic Games. In 1988, Johnson experienced a number of setbacks to his running career. In February of that year he pulled a hamstring, and in May he aggravated the same injury. Meanwhile, in Paris in June, Lewis ran a 9.99. Then in Zurich, Switzerland on August 17, the two faced each other for the first time since the 1987 World Championships; Lewis won in 9.93, while Johnson finished third in 10.00. \\"The gold medal for the (Olympic) 100 meters is mine,\\" Carl Lewis said. \\"I will never again lose to Johnson.\\" Olympic games and subsequent disqualification On September 24, 1988, Johnson was thought to be the first sprinter from Canada since Percy Williams in 1928 to win the 100 metres final at the Summer Olympics in Seoul, lowering his own world record to 9.79 seconds. Johnson would later remark that he would have been even faster had he not raised his hand in the air just before he hit the tape. However, Park Jong-sei of the Olympic Doping Control Center found that Johnson's urine sample contained stanozolol, and he was disqualified three days later. He later admitted having used steroids when he ran his 1987 world record, which caused the IAAF to rescind that record as well. Johnson and coach Francis complained that they used performance-enhancing agents in order to remain on equal footing with the other top athletes. In testimony before the Dubin Inquiry into drug use in sport, Francis charged that Johnson was only one of many cheaters, and he just happened to get caught. Later, six of the eight finalists of the 100 metres race tested positive for banned drugs or were implicated in a drug scandal at some point in their careers: Carl Lewis, who was given the gold medal; Linford Christie, who was moved up to the silver medal and went on to win gold at the next Games; Dennis Mitchell, who was moved up to fourth place and finished third to Christie in 1992; and Desai Williams, Johnson's countryman who won a bronze medal in the 4 √ó 100 metres relay at the Los Angeles Games in 1984. Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, a vocal critic of the IOC testing procedures, is the author of Speed Trap, which features Johnson heavily. In the book, he freely admits that his athletes were taking anabolic steroids, as he claims all top athletes at the time were, and also claims that Johnson could not possibly have tested positive for that particular steroid since Johnson actually preferred furazabol. He thought stanozolol made his body \\"feel tight\\". The numerous athletes using performance-enhancing drugs at the time understood how long before a race, and possible drug test, they should stop using the drugs. Johnson later claimed that Andr√© A. Jackson, Lewis' Santa Monica Track Club teammate, who was inside the drug testing room in Seoul, may have placed the stanozolol in one of the beers Johnson drank in order to make urine for his test. On 28 September 2018, the Toronto Star ran an article on the lab report which was created on Johnson's sample during the 1988 Olympic Games. It was produced by the IOC Doping Control Center in Seoul two days after Johnson handed in a urine sample taken after the 100m final. The newspaper concluded that the assumed substance Stanozolol was traceable, but \\"inconsistencies\\" are found in the report. The Toronto Star article goes on state that no Canadian Olympic team official saw the lab report in Seoul. The lab report was requested by Canada's chief medical officer, Dr. William Stanish. The Canadian team didn't object after the IOC Medical Commission assured \\"that its testing methods were unassailable.\\" =The Canadian reaction= Canadians rejoiced in the reflected glory of winning the gold medal and breaking the world record.Toronto celebrates Johnson's 'Fastest Man' titl e Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney watched Johnson set the new world record and after the race congratulated him over the phone. \\"It's a marvellous evening for Canada,\\" Mulroney said in the televised conversation.\\"Congratulating Canada's golden hero\\". The National, September 24, 1988. CBC Digital Archives, Newspapers covered the occasion by concocting words such as \\"Benfastic\\" (Toronto Star, September 25, 1988) to describe it. Two days later, Canadians witnessed the downfall of Johnson, when he was stripped of his gold medal and world record. Mark Tewksbury, a Canadian Olympic swimmer hung a bed sheet banner out of his Olympic Village apartment window expressing 'Hero to Zero in 9.79'. In the first week following the dethroning, Canadian newspapers devoted between five and eight pages a day to the story. Some squarely placed the blame on Johnson, such as one headline right after the exposure suggests: \\"Why, Ben?\\" (Toronto Sun, September 26, 1988). Because of the Olympic scandal, the Canadian news agency Canadian Press named Johnson \\"Newsmaker of the Year\\" for 1988. =The Dubin Inquiry= After the Seoul test, he initially denied doping, but, testifying before the 1989 Dubin Inquiry, a Canadian government investigation into drug abuse, Johnson admitted that he had lied. Charlie Francis, his coach, told the inquiry that Johnson had been using steroids since 1981. In Canada, the federal government established the Commission of Inquiry Into the Use of Drugs and Banned Practices Intended to Increase Athletic Performance, headed by Ontario Appeal Court Chief Justice Charles Dubin. The Dubin Inquiry (as it became known), which was televised live, heard hundreds of hours of testimony about the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs among athletes. The inquiry began in January 1989 and lasted 91 days, with 122 witnesses called, including athletes, coaches, sport administrators, IOC representatives, doctors and government officials. Comeback In 1991, after his suspension ended, he attempted a comeback. He returned to the track for the Hamilton Indoor Games in 1991 and was greeted by the largest crowd to ever attend an indoor Canadian track and field event. More than 17,000 people saw him finish second in the 50 metres in 5.77 seconds. He failed to qualify for the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo but made the Canadian Olympic team again in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain after finishing second at the Canadian Olympic trials to Bruny Surin. He missed the 100 metre finals at the Olympics, however, finishing last in his semi-final heat after stumbling out of the blocks. In 1993, he won the 50 metres on January 7 in Grenoble, France, in 5.65 seconds, just 0.04 seconds shy of the world record. However, he was again found guilty of doping just after the race ‚Äì this time for excess testosterone ‚Äì and was subsequently banned for life by the IAAF. Federal amateur sport minister Pierre Cadieux called Johnson a national disgrace, and suggested he consider moving back to Jamaica. Johnson commented that it was \\"by far the most disgusting comment [he had] ever heard\\". In April 1999, a Canadian adjudicator ruled that there were procedural errors in Johnson's lifetime ban and allowed him to appeal. The decision meant Johnson could technically run in Canada but nobody would compete against him. They would be considered \\"contaminated\\" by the IAAF and could also face sanctions. On June 12, 1999, Johnson entered a track meet in Kitchener, Ontario, and was forced to run alone, against the clock. He posted a time of 11.0 seconds. In late 1999, Johnson failed a drug test for the third time by testing positive for hydrochlorothiazide, a banned diuretic that can be used to mask the presence of other drugs. Johnson had not competed since 1993 and had arranged the test himself as part of his efforts to be reinstated. In 1999, Johnson made headlines again when it was revealed that he had been hired by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to act as a football coach for his son, Al-Saadi Gaddafi, who aspired to join an Italian football club. Al-Saadi ultimately did join an Italian team but was sacked after one game when he failed a drug test. Johnson's publicist in Canada had predicted in The Globe and Mail that his training of the young Gaddafi would earn Johnson a Nobel Peace Prize. Late 1990s and beyond Johnson briefly acted as trainer for Argentine football player Diego Maradona in 1997. This occurred at York University, Toronto. In 1998, Johnson appeared in a charity race in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, where he raced against a thoroughbred race horse, a harness racing horse and a stock car. Johnson finished third in the race. According to a 1998 article in Outside magazine, Johnson spent much of the latter part of the 1990s living downstairs in the house he shared with his mother Gloria. He spent his leisure time reading, watching movies, and taking his mother to church. He lived in a spacious home in Newmarket, Ontario's Stonehaven neighborhood. He claims to have lost his Ferrari when he used it as collateral for a loan from an acquaintance in order to make a house payment. His mother died of cancer in 2004 and Johnson lived with his sister afterwards. Shortly after his leaving Libya, it was reported that Johnson had been robbed of $7,300 by a Romani gang in Rome. His wallet was taken, containing $7,300 in cash, the proceeds of his pay for training Gaddafi. Johnson gave chase, but was unable to catch them after they vanished into a subway station. In May 2005, Johnson launched a clothing and sports supplement line, the Ben Johnson Collection. The motto for Johnson's clothing line was \\"Catch Me\\"; however, the clothing line never caught on. In a January 1, 2006 interview, Johnson claimed that he was sabotaged by a \\"Mystery Man\\" inside the doping-control room immediately following the 100 metres final in Seoul. He also stated that 40% of people in the sports world are still taking drugs to improve their performance. In August 2008, Johnson filed a $37 million lawsuit against the estate of his former lawyer Ed Futerman, claiming Futerman made unauthorized payments from his trust account to pay bills and 20 percent commissions to a hairdresser recruited by the lawyer to act as the sprinter's sports agent. In 2012, the lawsuit was dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court by summary judgment on the basis that \\"there were no genuine issues raised requiring a trial\\". At present, Johnson lives in Markham, Ontario and spends much of his time with his daughter and granddaughter. He also continues to coach, notably with New Jersey Devils defenseman P.K. Subban. In 2010, he released his autobiography entitled Seoul to Soul. In the self-published book, Johnson reviews his childhood in Jamaica, and his early bout with malaria. A Canadian Press article described the book as \\"an unconventional sports autobiography.\\" Acting career In March 2006, television spots featuring Johnson advertising an energy drink, \\"Cheetah Power Surge\\", started to receive some airtime. Some pundits questioned whether Johnson was an appropriate spokesperson for an all natural energy drink considering his history of steroid use. One ad is a mock interview between Johnson and Frank D'Angelo, the president and chief executive of D'Angelo Brands, which makes the drink, in which he asks Johnson: \\"Ben, when you run, do you Cheetah?\\" \\"Absolutely,\\" says Johnson. \\"I Cheetah all the time.\\" The other commercial includes Johnson and a cheetah, the world's fastest land animal, and encourages viewers to \\"go ahead and Cheetah.\\" In May 2017, Ben appeared in an advertising campaign for Australia's leading mobile bookmaker, Sportsbet. The campaign launches Sportsbet's new Android app, and Ben cheekily says it \\"has tested positive for speed and power, again and again\\". The campaign tagline is \\"Putting the 'Roid in Android\\" and concludes with Ben in the starters block on a racing track, telling punters to \\"get on it!\\" The ad can be found on YouTube. Documentaries The CBC radio documentary series Rewind broadcast an episode titled Ben Johnson: A Hero Disgraced CBC: Ben Johnson: A hero disgraced - CBC Rewind turns back clock to 1988 Seoul Olympics on September 19, 2013, for the 25th anniversary of the race, revealing 20 athletes tested positive for drugs but were cleared by the IOC at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. An International Olympic Committee (IOC) official told the CBC that endocrine profiles done at those games indicated that 80 percent of the track and field athletes tested showed evidence of long-term steroid use, although few were banned or had their medals stripped.

Ale-8 could be described as a ginger pop with a \\"kick\\". It is a ginger and citrus blend, containing less carbonation and fewer calories than conventional soda. It is bottled by the Ale-8-One Bottling Company in Winchester, Kentucky. History The formula for Ale-8-One was developed by soda bottler G. L. Wainscott in the 1920s.Walton, p. 11 Wainscott, who had been in the soda business in Winchester, Kentucky since 1902, had developed Roxa-Kola, his previous flagship product, in 1906. In creating the formula for Ale-8-One, Wainscott drew upon his knowledge of ginger-based recipes acquired in northern Europe. Wainscott began bottling Ale-8-One in 1926. To choose a name for the drink, he sponsored a name-the-product contest. \\"A Late One\\" was chosen as the winning entry. The \\"Ale-8-One\\" name is a pun of the phrase suggesting that his product was \\"the latest thing\\" in soft drinks. In 1935, Wainscott purchased a livery stable in Winchester and converted it to a bottling factory to expand his operation. Upon Wainscott's death in 1944, half of his company stock went to his wife; the other half was divided among his employees. When his wife died in 1954, her stock was left to her brother, Frank A. Rogers, Sr. Rogers bought the remaining company stock in 1962 and incorporated the Ale-8-One Bottling Company. He named his son, Frank Rogers, Jr., manager of the new company. The Ale-8-One Bottling Company constructed a new plant in Winchester in 1965. It ceased production of Roxa-Kola in 1968, and by 1974, had halted production of all its other drinks to focus on Ale-8-One. The company remains under the control of the Rogers family. Composition The recipe for Ale-8 is a closely guarded family secret. Reportedly, only two executives‚Äîformer company president Frank A. Rogers III and his oldest son, Fielding Rogers, the current president‚Äîknow the exact composition. In 2003, the company announced limited distribution of Diet Ale-8, its first new product since the introduction of the original Ale-8 in 1926. Diet Ale 8 contains 44 mg of caffeine and no sugars. The diet variety is sweetened with a mixture of acesulfame potassium and sucralose. Caffeine Free Diet Ale 8 followed in March 2011. In addition to not having any caffeine, it is also sweetened with Splenda. In 2018, Cherry Ale 8 was released, making it the first flavored Ale-8-One. It was first available exclusively in fountain drink form, then it became available in bottles.\\"Cherry Ale-8-One on sale in Louisville May 25 at only one location\\". WDRB. May 24, 2018.

In April 2001, the Ale-8-One Bottling Company expanded its distribution to areas of southern Ohio, and southern Indiana, through an agreement with Coca-Cola Enterprises. Later, distribution to eastern Tennessee and far western Virginia was added. It is also available in some parts of West Virginia. In July 2015, Ale-8 announced plans to expand production into Indianapolis.

Acclaimed by critics as a masterpiece when a hastily transcribed version was finally published in 1924, it quickly took its place as a classic second only to Moby-Dick among Melville's works. Budd is a \\"handsome sailor\\" who strikes and inadvertently kills his false accuser, Master-at-arms John Claggart. The ship's Captain, Edward Vere, recognizes the innocence of Budd's intent but the law of mutiny requires him to sentence Billy to be hanged. Melville began work on it in November 1886, revising and expanding from time to time, but left the manuscript in disarray. Melville's widow Elizabeth began to edit the manuscript for publication, but was not able to decide her husband's intentions at key points, even his intended title. Raymond M. Weaver, Melville's first biographer, was given the manuscript and published the 1924 version, which was marred by misinterpretation of Elizabeth's queries, misreadings of Melville's difficult handwriting, and even inclusion of a preface Melville had cut. Melville scholars Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts Jr. published what is considered the best transcription and critical reading text in 1962. In 2017, Northwestern University Press published a \\"new reading text\\" based on a \\"corrected version\\" of Hayford and Sealts' genetic text prepared by G. Thomas Tanselle. Billy Budd has been adapted into film, a stage play, and an opera. Plot Billy Budd is a seaman impressed into service aboard HMS Bellipotent in the year 1797, when the Royal Navy was reeling from two major mutinies and was threatened by the Revolutionary French Republic's military ambitions. He is impressed to this large warship from another, smaller, merchant ship, The Rights of Man (named after the book by Thomas Paine). As his former ship moves off, Budd shouts, \\"Good-bye to you too, old Rights-of-Man.\\" Billy, a foundling from Bristol, has an innocence, good looks and a natural charisma that make him popular with the crew. He has a stutter, which becomes more noticeable when under intense emotion. He arouses the antagonism of the ship's master-at- arms, John Claggart. Claggart, while not unattractive, seems somehow \\"defective or abnormal in the constitution\\", possessing a \\"natural depravity.\\" Envy is Claggart's explicitly stated emotion toward Budd, foremost because of his \\"significant personal beauty,\\" and also for his innocence and general popularity. (Melville further opines that envy is \\"universally felt to be more shameful than even felonious crime.\\") This leads Claggart to falsely charge Billy with conspiracy to mutiny. When the captain, Edward Fairfax \\"Starry\\" Vere, is presented with Claggart's charges, he summons Claggart and Billy to his cabin for a private meeting. Claggart makes his case and Billy, astounded, is unable to respond, due to his stutter. In his extreme frustration he strikes out at Claggart, killing him instantly. Vere convenes a drumhead court-martial. He acts as convening authority, prosecutor, defense counsel and sole witness (except for Billy). He intervenes in the deliberations of the court-martial panel to persuade them to convict Billy, despite their and his beliefs in Billy's moral innocence. (Vere says in the moments following Claggart's death, \\"Struck dead by an angel of God! Yet the angel must hang!\\") Vere claims to be following the letter of the Mutiny Act and the Articles of War. Although Vere and the other officers do not believe Claggart's charge of conspiracy and think Billy justified in his response, they find that their own opinions matter little. The martial law in effect states that during wartime the blow itself, fatal or not, is a capital crime. The court-martial convicts Billy following Vere's argument that any appearance of weakness in the officers and failure to enforce discipline could stir more mutiny throughout the British fleet. Condemned to be hanged the morning after his attack on Claggart, Billy before his execution says, \\"God bless Captain Vere!\\" His words were repeated by the gathered crew in a \\"resonant and sympathetic echo.\\" The novel closes with three chapters that present ambiguity: * Chapter 28 describes the death of Captain Vere. In a naval action against the French ship, Ath√©e (the Atheist), Captain Vere is mortally wounded. His last words are \\"Billy Budd, Billy Budd.\\" * Chapter 29 presents an extract from an official naval gazette purporting to give the facts of the fates of John Claggart and Billy Budd aboard HMS Bellipotent ‚Äì but the \\"facts\\" offered turn the facts that the reader learned from the story upside down. The gazette article described Budd as a conspiring mutineer likely of foreign birth and mysterious antecedents who is confronted by John Claggart. The master-at-arms, loyally enforcing the law, is fatally stabbed by Budd. The gazette concludes that the crime and weapon used suggest a foreign birth and subversive character; it reports that the mutineer was executed and nothing is amiss aboard HMS Bellipotent. * Chapter 30 is a cheaply printed ballad, \\"Billy in the Darbies,\\" written by one of Billy's shipmates as an elegy. The adult, experienced man represented in the poem is not the innocent youth portrayed in the preceding chapters. Composition history The last known image of the author, taken in 1885. Composed fitfully over the last five years of his life, the novella Billy Budd represents Melville's return to prose fiction after three decades of only writing poetry. Melville had a difficult time writing, describing his process with Moby-Dick as follows: \\"Taking a book off the brain is akin to the ticklish & dangerous business of taking an old painting off a panel‚Äîyou have to scrape off the whole business in order to get at it with safety.\\" The \\"scrapings\\" of Billy Budd lie in the 351 leaves of manuscript now in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. The state of this manuscript has been described as \\"chaotic,\\" with a bewildering array of corrections, cancellations, cut and pasted leaves, annotations by several hands, and with at least two different attempts made at a fair copy. The composition proceeded in three general phases, as shown by the Melville scholars Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., who did an extensive study of the original papers from 1953 to 1962. They concluded from the evidence of the paper used at each stage, the writing instruments (pencil, pen, color of ink), insertions, and crossings out that Melville introduced the three main characters in three stages of composition: first Billy, in a draft of what became \\"Billy in the Darbies\\"; then Claggart: and finally Vere. The work started as a poem, a ballad entitled \\"Billy in the Darbies\\", which Melville intended for his book, John Marr and Other Sailors. He added a short, prose head-note to introduce the speaker and set the scene. The character of \\"Billy\\" in this early version was an older man condemned for inciting mutiny and apparently guilty as charged. He did not include the poem in his published book. Melville incorporated the ballad and expanded the head-note sketch into a story that eventually reached 150 manuscript pages. This was the first of the three major expansions, each related to one of the principal characters. As the focus of his attention shifted from one to another of these three principals, he modified the plot and thematic emphasis. Because Melville never entirely finished the revisions, critics have been divided as to where the emphasis lay and to Melville's intentions. After Melville's death, his wife Elizabeth, who had acted as his amanuensis on other projects, scribbled notes and conjectures, corrected spelling, sorted leaves and, in some instances, wrote over her husband's faint writing. She tried to follow through on what she perceived as her husband's objectives but her editing was confusing to the first professional editors, Weaver and Freeman, who mistook her writing for Melville's. For instance, she put several pages into a folder and marked it \\"Preface?\\" indicating that she did not know what her husband had intended. At some point Elizabeth Melville placed the manuscript in \\"a japanned tin box\\" with the author's other literary materials, where it remained undiscovered for another 28 years. Publication history First edition cover page, 1924. In August 1918, Raymond M. Weaver, a professor at Columbia University, doing research for what would become the first biography of Melville, paid a visit to Melville's granddaughter, Eleanor Melville Metcalf, at her South Orange, New Jersey home. She gave him access to all the records of Melville that survived in the family: manuscripts, letters, journals, annotated books, photographs, and a variety of other material. Among these papers, Weaver was astonished to find a substantial manuscript for an unknown prose work entitled Billy Budd. After producing a text that would later be described as \\"hastily transcribed\\", he published the first edition of the work in 1924 as Billy Budd, Foretopman in Volume XIII of the Standard Edition of Melville's Complete Works (London: Constable and Company). In 1928 he published another version of the text which, despite numerous variations, may be considered essentially the same text. F. Barron Freeman published a second text in 1948, edited on different principles, as Melville's Billy Budd (Cambridge: Harvard University Press). He believed he stayed closer to what Melville wrote, but still relied on Weaver's text, with what are now considered mistaken assumptions and textual errors. Subsequent editions of Billy Budd up through the early 1960s are, strictly speaking, versions of one or the other of these two basic texts.Hayford & Sealts, pp. 12‚Äì23 After several years of study, in 1962, Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., established what is now considered the correct, authoritative text. It was published by the University of Chicago Press, and contains both a \\"reading\\" and a \\"genetic\\" text. Most editions printed since then follow the Hayford-Sealts text. Based on the confusing manuscripts, the published versions had many variations. For example, early versions gave the book's title as Billy Budd, Foretopman, while it now seems clear Melville intended Billy Budd, Sailor: (An Inside Narrative); some versions wrongly included as a preface a chapter that Melville had excised (the correct text has no preface). In addition, some early versions did not follow his change of the name of the ship to Bellipotent (from the Latin bellum war and potens powerful), from Indomitable, as Melville called it in an earlier draft. It is unclear of his full intentions in changing the name of the ship since he used the name Bellipotent only six times.Hayford & Sealts, pp. 20 Literary significance and reception The book has undergone a number of substantial, critical reevaluations in the years since its discovery. Raymond Weaver, its first editor, was initially unimpressed and described it as \\"not distinguished\\". After its publication debut in England, and with critics of such caliber as D. H. Lawrence and John Middleton Murry hailing it as a masterpiece, Weaver changed his mind. In the introduction to its second edition in the 1928 Shorter Novels of Herman Melville, he declared: \\"In Pierre, Melville had hurled himself into a fury of vituperation against the world; with Billy Budd he would justify the ways of God to man.\\" Outside of the English-speaking world, Thomas Mann declared Billy Budd \\"one of the most beautiful stories in the world\\" which \\"made his heart wide open\\" and declared that he wished he had written the dying scene of Billy.Andreas Platthaus: Melvilles 200. Geburtstag : Oh, h√§tte ich das geschrieben!, FAZ, August 1, 2019 (German) In mid-1924 Murry orchestrated the reception of Billy Budd, Foretopman, first in London, in the influential Times Literary Supplement, in an essay called \\"Herman Melville's Silence\\" (July 10, 1924), then in a reprinting of the essay, slightly expanded, in The New York Times Book Review (August 10, 1924). In relatively short order he and several other influential British literati had managed to canonize Billy Budd, placing it alongside Moby-Dick as one of the great books of Western literature. Wholly unknown to the public until 1924, Billy Budd by 1926 had joint billing with the book that had just recently been firmly established as a literary masterpiece. In its first text and subsequent texts, and as read by different audiences, the book has kept that high status ever since. In 1990 the Melville biographer and scholar Hershel Parker pointed out that all the early estimations of Billy Budd were based on readings from the flawed transcription texts of Weaver. Some of these flaws were crucial to an understanding of Melville's intent, such as the famous \\"coda\\" at the end of the chapter containing the news account of the death of the \\"admirable\\" John Claggart and the \\"depraved\\" William Budd (25 in Weaver, 29 in Hayford & Sealts reading text, 344Ba in the genetic text) : Weaver: \\"Here ends a story not unwarranted by what happens in this incongruous world of ours‚Äîinnocence and 'infirmary', spiritual depravity and fair 'respite'.\\" The Ms: \\"Here ends a story not unwarranted by what happens in this {word undeciphered} world of ours‚Äîinnocence and 'infamy', spiritual depravity and fair 'repute'.\\" Melville had written this as an end- note after his second major revision. When he enlarged the book with the third major section, developing Captain Vere, he deleted the end-note, as it no longer applied to the expanded story. Many of the early readers, such as Murry and Freeman, thought this passage was a foundational statement of Melville's philosophical views on life. Parker wonders what they could possibly have understood from the passage as written. Analysis and interpretations Hershel Parker agrees that \\"masterpiece\\" is an appropriate description of the book, but he adds a proviso. > Examining the history and reputation of Billy Budd has left me more > convinced than before that it deserves high stature (although not precisely > the high stature it holds, whatever that stature is) and more convinced that > it is a wonderfully teachable story‚Äîas long as it is not taught as a > finished, complete, coherent, and totally interpretable work of art. Given this unfinished quality and Melville's reluctance to present clear lessons, the range of critical response is not surprising. Some critics have interpreted Billy Budd as a historical novel that attempts to evaluate man's relation to the past. Thomas J. Scorza has written about the philosophical framework of the story. He understands the work as a comment on the historical feud between poets and philosophers. By this interpretation, Melville is opposing the scientific, rational systems of thought, which Claggart's character represents, in favor of the more comprehensive poetic pursuit of knowledge embodied by Billy. The centrality of Billy Budd's extraordinary good looks in the novella, where he is described by Captain Vere as \\"the young fellow who seems so popular with the men‚ÄîBilly, the Handsome Sailor\\",Melville, Herman (1995) [1924] Billy Budd, Sailor, Penguin Popular Classics, p. 54 have led to interpretations of a homoerotic sensibility in the novel. Laura Mulvey added a theory of scopophilia and masculine and feminine subjectivity/objectivity. This version tends to inform interpretations of Britten's opera, perhaps owing to the composer's own homosexuality. In her book Epistemology of the Closet (1990/2008), Eve Sedgwick, expanding on earlier interpretations of the same themes, posits that the interrelationships between Billy, Claggart and Captain Vere are representations of male homosexual desire and the mechanisms of prohibition against this desire. She points out that Claggart's \\"natural depravity,\\" which is defined tautologically as \\"depravity according to nature,\\" and the accumulation of equivocal terms (\\"phenomenal\\", \\"mystery\\", etc.) used in the explanation of the fault in his character, are an indication of his status as the central homosexual figure in the text. She also interprets the mutiny scare aboard the Bellipotent, the political circumstances that are at the center of the events of the story, as a portrayal of homophobia. Melville's dramatic presentation of the contradiction between the requirements of the law and the needs of humanity made the novella an \\"iconic text\\" in the field of law and literature. Earlier readers viewed Captain Vere as good man trapped by bad law. Richard Weisberg, who holds degrees in both comparative literature and law, argued that Vere was wrong to play the roles of witness, prosecutor, judge and executioner, and that he went beyond the law when he sentenced Billy to immediate hanging.Tom Goldstein, \\"The Law: Once Again, Billy Budd is Standing Trial,\\" New York Times June 10, 1989 Based on his study of statutory law and practices in the Royal Navy in the era in which the book takes place, Weisberg argues that Vere deliberately distorted the applicable substantive and procedural law to bring about Billy's death. Judge Richard Posner has sharply criticized these claims. He objects to ascribing literary significance to legal errors that are not part of the imagined world of Melville's fiction and accused Weisberg and others of calling Billy an \\"innocent man\\" and making light of the fact that he \\"struck a lethal blow to a superior officer in wartime.\\", pp. 211‚Äì23 H. Bruce Franklin sees a direct connection between the hanging of Budd and the controversy around capital punishment. While Melville was writing Billy Budd between 1886 and 1891, the public's attention was focused on the issue. Other commentators have suggested that the story may have been based on events on board USS Somers, an American naval vessel; Lt. Guert Gansevoort, a defendant in a later investigation, was a first cousin of Melville. If so then the character Billy Budd was likely inspired by a young man named Philip Spencer who was hanged on USS Somers on December 1, 1842. Harold Schechter, a professor who has written a number of books on American serial killers, has said that the author's description of Claggart could be considered to be a definition of a sociopath. He acknowledges that Melville was writing at a time before the word \\"sociopath\\" was used. Dr. Robert Hare might classify Claggart as a psychopath, since his personality did not demonstrate the traits of a sociopath (rule-breaking) but of grandiosity, conning manipulation and a lack of empathy or remorse. Adaptations in other media Charles Nolte as Billy Budd in the 1951 Broadway production The stage * In 1951, Louis O. Coxe and Robert Chapman's 1949 stage adaptation, Billy Budd, opened on Broadway, winning both the Donaldson Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards for best play. * The best-known adaptation is the opera Billy Budd, with a score by Benjamin Britten and a libretto by E. M. Forster and Eric Crozier. The opera follows the earlier text of 1924, and was premiered in December 1951 in a 4-act version. Britten, Forster and Crozier subsequently revised the opera into a 2-act version, which was first performed in January 1964. Scholar Hanna Rochlitz has studied the adaptation of the novella into this opera in detail. * Giorgio Ghedini also composed an Italian- language opera, premiered in 1949, adapted from the novella with a libretto by Salvatore Quasimodo based on the 1942 Italian translation by Eugenio Montale. The Ghedini opera has not been as widely performed as Britten's work. Film * Peter Ustinov produced, directed and worked on the script of his film version made in black and white in 1962, based on the stage play. It starred a young Terence Stamp as Billy Budd, and Ustinov took the role of Captain Vere. The movie also stars Robert Ryan as Claggart and David McCallum as Wyatt, Gunnery Officer. * Claire Denis' Beau Travail (1999), set in Djibouti, is loosely based on the novel.

It features such landmarks as the St. Boniface Cathedral, Boulevard Provencher, the Provencher Bridge, Esplanade Riel, St. Boniface Hospital, the Universit√© de Saint-Boniface and the Royal Canadian Mint. It covers the southeast part of the city and includes le Vieux Saint-Boniface (Old St. Boniface), Norwood West, Norwood East, Windsor Park, Niakwa Park, Niakwa Place, Southdale, Southland Park, Royalwood, Sage Creek and Island Lakes, plus a large industrial area. The ward is represented by Matt Allard, a member of Winnipeg City Council, and also corresponds to the neighbourhood clusters of St. Boniface East and West. The population was 58,520 according to the Canada 2016 Census. History St Boniface Cathedral Esplanade Riel at the edge of St Boniface Condominiums in St Boniface, Winnipeg Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years before European exploration. It was an area of historic Ojibwe occupation. Fur traders and European mercenaries hired by Lord Selkirk to protect his fledgling Red River Colony were among the area's first European settlers. With the founding of a Roman Catholic mission in 1818, St Boniface began its role in Canadian religious, political and cultural history ‚Äì as mother parish for many French settlements in Western Canada; as the birthplace of Louis Riel and fellow M√©tis who struggled to obtain favourable terms for Manitoba's entry into Confederation; and as a focus of resistance to controversial 1890 legislation to alter Manitoba's school system and abolish French as an official language in the province (see Manitoba Schools Question). French-speaking religious orders, including the Sisters of Charity of Montreal (better known as the Grey Nuns), who arrived in 1844, founded the early educational, cultural and social-service institutions, such as St. Boniface Hospital, the first in Western Canada. Early French-speaking missionary Catholic priests in the region founded the Coll√®ge de Saint- Boniface (dating to 1818) to teach Latin and general humanities to the local boys; it is now the Universit√© de Saint-Boniface. St Boniface was incorporated as a town in 1883 and as a city in 1908. The early economy was oriented to agriculture. Industrialization arrived in the early 20th century. The Union Stockyards, developed 1912‚Äì13, became the largest livestock exchange in Canada and a centre of the meat-packing and -processing industry. By the early 1900s, numerous light and heavy industries were established. Today the Stockyards site will be redeveloped into a housing and retail area Olexa Developments of Calgary beginning in 2020. In Phase 1 of the development, up to 600 housing units would be constructed. In the 1950s and 1960s the neighbourhoods of Windsor Park and Southdale developed into residential areas. In 2016 Windsor Park had a population of 10,050 and Southdale had a population of 6,450. In 1971, St. Boniface was amalgamated, along with several neighbouring communities, into the City of Winnipeg. As one of the larger French communities outside Qu√©bec, it has often been a centre of struggles to preserve French-Canadian language and culture within Manitoba. Culture CCFM Building in St. Boniface The Festival du Voyageur is held annually in February outdoors at Whittier Park and Fort Gibraltar. St Boniface is home to the Centre culturel franco-manitobain (CCFM), which features an art gallery, theatres, meeting rooms, and a community radio station.

According to the 2016 Canadian Census, 40,975 residents of the province stated that French was their mother tongue. In the same census, 148,810 Manitobans claimed to have either full or partial French ancestry. There are several Franco-Manitoban communities throughout Manitoba, although the majority are based in either the Winnipeg Capital Region or the Eastman Region. The first francophones to enter the region were fur traders during the late 17th century, with the first French settlers arriving in the subsequent century. Francophones constituted the majority of the region's non- First Nations population until mid 19th century, when anglophones became the linguistic majority. In 1869, the Red River Rebellion was sparked by a group of M√©tis francophones, eventually resulting in the admittance of the Red River Colony as a bilingual province of Canada. However, the provincial government moved to revoke the linguistic rights accorded to francophones late 19th and early 20th centuries. Restoration of these linguistic rights did not begin until 1970, when French was made an official language of its public education system. The linguistic rights of Franco-Manitobans was also furthered as a result of several decisions made by the Supreme Court of Canada during the 1980s and 1990s. Demographics According to the 2016 Canadian Census, the number of people that reported French as a mother tongue in Manitoba was 46,055 (or 3.7 per cent of the population), making it the most common mother tongue in the province after English, German, and Tagalog. The majority of Franco-Manitobans are bilingual in English and French, with only 1,485 respondents (0.1 per cent of Manitobans) in the 2016 census reporting they only had proficiency in the French language. There were 108,455 Manitobans or 8.6 per cent of the population that reported to be bilingual in English and French, although the following figure includes Manitobans that speak French as a second language. Nearly three quarters of all Franco-Manitobans (74 per cent of the population) were born in the province. Approximately 15 per cent of francophones in Manitoba were born elsewhere in Canada, whereas the remaining francophones that reside in the province were born outside the country. Among French-speaking migrants that settled into Manitoba, the approximately 57 per cent originated from Africa, while 28 per cent originated from Europe. In the 2016 census, 148,810 Manitobans reported having partial or full French ancestry. Communities Francophone communities in Manitoba is concentrated in southern Manitoba, along corridors that follows the Seine and Red River of the North towards Lake Manitoba. Four out of five francophones in the province residing in either the Winnipeg Capital Region, and Eastman Region. Approximately 58 per cent of all francophones reside in the Winnipeg Capital Region, while 22 per cent reside in Eastman Region. Approximately 90 per cent of all Franco-Manitobans live within an hour's drive from Winnipeg. There also exists francophone communities outside those regions, including Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes, St. Claude, Sainte Rose du Lac, and St. Laurent. Including the capital, there are 15 communities in the province that are officially designated as bilingual areas. History The first French speakers to visit Manitoba occurred in the 1660s, with French fur traders and explorers exploring the region around Hudson's Bay. However, the first attempts by francophones to settle the area did not occur until the 1730s, with French explorer Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V√©rendrye and his sons establishing a permanent presence in southern Manitoba. A number of francophone fur traders married √† la fa√ßon du pays, wedding First Nations wives whose children eventually developed a unique M√©tis identity. Until the mid-19th century, fur traders continued to encompass the majority of Europeans in the region, with francophone French Canadians and M√©tis constituting the majority of the region's population. Members of the Red River provisional government established in 1870, which included a number of francophone M√©tis. The provisional government pressured the Canadian government to guarantee certain M√©tis and francophone rights in Manitoba. In 1869, the government of Canada dispatched surveyors to survey Rupert's Land, with the transfer of the territory expected to occur in the next year. However, Louis Riel and a group of M√©tis took control of Red River Colony, and declared a provisional government; refusing entry to Canadian government surveyors and resulting the Red River Rebellion. The provisional government provided a list of terms for the colony's entry into Canadian Confederation, including land provisions for the M√©tis, and linguistic and religious rights for its francophone Catholic population. The Canadian government eventually consented to the terms, with Manitoba formally made a province of confederation in the Manitoba Act in 1870, with English and French made the province's official language.Manitoba Act, 1870 , s. 23. In 1871, there were about 5,500 francophones in the province almost all of whom were M√©tis, and comprised more than half of the province's population. However within the next ten years, francophones became a demographic minority in Manitoba as settlers from Ontario moved into the province in large numbers. In 1890, the provincial government moved to remove the linguistic rights of francophones, with the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba passing an Act that made the English language the sole official language of the province.An Act to Provide that the English Language shall be the Official Language of the Province of Manitoba, S.M. 1890, c. 14. In the same year, the province also moved to eliminate its separate school system, used predominantly by francophone Catholics. The resulting issue led to the Manitoba Schools Question, which became a contentious issue between English and French Canada. In 1896, the provincial and federal governments reached a compromise in which the separate school system would not be re-instituted, but religious and French language instruction would take place in the secular school system under certain conditions, and where francophone numbers warranted it. French language instruction continued to be permitted until March 1916, when the provincial legislature passed the Thornton Act, which repealed the aforementioned compromise, and forbade the use of any language other than English as the language of instruction in schools. The following act was passed in an effort to homogenize the province with English as its dominant language, after it received an influx of migrants from non-English speaking countries. After the Thornton Act was passed, the Association d‚Äô√©ducation des Canadiens fran√ßais du Manitoba (A√âCFM) was formed by the Roman Catholic clergy, serving as an shadow ministry of education for Franco- Manitobans. The A√âCFM provided financial assistance for prospective francophone teachers, and encouraged francophone teachers to continue providing French language instruction illicitly. Francophone teachers who were able to continue teaching the French language were largely aided by the fact that the trustees of several school boards were effectively francophone- controlled. Additionally, many school inspectors that were sent to enforce the Thornton Act ignored infractions by francophone teachers; as they often relied on the A√âCFM to support their positions as inspectors. Formally however, French language instruction was not reintroduced in Manitoba's public school system until 1947, when it was introduced as a second language for secondary schools, and in 1955 for elementary schools. Use of the French language to teach other subjects was introduced in 1967, with teachers permitted to use the language for half of the school day. French would formally be reestablished as an official language of the provincial education system in 1970. Exterior of the Supreme Court of Canada building. During the latter half of the 20th century, the supreme court made a number of decisions that guaranteed the linguistic rights of Franco-Manitobans. An issue regarding the province's official language emerged during the late 1970s, when a francophone M√©tis received a parking ticket written only in English. The case served as a basis for a successful constitutional challenge, where the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the 1890 act that made English the only language of the legislature, and judiciary, was unconstitutional, as it conflicted with section 23 of the Manitoba Act. The decision effectively made the province a bilingual province again. However, the provincial government continued to move slowly in re-instituting bilingual programs, resulting in another Franco- Manitoban to use his own parking ticket to launch a legal challenge that all legislation from 1890 to 1979 passed only in English were unconstitutional. The resulting challenge caused significant tension between anglophones and Franco-Manitobans, with the Soci√©t√© franco-manitobaine offices firebombed in 1993. A reference question was eventually posed to the supreme court, who ruled in Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights, that all legislation not printed in English and French were invalid; although did provide the provincial government a grace period to correct any unilingual documents. Another supreme court decision in 1993 ruled that francophone minority were afforded the right to manage and control their own educational facilities. In order to comply with the supreme court's ruling, the Public Schools Amendment (francophone Schools Governance) Act was passed, establishing the Franco- manitoban School Division in 1994. In 2016, the Francophone Community Enhancement and Support Act was passed with unanimous support, and no vocal opposition from the anglophone majority of Manitoba, signalling the acceptance of francophone linguistic rights within the province. Politics The official language of the judiciary and legislature of Manitoba is English and French, under section 23 of the Manitoba Act. The following section does not extend toward provincial government services. However, efforts to provide French language services have been undertaken since the province's first French language policy was instituted in 1989, with French language access to provincial services available in areas where numbers warrant it. The Francophone Affairs Secretariat serves as the main liaison between the provincial government and the Franco-Manitoban community. Conversely, the Soci√©t√© de la francophonie manitobaine serves as the main advocacy and lobby group for Franco-Manitobans. Education=Elementary and secondary French language education rights for minority francophone populations in Canada is guaranteed under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in addition to section 23 of the Manitoba Act. However, French language instruction was formally banned from the province from 1916 to 1947; although instruction of the language continued in some schools illicitly. French was reintroduced as an official language of the public education system in 1970, with Franco-Manitobans given the right to control and manage school boards independent from their anglophone peers in 1993. During the 1970s, the provincial government established the Bureau de l‚Äô√âducation fran√ßaise, and the office of the Deputy Minister of French Education to oversee French language education. The province's public francophone schools is administered by the Franco-manitoban School Division, which had an enrolment of nearly 5,400 children throughout 23 schools during the 2015‚Äì16 academic year. Post- secondary There is presently no independent publicly-funded francophone college or university in the province, although the publicly-funded University of Manitoba operates an affiliated university, the Universit√© de Saint- Boniface as a francophone institution. In 2016 there were approximately 2,000 students attending the Universit√© de Saint-Boniface. The Universit√© de Saint- Boniface is western Canada's only francophone post-secondary university. Culture and media The Franco-Manitoban community is served by Radio- Canada's CKSB (Ici Radio-Canada Premi√®re), CKSB-FM (Ici musique) and CBWFT-DT (Ici Radio-Canada T√©l√©), the community radio station CKXL-FM and the weekly newspaper La Libert√©.

It is an important building in Winnipeg, and is the principal church in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Boniface, serving the eastern part of Manitoba province as well as the local Franco-Manitoban community. The basilica sits in the centre of the city at 190 avenue de la Cath√©drale, Saint Boniface. The Cathedral faces the Red River. In Verendrye Park is a statue of Pierre La V√©rendrye by Joseph-√âmile Brunet. Across the river is The Forks in Downtown Winnipeg. History Second Saint-Boniface Church in the distance (1821) In 1818, newly arrived Rev. Norbert Provencher and two colleagues constructed the first church on land on the east bank of the Red River donated by Hudson's Bay Company's Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk. The small log building measured 50 feet by 30 feet and served as chapel, residence and school. It was soon replaced with a larger building. In 1832, Provencher, now bishop, built the first cathedral. \\"The bells of St. Boniface\\" are mentioned in John Greenleaf Whittier's 1859 poem \\"The Red River Voyageur\\". \\"On December 17, 1891, Whittier's 84th birthday, Archbishop Tach√© had \\"the bells of the Roman mission\\" rung in the poet's honour.\\" Between 1908 facade and back of new cathedral On December 14, 1860, a fire destroyed \\"Provencher‚Äôs cathedral\\". In 1862, Bishop Tach√© went to Quebec to raise funds to rebuild the cathedral in stone. This second cathedral was somewhat smaller; the bell tower was completed eight years later. Between 1888 and 1906, the number of Catholics in Saint Boniface had increased from 2,154 to 4,615, almost all of them of French heritage. By 1900, Saint Boniface was the fifth-largest city in the West and needed a larger cathedral. Local contractors Senecal and Smith were engaged to build a new cathedral to plans by Montreal architect Jean-Omer Marchand. On August 15, 1906, Monsignor Louis- Philippe Ad√©lard Langevin dedicated the cathedral, which became one of the most imposing churches in Western Canada. In 1972, a cathedral was built incorporating the back wall of the 1906 cathedral. On July 22, 1968, the 1906 cathedral was damaged by a fire which destroyed many of the structure's features and contents including the rose window, vestments, 1860 bells, and parish records. Only the fa√ßade, sacristy, and the walls of the old church remained. In 1972, a new, smaller cathedral, designed by √âtienne Gaboury and Denis Lussier, was built behind the 1906 fa√ßade.

In 1818 he and two other priests were sent by Joseph-Octave Plessis, Bishop of Quebec, to open a mission on the Red River in present-day Manitoba, where the majority of settlers were Irish and Scottish Catholics. He was tasked with converting the scattered Indian nations and to care for the \\"delinquent Christians, who have adopted there the customs of the Indians.‚Äù Lemieux, Lucien. \\"Provencher, Joseph-Norbert\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 8, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003 At the time, Provencher did not speak English. They arrived at Fort Douglas in mid-July. Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, a main share-holder in the Hudson's Bay Company gave the missionaries land on the east bank of the Red River. They immediately set to work to build a house before winter. Part of the building served as a chapel, which Provencher dedicated to famous missionary, Saint Boniface. The mission at Saint Boniface was highly successful; he baptized many of the local First Nations and M√©tis residents as well as many European settlers. In 1819, Provencher was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Quebec with the titular title of Bishop of Juliopolis, and vicar general for the northwest. He was consecrated at Trois-Rivi√®res in 1822. He returned to St. Boniface and built the school which is now known as the Universit√© de Saint-Boniface, and in 1832 Saint-Boniface Cathedral. In 1838, he founded a school to teach the weaving of wool provided by sheep brought into the colony. The Canadian settlers resisted his efforts to regularize concubinage with Indian and Metis women as they preferred the \\"‚Äúthis liberty of being able to get rid of their wives.‚Äù In 1844, Provencher was appointed head of the newly formed Vicariate Apostolic of James Bay; the Vicariate was elevated to the Diocese of Northwest in 1847 and he was appointed its first bishop.

In the foreground, skirts of the Gatineau Hills make up part of the southern tip of the Canadian Shield. The Ottawa Valley is the valley of the Ottawa River, along the boundary between Eastern Ontario and the Outaouais, Quebec, Canada. The valley is the transition between the Saint Lawrence Lowlands and the Canadian Shield. Because of the surrounding shield, the valley is narrow at its western end and then becomes increasingly wide (mainly on the Ontario side of the river) as it progresses eastward. The underlying geophysical structure is the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben. Approximately 1.3 million people reside in the valley (and along its tributaries), around 80% of whom reside in Ottawa, the remainder on the north side of the Ottawa River, in Quebec. The total area of the Ottawa Valley is 2.4 million ha (6 million ac). The National Capital Region area has just over 1.4 million inhabitants in both provinces. Near the City of Ottawa, the Ottawa Valley merges with the St. Lawrence Valley to the south to create a delta of flat farmland stretching unbroken from the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River as far east as the island of Montreal, where the two rivers meet. The area is sometimes referred to as the \\"Lower Ottawa Valley,\\" in contrast with the \\"Upper Ottawa Valley\\" west of Ottawa, but the name is not common, and most people think of the Ottawa Valley as only the upper portion. Cornwall is typically not included in the Ottawa Valley. From west to east, communities in the Ottawa Valley include Mattawa, Deep River (with nearby Chalk River, the site of Canada's nuclear reactor program), Petawawa (a major Canadian military base), Pembroke (where Samuel de Champlain landed briefly), Fort Coulonge, Shawville, Renfrew, Quyon, Arnprior, Ottawa (the nation's capital), Rockland, L'Orignal, Hawkesbury, and Rigaud and Almonte and Round Lake Centre. History The entire Ottawa Valley is within Om√†miwininiwak (Algonquin Country traditional territory) and, like most populated areas of Canada, is presently under land claim. Federally Recognized Algonquin Communities and Dialect Isoglosses As a relatively recent adaptation resulting from the economic pressures of the encroachment of non-native settling of the valley, the Algonquin First Nation is unevenly distributed within their territory. A majority of Algonquins reside on the Quebec side of the border, where all but two Algonquin communities are located. However, there are many Algonquin communities and individuals not recognized as such by the Government of Canada under the Indian Act. These individuals are referred to as \\"non-status Indians\\". Ardoch Algonquin First Nation is one such community located in the Ottawa Valley fighting for the return of their land. After the arrival of European settlers in North America, the first major industry of the Ottawa Valley was fur trading. The valley was part of the major cross-country route for French-Canadian Voyageurs, who would paddle canoes up the Ottawa River as far as Mattawa and then portage west through various rivers and lakes to Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. Later, lumber became the valley's major industry, and it is still important in the far western part where the valley is narrow and little farmland is available. Today, the vast majority of the valley's residents live at its eastern end in Ottawa and its suburbs, where government and technology are major industries. In the areas of Morrison's Island and Allumette Island there were many archaeological sites found from the earlier years of the Algonquin First Nations tribes. Many of these sites were found by the late Clyde C. Kennedy, who was a student of history; he was very interested in history and worked hard while researching the sites. The items found on the different sites are dated from about five thousand years ago to about two thousand years ago, and are a range of different things from native copper, to spear heads. Major settlements in the Upper Ottawa Valley Petawawa is a town located in Renfrew County, in the Ottawa Valley. It was thought to have been first settled by the Agolkin Natives and the name comes from their language meaning \\"where one hears the noise of the water\\". Samuel de Champlain visited this town and it was used as an important location for the Hudson's Bay Company. Many of the first settlers were of Irish, Scottish, and later German origin. In 1865 the township of Petawawa was incorporated because of its rich natural resources and its important military role. It wasn't until Canada Day 1997 that it was recognized as the Town of Petawawa. Today it is the home of one of the largest Canadian Forces Land Force Command bases in Canada CFB Petawawa. Pembroke is located in Renfrew County on the Ottawa River. It is known as ‚Äúthe heart of the Ottawa Valley‚Äù. It was established in 1828 by pioneers and became a centre for the logging industry. Today, it is the largest regional service centre between Ottawa and North Bay. Historical notes Samuel de Champlain spent the years between 1613 and 1615 traveling the Ottawa River with Algonquin and Huron guides. He was the first documented European to see the Ottawa Valley. When Champlain first arrived there the Huron, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Outaouais tribes were living in the Valley. In charting the new land Champlain inaugurated the route that would be used by French fur traders for the next 200 years.*Between 1847 and 1879 a \\"horse railway\\" was used to portage passengers from the Ottawa River steamboat in a horse-drawn car for 5.5 kilometres along the wooded shore, around the Chats Falls, on the Quebec side of the river between the ghost villages of Pontiac Village and Union Village, near Quyon Quebec, to another steamboat to continue their journey upriver. Language English and French are both commonly spoken throughout the Ottawa Valley on both sides of the river. The Counties of Prescott and Russell County, in the Ottawa Valley, has the highest concentration of francophones in Canada, living west of Quebec. The variant of French spoken in this area of the province is also based on Quebec French, but distinctly different from that of the Outaouais region. Valley twang Regional English accents are rare in Canada, but because of its isolation before the arrival of the railways and also by the mixture of the dominant French, Irish and Scottish populations, the valley at one time developed a distinctive dialect, referred to as the Ottawa Valley Twang. Many traces of it can still be heard today, especially in the valley's more isolated western portions. Music and musical heritage The Ottawa Valley has rich musical heritage that finds its roots in the music traditions of Irish and French immigrants. The music and traditions continued and developed in the lumber camps that are storied part of the Ottawa River lumber industry. Traditions continued in the Valley's festivals and hotels. Of these, Lennox Gavan's Hotel in Quyon, Quebec and Fred Meilleur's Chapeau Hotel on L'Ile aux Allumettes (now burned down), Quebec were particularly influential. Legendary performer and songwriter Mac Beattie and the Melodiers were also large influences on keeping the Ottawa Valley's musical culture vibrant and living. Today, many performers keep the musical traditions alive, including Gail Gavan, Terry McLeish, April Verch and Trevor Grahl. Food The Ottawa Valley has a rich beef and corn farming community. There are a great many local breweries spread about the valley. The Village of Killaloe is also the birthplace of the pastry known as a \\"beaver tail\\". Transportation There are two 400 series highways which service the Ottawa Valley region on the southern side (Ontario side) of the Ottawa River, Highway 417 (The Queensway) which runs east‚Äìwest through Ottawa and Highway 416 (The Veterans Memorial Highway) which runs north‚Äìsouth. To the west of Ottawa, Highway 417 eventually ends near Arnprior, where it continues westward as the two-lane Highway 17. In Ottawa there is a split in the Queensway near Cyrville and Pineview where Highway 174 branches off from Highway 417 and runs further north. East of Ottawa Highway 174 eventually ends and becomes County Road 17 again, and both it and Highway 417 continue eastwards to eventually merge near the Quebec border. At its northernmost point Highway 416 connects to Highway 417 in Ottawa near Nepean, and at its southernmost point it connects with Highway 401 near Prescott. On the Northern side (Quebec side) of the Ottawa river Autoroute 5 runs primarily North-South through Gatineau starting from the Macdonald Cartier Bridge. It eventually becomes Quebec Route 105 further north. Route 148 runs primarily east‚Äìwest through Gatineau and Hull; however, to the west of Hull it goes north-westward to south-eastern in order to follow the direction of the Ottawa River. There are five major road bridges which cross the Ottawa River in the Ottawa area. There are also three road bridges to the west of the city and one to the east, all along Country Road 17 and Route 148. There are also a number of ferries at various points along the river which can transport people and vehicles across. Part of the Trans Canada Railway passes through the Ottawa Valley. Via Rail operates passenger trains to and from Ottawa and other towns in the Ottawa Valley. The main passenger runs which operate from the region are Ottawa to Montreal and Ottawa to Toronto. The closest cities along the rail line to Ottawa are Montreal to the east of Ottawa and Brockville to the South. Freight trains also operate on the railway and Ottawa has a sizable train yard. A new commuter rail line between Ottawa and Pembroke is in the planning stages, along the Beachburg spur line. The Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport, ICAO Code CYOW operates both flights to other major Canadian cities and other international airports. The airport is also a major hub for diplomats and international figures to come into Canada. Major airlines such as Air Canada, West jet, American Airlines and First Air use the airport consistently. The airport is also home to two flight training colleges on the north side of the field. It is Canada's 7th busiest airport. Notable people Among the well-known people who hail from the Ottawa Valley, are former governor-general and broadcaster Adrienne Clarkson, Alanis Morissette, Margaret Atwood, Lorne Greene, railroad builder Michael James Heney, Bryan Murray, Terry Murray, Frank Finnigan, Bruce Cockburn, Peter Jennings, Matthew Perry, Dan Aykroyd, Mark Redman, Tom Green, Rich Little, Paul Anka, Alan Verch and Princess Margriet, sister of Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands. Many Ottawa natives have excelled in the athletic world, particularly winter sports. Barbara Ann Scott was world figure skating champion and won the gold medal at St. Moritz, Switzerland in 1948. Skier Ann Heggtveit won a gold medal at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California. Elizabeth Manley won the silver medal for women's figure skating at the Calgary Winter Olympics in 1988. The Clifford family has long been associated with skiing in the Ottawa area. Linda Thom won Olympic gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Francis Amyott, from the Britannia Club, won the single canoeing event when it was held for the first time at the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. Two Ontario premiers came from the Ottawa Valley - Premier Howard Ferguson (Kemptville) in the 1920s and Premier Dalton McGuinty (Ottawa), who became premier in 2003. \\"Hockey Country\\" The public relations office of the Ottawa Senators ice hockey team call Ottawa and the Valley \\"hockey country\\". Indeed, it is the home not only of the once prominent Senators, which folded in 1934 and came back in 1992, but also of such famous NHL builders as Tommy Gorman and Ambrose O'Brien. With the Senators' arena \\"Canadian Tire Centre (CTC)\\", originally named the \\"Palladium\\", located in Kanata, Ontario, which links Ottawa with the Valley, residents of the Upper Ottawa Valley can easily access the games. The CTC is the home of the \\"Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame\\", several restaurants, a fitness complex and several businesses. The CTC, including the standing room, has a capacity of holding 20,500 people for any event. Many of the members of the Senator's coaching and management staff in 2010 hail from, or have strong connections to, the town of Shawville. The Ottawa Valley's Renfrew Millionaires, the creation of lumber baron O'Brien, was a small-town professional hockey team that won the league championship in 1910. Ottawa and the valley are also the home of such outstanding players as Frank Nighbor, Aurel Joliat, Frank \\"King\\" Clancy, Frank Boucher, Kurtis Foster and Denis Potvin; the latter was the star defenceman of the New York Islanders dynasty of the late 1970s. Ottawa's Brian Kilrea holds the record as the Ontario Hockey League's longest-serving coach with a record number of games behind the bench of the Ottawa 67's junior hockey team. The 67's themselves are something of a legend, having a loyal following that results in sellout games almost every time they step on the ice. The Ottawa 67's play hockey at Lansdowne Park which used to be home to the Ottawa Senators. Lansdowne has a capacity of over 9,682 seats. The Ottawa 67's have won only two memorial cups (1984, 1999) since they first started in 1967. Geography The Ottawa Valley covers over 7,645 square kilometres. Some 12,800 years ago, glaciers retreated from what is now the Ottawa Valley region, leaving the area covered by the Champlain Sea for thousands of years. Ten thousand years ago the water retreated and land emerged, exposing fossils preserved in limestone, particularly in Eganville along the Bonnechere River and the historical site of the Bonnechere Caves and its subterranean river caverns. More than half of the Ottawa Valley is now wilderness. Renfrew County, located in the heart of the Ottawa Valley, is the largest county in Ontario. (outside of \\"districts\\", administrative regions in Northern Ontario). There are over 900 lakes and four major river systems in the Ottawa Valley. Ottawa itself is at the confluence of three rivers. These are the Ottawa, Gatineau and Rideau rivers. The river The Ottawa River is 1,130 kilometres long with a watershed of 140,000 km squared. Its source is Lac Capimitchigama in Quebec. The Ottawa River was first navigated and settled by the Huron, Algonquin, Iroquois and Outaouais people. The Ottawa River bears the name of an aboriginal tribe that traded on the waterway; the \\"Outaouais\\" which is French for Ottawa. The Ottawa River provided the means for entrepreneurs to start up their logging business. The River watershed had unlimited resources, loose regulations, and cheap labour pools which allowed the entrepreneurs to quickly increase control over the timber trade. Many people involved in the logging industry took advantage of the waterway and built their empires because of the fast-moving waters and forests along the River. These loggers played a crucial role in the development of the valley community as they guided logs downriver http://ottawariver.org/pdf/09-ch2-7.pdf this boost is what led to the development of major towns and cities such as Ottawa and Gatineau. The Algonquin people called the Ottawa River \\"Kitchissippi\\", which means ‚ÄúGreat River‚Äù. The Algonquin word Kichesippirini means \\"Big River People\\". The name Petawawa comes from the Algonquin language meaning ‚Äúwhere one hears a noise like this.‚Äù Flora and fauna More than 400 species of animals live in the Ottawa Valley. The white trillium, which grows throughout the Ottawa Valley, has been Ontario's provincial floral emblem since 1937. Its white blossom is associated with peace and hope. White pine, the Ontario provincial tree, was the most commercially important tree during the heyday of the logging industry in the 19th century. It was exported to Europe and used for building the masts of sailing ships. Winter was the best season for cutting timber as trees fell more easily when their sap wasn‚Äôt running and ice and snow made it easier to drag the timber. Spring was the season when the loggers would ‚Äúdrive‚Äù the logs downriver.

The suburb is located to the immediate north of the Mithi River, which separates Bandra from Mumbai City district. It is the third- largest commercial hub in Maharashtra, after Mumbai City district and Pune, primarily aided by the Bandra-Kurla Complex. Originally, Bandra was larger in size when present day Khar was also a part of it. Almost a century ago, it was considered too large a suburb to be served by one railway station. Therefore the Khar Road railway station was established in 1924, to give the northern part of Bandra closer access to the BB&CI; (present day Western Railway) railway line. This eventually led to Khar being considered a separate suburb. But to this day, the two adjoined suburbs make up one homogenous zone. Several prominent citizens of Mumbai, who are active in Bollywood, Media, Cricket and Politics reside in this area. History The name \\"Bandra\\" possibly originates from the Persian word for port, or \\"bandar.\\" It is described by Duncan Forbes's A Dictionary, Hindustani and English'(1848) as \\"a city; an emporium; a port, harbor; a trading town to which numbers of foreign merchants resort\\". In Marathi, Bandra is known as Vandre, which also means 'port' and is possibly derived from the same Urdu/Persian word. The area was under the rule of the Silhara dynasty in the 12th century. Bandra was a tiny fishing village inhabited by Kolis (fishermen) and farmers. It was under the Portuguese before it was acquired by the British East India Company. Portuguese Bandra In 1534, Diego da Silveira a pirate from the Mediterranean, entered Bandra's creek and burned the fishing town he found there. With that, Bandra came under the rule of the Portuguese crown. This turmoil was the start of a long period of Christianization of Bandra. Father Manuel Gomes, a Catholic priest, was instrumental in increasing the Church's prominence in Bandra. In 1580, he baptized 2,000 fishermen. By the time he died 11 years later, Father Gomes' \\"invincible strength of soul\\", as one historian describes it, had helped convert close to 6,000 people in the area. Father Gomes also established St. Andrew's Church. Bandra became a Portuguese possession when the Sultanate of Cambay ceded the region in the Treaty of St. Matthew, which was signed aboard the Portuguese brig Sao Mateus in Ba√ßaim harbor in 1534 and aided by Governor- General Nuno da Cunha and Diego da Silveira. The Portuguese enfeoffed (gave) Bandra, Kurla, Mazgaon and four other villages in 1548 to Ant√≥nio Pessoa as a reward for his military services. This was confirmed by the Royal Chancellery on 2 February 1550. As these villages were given for a period of 'two lives', they reverted to the Crown after the death of Isabel Botelha, Pessoa's widow. The Jesuits, who had applied for acquisition of these villages in anticipation of Isabel's death, obtained them from the viceroy in 1568 and received royal confirmation in 1570. In 1661, when King Charles married Catherine of Portugal, the island of Bombay was given to England as part of the dowry. However, Salsette Island, on which Bandra lay, was not part of this treaty and remained with the Portuguese. The Portuguese built additional churches in Bandra, one of the earliest being St. Andrew's Church in 1575. Their Jesuit missionaries, who learned local languages and cultures, attracted many Indian converts to Catholicism among the villagers on the island. Their descendants continued to support the six Catholic parish churches‚ÄîMount Carmel, St. Peter's, St. Andrew's, St. Theresa's, St. Anne's and St. Francis d'Assisi‚Äîthat lie within an area of four square kilometres. British Bandra Bandra became part of English territory with the signing of the Treaty of Surat in 1775, but was retroceded to the Marathas in 1779 during the First Anglo- Maratha War. In 1802, Bajirao II signed the Treaty of Bassein with the English, surrendering sovereignty and again ceding Bandra, and it remained under British control until 14 August 1947. Arrival of Railways and development: On 12 April 1867, the first railway service was inaugurated, with one train per day between Virar and Bombay, as part of the then private rail company, BB&CI; which was the earlier form of Western Railway. A grand railway station building for Bandra was inaugurated in 1869. The innovative aspects used in the design of this structure are visible to this day. On closer scrutiny, it is evident how railway tracks bunched together make up each of the iron pillars, that hold up the roof over the platforms. In 1873, with growing demands, the frequency of trains available was increased to 24 each day. In the early 1900s, the affluent Pathare Prabhu community lived in South Mumbai, and used their quaint bungalows in the Khar part of Bandra as weekend dwellings. Khar Danda was one of the original villages of the erstwhile larger Bandra. Back then, the local Bandra railway station was felt considerably far to alight from trains and hire 'tangas' (horse carriages) to get to their bungalows by these Bandra residents. Keeping such factors and the growing population in mind, the new railway station named 'Khar Road' was introduced adjoining Bandra Railway station on 1st July, 1924. This development is the primary reason that the Khar part of Bandra started being referred to as a suburb by itself. As late as the 1930s, Bandra had only one bus service from Pali Naka, Hill Road to the Railway station. Other people just walked to the nearest railway station. After World War II, the building boom began with an aim to accommodate immigrants. As of 2018, 940 trains stop daily at Bandra railway station. Bandra was raised to the status of a municipality in 1876 and twas then expanded. In 1950, following independence, it was merged into the Bombay Municipal Corporation to form the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay. Bandra consisted of many villages, among them Sherly, Malla, Rajan, Kantwady, Waroda, Ranwar, Boran, Khar Danda, Pali, and Chuim. These have almost been lost to urban development of the island. =Mount Mary's Church= Statue of Mother Mary at Mount Mary Church, Bandra. The Catholic chapel of Mount Mary was built around 1640 by the Portuguese. The statue of the Virgin was recovered from the sea by fishermen and temporarily installed in St Andrew's Church, before being shifted to the rebuilt Mount Mary's Church in 1761 marked the beginning of the \\"Feast of Our Lady of the Mount\\", also known as the \\"Monti Fest\\" or the \\"Bandra Fest\\". To this day, the statue is venerated and many miracles, minor and major, are attributed to the Lady of the Mount. The architect of Mount Mary's Church was Bombay architect Shahpoorjee Chandabhoy. The basilica was built in 1904 at a cost of INR 1 lakh. The original church was built to serve the garrison posted at the Castella de Aguada (Fortress of Aguada) at Land's End, Bandra. In 1879, Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy constructed a flight of steps to Mount Mary's Church; these are known as the Degrados de Bomanjee ('Steps of Bomanjee'). The Bandra Fair is held during the eight days of the Octave of the Nativity of Our Lady, beginning 8 September, when people throng the church.Mount Mary fair begins today Indian Express, 8 September 2007.\\"Devotees throng to Bandra Fair on opening day as stall owners protest\\", DNA (newspaper), 13 September 2010. =Educational institutions= The first school founded in Bandra after Bombay passed on to the English was St Andrew's Parish School, started by Fr. Francisco de Melo in 1780 to teach catechism to the children of the parish. This later became St. Andrew's High School. The school is located in Bandra West. St. Theresa's High School grew out of St. Andrew's Indian Christians' School, housed in a very dilapidated building situated in Old Khar. This school was founded in 1918. It was taken over by the Society of Divine Word (S.V.D). in 1952. It is counted among the best schools in Mumbai. St. Stanislaus High School was founded in 1863 by the Society of Jesus. It started as a Native Boy's orphanage. It became a high school in 1923 and was the first English medium school in the suburbs. Later, it grew to be a full-fledged educational institution for day-scholars as well as boarders. What started out as a school for 40 orphans has grown to support 2,300 students. St. Stanislaus High School is located on Hill Road, in Bandra West. Cardinal Gracias High School is a convent school located in Bandra East. St. Joseph's Convent High School for girls is run by the nuns of the congregation of the Daughters of the Cross in Bandra West. It was built in 1865 (Bandra was then known as Bandora) and boasts a beautiful chapel. The school has produced illustrious alumni over the years. R.D. National College was originally set up in 1922 in Hyderabad, Pakistan under the guidance of Annie Besant. In the run-up to the Partition of India, it was relocated to its present site in 1949 in Bandra. The Thadomal Shahani Engineering College was established in 1983 by the Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board. It was the first private engineering institute to be affiliated with the federal University of Mumbai to offer courses in Computer Engineering, Information Technology, Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology. The Rizvi Education Complex, located off Carter Road, comprises the Rizvi College of Arts, Science and Commerce (established in 1985); Rizvi High School (established in 1985); Rizvi College of Engineering (established in 1998); Rizvi College of Architecture; Rizvi College of Hotel Management & Catering Technology; Rizvi Law College; Rizvi College of Education and the Rizvi College of Fashion Designing & Creative Arts All are managed by the Rizvi Education Society, and may have the status of Muslim religious minority institution. St. Andrew's College Of Arts, Science and Commerce is another famous college located in the heart of Bandra, just a few hundred metres away from St. Stanislaus High School. It offers various courses including Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Commerce and other certified courses related to retail and travel-tourism to name a few. St. Andrews boasts of one of the best auditoriums in the city. =Bandra lake= Bandra Lake, also called Bandra Talao or Motha Reservoir was constructed by a rich Konkani Muslim of Navapada (also spelt Naupada or Naopara), an adjoining village. The lake was later acquired by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. It was officially renamed Swami Vivekanand Sarovar. Paddle boating facilities and pisciculture (fish farming) activities were operational in this lake during the 1990s but have since stopped. This lake is now a heritage structure of \\"Heritage II\\" status. The Portuguese also pronounced Bandra As Bandora. Development of Bandra as a Commercial Hub As traffic in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region worsened, especially in South Mumbai, there was increased demand to construct a business district outside of Mumbai, in the suburbs. In the mid-2000s, the city of Bandra started an audacious task to reclaim lands on the Mithi River in the eastern portion of the city, near the Kurla border. The newly formed Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) has attracted several equity and technology firms, such as Blackstone, Google, and Amazon, who chose Bandra instead of Mumbai City for its location, lower-cost of land, and new development. As the last suburb before entering Mumbai City, Bandra has for a while been strained with traffic, particularly around the railway station and S.V. Road. The development of a business centre has only exacerbated the traffic problems, as unlike other commercial hubs, Bandra's BKC is located between Bandra and Kurla stations and requires approximately 10-15 minute vehicular commute from either of the stations. Nearly 300,000 office-goers alight daily at Bandra Railway Station and take a taxi or bus to BKC. This has made Bandra among the busiest stations in India, surpassing Andheri and Bombay Central, and the second-busiest station in Maharashtra's Western Railway after Churchgate railway station. Urban art Bandra has a large collection of street art or graffiti. The paintings on walls are principally located in the vicinity of Chapel Road and Veronica Street, but prominent works are also visible near Bandstand and Mount Mary Church. They consist of various types of graffiti, including pieces, stencils, tags, etc. Globally renowned artists such as Gomez have created works on these walls. St+art Mumbai, Bollywood Art Project and Dharavi Art Room are some of the organizations that conduct various programs to encourage the artists. The programs have support from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Bandra is also home to the 37X46 metre (120X150 foot) portrait of Dadasaheb Phalke on the MTNL building at Bandra Reclamation. It was created by Ranjit Dahiya (from the Bollywood Art Project) and other artists including Yantr, Munir Bukhari and Nilesh Kharade as part of the St+art Mumbai festival in 2014. The mural was unveiled officially by Amitabh Bachan and Piyush Pandey. It is reportedly Asia's largest mural. Graffiti on a shop door at chapel road Bandra Geography Bandra Bandstand Bandra is split by the local railway- line into West Bandra (Postal Code 400050) and East Bandra (Postal Code 400051). The part of Bandra located on the western side of the railway line developed into a fashionable suburb by the middle of the 20th century. Film director Mehboob Khan established the Mehboob Studios here in 1954. Soon the area became a center for the Indian movie industry, Bollywood. A recording studio was set up in the 1970s. In the mid-to-late 1990s, the eastern part emerged as a commercial and administrative hub. It houses the Family Court, Bandra-Kurla Commercial Complex, the office of the state housing development authority (MHADA) and the office of the District Collector. The residential quarters of the employees of the Maharashtra State Government are also located here. Most roads and places in Bandra were given English names during British rule. They have been renamed over time but many are still popularly known by their old names. * Neighbouring suburbs: Dharavi, Khar, Kurla, Mahim, Santacruz * Arterial Roads: Swami Vivekanand Road (S.V Road), Linking Road, Turner Road (Guru Nanak Marg), Hill Road (renamed Ramdas Nayak Marg), Carter Road (renamed Naushad Ali Marg), Navpada Road (Balsamant), Western Express Highway. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link connects the western part of Bandra to Worli by the sea route, thus diverting a lot of road traffic. Worli skyline as seen from Bandra Reclamation A stall on Linking Road Transport Bandra- Worli Sealink Project Bandra railway station is connected with the Western Railway and the Harbour Line, which is an offshoot of the suburban Central Railway. It also has a newly built terminus called Bandra Terminus in Bandra (E) from where trains bound for northern and western India are scheduled regularly. The important trains include the Bandra-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, Bandra-Indore Express, Bandra-Patna Express, Bandra-Jaipur Express, Bandra- Jodhpur Express and the Bandra-Amritsar Express Public transport also includes BEST buses, auto rickshaws and taxis, which are abundant. Bandra is the last southern point from Mumbai where auto rickshaws ply. Beyond Bandra, entering Mahim, only taxis are allowed to ply. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link bridge connects Bandra West with Worli, located in central Mumbai. Due to Bandra's central location, most parts of the city are easily accessible.

White rice is the same grain but has the hull, bran layer, and cereal germ removed. Red rice, gold rice, and black rice (also called purple rice) are all whole rices, but with differently pigmented outer layers. Cooking time Brown rice generally needs longer cooking times than white rice, unless it is broken or flourblasted (which perforates the bran without removing it). Studies by Gujral and Kumar in 2003 estimated a cooking time between 35 and 51 minutes. Modifications Parboiled rice is a modified process that forces into the kernel some of the vitamins found in the hull before the hull is removed. The process provides more nutrition than white rice while shortening the time necessary for final meal preparation.  Storage  Brown rice has a shelf life of approximately 6 months, but hermetic storage, refrigeration or freezing can significantly extend its lifetime. Freezing, even periodically, can also help control infestations of Indian meal moths.  Arsenic  Rice plants accumulate arsenic, and there have been concerns over excessive arsenic levels in rice. There is more arsenic in the bran, so brown rice contains more arsenic. The European Union has introduced regulations on arsenic in rice, but the United States has not. Natural arsenic levels in groundwater and soils vary. Rice grown in some regions contains less arsenic than others. Arsenic from pesticides and poultry fertilizer may be taken up by rice. A 2012 report from the US publication Consumer Reports found measurable levels of arsenic in nearly all of the 60 varieties of rice and rice products it tested in the US. Consumer Reports states that brown rice has 80 percent more inorganic arsenic on average than white rice of the same type, because the arsenic tends to accumulate in the outer layers of the grain. Its 2013 analysis found that rice cereal and pasta can possess significantly more inorganic arsenic than the 2012 data showed; Consumer Reports said just one serving of rice cereal or pasta could place children over the maximum amount of rice it recommended for their weekly allotment, due to arsenic content. One study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (US) journal found a median level of arsenic that was 56% higher in the urine of women who had eaten rice. Composition {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"name-handout  African rice in its inedible husk (seed rice, will sprout)  The same rice, dehusked (whole brown rice) (colour varies by variety)  The same rice, with almost all bran and germ removed to make white rice }  Nutritional content  Brown rice and white rice have similar amounts of calories and carbohydrates. Brown rice is a whole grain and a good source of magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, thiamine, niacin, vitamin B6, and manganese, and is high in fiber. White rice, unlike brown rice, has the bran and germ removed, and therefore has different nutritional content. Brown rice is whole rice from which only the husk (the outermost layer) is removed. To produce white rice, the next layers underneath the husk (the bran layer and the germ) are removed leaving mostly the starchy endosperm. Several vitamins and dietary minerals are lost in this removal and the subsequent polishing process. Among these are oil in the bran, which is removed along with the bran layer, dietary fiber, small amounts of fatty acids, and magnesium. A part of these missing nutrients, such as vitamins B1 and B3, and iron, are sometimes added back into the white rice. In the US the result is called \\"enriched rice\\" and must comply with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for this name to be used. It has been found that germinated grains in general have nutritional advantages. Germinated brown rice (GBR), developed during the International Year of Rice, is brown rice that has been soaked for 4‚Äì20 hours in warm water before cooking. This stimulates germination, which activates various enzymes in the rice, giving rise to a more complete amino acid profile, including GABA. Cooked brown rice tends to be chewy; cooked GBR is softer, and preferred particularly by children.

Under his leadership, Bethlehem Steel became the second-largest steel maker in the United States, and one of the most important heavy manufacturers in the world. Early life Charles Schwab, was born in Williamsburg, Pennsylvania, the son of Pauline (n√©e Farabaugh) and John Anthony Schwab. All four of his grandparents were Roman Catholic immigrants from Germany. Schwab was raised in Loretto, Pennsylvania, which he considered his home town. Career Schwab began his career as an engineer in Andrew Carnegie's steelworks, starting as a stake-driver in the engineering corps of the Edgar Thomson Steel Works and Furnaces in Braddock, Pennsylvania. He was promoted often, including to the positions of general superintendent of the Homestead Works in 1887. and general superintendent of the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in 1890.Charles M. Schwab Correspondence Finding Aid, 1891, AIS.1994.02, Archives Services Center, University of Pittsburgh. In 1897, at only 35 years of age, he became president of the Carnegie Steel Company. In 1901, he helped negotiate the secret sale of Carnegie Steel to a group of New York‚Äìbased financiers led by J. P. Morgan. After the buyout, Schwab became the first president of the United States Steel Corporation, the company formed out of Carnegie's former holdings. Ibid. at 85. After several clashes with Morgan and fellow US Steel executive Elbert Gary, Schwab left USS in 1903 to run the Bethlehem Shipbuilding and Steel Company in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The company had gained shipyards in California, Delaware, and New Jersey through its brief but fortunate involvement as one of the few solvent enterprises in United States Shipbuilding Company. Under his leadership (and that of Eugene Grace), it became the largest independent steel producer in the world. A major part of Bethlehem Steel's success was the development of the H-beam, a precursor of today's ubiquitous I-beam. Schwab was interested in mass- producing the wide flange steel beam, but that was a risky venture that required raising capital and building a large new plant, all to make a product whose ability to sell was unproven. In his most famous remark, Schwab told his secretary, \\"I've thought the whole thing over, and if we are going bust, we will go bust big.\\" In 1908, Bethlehem Steel began making the beam, which revolutionized building construction and contributed to the age of the skyscraper. Its success helped make Bethlehem Steel the second-largest steel company in the world. Bethlehem, Pennsylvania was incorporated, virtually as a company town, by uniting four previous villages. In 1910, Schwab broke the Bethlehem Steel strike by calling out the newly formed Pennsylvania State Police. Schwab successfully kept labor unions out of Bethlehem Steel throughout his tenure (although Bethlehem Steel unionized in 1941, two years after his death). Schwab in 1901, at age 39 In 1911, Bethlehem Steel formed a company soccer team known as Bethlehem Steel F.C. In 1914 Schwab took the team professional.\\"SCHWAB CORNERS FOOTBALL STARS - Steel Man Gathers High-Class Soccer Team to Represent Bethlehem, Penn.\\" The New York Times, August 2, 1914. PDF.\\"Makes Record in Soccer: Bethlehem Sets Mark by Winning Double Championship\\". The New York Times, July 23, 1916. PDF. Until its demise in 1930, the team won eight league championships, six American Cups and five National Challenge Cups. It was considered among the greatest soccer teams in U.S. history. The company disbanded the team as a result of financial losses incurred during the internecine 1928‚Äì1929 \\"Soccer Wars\\" between American Soccer League and United States Football Association and the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. During the first years of World War I, Bethlehem Steel had a virtual monopoly in contracts to supply the Allies with certain kinds of munitions. Schwab made many visits to Europe in connection with the manufacture and supply of munitions to the Allied governments, during this period. He circumvented American neutrality laws by funneling goods through Canada. On April 16, 1918, Schwab became Director General of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, a board granted by Congress with master authority over all shipbuilding in the United States. He was appointed over Charles Piez, the former general manager of the corporation. President Wilson had specifically asked Schwab to assume this responsibility. Schwab's biggest change to the shipbuilding effort was to abandon the cost plus profit contracting system that had been in place up to that time and begin issuing fixed-price contracts. After America's entry into the war, he was accused of profiteering but was later acquitted. Schwab was considered to be a risk taker and was highly controversial (Thomas Edison once famously called him the \\"master hustler\\"). Schwab's lucrative contract providing steel to the Trans-Siberian Railroad came after he provided a $200,000 \\"gift\\" to the mistress of the Grand Duke Alexis Aleksandrovich. His innovative ways of dealing with his staff are given a mention in Dale Carnegie's most famous work, How to Win Friends and Influence People (1936). In 1928, Schwab was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal for \\"outstanding services to the steel industry\\". In 1932 he was awarded the Melchett Medal by the British Institute of Fuel Melchett Medal awarded to Charles M Schwab JTA archive 21 October 1932 retrieved 21 January 2015 In 1982, Schwab was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 2011 Schwab was inducted into the inaugural class of the American Metal Market Steel Hall of Fame (http://www.amm.com/HOF- Profile/CharlesSchwab.html) for his lifelong work in the US steel industry. Personal life Schwab married Emma Eurana Dinkey (1859‚Äì1939) on May 1, 1883. Mrs. Schwab had lived in Weatherly, Pennsylvania and donated $85,000 to build a school there. Schwab eventually became very wealthy. He moved to New York City's Upper West Side, which at the time was considered the \\"wrong\\" side of Central Park, where he built \\"Riverside\\", the most ambitious private house ever built in New York. The $7 million 75-room house, designed by French architect Maurice Hebert, combined details from three French chateaux on a full city block. After Schwab's death, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia turned down a proposal to make Riverside the official mayoral residence, deeming it too grandiose. It was eventually razed and replaced by an apartment block. The main house, cascades, and gardens of \\"Immergr√ºn\\", Charles M. Schwab's retreat in Loretto, Pennsylvania Schwab also owned a 44-room summer estate on 1,000 acres (4 km2) in Loretto, Pennsylvania, called \\"\\" (German for 'evergreen'). The house featured opulent gardens and a nine-hole golf course. Rather than raze the existing house, Schwab had the mansion moved on rollers to a new location to make room for the new mansion. Schwab's estate sold Immergr√ºn after his death, and it is now Mount Assisi Friary on the grounds of Saint Francis University. Schwab became notorious for his \\"fast lane\\" lifestyle including opulent parties, high-stakes gambling, and a string of extramarital affairs producing at least one child out of wedlock. The affairs and the out- of-wedlock child soured his relationship with his wife. He became an international celebrity when he \\"broke the bank\\" at Monte Carlo, and traveled in a $100,000 private rail car named \\"Loretto\\".North Carolina Transportation Museum: Rail Equipment 1 Even before the Great Depression, he had already spent most of his fortune, estimated at between $25 million and $40 million. Adjusted for inflation in the first decade of the 21st century, that equates to between $500 million and $800 million. The stock market crash of 1929 finished off what years of wanton spending had started. He spent his last years in a small apartment. He could no longer afford the taxes on \\"Riverside\\", and it was seized by creditors. He had offered to sell the mansion at a huge loss but there were no buyers. At his death ten years later, Schwab's holdings in Bethlehem Steel were virtually worthless, and he was over $300,000 in debt. Had he lived a few more years, he would have seen his fortunes restored when Bethlehem Steel was flooded with orders for war materiel. He was buried in Loretto at Saint Michael's Cemetery in a private mausoleum with his wife. Schwab had no children by Eurana Dinkey, but had one daughter by a mistress. A bust-length portrait of Schwab painted in 1903 by Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury (1862‚Äì1947) was formerly in the Jessica Dragonette Collection at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming at Laramie, but has been donated to the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. M√ºller-Ury also painted his nephew and namesake Charles M. Schwab (son of his brother Joseph) as a boy in a sailor suit around the same date.Town & Country, August 22, 1903, 'A Successful Portrait Painter', by S. E.

Dormice are nocturnal animals found in Africa, Asia, and Europe, and are particularly known for their long periods of hibernation. As only one species of dormouse ‚Äì the hazel dormouse ‚Äì is native to the United Kingdom, in everyday English usage \\"dormouse\\" can refer either to that one species or to the family as a whole. The English name of the species derived from the French dormeuse, and the latter in turn possibly from the Languedocien radourmeire. Etymology Concerning the dormouse's name, etymonline says \\"long-tailed Old World rodent noted for its state of semi-hibernation in winter, early 15c., possibly from Anglo-French dormouse 'tending to be dormant' (from stem of dormir 'to sleep,' see dormant), with the second element mistaken for mouse; or perhaps it is from a Middle English dialectal compound of mouse (n.) and Middle French dormir. French dormeuse, fem. of dormeur 'sleeper' is attested only from 17c.\\" Characteristics Dormice are small rodents, with body lengths between , and weights between . They are generally mouse-like in appearance, but with furred, rather than scaly, tails. They are largely arboreal, agile, and well adapted to climbing. Most species are nocturnal. Dormice have an excellent sense of hearing and signal each other with a variety of vocalisations. Dormice are omnivorous, and typically feed on berries, flowers, fruits, insects, and nuts. They are unique among rodents in that they lack a cecum, a part of the gut used in other species to ferment vegetable matter. Their dental formula is similar to that of squirrels, although they often lack premolars: Dormice breed once or occasionally twice each year, producing litters with an average of four young after a gestation period of 22‚Äì24 days. They can live for as long as five years. The young are born hairless and helpless, and their eyes do not open until about 18 days after birth. They typically become sexually mature after the end of their first hibernation. Dormice live in small family groups, with home ranges that vary widely between species and depend on the availability of food. Hibernation One of the most notable characteristics of those dormice that live in temperate zones is hibernation. They can hibernate six months out of the year, or even longer if the weather does not become warm enough, sometimes waking for brief periods to eat food they had previously stored nearby. During the summer, they accumulate fat in their bodies to nourish them through the hibernation period. The sleepy behaviour of The Dormouse character in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland reflects this familiar trait of dormice. Relationship with humans The edible dormouse (Glis glis) was considered a delicacy in ancient Rome, either as a savoury appetizer or as a dessert (dipped in honey and poppy seeds). The Romans used a special kind of enclosure, a glirarium, to raise and fatten dormice for the table. It is still considered a delicacy in Slovenia and in several places in Croatia, namely Lika, and the islands of Hvar and Braƒç. Dormouse fat was believed by the Elizabethans to induce sleep since the animal put on fat before hibernating. In more recent years dormice have begun to enter the pet trade, though they are uncommon as pets and are considered an exotic pet. The woodland dormouse (Graphiurus murinus) is the most commonly seen species in the pet trade. Asian garden dormice (Eliomys melanurus) are also occasionally kept as pets. Evolution The Gliridae are one of the oldest extant rodent families, with a fossil record dating back to the early Eocene. As currently understood, they descended in Europe from early Paleogene ischyromyids such as Microparamys (Sparnacomys) chandoni. The early and middle Eocene genus Eogliravus represents the earliest and most primitive glirid taxon; the oldest species, Eogliravus wildi, is known from isolated teeth from the early Eocene of France and a complete specimen of the early middle Eocene of the Messel pit in Germany. They appear in Africa in the upper Miocene and only relatively recently in Asia. Many types of extinct dormouse species have been identified. During the Pleistocene, giant dormice the size of large rats, such as Leithia melitensis, lived on the islands of Malta and Sicily.

They are nocturnal feeders that during the day may be found in flocks around lakes and wet paddy fields. They can perch on trees and sometimes build their nest in the hollow of a tree. This brown and long-necked duck has broad wings that are visible in flight and produces a loud two-note wheezy call. It has a chestnut rump, differentiating it from its larger relative, the fulvous whistling duck, which has a creamy white rump. Description The chicks are patterned in black and white This chestnut brown duck is confusable only with the fulvous whistling duck (D. bicolor) but has chestnut upper-tail coverts unlike the creamy white in the latter. The ring around the eye is orange to yellow. When flying straight, their head is held below the level of the body as in other Dendrocygna species. The crown appears dark and the sexes are alike in plumage. They fly slowly but with rapid wing-flapping and usually produce a repetitive wheezy seasick call as they circle overhead. They are very nocturnal and often rest during the day. The outermost primary feather has the inner vane modified. They produce very prominent whistling sound while flying. Distribution and habitat Shape of the outermost primary, claimed to produce a whistle in flight This is a largely resident species distributed widely across lowland wetlands of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The species also occur on islands in the region including the Andamans, Nicobars and Maldives. They sometimes make local movements in response to weather and changes in water availability and the more northern birds winter further south. They are found in freshwater wetlands with good vegetation cover and often rest during the day on the banks or even on the open sea in coastal areas. Downy chicks are black with a white eyebrow and white patches on the back of the head, the wing, lower back and rump. Albino individuals have been seen in the wild. White-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) with captured duck Large numbers are sometimes found in urban wetlands such as in Kolkata and Goa, particularly during winter. In the Alipore Zoological Gardens, captive individuals were introduced in the 1930s and wild birds joined this nucleus subsequently. With a wide distribution range between 1 and 10 million km¬≤, they are considered to have a secure global population of between two and twenty million individuals. They are not threatened by hunting as they are not considered good to eat. Hunters in Assam however have been known to raise the ducklings to serve as live decoy. Behaviour and ecology A flock landing (Kolkata, India) In flight the broad wings are distinctiveLesser whistling duck are usually gregarious. They feed mainly on plants taken from the water as well as grains from cultivated rice apart from small fish, frogs and invertebrates such as molluscs and worms. They dabble as well as dive in water. They will often waddle on the land and Common mynas have been noted to follow them on grass. Courtship involves the male facing the female and dipping and raising its bill in the water and swimming around the female. They breed during the monsoon or rainy season and may vary locally in relation to the food availability. The nest site may be a tree hole lined with twigs and grass or built in the fork of a large tree, sometimes reusing an old nest of a kite or heron or even on the ground. The clutch varies from 7 to 12 white eggs that are incubated by both the parents. Large clutches of up to 17 have been noted although these may be indications of intraspecific brood parasitism. The eggs hatch after about 22‚Äì24 days. More than one brood may be raised in a single season. Young birds may sometimes be carried on the back of the parents. Local names like sili and silhahi in India are based on their wheezy two-note calls. They become very tame in captivity, walking about and responding to whistles. Individuals in captivity in the USA have lived for up to 9 years. Several endoparasitic cestodes including Hymenolepis javanensis and Cittotaenia sandgroundi have been described from lesser whistling duck hosts apart from ectoparasitic bird lice and mites.

Building on Mount Putuo, 1899 Plan of the Mount Putuo Mount Putuo Guanyin Putuo Shan lake and pavilions Mount Putuo (, from Sanskrit: \\"Mount Potalaka\\") is an island southeast of Shanghai in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China. It is a renowned site in Chinese Buddhism and is the bodhima·πá·∏ça of the bodhisattva Guanyin. Mount Putuo is one of the four sacred mountains in Chinese Buddhism, the others being Mount Wutai, Mount Jiuhua, and Mount Emei (bodhima·πá·∏ças for Manjushri, K·π£itigarbha, and Samantabhadra, respectively). Mount Putuo lies in the East China Sea and incorporates the beauty of both mountain and sea. Mountain Putuo is at 29¬∞58‚Ä≤3ÔΩû30¬∞02‚Ä≤3 north latitude, 122¬∞21‚Ä≤6ÔΩû122¬∞24‚Ä≤9 east longitude.

Every year on the 19th day of the 2nd lunar month, 19th day of the 6th lunar month, and 19th day of the 9th lunar month of the Chinese calendar, it welcomes millions of people for the celebration of the birth of Guanyin.  History  Mount Putuo has been a pilgrimage site for over a thousand years. After the Tang dynasty, Mount Putuo became a center of Guanyin worship. Traditionally there were three main temples: The Puji Temple (, founded 10th cent.), the Fayu Temple (, founded 1580 CE), and the Huiji Temple (, founded 1793 CE). The site has received numerous renowned visitors over the ages, including the then 20-year- old future Chan master Yinyuan Longqi (Japanese: Ingen), who came to the site in 1612, while looking for his father, who had disappeared fifteen years earlier. The modern scholar-monk Taixu spent several years in solitary retreat at a small hermitage on Putuo.  Temples  *Putuo is covered with many temples and monasteries, both large and small. All are under the directive of the Buddhist Association of China. Many monks and nuns from all over the country, and abroad, go to great lengths to live and practice there.

Transport  Many of the Zhoushan Islands are now linked by bridges. This means that Putuoshan can easily be reached by bus from Shanghai and Ningbo. The bus terminates at Shenjiamen Bus Station. From the Banshengdong Wharf on the Shenjiamen waterfront it is a 10-minute ride by fast ferry (22 RMB) to Putuoshan. In Shanghai, the Nanpu Bridge Bus Station, Shanghai Stadium Sightseeing Bus Center and Shanghai South Long Distance Bus Station have several departures daily to Shenjiamen (4‚Äì5 hours, 138 RMB). In Ningbo, the North and South bus stations both have regular daily departures to Shenjiamen (2‚Äì3 hours, 60 RMB). There are two flights daily from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport to Putuo Airport, which is only from Shenjiamen. (approx 800 RMB). The ferry services mentioned below are still available but the bus services now provide a greater level of convenience and comfort. Putuoshan can be reached by boat from the major cities of Ningbo and Shanghai. It will take approximately an hour by boat to reach the wharf at Ningbo, from where a bus transports passengers to Ningbo city centre. There are two boats linking Putuoshan and Shanghai. One departs in the evening and travels overnight, arriving in the early morning; the other leaves early in the day from a wharf outside of Shanghai city centre but takes less than two hours. The transportation system of Mountain Putuo is very special. Private cars are not allowed there, and people can only rely on public transport. The reason for this rule is because the area of Putuo Mountain is very small, and only one road runs through the entire island. It is therefore necessary to control the number of cars on the island to avoid traffic congestion. At the same time, excessive vehicle emissions will affect the environment and air quality of Mountain Putuo. In addition, Putuo Mount is mountainous, so buses are not flexible enough for people to travel. And as there are thousands of tourists coming to Mountain Putuo and the number of buses is far from enough, the cable car has become another important means of transportation.  Weather  It is an Asian warm-temperate moist climate (Cfa) and has four distinct seasons. It has plenty of rain and fog. The average temperature of whole year is . The coldest month is January, average temperature is . The hottest month is August, temperature is . It has typhoon season on July, August and September. The average speed of wind is . The Mount Putuo has all-year-round travel seasons, but in regard to when and where to get on the island, tourists should be careful and check the weather forecast beforehand. Miscellaneous In 2013 the Chinese religious film Avalokitesvara tells the origin of Mount Putuo as the bodhimanda of Guanyin Bodhisattva. The film was filmed onsite at Mount Putuo. It was also selected as one of the World Great films during the 37th Montreal World Film Festival.

His case was initially verified by Guinness World Records, who titled him the oldest man ever, but Guinness later withdrew their claim; in the 2012 edition Christian Mortensen was named the \\"oldest verified man ever\\" and Izumi was not mentioned. Biography Shigechiyo was the only son of Tameminamoto and Tsurukame Izumi. His parents died when he was 6 months old, and he was adopted by his grandfather Katsuzumi Izumi in February 1866. Guinness World Records found a document attesting that he was 24 years old in 1889 when he was exempted from military service to deal with sugar cane fields. Izumi drank brown sugar sh≈çch≈´ (a Japanese alcoholic beverage often distilled from barley or rice), and took up smoking at age 70. Izumi's personal physician strongly advised him against drinking sh≈çch≈´ as his kidneys were not strong enough to process sh≈çch≈´ in his advanced age, but Izumi went on to say: \\"Without sh≈çch≈´ there would be no pleasure in life. I would rather die than give up drinking.\\" He retired from sugar cane farming in 1970. Death and uncertainty over age After a brief hospitalization, Izumi died of pneumonia at 21:15 JST on 21 February 1986. He was one of only two people (the other being Jeanne Calment) verified to have lived past their 120th birthday, although subsequent research has discounted this claim. In April 1987, 14 months after Izumi's death, the Department of Epidemiology at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology reported that research into Izumi's family registration records indicated he might have been 105 when he died.Asahi News Service, APRIL 6, 1987, MONDAY, JAPANESE EXPERT DEBUNKS IDEA OF 'VILLAGE OF 100-YEAR-OLDS' The 2011 Guinness World Records book states that the birth certificate submitted as evidence might have actually belonged to his older brother, who died at a young age, and the family may have re-used \\"Shigechiyo\\" as a necronym.

An all-rounder who bats left- handed in the middle order and bowls slow left-arm orthodox, Yuvraj is the son of former Indian fast bowler and Punjabi actor Yograj Singh. One of the greatest limited over players to play for India, Yuvraj was particularly noted for his aggressive stroke play of the ball and his fielding. Yuvraj was a member of the Indian cricket team in One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2000 and 2017 and played his first Test match in October 2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and 2008. He was the Man of the Tournament in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and one of the top performers at the 2007 ICC World T20, both of which India won. In a match against England at the 2007 World T20, he famously hit six sixes in one over bowled by Stuart Broad ‚Äî a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an international match between two teams with Test match status. In the same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same World Cup match. In 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his left lung and underwent chemotherapy treatment in Boston and Indianapolis. In March 2012, he was discharged from the hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April. He made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September against New Zealand shortly before the 2012 World Twenty20. In 2012, Yuvraj was conferred with the Arjuna Award, India's second highest sporting award by the Government of India. In 2014, he was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour. At the 2014 IPL auction Royal Challengers Bangalore bought Yuvraj for an all-time high price of 14 crore and, in 2015, the Delhi Daredevils bought him for 16 crore making him the most expensive player ever to be sold in the IPL. On 10 June 2019, Yuvraj announced his retirement from all forms of International cricket. He last represented India in June 2017, against the West Indies. Early years and personal life Singh was born in a Punjabi Sikh family to Yograj Singh, a former India cricketer, and Shabnam Singh. Tennis and roller skating were Yuvraj's favourite sports during his childhood and he was quite good at both. He had also won the National Under-14 Roller Skating Championship. His father threw away the medal and told him to forget skating and concentrate on cricket. He would take Yuvraj to training every day. Yuvraj studied at the DAV Public School in Chandigarh. He completed his graduation degree in Commerce from DAV College, Panjab University, Chandigarh. He also did two short roles as child star in Mehndi Sagna Di and Putt Sardara. In 2015, Yuvraj got engaged to Hazel Keech and married her in November 2016. Career=Youth career Yuvraj began his career with Punjab Under-16s at the age of 13 years and 11 months in November of the 1995‚Äì96 season against Jammu and Kashmir-16s. In 1996‚Äì97, Yuvraj was promoted to Punjab Under-19s and scored 137 not out against Himachal Pradesh Under-19s. Yuvraj made his first-class debut in late-1997 against Orissa during the 1997‚Äì98 Ranji Trophy but was dismissed for a duck opening the innings. His first break-out performance came in the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy Final of 1999 against Bihar at Jamshedpur; Bihar were all out with a score of 357 and Yuvraj batted at three for Punjab and made 358 runs himself. Yuvraj represented India in the series against Sri Lanka Under-19s in India in February 1999. In the third ODI, Yuvraj scored 89 runs from 55 balls. In 1999-2000 Ranji Trophy, he scored 149 against Haryana. In the 2000 Under-19 Cricket World Cup which India won under the captaincy of Mohammad Kaif, Yuvraj's all-round performance earned him the Player of the Tournament award and a call-up to the national squad. His performance in the tournament included 68 off 62 and 4/36 against New Zealand in a group stage match, and a quickfire 58 off 25 balls against Australia in the semifinal. Yuvraj was subsequently selected in 2000 for the first intake of cricketers in the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. International breakthrough Yuvraj was selected in the Indian squad for the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy on the back of his impressive performances for the Under-19 team. He made his international debut against Kenya in the pre-quarterfinal. He bowled four overs conceding 16 runs but did not get to bat. In the quarterfinal match against Australia, Yuvraj won the man of the match for his innings of 84 out of 80 balls, against a pace attack consisting of Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, that helped India win by 20 runs. In the semifinal against South Africa, he scored 41 and picked 1/15. He scored only 14 against New Zealand in the final which India lost. The tournament was followed by a tri- series involving India, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Yuvraj scored just 55 runs in five innings at an average of 11. Yuvraj averaged 15.50 in the ODI series against the touring Zimbabwe side in December 2000 after which he was dropped from the team. Yuvraj made his comeback during the 2001 Coca-Cola Cup in Sri Lanka. He scored a crucial 98* against Sri Lanka in the fifth match of an otherwise disappointing series with the bat. However, he proved to be useful with the ball as he took 8 wickets at an average of 27. In the Standard Bank triangular series involving hosts South Africa, India and Kenya, Yuvraj managed to score only 69 runs from 6 innings, including a duck in the final against South Africa. Following this, Dinesh Mongia and Hemang Badani were chosen over Yuvraj in the squad for the home series against England in January 2002. Yuvraj returned to domestic cricket in early 2002. After a disappointing run in the Ranji knockouts, Yuvraj struck 209 for North Zone against South Zone in a Duleep Trophy match in March 2002. He was immediately drafted into the national squad for the final two ODIs against Zimbabwe with India trailing the series 1-2. Yuvraj made an impact in his return match at Hyderabad, scoring an unbeaten 80 off just 60 balls, taking India to a five-wicket win and leveling the series. He won the Man of the Match award for his efforts. In the final ODI at Guwahati, Yuvraj made 75 runs from 52 balls, sharing a 157-run fifth-wicket partnership with Mongia who scored his career-best unbeaten 159, to help India post a total of 333 in their 50 overs. India went on to win the game by 101 runs and the series 3-2. 2002 NatWest Series After winning the ODI series in the West Indies 2-1, where Yuvraj managed scores of only 1 and 10, the Indian team toured England in June for the NatWest triangular series, featuring England, Sri Lanka, and India, and a four-match Test series against the hosts. In the first match at Lord's, Yuvraj won the man of the match for his all-round performance (3/39 and 64*) as India successfully chased down England's total of 271. In the next match against Sri Lanka, he scored 31 and shared a crucial 60-run sixth-wicket partnership with Mohammad Kaif to set up another successful run-chase. India's next match against England was washed out due to rain after Yuvraj had scored an unbeaten 40 off 19 balls to take India to 285/4 in their 50 overs. Yuvraj's knock of 37, along with a fifty from Rahul Dravid, helped India recover from 59/4 to reach a target of 188 posted by Sri Lanka. This win eliminated Sri Lanka from the series with another round of matches still to be played. Yuvraj had scores of 5 and 8 in the final round of matches but proved to be useful with the ball as he picked one wicket in each of the two games. At the end of the round- robin matches, India topped the points table with 19 points while England finished second with 15 points. The final was played at Lord's on 13 July between India and England. After winning the toss and electing to bat first, England posted a daunting total of 325/5 in 50 overs. In reply, India was struggling at 146/5 at the end of 24 overs, when Kaif joined Yuvraj at the crease. The pair initially stabilised the innings and later scored at a brisk rate. The pair shared a partnership of 121 runs for the sixth wicket which came to an end when Yuvraj was dismissed for 69 off 63 balls when he top-edged a sweep shot in the 42nd over off the bowling of Paul Collingwood resulting in a simple catch to Alex Tudor at short fine leg. India went on to win the game by two wickets with three balls to spare. This was India's first win in the final of an ODI tournament since 2000, after nine consecutive defeats. This win is regarded as one of India's greatest victories in ODI cricket. Highs and lows Yuvraj batted in two games of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy which was held in Sri Lanka in September. He scored 3 against Zimbabwe in the opening match, and 62 in the semifinal against South Africa. In November 2002, Yuvraj struggled in the first five games of the 7-match ODI series against West Indies, with a high score of 30. He returned to form in the sixth ODI at Jodhpur with a half-century that helped India win the match by three wickets and level the series 3-3. He top-scored for India in the 7th match with a 69-ball 68, but could not get support from any other batsman. India crashed to a 135-run defeat and lost the series. He struggled for runs in the seven-match ODI series in New Zealand in December 2002-January 2003, averaging just above 19 with a solitary fifty. Despite his average form leading up to the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup in South Africa, Yuvraj secured a place in the 15-man Indian squad for the tournament. He scored 37 in India's opening match against Netherlands. In the following games, he had scores of 0, 1 and 7* against Australia, Zimbabwe and Namibia respectively. He then scored a brisk 42 against England, followed by an unbeaten 50 against Pakistan setting up wins for India in both games. In the Super Six stage of the tournament, Yuvraj had scores of 58* against Kenya and 5 against Sri Lanka. He scored 16 in the semifinal against Kenya, and 24 against Australia in the final. Yuvraj scored his maiden ODI century (102* from 85 balls) against Bangladesh at Dhaka on 11 April 2003. In May 2003, Yuvraj was signed-up by the Yorkshire County Cricket Club for the 2003 county season. He became only the second Indian after Sachin Tendulkar to represent the county. Yuvraj's Test debut came on 16 October 2003 at his home ground Mohali against New Zealand. Batting at six, he scored 20 in the first innings, and 5* in the second innings. In the TVS Cup tri-series in October‚ÄìNovember 2003 involving India, Australia and New Zealand, he scored 113 runs from 7 games at an average of 18.83 and top-score of 44. Yuvraj returned to form in early-2004 in the tri-series involving Australia and Zimbabwe. He scored 314 runs from 8 innings at an average of 39.25, including his second ODI hundred - 139 runs from 122 balls, with 16 fours and two sixes - against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He had a mixed tour of Pakistan in March‚ÄìApril 2004. He disappointed in the ODI series with 141 runs from 5 matches, averaging just over 28, but found success in the Test series. In the first Test at Multan, he scored 59 - his maiden Test fifty - as India registered an innings win. He also picked his maiden Test wicket during Pakistan's second innings. In the second Test at Lahore, Yuvraj scored his maiden Test century during India's first innings while the rest of the batting line-up struggled against the bowling of Umar Gul. Yuvraj's score of 112 came from j129 deliveries with 15 fours and two sixes. He made only 12 runs in the second Test as Pakistan leveled the series after winning the match by 9 wickets. He scored 47 in the final Test at Rawalpindi where India secured the series with another innings victory. However, he suffered a drop in form in the latter half of 2004 with batting averages of 31 in the 2004 Asia Cup, 12.33 in the Natwest Series in England and just 4.50 in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy. In October 2004, after the first two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, he was dropped from the Test squad as his dismal run with the bat yielded just 47 runs from the two matches. Despite Yuvraj's loss in form, he continued to be a regular feature in the Indian ODI team. In the Platinum Jubilee Match against Pakistan in November 2004, he scored a 62-ball 78 in a losing cause. In December 2004, Yuvraj scored 94 runs at an average of 31.33 in the three-match ODI tour of Bangladesh including a quickfire knock of 69 from 32 balls in the final ODI at Dhaka. He had a disappointing ODI series at home against Pakistan in April 2005, scoring 98 runs in six matches at 19.60. Return to form In July‚ÄìAugust 2005, Yuvraj was the leading run-scorer for India in the 2005 Indian Oil Cup triangular series in Sri Lanka also involving the hosts Sri Lanka and West Indies. He scored 192 runs in four matches, averaging 48. He also recorded his third ODI century during the series - 110 runs from 114 balls - against the West Indies at Colombo for which he was adjudjed the man of the match. Yuvraj then played in the Videocon Cup in August‚ÄìSeptember 2005, a triangular series involving India, New Zealand and the hosts Zimbabwe. He averaged 54 with the bat in the series, scoring 216 runs from 5 matches. He scored 120 in the final round-robin match against Zimbabwe at Harare, helping India recover from 36/4 to successfully chase down a target of 251. It was his fourth ODI hundred and he won the man of the match award for his efforts. In the two-match Test tour of Zimbabwe that followed the tri-series, Yuvraj scored 12 and 25 runs. In October‚ÄìNovember 2005, Yuvraj had a quiet seven-match ODI series at home against Sri Lanka. He managed just 124 runs in six innings at an average of 31 with a top-score of 79*. In November 2005, Yuvraj scored 103 in the first ODI against South Africa at Hyderabad to take India from 35/5 to a respectable total of 249/9, and won the man of the match award despite South Africa winning the game by five wickets. He picked 1/17 and remained not out in the second ODI at Bangalore, before the third match at Chennai was washed out due to rain. He scored 53 and 49 in the final two matches at Delhi and Ahmedabad respectively, and the series was drawn 2-2. Yuvraj and South African captain Graeme Smith were jointly awarded the man of the series award as both of them scored 209 runs at 69.66, finishing as the joint-highest run-scorers of the series. Yuvraj had a mixed home Test series against Sri Lanka in December 2005 as he registered two ducks and two half-centuries. He scored 0 & 77* in the second Test at Delhi, and 0 & 75 in the third Test at Ahmedabad as India won both the matches by comfortable margins. Yuvraj was picked in both Test and ODI squads for the Pakistan tour in January‚ÄìFebruary 2006. The first two Tests were drawn and Yuvraj batted only once, in the second Test, scoring 4. In the third Test at Karachi, he top-scored for India in both innings. After scoring 45 in the first innings, he went to score his second Test hundred in the second innings (122 runs from 144 balls). India lost the match by 341 runs and the series 1-0. In the one- day series, he continued his good form. He scored a 28-ball 39 in the first ODI at Peshawar which Pakistan won by 7 runs by the Duckworth‚ÄìLewis method. He scored an unbeaten 82 in the second match at Rawalpindi taking India to an emphatic 7-wicket win, before scoring an unbeaten 79 in the third game at Lahore and helping India successfully chase the target of 289. In the low- scoring fourth match at Multan, he scored 37 as India took the series with a five-wicket victory. In the fifth and the final ODI at Karachi, Yuvraj, batting at three, hit his sixth ODI century. His innings of 107* which came off 93 balls with 13 boundaries helped India comfortably chase down a target of 287 while losing only two wickets. He won the man of the match award for this innings and was also adjudged player of the series. Against England, Yuvraj averaged 21.33 in two Tests in March but proved to be successful with both bat and ball in the ODI series in which he again won the player of the series award. During the series, he won the back-to-back man of the match awards in the third and fourth ODIs. In the third match, he made 103 from 76 balls, and in the fourth match, he picked 2/34 and scored 48. He scored a total of 237 runs in the series at an average of 47.40 and took 6 wickets with his part-time bowling. On India's tour of the West Indies, Yuvraj hit two fifties in the ODI series. In the second ODI at Kingston, with India needing two runs to win with one wicket in hand and three balls to spare, Yuvraj was bowled by Dwayne Bravo for 93. India went on to lose the series 4-1. His poor run of form in Tests continued, with him scoring 104 runs from four matches at an average of 17.33 and a top-score of 39. In September 2006, Yuvraj was dropped from the playing eleven during the 2006-07 DLF Cup in Kuala Lumpur after he registered two consecutive ducks against Australia and West Indies. He played in two group matches of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy held in India in October. and scored 27* against England and 27 against West Indies. During a training session before India's final group fixture against Australia, Yuvraj suffered a ligament injury in his left knee. Dinesh Mongia replaced him for the match which India lost to crash out of the tournament. In November, Indian team physio Andrew Leipus suggested that Yuvraj was unlikely to recover from the injury before the start of the World Cup in March 2007. Yuvraj was not named in any of the Indian squads that toured South Africa in late 2006. In January 2007, less than two months before the World Cup, he made a comeback from injury for the last two matches of the four-match ODI series against West Indies, but did not make much of an impact in either game. Despite concerns over his fitness, Yuvraj was selected in the 15-man Indian squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, with chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar confirming that Yuvraj was fit. He featured in the last two matches of the four-ODI series against Sri Lanka in February 2007, and struck an unbeaten 83-ball 95 in the deciding final game at Visakhapatnam. India won the match by seven wickets and the series 2-1. Yuvraj made 47 in India's first match of the World Cup, a shock defeat to Bangladesh. In India's next group match at Port-of-Spain against World Cup debutants Bermuda, he hit 83 off 46 balls to help India post a total of 413/5, the highest total in World Cup history at the time. After their emphatic against Bermuda, India were left with a must-win final group fixture against Sri Lanka. Chasing 255 to win the match, Yuvraj was run out for 6, as India were bowled out for 185 and made an early exit from the World Cup. In the three-match ODI series against South Africa in Ireland, Yuvraj took 3 for 36 and scored an unbeaten 49 in the second ODI before winning man of the match for his unbeaten 61 in the series-deciding final game. On India's tour of England, Yuvraj remained on the bench throughout the Test series before finishing third on the run-scorers list in the ODI series with 283 runs from 7 matches at an average of 40.42. 2007 World Twenty20 and vice-captaincy Yuvraj was the vice-captain of the Indian squad at the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. In India's Super 8 match against England at Durban, he hit six sixes in an over off Stuart Broad. In the process, he reached the fastest fifty ever in a Twenty20 game, off just 12 balls, which was also the fastest in any form of international cricket. This was the fourth time that six sixes had been hit in one over in senior cricket, the first time in Twenty20 cricket, and the first time in any form of international cricket against a bowler from a Test playing nation. He finished his innings with 58 runs off 16 balls and won the man of the match. Yuvraj missed the next game against South Africa due to a minor but recovered before the semifinal against Australia. In the semifinal, he top-scored with 70 off 30 balls and also hit the longest six of the tournament () off the bowling of Brett Lee).

She was launched on 17 January 1942 by Lady Royle, wife of First Naval Member Sir Guy Royle, and commissioned into the RAN on 7 September 1942. Operational history=World War II Echuca‚Äôs initial role was as an anti-submarine patrol and convoy escort vessel along the eastern Australia coast and in New Guinea waters. She stayed in this role from October 1942 until August 1944, when she was ordered to Darwin and attached to the United States Seventh Fleet's Survey Group. She performed survey duties until the end of World War II, when she was refitted with minesweeping gear in Brisbane and assigned to the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla. The Flotilla was responsible for clearing minefields set up in the waters of Australia, New Guinea, New Britain, and the Solomon Islands. Echuca received the battle honours \\"Pacific 1942‚Äì44\\" and \\"New Guinea 1943‚Äì44\\" for her wartime service. Echuca was paid off into Reserve in August 1946, but recommissioned in January 1947 for mine clearance work in the Great Barrier Reef. The corvette performed this duty until August 1947, and in November 1947 towed the decommissioned corvette to Sydney. Echuca was decommissioned again in Fremantle on 29 June 1948. At the end of April 1952, the corvette was sailed to Melbourne. RNZN service On 5 March 1952, Echuca and three other Bathurst-class corvettes (HMA Ships Inverell, , and ) were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). She was commissioned into the RNZN in May 1952, and received the prefix HMNZS. The corvette remained in service with the RNZN until 1967, although from 1953 she was classified as being in reserve. She was sold to Pacific Scrap Limited of Auckland for scrapping on 11 April 1967.

Foresters estimate the Treaty Oak to be about 500 years old. Before its vandalism in 1989, the tree's branches had a spread of . The tree is located in Treaty Oak Park, on Baylor Street between 5th and 6th Streets, in Austin's West Line Historic District. History and legends=Legends A Native American legend holds that the Council Oaks were a location for the launching of war and peace parties. Legends also hold that women of the Tejas tribe would drink a tea made from honey and the acorns of the oaks to ensure the safety of warriors in battle. According to popular local folklore, as well as the inscription on the plaque at the tree's base, in the 1830s early Texas pioneer Stephen F. Austin met local Native Americans in the grove to negotiate and sign Texas' first boundary treaty after two children and a local judge were killed in raids. No historical documentation exists to support this event actually taking place. Folklore also holds that Sam Houston rested beneath the Treaty Oak after his expulsion from the Governor's office at the start of Texas' involvement in the American Civil War. History As more and more European-Americans settled in Texas, the Council Oaks fell victim to neglect and the development of the city of Austin. By 1927 only one of the original 14 trees remained. The American Forestry Association proclaimed this tree the most perfect specimen of a North American tree, and inducted the Treaty Oak into its Hall of Fame in Washington, D.C. Beginning in the 1880s, the tree was privately owned by the Caldwell family in Austin. Because she could no longer afford to pay property taxes on the land, in 1926 the widow of W.H. Caldwell offered the land for sale for $7,000. While local historical groups urged the Texas Legislature to buy the land, no funds were appropriated. In 1937, the City of Austin purchased the land for $1,000 and installed a plaque honoring the tree's role in Texas history. Vandalism In 1989, in an act of deliberate vandalism, the tree was poisoned with the powerful hardwood herbicide Velpar. Lab tests showed the quantity of herbicide used would have been sufficient to kill 100 trees. The incident sparked community outrage, national news reports, and a torrent of homemade \\"Get Well\\" cards from children that were displayed on the fence around the park. Texas industrialist Ross Perot wrote a blank check to fund efforts to save the tree. DuPont, the herbicide manufacturer, established a $10,000 reward to capture the poisoner. The vandal, Paul Cullen, was apprehended after reportedly bragging about poisoning the tree as a means of casting a spell. Cullen was convicted of felony criminal mischief and sentenced to serve nine years in prison. The intensive efforts to save the Treaty Oak included applications of sugar to the root zone, replacement of soil around its roots and the installation of a system to mist the tree with spring water. Although arborists expected the tree to die, the Treaty Oak survived. Still, almost two-thirds of the tree died and more than half of its crown had to be pruned. Today In 1997, the Treaty Oak produced its first crop of acorns since the vandalism. City workers gathered and germinated the acorns, distributing the seedlings throughout Texas and other states. Today the tree is a thriving, though lopsided, reminder of its once-grand form. Many Texans see the Treaty Oak as a symbol of strength and endurance. In January 2009, the Texas chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture teamed up with the Austin Parks and Recreation Department to do maintenance pruning on the Treaty Oak.

In a 1975 case, the tribes challenged state efforts to regulate their hunting and fishing off the reservations, based on their rights in the treaties of St. Peters (1837) and La Pointe (1842). On August 21, 1987, the U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb ruled that six Ojibwe (Chippewa) tribal governments had the right under these treaties for hunting and fishing throughout their former territory. Protests erupted in Wisconsin among sports fishermen and resort owners who were opposed to tribal members spearfishing walleye during spawning season. Protests continued into 1991 against the Ojibwe walleye harvests. Tribal supporters successfully petitioned federal courts to issue an injunction against the protesters, curbing the protest events at boat landings.Lac du Flambeau v. Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin 991F. 2d 1249 (7th Cir. 1993) The events were chronicled in a Mother Jones 1991 article,Vold, M. 1991 \\"A people's birthright: Not for sale.\\" Mother Jones 16 (1): 42. books published in 1994 and 2002, and a documentary film, Lighting the Seventh Fire (1995). Background of court cases During the 1970s, American Indian activism increased on a number of fronts, in terms of land claims, treaty rights, and tribal sovereignty to exercise traditional practices. This particular conflict started in 1973, when two members of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of the Ojibwe Nation crossed a reservation boundary that divided Chief Lake, cut a hole in the ice, and harvested fish with spears, contrary to Wisconsin state laws. In a class taught by attorney Larry Leventhal, the members had learned their band held by treaty an unresolved claim to off-reservation hunting and fishing rights in the northern part of the state. The members were arrested and a Sawyer County judge convicted them under state law of poaching, as they were fishing out of season. The Lac Courte Oreilles band joined the legal fight on behalf of the two tribal members, contending that they had the right to fish off the reservation without restrictions because of mid-19th-century treaties made by the bands with the US government; at the time, the bands ceded hundreds of thousands of acres of land to the US. The case was heard in US District Court as it related to treaty rights. This court upheld the band's treaty rights to traditional hunting and fishing throughout its former territories, without regulation by the state. The state appealed, and the Seventh Court of Appeals' decision also upheld the rights of the Ojibwe. The state appealed again, but the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the state's argument to reverse the lower court decision. After the highest court refused to reverse, five other Chippewa bands joined the Lac Courte Oreilles' legal action. The Seventh Circuit sent the case back to U.S. District Court with instructions for the court to determine the scope of the treaty rights and to resolve conflicts related to regulation of off-reservation resources. On August 21, 1987, the U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb ruled that six Ojibwe (Chippewa) tribal governments had the right under these federal treaties for hunting and fishing throughout their former territories. In settling questions about regulation of off-reservation hunting and fishing, Judge Crabb ruled the state could intervene to protect natural resources, but that tribes had the right first to establish their own regulatory system. This could prevail if they showed the court their system was as protective of the resource as was the state's system. After detailed scientific testimony, Crabb approved a natural resource code adopted by the six tribal governments, which allowed members to harvest walleye and other fish using traditional methods during the spawning season, when lakes are closed to state-licensed anglers. Conflict By late April 1988 of the spring spearfishing season, residents and visitors of Park Falls, Wisconsin, rallied at Butternut Lake. A band of fishers were led by Tom Maulson, a former judge and council member of the Lac du Flambeau Band.\\"Tom Maulson.\\" Ojibwe: Waasa-Inaaabidaa. Retrieved 11 Jan 2012. The crowd pressed against the fishers, the tribal wardens, and the few state game wardens, pushing them toward the water. Local police declined to render aid, and the standoff lasted until a convoy of officers was brought from Superior, almost distant. They made their way through the crowd to rescue the fishers and game wardens. With the opening of the 1989 fishing season, the Ojibwe and other interested groups wondered what would take place. Governor Tommy Thompson, a Republican, mobilized the state's Division of Emergency Government to form a Treaty Rights Task Force. He ordered them to find a way to keep the peace. Dressed in riot gear, police stood shoulder to shoulder, often three deep, with sticks and shields ready to stop the crowd if they pressed past snow fences hastily erected for crowd control. During the spring walleye spawning seasons of 1989, 1990, and 1991, the task force deployed hundreds of police officers from around the state to help local sheriffs maintain order at lakes where Chippewa members began exercising their newly reaffirmed rights. Hundreds of protesters lined boat landings to make their case that tribal members enjoyed \\"special rights\\" under Crabb's decision. They shouted offensive slogans and sometimes threw rocks at the tribal fishers and the protection officials. To disrupt the fishing, protesters launched boats and circled the fishers at high speed, trying to upend the Chippewa fishers, who were standing in boats to spear fish by lamplight. Other protesters joined mass arrests, at least one of which degraded into a melee when police moved to seize sound amplification devices from protest leaders. In 1989, pro-treaty groups organized as the Midwest Treaty Network in support of the Ojibwe fishing families. Activists such as Walter Bresette of the Red Cliff Band from northern Wisconsin and Minneapolis-St. Paul asked witnesses to document by video the anti-Indian harassment and violence at the boat landings. He issued Witness for Nonviolence Reports in 1990 and 1991. Convoys of activists from the American Indian Movement in Minneapolis also joined the protests, playing native drums to sound above emergency power generators and protesters' chants. Resolution Protests subsided in 1991 as a result of developments on several fronts. On April 10, 1990, the first day of spearing season the previous year, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson signed a bill authorizing a fine of as much as $1,000 for anyone preventing Chippewas from spearfishing.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/04/24/wisconsin- fights-annual-fishing-war/7bc29ba7-c340-42b6-94fb-3145b7df9315/ During the spring of 1991, because of a late thaw, the Vilas County Sheriff imposed weight limits on county roads that prohibited travel by the heavy satellite news vehicles sent by local and national tv news departments to cover the protests. Protesters could show up, but there was no chance of being interviewed on camera. Seeing a significant drop in heightened emotion at the boat landings. During the following years, weight limits were again imposed at the same time as spearing season. The Lake of the Torches Casino in nearby Lac du Flambeau had recently opened. Many who lived on the reservation now had full time jobs at the gaming establishment and stopped their participation in spearing fish for fear of losing their jobs if they were absent. Dean Crist, head of the \\"Stop Treaty Abuse\\" https://journaltimes.com/news/national/spearfishing-protests-lack- enthusiasm/article_a2511a4a-87d6-55b1-b5b9-693117ffb105.html, and Tom Maulsen, http://www.ojibwe.org/home/pdf/Tom_Maulson_LDF.pdf tribal chairman from Lac du Flambeau were interviewed on camera, not at the boat landings, but outside their places of business during the day with no protests in the background. Judge Crabb issued an injunction against the \\"Stop Treaty Abuse\\" group for physically harassing and blocking the exercise of treaty rights by the Lac du Flambeau Ojibwa. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission reported that the Ojibwe speared only 3% of the walleye in treaty-ceded territory. By this time, protest leaders had lost considerable prestige by reports of their groups' racially motivated chants, gunshots, bombings, and frequent rock throwing and slingshot attacks. Also in 1991, the newly elected Wisconsin Attorney General, James Doyle, reached an agreement with the six tribes by which neither the state nor the Chippewa would further appeal the federal court rulings. The state legislature passed a hunters' protection law and a law requiring schools statewide to include information about local tribes in history and geography curricula. This included an explanation of the treaty rights they had acquired in exchange for ceding hundreds of thousands of acres of land to the US, which benefited countless European-American settlers. Later in the 1990s, some of those sportfishing groups that had originally opposed Native American fishing rights, worked with northern Wisconsin tribes to protect the fish from industry plans for metallic sulfide mining, particularly the Crandon mine. As a result of the protests, a team of federal, state, and tribal biologists formed the Joint Assessment Steering Committee in 1990 to analyze the impact of sportfishing and spearfishing on walleye populations. More than 20 years of research by the panel of fisheries biologists has shown that the walleye resource is not harmed by spring spearing, noting that only 9% of the tribal harvest is made up of females.Fishery Status Update in the Wisconsin Ceded Territory, US Dept of Interior, 6th ed., 2013 Representation in other media The treaty rights fishing battles captured national attention from media, including the political magazine Mother Jones. The events, issues, and people were explored in Lighting the Seventh Fire (1995), a documentary film made by Sandra Osawa (Makah) and broadcast nationally on PBS on July 4, 1995. The title refers to an Ojibwe prophecy about the seventh fire, when the people's traditions will be revived after a time of trial. Two books have also been written about the events. The bands' legal challenges are considered to be part of a renewal of activism since the late 20th century by Native American tribes to exercise their treaty rights, pursue land claims, exercise rights to traditional hunting and fishing when not explicitly addressed in a treaty, and exercise sovereignty.

The Green armies were semi-organized local militias that opposed the Bolsheviks, Whites, and foreign interventionists, and fought to protect their communities from requisitions or reprisals carried out by third parties. The Green armies were politically and ideologically neutral, but at times associated with the Socialist- Revolutionary Party. The Green armies had at least tacit support throughout much of Russia, however their primary base, the peasantry, were largely reluctant to wage an active campaign during the Russian Civil War and eventually dissolved following Bolshevik victory in 1922. Background The Green movement formed as a popular reaction of the peasantry against Bolshevik activities in the countryside during the Russian Civil War, which began after the October Revolution in November 1917. The Bolshevik government instituted the War Communism policy in 1918, sending officials through the peasant lands of central Russia to collect supplies that the state needed to sustain the military and to begin building a socialist economy. Official requisitioning of peasant property occurred, with common targets including recruits for the Red Army, horses, and grain. Requisitioning units and agricultural overseers often overstepped their official duties, plundering households indiscriminately and harming villagers. The official policies inflamed passions, and their harsh implementation engendered widespread resentment to the Bolshevik regime. The bloody repression of any popular unrest further alienated the peasantry, and when the Green armies began to form, Bolshevik excesses led many peasants to devote themselves to anti-Bolshevik activities. Compare: Vladimir N. Brovkin, Behind the Front Lines of the Civil War: Political Parties and Social Movements in Russia, 1918-1922 (Princeton: Princeton University, 1994), 130-54. Constituents, leadership and goals Despite Soviet attempts to associate the Green armies with White leadership, such a designation overemphasizes the political aspects of the movement. In a broad sense, the Green armies were spontaneous manifestations of peasant discontent rather than of any specific ideology. By 1920, the Bolsheviks had secured victory over the Whites and the peasant soldiers of the Red Army, outraged at the prospect of continuing to violently oppress their own class in the interest of the new government, deserted and consolidated in groups in the forests, eventually leading to their \\"Green\\" designation. While these groups primarily opposed the Bolsheviks, they often did so without a plan or alternative form of government in mind; rather, they simply wanted to rid the countryside of Bolshevik influence by any means necessary.Orlando Figes, Peasant Russia, Civil War: The Volga Countryside in Revolution (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 319-20. Besides Soviet records of their oppositional activity, there is very little personal information about the Green leaders, described as \\"men who acted and wrote not\\" due to the widespread illiteracy and spontaneous nature of their movement.Oliver H. Radkey, The Unknown Civil War in Soviet Russia: A Study of the Green Movement in the Tambov Region 1920-1921 (Stanford: Hoover Institution, 1976), 48. In order to build substantial forces, a motivated individual would lead a group of soldiers through the countryside, enlisting village inhabitants and deserters from the Red Army along the way. The leaders would enter a village and make an announcement, employing simple messages and vague, reactionary goals in their rhetoric to rouse enthusiasm. They often exaggerated Bolshevik weakness and opposition victories as a means to convince listeners to join. By keeping the objectives simple, the recruitment indiscriminate, and the mood optimistic, Green leaders succeeded in provoking a sense among the peasants that they could make a significant dent in Bolshevik power.Radkey, Unknown Civil War, 70-94. They also drew support from disillusioned urban and railroad workers, who had \\"fled back to the villages\\" and informed the peasants about the horrendous working conditions of developing industry.Graeme J. Gill, Peasants and Government in the Russian Revolution (London: Macmillan, 1979), 185. Tactics and activity While it can be difficult to distinguish Green armies from other forms of peasant unrest, they were marked by concentrated leadership and distinct units, displaying a higher level of organization than most peasant uprisings. For instance, Aleksandr Antonov's Green army in Tambov had a medical staff, reinforcement brigades, and a complex system of communication and intelligence that employed women, children, and the elderly.Radkey, Unknown Civil War, 139-47. Notable Green movements also developed in the regions of Novgorod, Tula, Ryazan, Tver, Voronezh, Kostroma, Syzran, Gomel, Kursk, Bryansk and Oryol, among many others.Brovkin, Behind the Front Lines of the Civil War, 155-62. Estimations of Green forces ranged from a few hundred to fifty- thousand. Apart from the weapons that Red deserters brought with them, the Greens stole war material from defeated Bolshevik soldiers, from Bolshevik supply buildings, and from abandoned garrisons of the former Imperial Russian Army. They incited armed resistance to Bolshevik institutions in nearby villages and towns, bragging of peasant victories and recruiting new soldiers, sometimes by force. Green bands conducted highly mobile guerrilla warfare, attacking Bolshevik communication systems, mills, railways and factories, as well as Red Army detachments if they were comparable in size.Raleigh, Donald J. Experiencing Russia‚Äôs Civil War, (Princeton: Princeton University, 2002), 337-41. and Radkey, The Unknown Civil War, 139-74. If the peasants successfully overwhelmed Bolsheviks, they cruelly punished soldiers and officials, often mutilating bodies, torturing families or burying victims alive.Radkey, Unknown Civil War, 319-21. Cooperation with other groups Green armies often cooperated with other opposition groups ‚Äì including anarchists and moderate left-wing Socialist-Revolutionary Party ‚Äì in concerted efforts against the Bolsheviks, but generally for strategic reasons rather than ideological ones.Radkey, Unknown Civil War, 84, 142. While disillusioned Whites joined the Green cause and led some of the peasant bands, the Bolsheviks overstated the extent to which the two elements were related.Raleigh, Experiencing Russia‚Äôs Civil War, 382. Prone to follow fiery rhetoric and promises of violent revenge, the peasants usually rejected leaders who announced a primarily political goal or who represented the more moderate interests of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and other parties associated with the Provisional Government of 1917. \\"They preferred waging a desperate and lonely struggle on their own to helping the oppressors of the past [the Whites] achieve victory over the oppressors of the present [the Reds].\\"Radkey, Unknown Civil War, 407-8. Bolshevik response The Bolshevik government tried to build an anti-revolutionary, anti-communist image for the Green armies. Provincial Communist officials announced to locals that the Green armies were a subsection of the villainous White movement, despite the fact that Green armies were generally just as hostile to the Whites as they were to the Reds. The Bolsheviks also exaggerated the influence of the kulaks in Green armies, who were undoubtedly involved but hardly the driving force of the movement.Radkey, Unknown Civil War, 78-80, 104-7, 407. The Bolsheviks initially believed that they could easily defeat the Greens, treating them as a hopeless cause both in their propaganda and in their military strategies. Instead of focusing armed attention on the Greens as a whole, the Reds treated each peasant army as a specific instance of unrest, suppressing harshly and further angering the peasant population.Brovkin, Behind the Front Lines of the Civil War, 318. By the time that Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks realized the strength of the Green movement, it had grown into a serious social and military threat to Bolshevik power. Some scholars credit the Green movement with indirectly forcing the Communist Party to change its economic strategy in 1921 (see New Economic Policy), and yet, while the Greens certainly contributed to changes in Bolshevik policy, the extent of their influence is open to debate. It is far less contestable that the New Economic Policy ‚Äì along with increased rainfall ‚Äì quelled the Green movement by improving rural conditions and thus damaged the Green armies‚Äô foundation for successful recruitment ‚Äì peasant discontent. By the summer of 1922, as the Bolsheviks were securing their victory in the civil war, the Green troops had all but disappeared.Raleigh, Experiencing Russia‚Äôs Civil War, 354-87. Reasons for failure Aside from the Bolshevik response, a number of internal aspects of the Green movement led to its failure. Green activity often amounted to violence without an actual goal beyond killing communists and interrupting their economic and political activity. Thus, the armies rarely moved outside of their original geographic region.Radkey, Unknown Civil War, 49-59. When Greens conquered towns or villages, they did not install themselves politically, leaving the territory to be retaken later by Bolsheviks.Brovkin, Behind the Front Lines of the Civil War, 319-21. Furthermore, there was a great deal of tension within the bands, which often included agrarian peasants, kulaks, workers and Whites, many with preexisting resentment towards each other. The Green armies were underfunded, low on supplies, and outmatched by the Red Army (which, despite its flaws, had better organization and morale as a result of greater, more frequent victories).Radkey, Unknown Civil War, 49-59.

She was built by HM Dockyard Devonport and completed at the end of 1905. Encounter spent the first six years of her career operating with the RN's Australia Squadron, before being transferred to the newly formed RAN. During World War I, the cruiser became the first ship of the RAN to fire in anger when she bombarded Toma Ridge. Encounter operated in the New Guinea, Fiji-Samoa, and Malaya areas until 1916, when she returned to Australian waters. The ship spent the rest of the war patrolling and escorting convoys around Australia and into the Indian Ocean. In 1919, Encounter was sent to evacuate the Administrator of the Northern Territory and his family following the Darwin Rebellion. Encounter was paid off into reserve in 1920, but saw further use as a depot ship until being completely decommissioned in 1929. In 1932, the cruiser was scuttled off Sydney. Design and construction Challenger class vessels had a standard displacement of 5,880 tons, a length of overall and between perpendiculars, a beam of , and a draught of .Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 66‚Äì7 The cruisers were propelled by a Keyham 4-cylinder triple expansion steam engine, which provided 12,500 horsepower to two propeller shafts, allowing her to reach speeds just over . Her economical cruising speed was , which allowed the ship to travel before exhausting her 1,314 tons of coal. In British service, the ship's company stood at 450, but while operated by the RAN, this was reduced to 29 officers and 269 sailors. She was among the first ships of the Royal Navy to receive water-tube D√ºrr boilers. As completed, the ship's armament consisted of eleven BL 6-inch Mk VII naval guns, nine QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval guns, six 3-pounder guns, three machine guns, and two 18-inch (450-mm) torpedo tubes mounted broadside.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 67 By the 1920s, the 6-inch and 12-pounder guns had been reduced to three and four respectively, although a 12-pounder field gun was added to the ship's arsenal. A single QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun replaced the six 3-pounders, while the original three machine guns were supplanted by four Maxim guns and two Lewis guns. Encounter was laid down for the RN by HM Dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth on 28 January 1901. The ship was launched on 18 June 1902, when the naming ceremony was performed by Lady Sturges Jackson, wife of Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Sturges Jackson, Admiral-Superintendent of Devonport Dockyard. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 21 November 1905, and completed on 16 December 1905. The ship sailed for Australia on 31 December.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 49 Operational history From April 1906 to June 1912, Encounter served as part of the RN Australia Squadron.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 68 Herbert Wilson, a petty officer aboard Encounter, published his personal log covering 1910‚Äì1912, including an account of the British expeditions to Vava ªu for the total solar eclipse of 28 April 1911.

In the course of that operation, she captured the steamer Zambezi on 12 August and, on 14 September, bombarded Toma Ridge to support the Australian Military and Naval Expeditionary Force which was besieging the town. That action made her the first RAN ship to fire in anger. She covered the landing at Madang on 24 September. In October, she was sent to the Fiji- Samoa area. During a patrol of the region on 25 April 1915, Encounter captured the German sailing vessel Elfriede.Gardiner & Gray,Conway's All The World's Fighting Ships 1906‚Äì1921, p. 16 In 1915, Encounter underwent refit in Sydney, then sailed on 21 July to transport a garrison to Fanning Island. Sometime in 1915, the ship sustained hull damage from a coral reef at Johnson Island. Temporary repairs were made at Suva, before the ship sailed to Hong Kong for permanent repairs. The cruiser also operated in the Malay archipelago during early 1916, but was recalled to Australian waters on 11 February 1916, because all other RAN ships had been deployed elsewhere. In July 1916, during a visit to an unnamed island off the coast of Western Australia, two bronze cannons were discovered by Encounter officers Commander C.W. Stevens and Surgeon Lieutenant W. Roberts. The latter described: Because the guns were erroneously thought to be carronades, the place was named \\"Carronade Island\\".Green, The Carronade Island guns and Australia's early visitors On 12 January 1917, Encounter was ordered to New Zealand, where she met a convoy of Australian and New Zealand troopships. The cruiser remained with the convoy until a rendezvous point in the Indian Ocean, where responsibility was handed over to ships of the East Indies Station. On 6 July, Encounter assisted SS Cumberland, which had struck a mine off Gabo Island. In August, the cruiser assisted in the search for the missing merchantman SS Matunga; it was not known until 1918 that she had been a victim of the German raider . The ship visited Mopelia Island in September 1917, to search for the wreck of the German raider . From December 1917 until April 1918, Encounter underwent refit in Sydney, and then returned to Western Australia.

Commercial Pacific Cable Company was founded in 1901, and ceased operations in October 1951. It provided the first direct telegraph route from America to the Philippines, China, and Japan. The company was established as a joint venture of three companies: the Commercial Cable Company (25%), the Great Northern Telegraph Company (25%), and the Eastern Telegraph Company (50%). Though the Eastern (a British firm) was the majority shareholder, the CPCC was registered in the United States. The company used cable ships to lay its undersea cable across the Pacific Ocean from America's west coast. The cables extended a length of and the project cost about $12 million. Before this, messages had to travel across the Atlantic to the Far East via Cape Town and the Indian Ocean, or via London to Russia, then across the Russian landline to Vladivostok, then by submarine cable to Japan and the Philippines. The first section of cable was laid in 1902 by the cableship CS Silvertown from Ocean Beach, adjacent to the famous Cliff House in San Francisco to Honolulu. It began operating on January 1, 1903. Later that year, cables were laid from Honolulu to Midway Atoll, thence to Guam, thence to Manila. The cables carried the first message to ever travel around the globe from US President Theodore Roosevelt on July 4, 1903. He wished \\"a happy Independence Day to the US, its territories and properties...\\" It took nine minutes for the message to travel worldwide. In 1906 Siemens AG made and laid the section from Guam to Bonin Islands in the Japanese archipelago. In the same year the India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company manufactured and laid a cable between Manila and Shanghai using CS Silvertown and CS Store Nordiske. CS Dickenson, built in 1923 In the First World War the trans-Pacific service slowed significantly from repeated faults and the general increase in war-related traffic. Despite repeated requests by United States businesses and the Federal government, the company would not invest in improvements to increase traffic volume or speed. After the war conditions eased, but demand continued to be high and the company made repeated promises to invest in a second cable, but never did so. When the US entered the Second World War, the cable connection from Midway to the Philippines closed quickly after 7 December 1941, and did not reopen until the war was over. By 1946 the cables were developing serious faults. Over a million dollars was spent on repairs, but the company was unable to maintain a viable service and stopped operating in 1951.

Built by HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown, Victoria, Flinders was commissioned into the RAN in 1973, and was used to conduct hydrographic surveys in the waters to Australia's north, including parts of New Guinea. In 1974, the ship was tasked with assisting clean up efforts in the wake of Cyclone Tracy, which devastated large parts of Darwin. The ship was decommissioned in 1998 and sold to civilian operators, who have since converted her into a private yacht in the Cayman Islands.

Most operations were intended to be in the waters of Australia and Papua New Guinea, although Flinders was also capable of limited oceanographic work. The ship's company consisted of 38 personnel, and Flinders carried light-calibre weapons for self-defence. Flinders was laid down by HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown, Victoria, in February 1971.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 393 She was launched on 29 July 1972 and commissioned into the RAN on 27 April 1973.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships Since 1946, p. 102 The ship cost $2,600,000.Gillett & Graham, Warships of Australia, p. 274. Operational history On commissioning, the ship was based in Cairns, and afterwards was used to undertake hydrographic surveys to Australia's north. Following the destruction of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy during the night of 24‚Äì25 December 1974, Flinders was deployed as part of the relief effort; Operation Navy Help Darwin. She sailed from Cairns on 26 December, and as the first ship to arrive, Flinders was tasked with surveying the harbour to work out the position of wrecks and the safest areas for the other RAN ships to anchor. The majority of Flinders survey work was undertaken off the Queensland coast, but in 1976 she undertook operations in the Dampier Strait, in New Guinea waters. From 1980 to 1983, she was commanded by a real-life RAN officer called James Bond, and operated off the coasts of Queensland and Papua New Guinea.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/05/22/commander-james-bond --obituary/ Flinders was decommissioned in 1998. In October 1999, the ship was sold at auction for A$518,460 to a New Zealand consortium. She was remodelled into a private yacht, and now operates as MY Plan B, registered in the Cayman Islands.

The submarine was named after the town of Onslow, Western Australia, and Sir Alexander Onslow, with the boat's motto and badge derived from Onslow's family heritage. Ordered in 1963, Onslow was laid down at the end of 1967 by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Scotland, launched almost a year later, and commissioned into the RAN at the end of 1968. Although never involved in war, three major incidents occurred during Onslows career. The first occurred in 1972, when a disgruntled sailor who disobeyed orders caused the submarine to dive to almost twice her safe operating depth. As a result, the RAN changed the Submarine Service from being able to \\"conscript\\" any sailor for submarine service to volunteer only. The second happened in 1981, when carbon monoxide fumes from one of the diesel generators filled the submarine, resulting in the death of one sailor. Although changes were made to submarine operating procedures, the boat's company was not provided with any psychological counselling, and the incident report remained classified until 2009. The third was a controversial line- crossing ceremony in 1995, which resulted in restrictions being placed on similar ceremonies aboard RAN vessels. During her career, Onslow became the first conventionally powered submarine to be fitted with anti-ship missiles, and was successful in wargames, \\"sinking\\" a seven-ship flotilla during Exercise Kangaroo 3 in 1980 and the United States supercarrier at RIMPAC 1998. Onslow was decommissioned in 1999, and was presented to the Australian National Maritime Museum, where she is preserved as a museum ship. Design and construction Onslow was one of four Oberon-class submarines ordered in 1963. The last of this group, Onslow was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. in Greenock, Scotland on 4 December 1967. She was launched by Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy on 3 December 1968, and commissioned into the RAN on 22 December 1969.White, Australian submarines, p. 199 The boat was named after the coastal town of Onslow, Western Australia, which was in turn named after Sir Alexander Onslow, the third Chief Justice of Western Australia. Onslows motto, Festina Lente (Latin for \\"Hasten Slowly\\"), is shared with the Onslow family, and the ship's badge contains a judge's wig.White, Australian submarines, p. 200 Although this was the only use of the name by the RAN, two surface ships of the Royal Navy have previously been named . The builders' plaque for Onslow The submarine is long, with a beam of , and a draught of when surfaced. At full load displacement, Onslow displaces 2,030 tons when surfaced, and 2,410 tons when submerged. The two propeller shafts are each driven by an English Electric motor providing 3,500 brake horsepower and 4,500 shaft horsepower; the electricity for these is generated by two Admiralty Standard Range supercharged V16 diesel generators. These could propel the submarine at up to on the surface, and up to when submerged. Onslow had a maximum range of at , and a test depth of below sea level. When launched, the boat had a company of 8 officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she decommissioned, the number of sailors had increased to 60. In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried. Unlike other submarines in her class, Onslow was fitted with a four-man diver access hatch, allowing for easier deployment and recovery of special forces divers.Shaw, HMAS Onslow, p. 10 Armament The main armament of Onslow was six bow torpedo tubes, capable of firing torpedoes or releasing sea mines. The British Mark 8 torpedo was initially carried by the submarine; this was replaced by the wire-guided Mark 23.Shaw, HMAS Onslow, p. 21 During a refit from 1982 to 1984, Oberon became the first conventionally powered submarine in the world to be fitted with anti-ship missiles; specifically the UGM-84 Sub Harpoon. At the same time, the Mark 23 torpedoes were replaced by the United States Mark 48 wire-guided torpedo. As of 1996, the standard payload of Onslow was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles. Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by Mark 5 Stonefish sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes. The submarine's secondary armament consisted of two stern- mounted, short-length torpedo tubes: these were intended for use against pursuing submarines, but the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes shortly after the boat entered service made these redundant, and they were closed off during the 1982-84 refit.Shaw, HMAS Onslow, p. 19 The aft tubes fired Mark 20 anti-submarine torpedoes. Operational history=1970‚Äì1981 Onslow arrived in Sydney at the conclusion of her delivery voyage to Australia on 4 July 1970. On board was Vice Admiral Sir Victor Smith, at the time the Chief of Naval Staff, who had embarked at Brisbane. The boat visited Pearl Harbor later that year; arriving without being detected by the USN until she surfaced in the middle of the harbour.Pratley, Farewell to a quiet achiever, p. 59 Onslow returned to Pearl Harbor in 1971 to participate in the RIMPAC multinational naval exercise.Shaw, HMAS Onslow, p. 6 During the exercise, a practice torpedo fired by the United States Coast Guard Cutter failed to disengage as designed and hit the submarine‚Äîthe only damage was a small dent near the stern. In 1972, the first major incident of Onslows career occurred. The submarine was performing dive tests off the continental shelf outside Sydney Heads. One of the boat's company, transferred to the RAN Submarine Service against his will, refused to obey an order to close the valve on forward ballast tank, causing it to overfill with seawater and forcing the submarine into a steep crash dive. The dive took Onslow to a depth of , well beyond the safe operating depth of the , before another sailor was able to close the valve. Seven tons of water had been taken on by the ballast tank, and with not enough compressed air available to completely empty the tank and allow the submarine to rise, Onslows company had to rely on the submarine's twin propeller screws to help make it to the surface. The sailor responsible for the incident was beaten by his comrades and removed from the submarine in a straitjacket upon the boat's return to submarine base . This incident led the RAN to change submarine service to volunteers only. Onslow became the first vessel of the RAN to be assigned to the ANZUK force in Singapore on 22 July 1972.Gillett, Warships of Australia, p. 198 During another ANZUK deployment, in 1974, the boat's attack periscope was damaged when it came in contact with the log probe of the frigate . The boat returned to Australia on 18 December. On 5 May 1975, Onslow began a two-year refit at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, becoming the first Australian submarine to use the dockyard's new slave dock.Jeremy, Cockatoo Island, p. 64 This dock had been built specifically for refit work on Oberon-class submarines, and was the main location of all Onslows refits until 1990. In 1977, Onslow was presented with the Gloucester Cup, marking her as the most efficient warship in the RAN during the previous year‚ÄîOnslow was the first submarine to receive the award. Onslow underway on the surface. A sailor is standing near the original bow sonar dome. This dome was replaced during the submarine's 1982‚Äì84 refit, as the new sonar was larger. In 1980, Onslow participated in Exercise Kangaroo 3 as an opposing submarine.Richards & Smith, Onslow's Jolly Roger, pp. 11‚Äì12 During the exercise, Onslow carried out successful simulated attacks on all seven surface ships involved in the exercise without being 'sunk' herself, including a simultaneous 'attack' on two United States Navy (USN) amphibious warfare vessels and a RAN replenishment ship while they were under escort by the other four warships. To indicate her success, the submarine flew a Jolly Roger from her communications mast upon her return to port, which was marked with the silhouettes of her seven targets: the s and , the , the , the , the , and the . The second major incident of the boat's career happened on 1 March 1981, when Onslow was participating in wargames with a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate off the coast of Sydney.Seconds from Disaster [Sunday Night segment] While operating at periscope depth, the submarine spotted an 'enemy' P-3C Orion aircraft and stopped snorting (the process of taking in air to operate the boat's two diesel generators and expelling the produced exhaust through a snorkel) in preparation to go deep. Both generators were turned off, but upon diving, it was quickly discovered that the starboard diesel had failed to switch off or had restarted and as the exhaust snorkel was sealed, the carbon monoxide exhaust filled the submarine. Onslow rapidly resurfaced, and the exhaust was pumped from the submarine. Able Seaman Christopher Passlow, who had been on the lower deck of the submarine at the time, died of asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning, while another eighteen were rendered unconscious or were convulsing because of blood poisoning.White, Australian submarines, p. 203 Upon returning to base, doctors found that one-third of the 66 survivors had absorbed twice the lethal limit of carbon monoxide into their blood. The company was given a week's leave, with no further assistance from the RAN; psychological or otherwise. Two submariners were later awarded decorations for bravery.Stewart, Sailors washed off submarine as rescue kept quiet The RAN Board of Inquiry into the incident concluded that the accident was caused by human error‚Äîthe duty engineer failed to shut down both engines‚Äîbut members of Onslows complement disagree with this, claiming the problem to be mechanical in origin. Changes were made to Submarine Service operating procedures as a result of the Inquiry, but the investigation and subsequent report remained classified until 2009, when the information was acquired by the Sunday Night newsmagazine program under the Freedom of Information Act. When interviewed by Sunday Night in March 2009, the deputy Chief of Navy, Rear Admiral Davyd Thomas (who had been Passlow's divisional officer prior to the incident) promised counselling for the survivors, and claimed that prior treatment of the Onslow submariners was due to a limited understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder back in the 1980s. 1982‚Äì1990 Onslow underwent a modernisation refit from 1982 until 1984; becoming the third Australian Oberon to be modernised.White, Australian submarines, p. 202 As part of the modernisation, integrated data processing and fire control systems were installed, and the boat was fitted with Micropuffs passive ranging sonar.White, Australian submarines, p. 201 The torpedo payload was upgraded to the United States Mark 48 wire-guided torpedo. In addition to new torpedoes, the modernisation allowed Oberon-class submarines to carry and fire the Harpoon anti-ship missile through the torpedo tubes: Onslow became the first conventionally powered submarine in the world to be fitted with guided anti-ship missiles.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy ‚Äì Historic Naval Events Year by Year, p. 303 Onslow was the first Australian submarine to visit the west coast of the United States of America when she arrived in San Diego on 17 July 1985.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy ‚Äì Historic Naval Events Year by Year, p. 304 The boat made goodwill visits to the cities of San Francisco and Seattle during mid-August, before participating in the Royal Fleet Review for the 75th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy.Australian Submarine to visit San Francisco, PR Newswire, p. 7 Onslows \\"safe to dive\\" certificate ran out just after Christmas 1989.Grigson, Nothing doing down under for our subs, p. 3 The Australian government had been trialling a program whereby refit work was tendered out to the private sector; delays in selecting the winning company and allocating the funds meant that an 18-month refit of the submarine scheduled to begin at the start of 1990 did not commence on time. Australian Defence Industries (ADI) was awarded the $100 million refit contract for Onslow and sister submarine in July.Grigson, $100M submarine refits to stay in Sydney, p. 2 Cockatoo Island's slave dock was transferred to the ADI facilities at Garden Island in November 1990, and was used for the refit. It was later found, during arbitration between the Australian Government and Cockatoo Island Dockyard for various issues, that by tendering out the submarine refits to other companies, the government was in breach of contract with the Dockyard; A$17.3 million in compensation was awarded to the dockyard in August 1996 for loss of profits and overhead costs.Jeremy, Cockatoo Island, pp. 52‚Äì3 1990‚Äì1999 In the early 1990s, four of Onslows sister boats were decommissioned from service. By 1996, Onslow and Otama were the only members of the class in active service. During 1995, Onslow was deployed to South East Asia. During this deployment, the personnel of Onslow were involved in a controversial line-crossing ceremony while operating near the equator.Weaver, Navy crosses the line with anal antics, p. 13 During this particular ceremony, normally intended to induct new sailors into the 'court of King Neptune', the victims were verbally and physically abused, had their pelvises and genitals covered in what was described as a \\"blistering concoction\\", then thrown overboard and forced to stay there until the rest of the company permitted them on board. When one of the victimised sailors complained to superiors, he became subject to several administrative errors and inconveniences, to the point where he was forced to resign a year later. The sailor acquired a copy of a videotape made of the ceremony and presented it to the Nine Network, which broke the story on 6 July 1999. An inquiry into the incident aboard Onslow was held, which found that although guidelines had been developed in the years after the incident to prevent harassment in the Australian Defence Force, disciplinary charges against the sailors involved could not be laid, as more than three years had passed since the offence.Australian Associated Press, Sailors won't be disciplined over videotaped ceremony The inquiry also stated that while line-crossing ceremonies would continue to be held aboard RAN vessels, they would be supervised by a non-involved member of the crew to prevent similar extreme situations developing. The deployment ended in December, with Onslow visiting her namesake town for the last time on her return to Australia.Barton, Onslow snubbed on sub visit, p. 38 On the evening of 16 April 1997, three Australian Special Air Service Regiment soldiers were injured when they were thrown from their Zodiac boat during launch and recovery exercises with the submarine.Seymour, SAS men hurt in submarine exercise, p. 4 Later that year, in November, Onslow participated in a joint RAN-RAAF exercise off the coast of Western Australia.Cusworth, Farewell flight for fighters, p. 48 Over the end of 1997 and the start of 1998, Onslow and Otama were used for trials of the Australian-designed Narama towed array sonar.Narama Sonar secures first sales, Jane's Navy International, p. 36 The Narama sonar was one of the towed arrays under consideration for incorporation with the under-development s, and was the array selected. In mid-1998, the date of Onslows decommissioning was announced for early 1999. Representatives from the town of Onslow, Western Australia requested that the submarine visit her namesake town before decommissioning, but were informed that the submarine's planned operational schedule could not accommodate such a visit. As part of this schedule, Onslow participated in the 1998 RIMPAC exercise.Curtis, Pride of the fleet The submarine had to pull out of the early part of the exercise: a resistor in the motor room switchboard had begun to smoke, forcing Onslow to return to Pearl Harbor for repairs.Stott & Jaumeson, Navy sinks Indonesian fishing vessel, p. 6 She departed on 12 July, but was forced to return less than 24 hours later when a smouldering smell was noticed. The boat's luck changed during the latter part of RIMPAC 98, when on the morning of 10 August, Onslow located the 'enemy' , closed to within without being detected, then released green flares to indicate her location, 'sinking' the supercarrier. From 7 November onwards, Onslow was used as the target submarine for the annual Fincastle competition.Blenkin, RAAF use old technology to hunt old sub in annual comp Onslow operated on a secret patrol course south of Kangaroo Island while aircraft from the competing Australian, British, Canadian, and New Zealand air forces attempted to locate and 'sink' her.

Onslow was docked next to , another warship belonging to the museum, and was officially opened to the public on 1 June 1999. Onslow is the second RAN submarine to be preserved as a museum ship; the first was sister submarine , which was decommissioned at the end of 1998 and installed at the Western Australian Maritime Museum.Australian Associated Press, Submarine to rest at museum after distinguished service As of 2004, she is one of seven Oberon-class submarines preserved in this manner.Weaver, The conservation of heritage submarines, pp. 58‚Äì9left On 22 November 2002, Onslow was taken by tugs to Garden Island for three weeks of maintenance in drydock.Brough, Onslow in dry dock 2002, p. 30 This included cleaning and repainting of the hull,Davis, Sub surfaces in Sydney replacement of the tributyltin coating used to prevent biofouling with a coating that was not harmful to marine organisms, and the sealing of several ballast tanks to improve the boat's stability and raise the aft section relative to the waterline.Brough, Onslow in dry dock 2002, p. 31 Onslow was returned to the museum on 11 December, and re-opened to the public three days later. In October and November 2008, Onslow returned to Garden Island for maintenance and upkeep. During this refit, an additional torpedo was loaded into the submarine's torpedo tubes and her hull was cleaned and painted.Brooke, Oberon sub surfaces at Fleet Base East, p. 10 Another docking occurred on 18 May 2012, with hull cleaning, rust removal, repainting, and repairs to the boat's aft torpedo tubes done before she returned to display on 6 June.Vanoac, Cold War sub gets polished In November 2015, the submarine was moved to the new Warships Pavilion 'Action Stations' at the Australian National Maritime Museum alongside HMAS Vampire (D11) and HMAS Advance.

One of six submarines ordered by the RAN during the 1960s, Orion, named after the constellation in a break from ship-naming tradition, was built in Scotland and commissioned in 1977. Orion was one of two Oberon-class submarines designed for intelligence gathering and conducted regular patrols in Soviet, Indian and Chinese waters to gather information regarding enemy capabilities. Orion was decommissioned in 1996, marked for disposal in 2003, and broken up for scrap in 2006. Several sections of the submarine remain intact as memorials and museum pieces. Design and construction The Oberon class was based heavily on the preceding Porpoise class of submarines, with changes made to improve the vessels' hull integrity, sensor systems, and stealth capabilities.Chant, A Compedium of Armaments and Military Hardware, pp. 167‚Äì8 Eight submarines were ordered for the RAN, in two batches of four.Cooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 188 The first batch was approved in 1963, and the second batch (including Orion) was approved during the late 1960s, although two of these were cancelled before construction started in 1969, with the funding redirected to the Fleet Air Arm.Cooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 194Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, pp. 394‚Äì5 This was the fourth time the RAN had attempted to establish a submarine branch.Dennis et al., The Oxford Companion to Australian Military history, p. 399 The submarine was long, with a beam of , and a draught of when surfaced. At full load displacement, she displaced 2,030 tons when surfaced, and 2,410 tons when submerged. The two propeller shafts were each driven by an English Electric motor providing 3,500 brake horsepower and 4,500 shaft horsepower; the electricity for these was generated by two Admiralty Standard Range supercharged V16 diesel generators.Shaw, HMAS Onslow, p. 15 The submarine could travel at up to on the surface, and up to when submerged, had a maximum range of at , and a test depth of below sea level. When launched, the boat had a company of 8 officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she decommissioned, the number of sailors had increased to 60. In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried. A small number of non-RAN personnel, most often from the Defence Signals Directorate, were also present during some intelligence gathering missions. The main armament of the Oberons consisted of six torpedo tubes. The British Mark 8 torpedo was initially carried by the submarine; this was later replaced by the wire-guided Mark 23.Shaw, HMAS Onslow, p. 21 Between 1977 and 1985, the Australian Oberons were upgraded to carry United States Navy Mark 48 torpedoes and UGM-84 Sub Harpoon anti-ship missiles. As of 1996, the standard payload of an Australian Oberon was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles. Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by Mark 5 Stonefish sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes.Sharpe (ed.), Jane's Fighting Ships, 1996‚Äì1997, p. 23 On entering service, two stern-mounted, short-length torpedo tubes for Mark 20 anti-submarine torpedoes were fitted. However, the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes made the less-capable aft- firing torpedoes redundant; they were closed off, and later removed during a refit.Shaw, HMAS Onslow, p. 19 Orion was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Greenock, Scotland on 6 October 1972, launched on 16 September 1974, and commissioned into the RAN on 15 June 1977.Sharped (ed.), Jane's Fighting Ships 1992‚Äì93, p. 22 The submarine was due to enter service in 1975, but faulty high-power electrical cabling had been installed in Orion and sister boat ; stripping out and replacing the cabling delayed each submarine's construction by two years.Owen, in Mitchell, Australian Maritime Issues 2010, p. 31 The delay meant that the two boats could be fitted with Micropuffs rangefinding sonar during construction, and have additional electronic surveillance equipment installed.Owen, in Mitchell, Australian Maritime Issues 2010, pp. 32‚Äì3 Orions name comes from the constellation Orion: although a name with strong links to the Royal Navy (with six vessels operating as ), this was a break from the RAN's traditional use of the names of explorers and pioneers for submarines.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 394 The submarine's motto of \\"Orbe Circumcincto\\" (Latin for \\"All around the world\\") refers to the visibility of the constellation from any point on Earth.Orion set to become a reality in Jindabyne, in Summit Sun Operational history Orion was the first ever Australian vessel to visit a German port. On her delivery voyage from Scotland in 1978, Orion recorded communications and any other signals emitted from Libyan Navy vessels around the ports of Tripoli, Benghazi, Darnah and Tobruk at the request of the United Kingdom and the United States. As Orion and Otama were fitted with specialist intelligence gathering equipment, they were regularly deployed on surveillance and spying operations, earning them the nickname \\"Mystery Boats\\".Owens, in Centenary of Australian Submarines, pp. 103-5Seal & Blake, Century of Silent Service, p. 85 Activities were part of the broader Western nations' intelligence-gathering apparatus, and included surveillance off the coasts of China, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, tailing of Soviet Pacific Fleet units during operations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and observation off the Soviet base at Vladivostok. These activities continued until the end of the Cold War in 1992, and most of Orions activities and deployments during this period remain classified. The first captain of Orion, Commander Rob Woolrych MBE, stated that Orion and Otama conducted sixteen intelligence-gathering missions during their service between March 1978 to December 1992. Each mission was under the command of the Chief of the Defence Force, authorised by the Minister for Defence and conducted with the knowledge of the Prime Minister. Regular patrols were conducted for six to eight weeks. On occasion, Orion and Otama would dock in British naval facilities in Singapore or Hong Kong for refuelling and maintenance. Orion and Otama would remain just off the horizon‚Äîaround five nautical miles from a target‚Äîat periscope depth to observe surroundings and record information during operations close to enemy waters. Batteries which powered the submarines would be recharged during the night and intelligence gathering took place during daylight hours. The submarine was equipped with passive sonar hydrophones which allowed it to record signatures from Soviet vessels, identifying the capabilities of each individual vessel. On 27 September 1980 the Officers and Crew of Orion were granted the Freedom of the City of Wollongong in perpetuity. In 1987, Orion was awarded the Gloucester Cup, for being the RAN vessel demonstrating the greatest overall efficiency over the previous twelve months.Davidson & Allibone, Beneath Southern Seas, p. 204 Orion was the last submarine to receive the Cup until 2005, when it was presented to the Collins class submarine . Like a number of other Oberon class submarines, Orion carried out many special operation deployments during her service which qualified those crew members for the Australian Service Medal, with Special Operations clasp. Conducted between 1978 and 1992, these operations involved intelligence-gathering missions off the coasts of Vietnam, Indonesia, China and India, primarily targeting the Soviet Navy during the Cold War. Decommissioning and fate HMAS Orion memorial at Rockingham Naval Memorial Park Orion paid off into reserve at Garden Island, Western Australia in 1996. She remained there for several years, until she was marked for disposal as scrap in September 2003. Efforts to hand her over to a State Government for preservation as a museum ship or sinking as a dive wreck failed, and submissions for disposal companies were closed off on 6 August 2004. The submarine was sold for scrapping, and was broken up by Tenix at Henderson, Western Australia in December 2006. The fin was given to the City of Rockingham and is now mounted as a permanent memorial at Rockingham Naval Memorial Park. The port propeller was donated to the Western Australia Maritime Museum. In November 2011, authorisation was granted to establish a new Australian Naval Cadets unit in Jindabyne, New South Wales, named New Training Ship (NTS) Orion after the submarine. In addition to the name, the cadet unit will use Orions badge and motto.

Built in Scotland, the submarine was the last of the class to enter service when commissioned into the RAN in 1978. Otama was a specialist, one of two \\"Mystery Boats\\", fitted with additional surveillance and intelligence- gathering equipment.Barker, The Mystery Boats Otama was routinely deployed on classified operations to obtain intelligence on Soviet Pacific Fleet vessels and Chinese Navy vessels, and conducted associated coastal surveillance, throughout Asia. The submarine was part of the RAN's largest flag-showing cruise in the Indian Ocean during 1980. From 1983 to 1985, she underwent an extensive upgrade. On Monday 3 August 1987 , two submariners died when Otama submerged while they were still working in the fin. Otama remained in service until late 2000; a delay from her original planned decommissioning date to help attenuate the problems with the replacement s. Otama was sold to the Western Port Oberon Association in 2001, which planned to preserve her as a museum vessel as part of the proposed Victorian Maritime Centre. Submissions to build the maritime museum at various locations on the Mornington Peninsula were repeatedly rebuffed. In late 2008, the submarine was listed for sale on eBay, but despite several expressions of interest, Otama was not sold. In- principle approval to build the Victorian Maritime Centre on reclaimed land adjacent to the Western Port Marina at Hastings was granted in 2013, but as of 2016, planning permits have not been approved. Design and construction The Oberon class was based heavily on the preceding Porpoise class of submarines, with changes made to improve the vessels' hull integrity, sensor systems, and stealth capabilities.Chant, A Compedium of Armaments and Military Hardware, pp. 167‚Äì8 Eight submarines were ordered for the RAN, in two batches of four.Cooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 188 The first batch was approved in 1963, and the second batch (including Otama) was approved during the late 1960s, although two of these were cancelled before construction started in 1969, with the funding redirected to the Fleet Air Arm.Cooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 194Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, pp. 394‚Äì5 This was the fourth time the RAN had attempted to establish a submarine branch.Dennis et al., The Oxford Companion to Australian Military history, p. 399 The submarine was long, with a beam of , and a draught of when surfaced. At full load displacement, she displaced 2,030 tons when surfaced, and 2,410 tons when submerged.

When launched, the boat had a company of 8 officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she decommissioned, the number of sailors had increased to 60. In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried. The main armament of the Oberons consisted of six torpedo tubes. The British Mark 8 torpedo was initially carried by the submarine; this was later replaced by the wire-guided Mark 23.Shaw, HMAS Onslow, p. 21 After a multi-year refit ending in 1985, Otama was upgraded to carry United States Navy Mark 48 torpedoes and UGM-84 Sub Harpoon anti-ship missiles; the last Australian Oberon to undergo the Submarine Weapon Update Program.Owen, in Mitchell, Australian Maritime Issues 2010, p. 32 As of 1996, the standard payload of an Australian Oberon was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles. Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by Mark 5 Stonefish sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes.Sharpe (ed.), Jane's Fighting Ships, 1996‚Äì1997, p. 23 On entering service, two stern-mounted, short-length torpedo tubes for Mark 20 anti-submarine torpedoes. However, the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes made the less-capable aft-firing torpedoes redundant; they were closed off, and later removed during a refit.Shaw, HMAS Onslow, p. 19 Otama was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Greenock, Scotland on 25 May 1973, launched on 3 December 1975, and commissioned into the RAN on 27 April 1978.Sharped (ed.), Jane's Fighting Ships 1992‚Äì93, p. 22 The submarine was due to enter service in 1976, but faulty high-power electrical cabling had been installed in Otama and sister boat ; stripping out and replacing the cabling delayed each submarine's construction by two years.Owen, in Mitchell, Australian Maritime Issues 2010, p. 31 The delay meant that the two boats could be fitted with Micropuffs rangefinding sonar during construction that the earlier built boats were due to receive as an upgrade.Owen, in Mitchell, Australian Maritime Issues 2010, pp. 32‚Äì3 Otama was the sixth and final Oberon-class submarine to enter service with the RAN.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, opp. p. 32 The boat's name comes from a North Queensland Aboriginal word meaning \\"dolphin\\"; this was a break in RAN tradition, which had used the names of explorers and pioneers for previous submarines.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 394 Otama was assigned the pennant number 62.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 77 The high standard of internal fittings compared to the rest of the class led to the \\"Gucci Boat\\" nickname.Seal & Blake, Century of Silent Service, p. 83 Otama received a special electronic surveillance fit after Orion had been fitted with this during construction.

Commemorative plaque at Rockingham Naval Memorial Park for the three sailors killed on board of Australian Oberons On 3 August 1987, two sailors were killed aboard Otama. At 09:00, the submarine left HMAS Platypus to test a new towed hydrophone array.Waller, Suddenly Dead, p. 6 Extreme weather forced the cancellation of the test, and two sailors were sent into the fin at around 10:20 to retrieve and stow the array. At 10:35, the submarine was prepared for diving, and she submerged four minutes later, with the two men still in the fin. The submariners, on noticing their vessel diving underneath them, climbed up the fin to the bridge and opened the voicepipe in an unsuccessful attempt to contact the control room before being washed overboard. Their absence was not noticed until around 11:00, despite post-dive checks and a rotation of duty stations in the interim, and was not confirmed for at least another half-hour. A search for the submariners was conducted, and one of the bodies was spotted, but could not be recovered.Waller, Suddenly Dead, p. 7 Estimated survival time in the prevailing conditions was only five minutes, and the submariners were not required to wear lifebelts. A naval board of inquiry recommended that action be taken against two officers, although the Navy Office did not take action, as there were multiple factors leading into the incident, and court martialing the two officers could find one or both held solely responsible for the deaths.Waller, Suddenly Dead, pp. 3‚Äì4 In addition to the rejection of the board's findings, several officers involved in the incident (including the two singled out by the inquiry), were promoted.Waller, Suddenly Dead, p. 10 A coronial inquiry followed (one of the first heard by the new office of the State Coroner of New South Wales), to which there was some opposition by the RAN, including advising personnel not to cooperate with the task force gathering evidence for the inquiry, and attempting to fend off a request by the coroner for a trip on the submarine replicating the events of the day. Following two separate weeks of hearings in October and November 1988, the state coroner concluded that the incident was the sum of multiple moderate-to-minor breaches of operating procedure and careless negligence (including that notices indicating personnel were outside the submarine were not posted, and key personnel were not informed) aboard a submarine operating in non-standard conditions (such as the testing of new equipment, along with observers and trainees aboard, and a high rotation of personnel between stations in a short period of time).Waller, Suddenly Dead, pp. 5-10 The coroner singled out Otamas commanding officer for allowing so many rules and procedures to be ignored under his command, but did not find sufficient cause to recommend charges against any individual.Waller, Suddenly Dead, pp. 8-9 Several changes were made to casing operational procedures at sea, including making lifebelts compulsory and requiring the senior petty officer on duty to sign out and sign back in personnel working outside.Waller, Suddenly Dead, pp. 7, 10 The fatalities aboard Otama were two of the only three deaths aboard Australian Oberons.Owen, in Centenary of Australian Submarines, p. 105 From 1996, Otama was given approval to conduct coastal surveillance operations using its specialist intelligence-gathering equipment on Indonesia in particular to obtain information on East Timor. At the end of March 1999, Otama was reassigned to in Western Australia, where the s were operating.Owens, in Centenary of Australian Submarines, pp. 103-4Subs leave harbour behind, The Daily Telegraph, p. 4 Within days of leaving Sydney, sister boat was paid off, leaving Otama the only one of her class in service, and the submarine base at HMAS Platypus was cleared for closure.

Otama arrived in Western Port Bay in 2002, where she was moored while waiting for the approval and development of the museum. By late 2008, plans for three separate locations for the Victorian Maritime Centre ‚Äì Hastings, Crib Point, and Stony Point ‚Äì had all been rejected by the Department of Sustainability and Environment. As the Western Port Oberon Association could no longer afford to maintain the submarine while waiting for a favourable decision, Otama was listed on eBay for sale in November 2008.Seal & Blake, Century of Silent Service, p. 84Clifton-Evans, Is eBay the answer?College & Warlow, Ships of the Royal Navy, p. 291 Although no bids were placed by the time the online auction closed in late December, the association received several expressions of interest: including from the St Kilda Marina, Frankston City Council, and one purporting to be a tourism operator but believed by the Western Port Oberon Association to be wanting to restore the submarine for drug smuggling (which was referred to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation).Stewart, Submarine for sale as group's dream sinks in a sea of red tapeSubmarine fails to sell on Ebay, in The Shipping Times No sale was made, and the submarine remained in the possession of the association.

Due to its generally flat shape it is often used for anthropogenic structures such as settlements and infrastructure. A raised beach is an emergent coastal landform. Raised beaches and marine terraces are beaches or wave-cut platforms raised above the shoreline by a relative fall in the sea level. Around the world, a combination of tectonic coastal uplift and Quaternary sea-level fluctuations has resulted in the formation of marine terrace sequences, most of which were formed during separate interglacial highstands that can be correlated to marine isotope stages (MIS). A marine terrace commonly retains a shoreline angle or inner edge, the slope inflection between the marine abrasion platform and the associated paleo sea-cliff. The shoreline angle represents the maximum shoreline of a transgression and therefore a paleo-sea level.

The width is quite variable, reaching up to , and seems to differ between the northern and southern hemispheres.Pethick, J (1984): An Introduction to Coastal Geomorphology. Arnold&Chapman;&Hall;, New York, 260p. The cliff faces that delimit the platform can vary in steepness depending on the relative roles of marine and subaerial processes.Masselink, G; Hughes, MG (2003): Introduction to Coastal Processes & Geomorphology. Arnold&Oxford; University Press Inc., London, 354p. At the intersection of the former shore (wave-cut/abrasion-) platform and the rising cliff face the platform commonly retains a shoreline angle or inner edge (notch) that indicates the location of the shoreline at the time of maximum sea ingression and therefore a paleo-sea level. Sub-horizontal platforms usually terminate in a low tide cliff, and it is believed that the occurrence of these platforms depends on tidal activity. Marine terraces can extend for several tens of kilometers parallel to the coast. Older terraces are covered by marine and/or alluvial or colluvial materials while the uppermost terrace levels usually are less well preserved. While marine terraces in areas of relatively rapid uplift rates (> 1 mm/year) can often be correlated to individual interglacial periods or stages, those in areas of slower uplift rates may have a polycyclic origin with stages of returning sea levels following periods of exposure to weathering. Marine terraces can be covered by a wide variety of soils with complex histories and different ages. In protected areas, allochtonous sandy parent materials from tsunami deposits may be found. Common soil types found on marine terraces include planosols and solonetz.Finkl, CW (2005): 'Coastal Soils' in Schwartz, ML (ed) Encyclopedia of Coastal Science. Springer, Dordrecht, pp. 278‚Äì302  Formation  It is now widely thought that marine terraces are formed during the separated highstands of interglacial stages correlated to marine isotope stages (MIS).Bull, W.B., 1985. Correlation of flights of global marine terraces. In: Morisawa M. & Hack J. (Editor), 15th Annual Geomorphology Symposium. Hemel Hempstead, State University of New York at Binghamton, pp. 129‚Äì152.  Causes  sea level reconstructions during the last 500Ma. The scale of change during the last glacial/interglacial transition is indicated with a black bar. The formation of marine terraces is controlled by changes in environmental conditions and by tectonic activity during recent geological times. Changes in climatic conditions have led to eustatic sea-level oscillations and isostatic movements of the Earth's crust, especially with the changes between glacial and interglacial periods. Processes of eustasy lead to glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations due to changes of the water volume in the oceans and hence to regressions and transgressions of the shoreline. At times of maximum glacial extent during the last glacial period, the sea level was about lower compared to today. Eustatic sea level changes can also be caused by changes in the void volume of the oceans, either through sedimento-eustasy or tectono- eustasy.Ahnert, F (1996) ‚Äì Einf√ºhrung in die Geomorphologie. Ulmer, Stuttgart, 440 p. Processes of isostasy involve the uplift of continental crusts along with their shorelines. Today, the process of glacial isostatic adjustment mainly applies to Pleistocene glaciated areas. In Scandinavia, for instance, the present rate of uplift reaches up to /year.Lehmkuhl, F; R√∂mer, W (2007): 'Formenbildung durch endogene Prozesse: Neotektonik', in Gebhardt, H; Glaser, R; Radtke, U; Reuber, P (ed) Geographie, Physische Geographie und Humangeographie. Elsevier, M√ºnchen, pp. 316‚Äì320 In general, eustatic marine terraces were formed during separate sea level highstands of interglacial stages and can be correlated to marine oxygene isotopic stages (MIS). Glacioisostatic marine terraces were mainly created during stillstands of the isostatic uplift. When eustasy was the main factor for the formation of marine terraces, derived sea level fluctuations can indicate former climate changes. This conclusion has to be treated with care, as isostatic adjustments and tectonic activities can be extensively overcompensated by a eustatic sea level rise. Thus, in areas of both eustatic and isostatic or tectonic influences, the course of the relative sea level curve can be complicated.Worsley, P (1998): 'Altersbestimmung ‚Äì K√ºstenterrassen', in Goudie, AS (ed) Geomorphologie, Ein Methodenhandbuch f√ºr Studium und Praxis. Springer, Heidelberg, pp. 528‚Äì550 Hence, most of today's marine terrace sequences were formed by a combination of tectonic coastal uplift and Quaternary sea level fluctuations. Jerky tectonic uplifts can also lead to marked terrace steps while smooth relative sea level changes may not result in obvious terraces, and their formations are often not referred to as marine terraces.  Processes  Marine terraces often result from marine erosion along rocky coast lines in temperate regions due to wave attack and sediment carried in the waves. Erosion also takes place in connection with weathering and cavitation. The speed of erosion is highly dependent on the shoreline material (hardness of rock), the bathymetry, and the bedrock properties and can be between only a few millimeters per year for granitic rocks and more than per year for volcanic ejecta. The retreat of the sea cliff generates a shore (wave-cut/abrasion-) platform through the process of abrasion. A relative change of the sea level leads to regressions or transgressions and eventually forms another terrace (marine-cut terrace) at a different altitude while notches in the cliff face indicate short stillstands. It is believed that the terrace gradient increases with tidal range and decreases with rock resistance. In addition, the relationship between terrace width and the strength of the rock is inverse, and higher rates of uplift and subsidence as well as a higher slope of the hinterland increases the number of terraces formed during a certain time. Furthermore, shore platforms are formed by denudation and marine-built terraces arise from accumulations of materials removed by shore erosion. Thus a marine terrace can be formed by both erosion and accumulation. However, there is an ongoing debate about the roles of wave erosion and weathering in the formation of shore platforms. Reef flats or uplifted coral reefs are another kind of marine terrace found in intertropical regions. They are a result of biological activity, shoreline advance and accumulation of reef materials. While a terrace sequence can date back hundreds of thousands of years, its degradation is a rather fast process. On the one hand a deeper transgression of cliffs into the shoreline may completely destroy previous terraces; on the other hand older terraces might be decayed or covered by deposits, colluvia or alluvial fans. Erosion and backwearing of slopes caused by incisive streams play another important role in this degradation process.  Land and sea level history  The total displacement of the shoreline relative to the age of the associated interglacial stage allows calculation of a mean uplift rate or the calculation of eustatic level at a particular time if the uplift is known. In order to estimate vertical uplift, the eustatic position of the considered paleo sea levels relative to the present one must be known as precisely as possible. Our chronology relies principally on relative dating based on geomorphologic criteria but in all cases we associated the shoreline angle of the marine terraces with numerical ages. The best-represented terrace worldwide is the one correlated to the last interglacial maximum (MISS 5e) (Hearty and Kindler, 1995; Johnson and Libbey, 1997, Pedoja et al., 2006 a, b, c). Age of MISS 5e is arbitrarily fixed to range from 130 to 116 ka (Kukla et al., 2002) but is demonstrated to range from 134 to 113 ka in Hawaii and Barbados (Muhs et al., 2002) with a peak from 128 to 116 ka on tectonically stable coastlines (Muhs, 2002). Older marine terraces well represented in worldwide sequences are those related to MIS 9 (~303‚Äì339 ka) and 11 (~362‚Äì423 ka) (Imbrie et al., 1984Imbrie, J. et al., 1984. The orbital theory of Pleistocene climate: support from revised chronology of the marine 18O record. In: A. Berger, J. Imbrie, J.D. Hays, G. Kukla and B. Saltzman (Editors), Milankovitch and Climate. Reidel, Dordrecht, pp. 269‚Äì305.). Compilations show that sea level was 3 ¬± 3 meters higher during MISS 5e, MIS 9 and 11 than during the present one and ‚àí1 ¬± 1 m to the present one during MIS 7 (Hearty and Kindler, 1995, Zazo, 1999). Consequently, MIS 7 (~180-240 ka; Imbrie et al., 1984) marine terraces are less pronounced and sometimes absent (Zazo, 1999). When the elevations of these terraces are higher than the uncertainties in paleo- eustatic sea level mentioned for the Holocene and Late Pleistocene, these uncertainties have no effect on overall interpretation. Sequence can also occurs where the accumulation of ice sheets have depressed the land so that when the ice sheets melts the land readjusts with time thus raising the height of the beaches (glacio-isostatic rebound) and in places where co-seismic uplift occur. In the latter case, the terrace are not correlated with sea level highstand even if co-seismic terrace are known only for the Holocene.  Mapping and surveying  Aerial photograph of lowest marine terrace at Tongue Point, New Zealand For exact interpretations of the morphology extensive datings, surveying and mapping of marine terraces is applied. This includes stereoscopic aerial photographic interpretation (ca. 1 : 10,000 ‚Äì 25,000), on- site inspections with topographic maps (ca. 1 : 10,000) and analysis of eroded and accumulated material. Moreover, the exact altitude can be determined with an aneroid barometer or preferably with a levelling instrument mounted on a tripod. It should be measured with the accuracy of and at about every , depending on the topography. In remote areas technics of photogrammetry and tacheometry can be applied.  Correlation and dating  Different methods for dating and correlation of marine terraces can be used and combined.  Correlational dating  The morphostratigraphic approach focuses especially in regions of marine regression on the altitude as the most important criterion to distinguish coast lines of different ages. Moreover, individual marine terraces can be correlated based on their size and continuity. Also paleo-soils as well as glacial, fluvial, eolian and periglacial landforms and sediments may be used to find correlations between terraces. On New Zealand's North Island, for instance, tephra and loess were used to date and correlate marine terraces. At the terminus advance of former glaciers marine terraces can be correlated by their size, as their width decreases with age due to the slowly thawing glaciers along the coast line. The lithostratigraphic approach uses typical sequences of sediment and rock strata to prove sea level fluctuations on the basis of an alternation of terrestrial and marine sediments or littoral and shallow marine sediments. Those strata show typical layers of transgressive and regressive patterns. However, an unconformity in the sediment sequence might make this analysis difficult. The biostratigraphic approach uses remains of organisms which can indicate the age of a marine terrace. For that often mollusc shells, foraminifera or pollen are used. Especially Mollusca can show specific properties depending on their depth of sedimentation. Thus they can be used to estimate former water depths. Marine terraces are often correlated to marine oxygene isotopic stages (MIS) (e.g. Johnson, M. E.; Libbey, L. K. 1997) and can also be roughly dated using their stratigraphic position.  Direct dating  There are various methods for the direct dating of marine terraces and their related materials including 14C radiocarbon dating, which is the most common one.Schellmann, G; Br√ºckner, H (2005): 'Geochronology', in Schwartz, ML (ed) Encyclopedia of Coastal Science. Springer, Dordrecht, pp. 467‚Äì472 E.g. this method has been used on the North Island of New Zealand to date several marine terraces. It utilizes terrestrial biogenic materials in coastal sediments such as mollusc shells analyzing the 14C isotope. In some cases dating based on the 230Th/234U ratio was applied though in case of detrital contamination or low uranium concentrations a high resolution dating was found to be difficult. In a study in southern Italy paleomagnetism was used to carry out paleomagnetic datingsBr√ºckner, H (1980): 'Marine Terrassen in S√ºditalien. Eine quart√§rmorphologische Studie √ºber das K√ºstentiefland von Metapont', D√ºsseldorfer Geographische Schriften, 14, D√ºsseldorf, Germany: D√ºsseldorf University and luminescence dating (OSL) was used in different studies on the San Andreas Fault and on the Quaternary Eupcheon Fault in South Korea. In the last decennia, the dating of marine terraces has been enhanced since the arrival of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides method, and particularly through the use of 10Be and 26Al cosmogenic isotopes produced in-situ. These isotopes record the duration of surface exposure to cosmic rays. and this exposure age reflects the age of abandonment of a marine terrace by the sea. In order to calculate the eustatic sea level for each dated terrace it is assumed that the eustatic sea-level position corresponding to at least one marine terrace is known and that the uplift rate has remained essentially constant in each section.  Relevance for other research areas  Marine terraces south of Choapa River in Chile. These terraces have been studied among others by Roland Paskoff. Marine terraces play an important role in the research on tectonics and earthquakes. They may show patterns and rates of tectonic uplift and thus may be used to estimate the tectonic activity in a certain region. In some cases the exposed secondary landforms can be correlated with known seismic events such as the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake on the Wairarapa Fault near Wellington, New Zealand which produced a uplift.Crozier, MJ; Preston NJ (2010): 'Wellington's Tectonic Landscape: Astride a Plate Boundary' in Migo≈Ñ, P. (ed) Geomorphological Landscapes of the World. Springer, New York, pp. 341‚Äì348 This figure can be estimated from the vertical offset between raised shorelines in the area. Furthermore, with the knowledge of eustatic sea level fluctuations the speed of isostatic uplift can be estimatedPress, F; Siever, R (2008): Allgemeine Geologie. Spektrum&Springer;, Heidelberg, 735 p. and eventually the change of relative sea levels for certain regions can be reconstructed. Thus marine terraces also provide information for the research on climate change and trends in future sea level changes. When analyzing the morphology of marine terraces it must be considered, that both eustasy and isostasy can have an influence on the formation process. This way can be assessed, whether there were changes in sea level or whether tectonic activities took place.  Prominent examples  Quaternary marine terraces at Tongue Point, New Zealand Raised beaches are found in a wide variety of coast and geodynamical background such as subduction on the pacific coast of South America (Pedoja et al., 2006), of North America, passive margin of the Atlantic coast of South America (Rostami et al., 2000), collision context on the Pacific coast of Kamchatka (Pedoja et al., 2006), Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Japan (Ota and Yamaguchi, 2004), passive margin of the South China sea coast (Pedoja et al., in press), on west-facing Atlantic coasts, such as Donegal Bay, County Cork and County Kerry in Ireland; Bude, Widemouth Bay, Crackington Haven, Tintagel, Perranporth and St Ives in Cornwall, the Vale of Glamorgan, Gower Peninsula, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay in Wales, Jura and the Isle of Arran in Scotland, Finist√®re in Brittany and Galicia in Northern Spain and at Squally Point in Eatonville, Nova Scotia within the Cape Chignecto Provincial Park. Other important sites include various coasts of New Zealand, e.g. Turakirae Head near Wellington being one of the world's best and most thoroughly studied examples. Also along the Cook Strait in New Zealand there is a well-defined sequence of uplifted marine terraces from the late Quaternary at Tongue Point. It features a well preserved lower terrace from the last interglacial, a widely eroded higher terrace from the penultimate interglacial and another still higher terrace, which is nearly completely decayed. Furthermore, on New Zealand's North Island at the eastern Bay of Plenty a sequence of seven marine terraces has been studied. Santa Cruz, California, note Highway 1 running along the coast along the lower terraces Along many coasts of mainland and islands around the Pacific, marine terraces are typical coastal features. An especially prominent marine terraced coastline can be found north of Santa Cruz, near Davenport, California, where terraces probably have been raised by repeated slip earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault.Pirazzoli, PA (2005b.): 'Tectonics and Neotectonics', Schwartz, ML (ed) Encyclopedia of Coastal Science. Springer, Dordrecht, pp. 941‚Äì948 Hans Jenny (pedologist) famously researched the pygmy forests of the Mendocino and Sonoma county marine terraces. The marine terrace's \\"ecological staircase\\" of Salt Point State Park is also bound by the San Andreas Fault. Along the coasts of South America marine terraces are present, where the highest ones are situated where plate margins lie above subducted oceanic ridges and the highest and most rapid rates of uplift occur. At Cape Laundi, Sumba Island, Indonesia an ancient patch reef can be found at above sea level as part of a sequence of coral reef terraces with eleven terraces being wider than . The coral marine terraces at Huon Peninsula, New Guinea, which extend over and rise over above present sea level are currently on UNESCO‚Äôs tentative list for world heritage sites under the name Houn Terraces - Stairway to the Past.UNESCO (2006): Huon Terraces ‚Äì Stairway to the Past. from https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5066/ [13/04/2011] Other considerable examples include marine terraces rising up to on some Philippine IslandsEisma, D (2005): 'Asia, eastern, Coastal Geomorphology', in Schwartz, ML (ed) Encyclopedia of Coastal Science.

Springer, Dordrecht, pp. 9‚Äì21  Related coastal geography  Uplift can also be registered through tidal notch sequences. Notches are often portrayed as lying at sea level; however notch types actually form a continuum from wave notches formed in quiet conditions at sea level to surf notches formed in more turbulent conditions and as much as above sea level (Pirazzoli et al., 1996 in Rust and Kershaw, 2000). As stated above, there was at least one higher sea level during the Holocene, so that some notches may not contain a tectonic component in their formation.

As a Republican, he served as the County Attorney for Maricopa County, Arizona from 1989 to 2004. Early life A veteran of the Vietnam War, serving in the United States Marine Corps, he received numerous commendations for his service in that war, including the Purple Heart medal. He was severely wounded by a land mine, losing both legs above the knee and suffering other injuries. Following the war, Romley went to Arizona State University in Tempe as a business management student, and graduated in 1974. He later attended ASU's law school and attained his Juris Doctor degree in 1981. Career highlights Romley was elected Maricopa County attorney in 1989. One of his highest publicized cases was his prosecution of the AzScam scandal of the early 1990s. In 2002, he initiated an investigation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix and its part in the Catholic sex abuse cases, that led to an admission of wrongdoing by the then-Bishop Thomas O'Brien. Romley also prosecuted Ray Krone for the murder of Kim Ancona. Krone, who had no prior criminal record, was convicted and sentenced to death. After spending ten years in prison, four on Death Row, Krone was freed after DNA conclusively proved that he was innocent. Romley defended his prosecution of Ray Krone by saying there was \\"strong circumstantial evidence\\" of his guilt. In response to the conclusive proof that an innocent Ray Krone spent 10-1/2 years in prison, four of which was spent on Arizona's death row, Prosecutor Romley said, \\"we will try to do better.\\" He neglected to mention that the prosecution's concealment of the odontologist's report that cast doubt on Ray's guilt prior to his first trial indicates they may have knowingly prosecuted an innocent man. (See: \\"Twice Wrongly Convicted of Murder - Ray Krone Is Set Free After 10 Years\\" by Hans Sherrer, Justice Denied Magazine, Vol. 2, Issue 9.) In 2001, he received the Disabled American Veterans' (DAV) Outstanding Disabled Veteran of the Year Award. After leaving the county attorney's post, Romley served as a special advisor to the Arizona Attorney General for six months. In August 2007, he became a personal advisor to James Nicholson, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in Washington, D.C. In April 2010 the Board of Supervisors appointed him as Interim Maricopa County Attorney when Andrew Thomas resigned amid ethics investigations from that position to run for the office of Attorney General of Arizona, making Romley only the third interim ever since 1912, following Donald Harris in 1976 and Phil MacDonnell (Andrew Thomas' Chief Deputy) in 2010.

History The title was created in 1816 for Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Londonderry. He had earlier represented County Down in the Irish House of Commons. Stewart had already been created Baron Londonderry in 1789, Viscount Castlereagh, of Castlereagh in the County of Down, in 1795 and Earl of Londonderry, of the County of Londonderry, in 1796. These titles are also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was the son of Alexander Stewart, who had married Mary Cowan, sister and heiress of Robert Cowan, who gained great wealth as Governor of Bombay from 1729 to 1737. Alexander was from Ballylawn, a townland at the south-west corner of Inishowen in the north of County Donegal, a county located in the west of Ulster in the northern part of Ireland. However, much of the Stewart family wealth was based on the estates which came into the family through this marriage. The 1st Marquess was one of the few people to become a Marquess without inheriting any titles prior to the creation. He sat in the British House of Lords as one of the twenty-eight original Irish Representative Peers from 1800 to 1821. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to Lady Sarah Seymour. The 2nd Marquess, better known as Lord Castlereagh (he went by the courtesy title of Viscount Castlereagh from 1796 to 1821), was a noted statesman and diplomat. Castlereagh is best remembered for his tenure as Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom from 1812 to 1822 and played an important role at the Congress of Vienna of 1814 to 1815. He committed suicide in 1822, one year after succeeding his father in the marquessate. The 2nd Marquess did not follow his father as a Representative Peer into the House of Lords, this permitted him to continue fulfilling his roles in the House of Commons. Castlereagh was succeeded by his half-brother, the 3rd Marquess. He was the only son from the 1st Marquess's second marriage to Lady Frances Pratt, daughter of Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden. He was a General in the Army and like his elder half-brother a prominent politician and diplomat. Lord Londonderry served as Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1807 to 1809, fought in the Napoleonic Wars and was Ambassador to Austria from 1814 to 1823. In 1814 he was created Baron Stewart, of Stewart's Court and Ballylawn in County Donegal, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1819 Londonderry married as his second wife Lady Frances Anne Vane-Tempest (died 1865), daughter and wealthy heiress of Sir Henry Vane- Tempest, 2nd Baronet, through which marriage substantial estates in County Durham came into the Stewart family. He assumed the additional surname of Vane on his marriage and in 1823 he was created Viscount Seaham, of Seaham in the County Palatine of Durham, and Earl Vane, with remainder to the male issue of his second marriage. These titles are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Londonderry was succeeded in the viscountcy of Seaham and earldom of Vane according to the special remainder by his eldest son from his second marriage while he was succeeded in the Irish titles and the barony of Stewart by his son from his first marriage to Lady Catherine Bligh, the 4th Marquess. He died childless in 1872 and was succeeded by his half-brother, the 5th Marquess, who had already succeeded his father as second Earl Vane in 1854. He represented Durham North in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Durham. In 1851 the 5th Marquess assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Tempest. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the 6th Marquess. He was a Conservative politician and held office in the administrations of Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, as Postmaster General, as President of the Board of Education, as Lord Privy Seal and as Lord President of the Council. In 1885 he assumed by Royal licence the additional and principal surname of Stewart. He was succeeded by his son, the 7th Marquess, who was also a Conservative politician. He had a career in both Irish and British politics but is best known for his role as Secretary of State for Air from 1931 to 1935. Lord Londonderry subsequently gained notoriety for his informal diplomatic contacts with senior members of the German government. He made six visits to Nazi Germany between January 1936 and September 1938 meeting Adolf Hitler on a number of occasions and sympathising with some of his viewpoints. His wife Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry, was an influential society hostess remembered for her close friendship with Ramsay MacDonald. Lord Londonderry was succeeded by his son, the 8th Marquess. He represented County Down in the House of Commons as a Conservative from 1931 to 1945. The heir apparent to the marquessate is styled Viscount Castlereagh, although the Marquess is also the Earl Vane, and the heir apparent's heir apparent, when such exists, is styled Lord Stewart\\" Between 1823 and 1854 and between 1872 and 1999, the Marquesses of Londonderry sat in the House of Lords as The Earl Vane. Between 1822 and 1823 and between 1854 and 1872, they sat as The Lord Stewart. Residences The family seat was Mount Stewart near Newtownards, County Down, Northern Ireland. The other estates were the Wynyard Park estate in County Durham, Seaham Hall in County Durham, as well as Londonderry House on Park Lane in London (where the London Hilton hotel is now) and Plas Machynlleth in mid-Wales.

It was created in 1816 for Henry Conyngham, 1st Earl Conyngham. He was the great-nephew of another Henry Conyngham, 1st Earl Conyngham, a member of a family of Scottish descent which had settled during the Plantation of Ulster in County Donegal in Ireland in the early 17th century. The 'founder' of the dynasty in Ireland was The Very Rev. Dr. Alexander Cunningham, Dean of Raphoe. The earlier Henry was a member of both the Irish House of Commons and the British House of Commons and served as Vice-Admiral of Ulster and as Governor of the counties of Donegal and Londonderry. In 1753 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Conyngham, of Mount Charles in the County of Donegal, and in 1756 he was created Viscount Conyngham, in Ireland, also in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1781 he was made Baron Conyngham, of Mount Charles in the County of Donegal, with remainder to his nephew Francis Burton, and Earl Conyngham, of Mount Charles in the County of Donegal, which like the creations of 1753 and 1756 was created with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. The latter titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Conyngham was childless and on his death in 1781 the barony of 1753, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct while he was succeeded in the barony of 1781 according to the special remainder by his aforementioned nephew Francis. He was the eldest son of Mary, sister of the first Earl Conyngham, by her husband Francis Burton. The new 2nd Baron Conyngham, who had earlier represented Killybegs and County Clare in the Irish House of Commons, assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Conyngham on succeeding to the titles. The 2nd Baron Conyngham was succeeded by his eldest twin son, Henry, the third Baron. He was a General in the British Army, one of the original 28 Irish Representative Peers, Governor of both County Donegal and County Clare and Lord Steward of the Household. He was created Viscount Conyngham, of Mount Charles in the County of Donegal, in 1789, Viscount Mount Charles and Earl Conyngham in 1797, and Viscount Slane, in the County of Meath, Earl of Mount Charles and Marquess Conyngham, of the County of Donegal, in 1816. All these titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1821 he was also made Baron Minster, of Minster Abbey in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, Francis, the second Marquess. Like his father he was a General in the Army and also held government office as Postmaster General and as Lord Steward of the Household. His eldest son, George, the third Marquess, was a Lieutenant-General in the British Army. When he died the titles passed to his eldest son Henry, the fourth Marquess. He was Vice-Admiral of Ulster. Two of his sons, Victor, the fifth Marquess (who was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General Sir John Grenfell Maxwell during World War I, and who died on November 9, 1918 in York), and Frederick, the sixth Marquess, both succeeded in the titles. Frederick's son, Frederick, succeeded him in 1974 as seventh Marquess, followed by his son Henry, the eighth Marquess, in 2009. Several other members of the Conyngham and Burton families may also be mentioned. Henry Conyngham (died 1706), father of the first Earl Conyngham (of the 1718 creation), was a Major-General in the British Army and was killed in the War of the Spanish Succession. Francis Burton (died 1743), father of the second Baron Conyngham, was a Member of the Irish Parliament for Coleraine and County Clare. William Conyngham (who assumed the surname of Conyngham in lieu of Burton in 1781), younger son of Francis Burton and younger brother of the second Baron Conyngham, was a Member of the Irish Parliament and served as a Teller of the Exchequer. The Honourable Sir Francis Burton, second son of the second Baron, was a colonial administrator and Member of Parliament for County Clare. Elizabeth Conyngham, Marchioness Conyngham, wife of the first Marquess, was a mistress of King George IV. Henry Francis Conyngham, Earl of Mount Charles, eldest son of the first Marquess, represented County Donegal in the House of Commons but predeceased his father, unmarried. Lord Albert Denison Conyngham, third son of the first Marquess, assumed the surname of Denison in lieu of Conyngham in 1849 on succeeding to the vast fortune of his maternal uncle William Joseph Denison, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Londesborough the following year (see this title for more information on this branch of the family). Lady Jane Conyngham, second daughter of the first Marquess, was a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria. Lord Francis Conyngham, second son of the second Marquess, was Member of Parliament for County Clare. The family seat is Slane Castle in County Meath. A former family seat was The Hall in the village of Mountcharles, near Donegal Town in the south of County Donegal. The family surname is pronounced \\"Cunningum\\".

It was created on 17 July 1821 for Charles Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury. On 18 March 1664, Robert Bruce, 2nd Earl of Elgin in the Peerage of Scotland was created Baron Bruce, of Skelton in the County of York, Viscount Bruce, of Ampthill in the County of Bedford, and Earl of Ailesbury, in the County of Buckingham, all in the Peerage of England. His grandson, Charles, the 3rd Earl of Ailesbury (and 4th Earl of Elgin), was created Baron Bruce, of Tottenham in the County of Wilts, on 17 April 1746, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with a special remainder to his nephew, the Honourable Thomas Brudenell, fourth and youngest son of George Brudenell, 3rd Earl of Cardigan, by Lady Elizabeth Bruce, sister of the 3rd Earl of Ailesbury. On Lord Ailesbury's death in 1747, his English titles became extinct, except for the 1746 Barony of Bruce, which was inherited by his nephew, Robert, according to the special remainder. His Scottish titles passed to his kinsman, Charles Bruce, 5th Earl of Elgin. Thomas Brudenell, 2nd Baron Bruce, assumed the additional surname of Bruce by Royal licence in 1767. On 10 June 1776 he was created Earl of Ailesbury, in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain, a revival of the title which had become extinct on his uncle's death 29 years earlier. His son, Charles Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury was created Viscount Savernake, of Savernake Forest in the County of Wilts, Earl Bruce, of Whorlton in the County of York, and Marquess of Ailesbury, in the County of Buckingham, on 17 July 1821, all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1838 his eldest son, George Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Bruce. In 1868 the 2nd Marquess also inherited the Earldom of Cardigan from his kinsman the 7th Earl of Cardigan, and so the Marquesses of Ailesbury now also hold the titles Earl of Cardigan (1661) and Baron Brudenell, of Stonton in the County of Leicester (1628), in the Peerage of England, as well as being Baronets of England, styled \\"of Deene in the County of Northampton\\". The 2nd Marquess was succeeded by his younger brother, Ernest Brudenell-Bruce, 3rd Marquess of Ailesbury, who had previously sat in the House of Commons for 46 years under the name of Lord Ernest Bruce. The 3rd Marquess was succeeded by his grandson, George Brudenell-Bruce, 4th Marquess of Ailesbury, the only son of George John Brudenell-Bruce. The 4th Marquess died bankrupt at an early age and was succeeded by his uncle, Henry Brudenell-Bruce, 5th Marquess of Ailesbury, who had previously represented Chippenham in Parliament under the name of Lord Henry Bruce. As of 2013 the titles are held by the 5th Marquess's great-grandson, Michael Brudenell-Bruce, 8th Marquess of Ailesbury, the titles having descended from father to son. The heir apparent to the Marquessate bears the courtesy title Earl of Cardigan, and his heir apparent bears the title Viscount Savernake. Between 1776 and 1821 the heir apparent to the earldom of Ailesbury bore the courtesy title Lord Bruce. Between 1821 and 1868 the heir apparent to the marquessate bore the courtesy title Earl Bruce while Earl Bruce's heir apparent bore the title Viscount Savernake. Ever since Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury succeeded his father in 1685, every Earl and Marquess of Ailesbury has also been a Hereditary Warden of Savernake Forest.Chandos Brudenell-Bruce.

This explains the usage of the title Viscount Savernake within the family. Although not an earl until 1685, Thomas Bruce had already inherited the Wardenship through his marriage to Lady Elizabeth SeymourBurke, Bernard (1866).

Lord Charles Bruce, youngest son of the 1st Marquess, was a Liberal politician. A descendant of the 3rd Marquess is the model Florence Brudenell-Bruce. The family seat was Tottenham House, near Marlborough, Wiltshire. The family last lived in the house in 1945, after which it became a school, and was sold in 2015. The Estate is held in a trust, controlled by the family. In 2013, the heir to the marquessate, Earl of Cardigan, filed a lawsuit against the trustees, alleging mismanagement. As a result, the two Trustees were ordered to stand down. Coat of arms A Bookplate showing the Brudenell-Bruce coat of arms. The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the marquessate is: Quarterly: 1st and 4th, or a saltire and chief gules on a canton argent a lion rampant azure (for Bruce); 2nd and 3rd, argent a chevron gules between three chapeaux to the sinister azure (for Brudenell). This can be translated as: a shield divided into quarters, the top left and bottom right quarters being gold, with a red saltire over the gold field, and the top part of the shield also being red. In addition, there is a white square in the top left corner of the shield with a blue lion rampant (for the Bruce family); the top right and bottom left quarters are white with a red chevron between three blue caps of state that are turned to face to the viewer's right (for the Brudenell family).

The 6th and present Marquess is Christopher George Charles Nevill (b. 23 April 1955), the son of the late Lord Rupert Nevill and Lady Anne Camilla Evelyn Wallop. He succeeded to the title in 2000 on the death of his uncle the 5th Marquess who had no surviving sons. The family seat is Eridge Park, near Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent. History=Medieval Origins The incumbent Marquess of Abergavenny is the current head of the House of Neville, a noble house of early medieval origins, notable for its central role in the Wars of the Roses. Lord Abergavenny's ancestor Edward Neville, 3rd Baron Bergavenny was a younger son of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt 1st Duke of Lancaster. Abergavenny in the Marquess's title derives from the market town in Wales in which this branch of the Nevill family inherited Abergavenny Castle, much of the family's ancestral lands and title of Baron Bergavenny by virtue of the marriage between the suo jure peeress Elizabeth de Beauchamp, Baroness Bergavenny and Edward Neville in 1424. Subsidiary Titles Subsequent Nevill Barons Bergavenny have been raised to higher ranks within the peerage. The 1st Marquess's ancestor, the de facto 17th (de jure 2nd) Baron Bergavenny, was created Earl of Abergavenny, in the County of Monmouth, and Viscount Nevill, of Birling in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of Great Britain on 17 May 1784.

He was the maternal grandfather of President George H. W. Bush and a great-grandfather of President George W. Bush, both of whom were named in his honor. He was also the amateur heavyweight-boxing champion of Missouri while studying law at Washington University. Early life George Herbert Walker was born on June 11, 1875 in St. Louis, Missouri. Walker was descended from a Maryland family of slave owners. His great- grandfather Thomas Walker was a British slave trader. He was the youngest son of David Davis Walker, a dry goods merchant from Bloomington, Illinois, and Martha Adela (Beaky). Ely, Walker & Company, which grew into a leading regional wholesaler, was later acquired by Burlington Industries. Walker was educated at Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit boarding school in England. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 1897. Business career Walker started a banking and investment firm named G.H. Walker & Co. in 1900. His family had developed many international banking contacts, and he helped organize the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Walker was known as the power behind the local Democratic Party. In 1920, Walker became the President of the W.A. Harriman & Co. investment firm, and quickly arranged the credits that W. Averell Harriman needed to take control of the Hamburg-Amerika Line. Walker also organized the American Ship and Commerce Corp. to be subsidiary of the W.A. Harriman & Co., with contractual power over the affairs of the Hamburg- Amerika. W.A. Harriman & Co. (renamed Harriman Brothers & Company in 1927) well-positioned for this enterprise and rich in assets from their German and Russian business, merged with the British-American investment house Brown Bros. & Co. on January 1, 1931. Walker retired to his own G.H. Walker & Co. This left the Harriman brothers, his son-in-law Prescott Bush and Thatcher M. Brown as senior partners of the new firm of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. The firm's London branch continued operating under its historic name Brown, Shipley & Co. Walker was a director of the W.A. Harriman & Company; Harriman Fifteen, American International Corporation; Georgian Manganese Corporation; Barnsdall Corporation; American Ship & Commerce Corporation; Union Banking Corporation; G.H. Walker & Company; Missouri Pacific Railroad; Laclede Gas and the New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railroad. Golf and horseracing In addition to his business concerns, Walker was also a golf enthusiast and a President of the United States Golf Association (USGA). The USGA's Walker Cup (the famous biennial golf match) acquired Walker's namesake for his role in the event's creation. He also coheaded the syndicate, (with W. Averell Harriman), which rebuilt the famed sports venue of Madison Square Garden and the Belmont Race Track, 1925. Personal life Walker married Lucretia Wear (1874‚Äì1961), daughter of James H. Wear and they had six children: Dorothy Wear Walker, New York Mets cofounder George Herbert Walker Jr., Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center CEO Dr. John M. Walker Sr. (father of Judge John M. Walker Jr.), James Wear Walker, Nancy Walker, and Louis Walker (S&B; 1936). His brother-in-law Joseph Walker Wear was one of the founders of the Davis Cup. His son-in-law Prescott Bush was a member of the executive committee of the USGA, serving successively as Secretary, Vice President and President, 1928‚Äì1935. Walker not only maintained the Walker's Point estate in Kennebunkport, but also a mansion on Long Island, and a stunning residence at One Sutton Place in Manhattan. In the 1930s Walker purchased the 10,000-acre (40 km¬≤) Duncannon Plantation near Barnwell, South Carolina as a private hunting retreat. In the 1940s Walker moved out of the circa 1835 plantation house, and the property became a hunting club. Much of the land was later purchased by the U.S. Government for development of the Savannah River Site. Death and legacy Walker died in 1953 in New York City, New York, aged 78. He was survived by his wife, daughter Dorothy Walker Bush, several grandchildren including George H.W. Bush, Ambassador to Hungary and Stifel Nicolas CEO George Herbert Walker III, William H. T. (Bucky) Bush, Nancy Ellis Bush, Ray Walker, Betty Walker Holden, and many great-grandchildren including George W. Bush, and Jeb Bush.

The fire marshal is often charged with enforcing fire-related laws. A fire marshal or fire commissioner, in the United States and Canada, is often a member of a state, provincial or territorial government, but may be part of a building department or a separate department altogether. Fire marshals' duties vary but usually include fire code enforcement or investigating fires for origin and cause. Fire marshals may be sworn law-enforcement officers and are often experienced firefighters. In larger cities with substantially developed fire departments the local fire departments are sometimes delegated some of the duties of the fire marshal. A fire marshal's duties vary by location. Fire marshals may carry a weapon, wear a badge, wear a uniform or plain clothes, can drive marked or unmarked cars, and make arrests pertaining to arson and related offenses, or, in other localities, may have duties entirely separate from law enforcement, including building- and fire-code-related inspections. In many areas, the fire marshal is responsible for enforcing laws concerning flammable materials.  Canada  In Ontario, the Office of the Fire Marshal of Ontario (OFM), part of the Ministry of the Solicitor General (Ontario), provides support to municipal fire departments, sets training requirements for firefighters, and advises the government on legislation. The Fire Marshal is responsible for investigating the origins of fires.  United States = Arizona fire marshals  In Arizona, fire marshals are employed at the municipal, county, and state levels of government, and possess law enforcement powers where they relate to arson investigation. At the state level, the Office of the State Fire Marshal (SFM) is led by the State Fire Marshal and employs paid deputy fire marshals and unpaid assistant fire inspectors. Deputy Fire Marshals are full time employees of the SFM, while assistant fire inspectors are appointed from local Fire chiefs or those recommended by them. Both deputies and inspectors attend fire inspector training, have fire prevention and fire protection and possess law enforcement powers where they relate to their duties. Duties of fire marshals in Arizona include: *Assisting in the enforcement of state, county, and local fire laws *Investigating the causes, origins, and circumstances of fires, including those suspected of arson *Collecting evidence *Operating a fire safety inspection program for public buildings and schools *Inspecting residential complexes *Maintaining and propagating fire-related laws *Operating an arson detection reward fund *Providing and coordinating firefighting and fire protection trainingArizona Revised Statutes Title 37 Chapter 9 Article 4  California fire marshals  Like most states, Californian fire marshals are typically associated with a city or region's local fire department. Yet, California has two additional authorities that hold the official designations of fire marshal. One is the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE).California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection It is tasked with the building code enforcement of all structures and occupancies within the state. They have the authority to issue building permits, conduct building inspections and investigate code violations. California Fire marshals are designated peace officers.California Fire marshals The person heading this office is officially designated as the State Fire Marshal. The second authority designated as fire marshals is the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) who is the state building official for all California hospitals. They are tasked with the structural, electrical and fire/life safety reliability of all hospital construction in the state. This responsibility is paramount in California due to the frequency and intensity of earthquake seismic activity it experiences.  Florida Fire Marshal  The Florida Division of State Fire Marshal (SFM) is located within the Department of Financial Services, where Florida's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) also serves as Florida's State Fire Marshal. The SFM office serves local fire departments who request assistance with conducting fire investigations and provides fire training colleges throughout the state. It is headquartered in Tallahassee, with numerous field offices located across the state.Statutes The investigators working for the SFM office are sworn law enforcement officers, with powers to make arrests, conduct searches and seizures, serve summonses, and carry firearms. These law enforcement officers conduct complex investigations and have the ability to make arrests statewide. Investigators conduct thousands of fire-related investigations each year, with approximately 45% being determined to be arson in 2009. Florida SFM investigators make arrest in 18% of the arson fires investigated, which is above the national average of 16%. Fire investigations are complex and potentially dangerous.Bureau of Fire and Arson Investigations The Florida SFM Forensic Laboratory receives and examines over 10,000 evidence submissions every year. These submissions come from fire departments, police departments, sheriff's offices and SFM investigators. The crime laboratory offers a wide variety of services to include examination of fire debris, explosives analysis, image reproduction and forensic video analysis. The forensic experts in the laboratory conduct consultations with investigators, prosecutors, and other attorneys on analyses and general aspects of forensic science. These consultations are often in preparation for expert witness testimony in criminal court.Bureau of Forensic Fire and Explosive Analysis The Florida SFM office issues over 3,000 basic firefighter certifications every year. There are thirty-five certified training centers located across the state and the Florida State Fire College. The State Fire College trains over six thousand students per year in a wide variety of certification and professional development programs to include Pump Operator, Fire Officer, Fire Investigator, HAZMAT, etc.Bureau of Fire Standards and Training The Florida SFM is responsible for inspecting over 14,000 state- owned buildings every year. SFM code enforcement and inspection activities also reach over 16,000 public and private buildings; to include prisons, universities, public schools, thousands of fuel-fired boiler systems, hundreds of construction mining sites and explosive storage locations each year.Bureau of Fire Prevention The Florida Fire Incident Reporting Section collects over 1,800,000 fire and emergency reports per year. These local fire department and fire service reports are combined with the other states reports in the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) for use by the fire services in analysis and trends. The Florida reports are also used to form the basis for the SFM Annual Report \\"Florida Fires\\".Fire and Emergency Incident Reporting Section The SFM has authority to implement rules that conform to the standards of fire safety and the need to protect Floridians from fire hazards. Additionally, the SFM shall adopt and administer rules prescribing standards for the safety and health of occupants of educational and ancillary facilities pursuant to ss. 633.022, 1013.12, 1013.37, and 1013.371. In any county that does not employ or appoint a local fire official, the State Fire Marshal shall assume the duties of the local fire official with respect to fire safety inspections of educational property required under s. 1013.12(2)(b), and the State Fire Marshal may take necessary corrective action as authorized under s. 1013.12(5).  New York City Fire Marshals  New York City Fire Marshal patch New York City's Bureau of Fire Investigation, a division of the FDNY, currently employs about 100 fire marshals and 40 supervising fire marshals. The position of fire marshal is a promotional civil service title and all officers have served several years as active firefighters. Unlike many other jurisdictions, the New York City fire marshals are armed police officers with full powers of arrest who generally work in pairs and investigate serious fires with the New York City Police Department. New York City Fire Marshals undergo comprehensive police training to include annual weapons qualification at Camp Smith. Investigations are conducted in cooperation with the New York City Police Department, with whom they have a close relationship. Most New York City fire marshals are former New York City Police officers. In a typical year they are assigned about 4,000 fires within the five boroughs of the city. New York Fire Marshals often receive special training at the FBI academy in Quantico, Virginia, as well as attending investigative classes conducted by the NYPD and explosives training classes sponsored by the federal government in Socorro, New Mexico. Under New York State Consolidated Laws Article 35.00 section 35.20 \\"deadly physical force may be used in order to terminate or prevent commission of arson.\\" The city's first fire marshal, George H. Sheldon, was appointed in 1873, eight years after the reorganization of the fire department into a career department in 1865. Robert O. Lowery became the first African-American fire marshal in 1946. Lowery would ultimately rise to the top of the department, being appointed the city's fire commissioner in 1965. Fire marshals have conducted a number of significant investigations, including the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911. They investigate insurance fraud involving arson, and more recently, potential terrorism. They also function as expert witnesses in arson cases. At times New York fire marshals work undercover and conduct surveillance operations. They also coordinate with federal, state and local law enforcement because arsonists are frequently involved in other criminal activity as well, and some investigations, like the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, require multiple agencies' skills. The first line of duty NYC fire marshal death was from the September 11, 2001, attacks when Marshal Ronald Paul Bucca, disregarding danger, rushed into the World Trade Center to assist in the rescue of civilians trapped within the towers. Bucca, badge 317, a decorated Vietnam combat war veteran, reached the 78th floor of the South Tower along with Batallion Chief Orio Palmer, before the South Tower collapsed. The pair had worked on the 1993 investigation at the same site. Professional training outside the state at the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia, and other locations for New York City marshals was made possible through federal counter-terror grants, subsequent to 9/11, actively supported by Mayor Mike Bloomberg. New York State Executive Law, article 6c, sec 159, created an arson control board that mandated every jurisdiction prepare an arson control plan and a strong coordinated arson control program to include certification of investigators in compliance with NFPA 921 and NFPA 1033. A state standard of level I and level II fire investigator certification was developed. New York City Fire Marshal's training exceeds the requirements of level II.  Pennsylvania fire marshals  There are two levels of fire marshals in Pennsylvania, the state police fire marshal and the local fire marshal. The State Fire Marshal had been an independent office until powers and duties were transferred to the state police in 1919. In 1927, the state (commonwealth) created the local fire marshal position underneath the state police, via an act of April 27, 1927 (P.L. 450, No. 291). The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) fire marshals are usually considered the final investigative authority for fires deemed exceptionally costly (over $1,000,000) or where a death has occurred. The local fire marshal notifies PSP Fire Marshals when he or she considers their involvement necessary. State law authorizes and identifies the local fire marshal as an \\"Assistant to the State Police Fire Marshal\\". Local fire marshals are selected for their positions by the local fire chief or municipality. The State Police Commissioner (Colonel) then appoints them to the PSP office. Local fire marshals are authorized to investigate fires, obtain and execute search documents, take evidence, and detain and question in the process of establishing origin and cause. This process may or may not result in affecting an arrest or prosecution. Both levels of Fire Marshals often testify in civil and criminal court proceedings, and respond and collaborate with insurance investigators. Along with state law, many municipalities have assigned local law enforcement officer (LEO) status to their respective fire marshals due to the nature of the service, requirements to detain, question or arrest, enforce fire safety-related laws, and to protect themselves during potential high-risk investigations. (Some of the largest methamphetamine labs in the U.S. have been found in Pennsylvania during local fire marshal's investigations.) All municipalities and fire districts require fundamental fire training and substantial fire fighting experience, followed by progressive continuing fire investigation education supplied by the Pennsylvania State Police. Municipalities who have granted specific LEO status usually require either PA Act 120 or PA Act 235 training in addition.  Virginia Fire Marshals  The Virginia State Fire Marshal's Office is part of the Virginia Department of Fire Programs; the current marshal is Charles E. Altizer, P.E. The mission of the office is to provide safety to life and property from fire for the citizens of the Commonwealth. To do this, the Office: * Utilizes inspectors and engineers to complete fire safety inspections in localities that do not have their own fire code official; * Conducts building plan reviews for fire safety measures; * Conducts construction inspections for fire safety systems in state buildings; * Provides assistance to local building and fire code officials; and * Responds to complaints and questions from private citizens. Many of Virginia's larger urban localities have their own local fire official. For example, Fairfax County's Office of the Fire Marshal has over 100 employees who are trained and certified to enforce a variety of fire prevention regulations including portions of the Uniform Statewide Building Code. The Office, which is the Fire Prevention Division of the Fire & Rescue Department's Business Services Bureau, functions under the command of a Deputy Fire Chief, who is responsible for oversight of all aspects of the Office's mission, including supervision of the Fire Prevention Services (FPS) and Hazardous Materials & Investigative Services (HMIS) sections, each commanded by a Battalion Fire Chief. The mission is to prevent the inception or recurrence of fire and hazardous conditions by providing fire prevention and hazardous materials- related educational, enforcement, inspection, investigative, plans review, and technical services to the businesses, industries, residents, and visitors of Fairfax County and the towns of Clifton, Herndon, and Vienna.  Washington Fire Marshals  The Washington State Fire Marshal's Office is a bureau within the Washington State Patrol. The Office of the State Fire Marshal provides services including incident reporting, data collection, code review, construction plan fire safety, fireworks and supervision of sprinkler installation.  United Kingdom  The American definition of a fire marshal should not be confused with that used in the United Kingdom. Fire marshals (sometimes known as \\"fire wardens\\") are civilians trained to assist in fire evacuation procedures at businesses and other organizations, usually employees.Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Authority, Fire Marshal Training (accessed December 1, 2006) There is no direct equivalent to a US fire marshal in the United Kingdom. The enforcement and investigation role are carried out by two separate professionals known as fire investigators and fire inspectors. Fire investigators are highly trained and experienced firefighters or fire officers, who investigate cases of arson and other fire incidents where the cause of the fire is unclear or disputed. Fire investigations can also be carried out by police scenes of crime officers. Fire investigators do not fulfill a direct law enforcement role but instead act as expert witnesses in any prosecutions brought forward by the police or fire service. The enforcement of fire safety legislation is undertaken by fire safety inspectors, or fire safety officers as they are sometimes known. UK fire officers do not have powers of arrest but can place subjects under caution and prosecute anyone who has failed to comply with fire safety law. They also have the authority to close unsafe premises and investigate any actual perceived fire safety offence. They have substantial powers of entry. Most fire inspectors are experienced firefighters / fire officers, but there are also several civilian fire inspectors.

He was the younger brother of Emperor Ming and installed by military leader Huan Wen. Prior to taking the throne, he had served in important roles in the administrations of his grandnephews Emperor Mu, Emperor Ai, and Emperor Fei. Both in his service to his grandnephews and in his own reign as emperor, he is generally viewed as a weak-willed figure who showed enough wisdom to continue to survive and extend Jin rule, but whose effectiveness was also compromised by his over-dedication to philosophical discussions of Taoism and other related philosophies. Early life Sima Yu was born in 320, as the youngest son of Emperor Yuan, by his favorite concubine Consort Zheng Achun (). As Emperor Yuan's wife Yu Mengmu () had died years earlier (in 312), and the mother of his oldest son Sima Shao the Crown Prince (later Emperor Ming), Lady Xun, had been forced to leave the palace due to Princess Yu's jealousy while she was still alive, Consort Zheng was effectively the mistress of the palace, although she never carried the title of empress. In 322, Emperor Yuan created him the Prince of Langya‚Äîthe same title that Emperor Yuan had earlier, which was therefore considered a special honor. In 323, Emperor Yuan died. In 326, Consort Zheng also died, and because, as Prince of Langya, Sima Yu was not permitted by law to mourn his mother, he, at age six, requested another title by which he could. His nephew Emperor Cheng (Emperor Ming's son), himself then a young child, permitted it, and created him the Prince of Kuaiji. As he grew in age, he was given a progression of higher and higher posts, although without actual power. During Emperor Mu's reign In 344, another nephew of Sima Yu, Emperor Kang (Emperor Cheng's younger brother), died, and was succeeded by his infant son Emperor Mu. Emperor Mu's mother Empress Dowager Chu became regent, but she largely followed the advice of prime minister He Chong (). As it was customary, at this point of Jin history, for there to be two prime ministers, He Chong recommended Empress Dowager Chu's father Chu Pou (), who declined and recommended Sima Yu instead. He Chong and Sima Yu thus shared the prime minister responsibilities until He Chong's death in 346. He Chong was replaced by Cai Mo. In 347, after the ambitious general Huan Wen, without the imperial government's approval, carried out a campaign against and destroyed Cheng Han, annexing Cheng Han territory to Jin, the imperial government became apprehensive that Huan would use this opportunity to take over. Sima Yu thus invited the official Yin Hao, who was considered able, to join him and Cai in making important decisions, to counter Huan's influence. In 350, after Cai had repeatedly declined greater honor conferred him by the emperor, Yin accused Cai of disrespecting imperial authority and had him removed, seizing more power than he had before. In 348, Sima Yu's heir apparent Sima Daosheng (), who was described as careless and frivolous, was accused of unspecified crimes, and he was deposed and imprisoned, and died in imprisonment. Sima Yu's wife and Sima Daosheng's mother, Princess Wang Jianji (), also died in distress. (She might have also been imprisoned prior to her death) His other sons, one by Princess Wang and three by various concubines, died early, and he was left without an heir, and his concubines were not conceiving any more. He retained a magician to look at his concubines to see which one could conceive an heir, and the magician looked at all of them and opined that none was destined to give him an heir‚Äîbut then he saw a dark-skinned maid who was working with textiles, who was derogatorily referred to as a Malay, named Li Lingrong, and he, in surprised, yelled out, \\"She is the one!\\" Sima Yu therefore took her as a concubine, and she bore him two sons -- Sima Yao in 352 and Sima Daozi in 353. Sima Yao was subsequently named heir apparent. Around the new year 352, Huan, impatient after his requests to advance north in light of Later Zhao's collapse were being rebuffed by Sima Yu and Yin, who were concerned about his expanding power, and mobilized his troops and gestured as if he were about to attack the capital. Yin was shocked, and initially considered either resigning or send the imperial banner of peace (Zouyu Fan, È®∂ËôûÂπ°) to order Huan to stop. After advice from Wang Biaozhi (), however, he instead asked Sima Yu to write a carefully worded letter to Huan, persuading Huan to stop. After Yin himself launched unsuccessful northern campaigns in 352 and 353‚Äîthe latter at great loss of life and property‚ÄîHuan submitted a petition accusing Yin of crimes. The imperial government, led by Sima Yu, felt compelled to depose Yin in 354. From that point on, Sima Yu became the sole prime minister, although he was often forced to submit to Huan's wishes on important matters. Later in 354, Huan himself launched a campaign north against Former Qin, one of the successor states to Later Zhao, but after initial successes, he was forced to withdraw as he hesitated at attacking Former Qin's capital Chang'an and ran out of food supplies. In 358, Sima Yu offered to resign and return all authority to Emperor Mu. Emperor Mu declined. In 361, Emperor Mu died without a son, and by order of Empress Dowager Chu, his cousin Sima Pi the Prince of Langya ascended the throne as Emperor Ai. Sima Yu continued in his post as prime minister. During Emperor Ai's reign In 363, when Emperor Ai's mother Princess Dowager Zhou died, Sima Yu served as regent for the three-month mourning period. In 364, Emperor Ai, who was obsessed with immortality, was poisoned by pills given him by magicians, and he could not handle important affairs of state. Empress Dowager Chu again served as regent, but important decisions were made by Sima Yu and Huan Wen. In 365, with the Former Yan regent Murong Ke besieging the important city Luoyang, Sima Yu and Huan discussed launching a counterattack to relieve Luoyang, but when Emperor Ai died in spring 365, the plans were cancelled. Emperor Ai was succeeded by his brother Sima Yi the Prince of Langya, who took the throne as Emperor Fei. Sima Yu continued in his role as prime minister. During Emperor Fei's reign In late 365, Emperor Fei offered the title Prince of Langya to Sima Yu and further created his heir apparent Sima Yao the Prince of Kuaiji. Sima Yu declined on his son's behalf and further himself declined the title of Prince of Langya, continuing to refer to himself as the Prince of Kuaiji, and Emperor Fei did not insist on his taking the greater title. In 369, after Huan Wen launched a major attack against Former Yan but suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of Murong Chui, he considered another way to showcase his power. He decided to depose Emperor Fei, and he spread false rumors that Emperor Fei was impotent and that his sons were actually sons of men that he favored (implying a homosexual relationship between him and those men). In winter 371, Huan forced Empress Dowager Chu to issue an edict deposing Emperor Fei and replacing him with Sima Yu, who took the throne with trepidation but felt he had no choice. Reign An immediate issue that Emperor Jianwen had to deal with upon taking the throne was Huan's suspicions toward his older brother Sima Xi () the Prince of Wuling, whose interest in military matters made Huan concerned that he would oppose Huan. Huan therefore falsely accused him of plotting treason, and Emperor Jianwen agreed to remove Sima Xi from his posts. Subsequently, however, Huan manufactured evidence against Sima Xi and petitioned that he be put to death. Emperor Jianwen wrote to Huan, stating that he did not want to kill his brother‚Äîand that if he was forced to, he would instead yield the throne. Huan, not willing to risk a confrontation, settled for having Sima Xi and his sons demoted to commoner status and exiled. In summer 372, Emperor Jianwen grew ill, and repeatedly tried to summon Huan to the capital‚Äîperhaps to offer him the throne‚Äîbut Huan, concerned that it was a trap, continuously declined. Emperor Jianwen soon died, and was succeeded by his 10-year-old son Sima Yao, whom he created crown prince right before his death.

The players take the roles of these beings as they adapt to their newly symbiotic existence and learn the secrets hidden behind veils of obscurity and mysticism, seeking the path toward enlightenment, Agartha. The game contains much symbolism, primarily related to the Hermetic tradition. History The game was originally published in 1992 by the French company Multisim. The first edition used the Chaosium \\"Basic Role Playing\\" principles, and in 1994 was translated into English by Chaosium as well, with some additional research and writings by Kenneth Hite. Since then, Nephilim had three other editions (all three in French, from Multisim/Mn√©mos) - the second edition was still akin to the BRP system while the third edition, Nephilim : La R√©v√©lation (The Revelation) uses a radically different, descriptor-based, system. It also introduces Ar-Ka√Øm and intuitive magic in the style of Mage: The Ascension (although based on elements and words instead of spheres). The fourth edition has its own unique system as well, using a scale ranging from 1 to 25 and difficulty multipliers to obtain percentages. Its core book as for the first two editions is centered on Nephilim. The fifth edition, called Nephilim L√©gende (Nephilim Legend)https://www.mnemos.com/collections/nephlim-legende/ was release in 2019 by Mn√©mos following a crowdfunding campaign on the Ulule platform. It brings a new system, based on a scale from 1 to 10, that is then multiplied by 10 to obtain a percentage. This new edition update the settings to the context of the late 2010s, re-published after update some older and unavailable sourcebooks as well as adding some new materials, like the Golden fleece campaign. Setting Nephilim is a game based on the idea that since ancient times there have been spirits without bodies who, given the right circumstances, can take over the body of a human and use it until it dies, then try to find another body. These spirits are the Nephilim. Players get to choose one of five types of Nephilim. Within each of these types are different species of Nephilim. Each type of element or \\"Ka\\" has different strong points. Fire Nephilim (Pyrim) tend to be aggressive, Earth Nephilim (Fa√´rim) are caretakers and healers, Air Nephilim (√âolim) are intellectuals, Water Nephilim (Hydrim) relate to change and movement and Moon Nephilim (Onirim) are secretive and manipulative. They are also defined by the major Arcana they choose to follow. The spirit of the Nephilim takes over the body of a human and tries to gain the skills and knowledge the human has, while avoiding the Immortals' enemies. The Nephilim's ultimate goal is to attain Agartha, a form of spiritual illumination. Other races have a similar goal. Nephilim can be set in any times from ancient Egypt to present day or the future. Besides the Nephilim, the players can play Selenim (\\"Vampires\\" of the Dark Moon, an element created by an ancient race that is unstable and corrupts Nephilim) or Ar-Ka√Øm (Astrological unstable mutants, introduced in the Third Edition). Several human secret organizations know of the existence of the Nephilim. Most of these organizations oppose or hunt the Nephilim, but some are sympathetic to their cause. The Knights Templar is one of the primary sources of antagonists for Nephilim, who along with the Rosicrucians supply the most organized opposition. The Order of the Black Star possess many magical secrets, but are fewer in numbers and less likely to team up against Nephilim. Game mechanics Nephilim uses the Basic Role-Playing system used in many other Chaosium products, such as Call of Cthulhu, Pendragon and RuneQuest. It is expanded to suit the setting, amongst other things each nephilim has a set of elemental attributes influencing the body in which it resides. Published books Chaosium published the following books in its version of Nephilim RPG, until its discontinuation: * Nephilim : Occult Roleplaying : Core Rule Book; * Chronicle of the Awakenings : contains more Incarnation Eras and Gamemaster resources; * Secret Societies : has information on human occult organizations and how they interact with Nephilim; * Major Arcana : very detailed information about the Arcana, the Nephilim Organizations and many campaign ideas. * Gamemaster's Companion : optional rules and resources; * Serpent Moon : a series of four adventures that can be made into a campaign; * Liber Ka : alternative rules for magic, of the western ceremonial type (subtler effects, no Hollywood flash-bang magic). In addition, Chaosium published a Gamemaster's Veil and Character Dossiers.

It is similar to Make, but is implemented using the Java language and requires the Java platform. Unlike Make, which uses the Makefile format, Ant uses XML to describe the code build process and its dependencies. Released under an Apache License by the Apache Software Foundation, Ant is an open-source project. History Ant (\\"Another Neat Tool\\") was conceived by James Duncan Davidson while preparing Sun Microsystems's reference JSP and Servlet engine, later Apache Tomcat, for release as open-source. A proprietary version of Make was used to build it on the Solaris platform, but in the open-source world, there was no way of controlling which platform was used to build Tomcat; so Ant was created as a simple platform-independent tool to build Tomcat from directives in an XML \\"build file\\". Ant (version 1.1) was officially released as a stand-alone product on July 19, 2000. Several proposals for an Ant version 2 have been made, such as AntEater by James Duncan Davidson, Myrmidon by Peter Donald and Mutant by Conor MacNeill, none of which were able to find large acceptance with the developer community. At one time (2002), Ant was the build tool used by most Java development projects. For example, most open source Java developers included \`build.xml\` files with their distribution. Because Ant made it trivial to integrate JUnit tests with the build process, Ant made it easy for willing developers to adopt test-driven development, and even extreme programming. Extensions WOProject-Ant is just one of many examples of a task extension written for Ant. These extensions are installed by copying their \`.jar\` files into ant's \`lib\` directory. Once this is done, these task extensions can be invoked directly in the typical \`build.xml\` file. The WOProject extensions allow WebObjects developers to use ant in building their frameworks and apps, instead of using Apple's Xcode suite. \`Antcontrib\` provides a collection of tasks such as conditional statements and operations on properties as well as other useful tasks. \`Ant-contrib.unkrig.de\` implements tasks and types for networking, Swing user interfaces, JSON processing and other. Other task extensions exist for Perforce, .NET Framework, EJB, and filesystem manipulations. Example Below is listed a sample \`build.xml\` file for a simple Java \\"Hello, world\\" application. It defines four targets - \`clean\`, \`clobber\`, \`compile\` and \`jar\` , each of which has an associated description. The \`jar\` target lists the \`compile\` target as a dependency. This tells Ant that before it can start the \`jar\` target it must first complete the \`compile\` target. Within each target are the actions that Ant must take to build that target; these are performed using built-in tasks. For example, to build the \` compile \` target Ant must first create a directory called \`classes\` (which Ant will do only if it does not already exist) and then invoke the Java compiler. Therefore, the tasks used are \`mkdir\` and \`javac\`. These perform a similar task to the command-line utilities of the same name. Another task used in this example is named \`jar\`: This Ant task has the same name as the common Java command-line utility, JAR, but is really a call to the Ant program's built-in JAR/ZIP file support. This detail is not relevant to most end users, who just get the JAR they wanted, with the files they asked for. Many Ant tasks delegate their work to external programs, either native or Java. They use Ant's own and tasks to set up the command lines, and handle all the details of mapping from information in the build file to the program's arguments and interpreting the return value. Users can see which tasks do this (e.g. , , , ), by trying to execute the task on a system without the underlying program on the path, or without a full Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Portability One of the primary aims of Ant was to be more portable than Make. In Make, the actions required to create a target are specified as platform-specific shell commands, whereas Ant provides a large amount of built-in functionality that is designed to behave the same on all platforms. For example, in the sample \`build.xml\` file above, the clean target deletes the \`classes\` directory and everything in it. In a Makefile this would typically be done with the command: rm -rf classes/ \`rm\` is a Unix-specific command unavailable in some other environments. Microsoft Windows, for example, would use: rmdir /S /Q classes In an Ant build file the same goal would be accomplished using a built-in command: Additionally, Ant does not differentiate between forward slash or backslash for directories and semicolon or colon for path separators. It converts each to the symbol appropriate to the platform on which it executes. Limitations *Ant build files, which are written in XML, can be complex and verbose, as they are hierarchical, partly ordered, and pervasively cross-linked. This complexity can be a barrier to learning. The build files of large or complex projects can become unmanageably large. Good design and modularization of build files can improve readability but not necessarily reduce size. Other build tools, such as Gradle or Maven, use more concise scripts at the expense of generality and flexibility. *Many of the older tasks‚Äîthe core ones that are used every day, such as , and ‚Äîuse default values for options that are not consistent with more recent versions of the tasks. Changing those defaults would break existing Ant scripts. *When expanding properties in a string or text element, undefined properties are not raised as an error, but left as an unexpanded reference (e.g. \`\${unassigned.property}\`). *Ant has limited fault handling rules. *Lazy property evaluation is not supported. For instance, when working within an Antcontrib loop, a property cannot be re-evaluated for a sub-value which may be part of the iteration. (Some third-party extensions facilitate a workaround; AntXtras flow-control tasksets do provide for cursor redefinition for loops.) *In makefiles, any rule to create one file type from another can be written inline within the makefile. For example, one may transform a document into some other format by using rules to execute another tool. Creating a similar task in Ant is more complex: a separate task must be written in Java and included with the Ant build file in order to handle the same type of functionality. However, this separation can enhance the readability of the Ant script by hiding some of the details of how a task is executed on different platforms. There exist third-party Ant extensions (called antlibs) that provide much of the missing functionality. Also, the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) can build and execute Ant scripts, while the NetBeans IDE uses Ant for its internal build system. As both these IDEs are very popular development platforms, they can simplify Ant use significantly. (As a bonus, Ant scripts generated by NetBeans can be used outside that IDE as standalone scripts.)

It is located in the middle of the Hadhramaut Valley, about from Mukalla, the capital of Mukalla District and the largest city in the area, via western route. It is also away from Shibam and away from Tarim, other large cities in the valley. It is said that the origin of the city was a resting point for travellers. There was a cafe with a woman named Seiyun there, and the area was named after her in her honor. Since then, the city has become the largest area of Hadhramaut valley. The most prominent villages surrounding the city including Madurah, M√©rida, Burr, Hazkir, and Houta Sultana. It is served by Seiyun Airport. It is also well known for the Seiyun Palace of the Sultan of Kathiri built in 1920s by mud and stones. It oversees the market place for merchants coming from outside. History Seiyun is first mentioned in the beginning of the 4th- century, which dates back to the reign of King Dhamar who ruled at the beginning of the 4th-century the area around Hadhramaut Valley and known for destroying sixty thousand columns in the area. Destruction of the columns confirms that the Hadhramaut region was undergoing an economic prosperity owing from spread of grape cultivation in large areas under the climatic conditions different from the current circumstances. Seiyun during the Islamic period emerged as a village in the era of the Rashidun Caliphate. It was administratively followed by the city of Tarim. This was the case during the Umayyad period as well. In 708, it became administratively affiliated with the city of Shibam, however the son of Haritha had led the revolution in 1179. But it gained its autonomy only in the year 1501 when it became the capital of the valley in the era of Badr Abu Tuwairq (1501-1556), where an administrative unit consisted of a sultanate that extended from Ain Ba to the west of the city of Dhofar was founded. In the 18th-century, Yafa conquered the cities of Hadhramaut and took over many parts of Seiyun, where the state was established. In 1852, it became the capital of the State of Kathiri (Aden- Kathiri) which was within the British Aden Protectorate (1869 - 1963). Its fortified fortress, the Sultan's Palace, was the seat of Sultan al-Kathiri. Postage stamps from the Sultanate were sometimes inscribed \\"Kathiri State of Seiyun.\\" After the independence from British colonialism, Seiyun became the capital of the Southern district in the fifth province of Hadhramaut. Geography Sayun District, in which Seiyun is serving as its capital, is about 804 square kilometers wide. The district is located in the central part of Hadhramaut and Wadi Hadhramaut. It is bordered to the south by Tarim and Sah Districts, and to the west by Shibam District. Siyoun District is about 320 kilometers from the provincial capital Mukalla. As for the terrain, the district consists of a relatively flat surface that forms a part of Wadi Hadhramaut surrounded by mountain ranges from the northern and southern sides leading to the northern and southern plateaus. These mountain ranges also penetrate several sub-valleys of Hadhramaut Valley, Wadi Bin Salman in Batarab and the northern part of Wadi Madr Bbour. Climate The climate is tropical with a high temperature in the summer (26 - 42 ¬∞C) and a mild temperature in the winter (6 - 28 ¬∞C). Rain is rare and usually falls from mid-spring until autumn.

Its economy is linked to Port of London industries, its own offices, retail and the Lakeside Shopping Centre at West Thurrock. History Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary that he visited Grays on 24 September 1665 and apparently bought fish from the local fishermen. Parts of Grays and Chafford Hundred are set within three Victorian chalk pits; the largest two being the Lion Gorge, and the Warren Gorge. Another area of the Chafford Hundred residential development is built on a Victorian landfill site. On 23 October 2019, the bodies of 39 people were found in the back of a lorry at Waterglade Industrial Park in Eastern Avenue. They are believed to have been victims of human trafficking, or migrants being smuggled into Britain. The vehicle, registered in Bulgaria, was thought to have travelled to the UK through Purfleet from Zeebrugge. A 25-year-old lorry driver from Northern Ireland was arrested by Essex Police on suspicion of murder and pleaded guilty to manslaughter in April 2020. Essex Police launched an investigation afterwards and the lorry was moved to the nearby Port of Tilbury. It is the biggest murder investigation in the history of Essex police. On 26 May 2020, a total of 26 further suspects, most of whom Vietnamese nationals, were arrested in Belgium and France. Origin of the name The origin of the name \\"Grays Thurrock\\" comes in two parts. Thurrock is a Saxon name meaning \\"the bottom of a ship\\".PH Reaney, The Place-Names of Essex, (CUP, 1969) The element \\"Grays\\" comes from Henry de Grai, a descendant of the Norman knight Anchetil de Greye, who was granted the manor of Grays Thurrock in 1195 by Richard I.

From the top of the Derby Road Bridge in Grays one can look down to Thurrock Yacht Club, Grays Beach children's playground and the River Thames. As well as Thurrock Yacht Club, Grays Beach is the site of the local landmark The Gull, a lightship built in 1860, which has lain on the foreshore for decades and is now in a serious state of dilapidation. The light from The Gull has now been removed, restored and installed on the foreshore of the yacht club. The Thurrock Campus of South Essex College relocated to a new complex in the town centre in September 2014.

Dionysus Lardner archive with marriage certificate of Susan Lardner and Baron von Ziegesar Gardiner was born in Chelsea, LondonBirths England and Wales 1837‚Äì1915 and attended Harrow School. When his father visited him at Harrow he noticed a copy of the Nation, later incorporated into the New Statesman, lying around and yelled that no other son of his would attend a school where such publications were openly displayed. He was as good as his word, and Gerald's two brothers were sent to Eton. When Gardiner was at Magdalen College, Oxford in the 1920s, he published a pamphlet on pink paper which resulted in his being sent down. A woman undergraduate had suffered the same fate a few days previously for climbing into a men's college after a dance. Gardiner, characteristically, rushed to her defence and the Vice-Chancellor, Lewis Richard Farnell, notoriously out of touch with the post-war generation, asked Gardiner to leave at 06:00; any later, Farnell knew, would have meant a sympathetic funeral procession several hundred strong. The girl to whose defence Gardiner had come was Dilys Powell, who later became a film critic. Gardiner graduated with a fourth-class degree in jurisprudence in 1923. While occupying the position of Chancellor of the Open University, he took a degree in the Social Sciences, at the age of 76. Pacifism Gerald Gardiner served in the Coldstream Guards in 1918, but in the 1930s he joined the Peace Pledge Union. During World War II Gardiner volunteered to join the Friends' Ambulance Unit, as an alternative to military service, although he was actually just over conscription age, and served 1943 to 1945; as someone relatively mature, he was usefully able to lead a 55-strong team assisting refugees in the turmoil of north-west Europe in the last year of the war. Legal career Gardiner was called to the Bar in 1925 and was made King's Counsel in 1948. As a lawyer, he fought for the abolition of capital punishment. He represented the Daily Mirror and its columnist Cassandra (William Neil Connor) in a notable libel trial in 1959 when the pianist Liberace claimed that a newspaper article imputed that he was homosexual.Crying All The Way to the Bank ‚Äì Liberace v. The Daily Mirror and Cassandra, by Revel Barker, 2009 More successfully, he was the Counsel for the Defence in the trial for obscenity of the publishers of Lady Chatterley's Lover in 1960. He played an active role in various reform movements and held numerous professional positions. He was a member of the Committee on Supreme Court Practice and Procedure, 1947‚Äì53 chaired by Raymond Evershed, 1st Baron Evershed.Lord Evershed's ODNB biography says: \\"The committee spent six years examining the rules which had mainly been introduced in 1875 to govern the newly created, single Supreme Court. By the middle of the twentieth century this code had distinctly aged and become an ill-assorted patchwork. Following three interim reports the committee reported finally in 1953 with more than 200 recommendations. \\" -ODNB article by Nicholls of Birkenhead, 'Evershed, (Francis) Raymond, Baron Evershed (1899‚Äì1966)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 27 March 2008. He was a member of the Lord Chancellor's Law Reform Committee, 1952‚Äì63. He was a Master of the Bench of the Inner Temple in 1955, Chairman of the General Council of the Bar in 1958 and 1959.Bar Council website (Accessed 27 March 2008). He was a member of the International Commission of Jurists in 1971. He was Joint Chairman of the National Campaign for Abolition of Capital Punishment. Lord Chancellorship Gardiner stood for election as the Labour Party's candidate in the 1951 General Election in Croydon West. He lost to the Conservative, Richard Thompson. In the 1964 New Year Honours he was made a life peer as Baron Gardiner, of Kittisford in the County of Somerset. On the Labour Party's General Election victory in 1964, he was appointed Lord Chancellor and to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1964 by Harold Wilson. In 1970, the Labour Party was defeated in the General Election and Lord Gardiner resigned as Lord Chancellor. In that role, he was responsible for the creation of the Ombudsman. He also did much to advance women's rights. Security surveillance During debates on the British Telecommunications BillEnacted as the British Telecommunications Act 1981 c. 38 in the House of Lords in 1981, various members raised concerns about telephone tapping, a matter of disquiet in the community and amongst these members. In his contribution, Lord Gardiner told of the difficulties he experienced as Lord Chancellor (1964‚Äì1970) in being able to conduct strictly private discussions with the then Attorney-General. Lord Gardiner said he believed his telephone calls were intercepted by a British intelligence organisation. He also alluded to a need to take a ride around the park in his chauffeur-driven car with the Attorney-General to ensure security of their conversations ‚Äì rather than having 'security' listen inThe Times, Wednesday, 20 May 1981; pg. 5; Issue 60932; col G \\"House of Lords Lord Gardiner thought his phone was bugged.\\" Post-Lord Chancellorship=Northern Ireland Interrogation methods Minority Report Lord Gardiner published the Minority Report in March 1972 as part of the Parker Report (Report of the Committee of Privy Counsellors appointed to consider authorised procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of terrorism),Parker Report online source. which considered the interrogation procedures used against suspects of terrorism in Northern Ireland, with particular reference to allegations of torture during internment in 1971 (See Sensory deprivation, Use of torture since 1948#United Kingdom, Five techniques). Lord Gardiner was appointed a Companion of Honour in the 1975 New Year's Honours. Assassination attempt In June 1981 Gardiner survived a failed assassination attempt when a bomb containing 3 pounds of explosive was attached to his car by the IRA during a visit to Belfast. The device was later found near the junction of University Road and Elmwood Avenue, Belfast, and defused by the British Army. The IRA released a statement saying: \\"We meant to kill Gardiner, the political architect of the criminalization policy and the H-blocks. The device fell off the car and failed to explode.\\" Open University He was Chancellor of the Open University from 1973 to 1978. Personal life In 1925 he married Lesly Trounson (died 1966). They had one daughter. In 1970, Gardiner married Muriel Box, writer, producer and director who had won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for The Seventh Veil.

He also competed under the ring names Scott Taylor (1991‚Äì1999) and Scotty 2 Hotty (1999‚Äì2007) for WWE. During his WWF/WWE career, Garland held the WWF World Tag Team Championship, WWE Tag Team Championship and WWF Light Heavyweight Championship. Professional wrestling career=Early career (1989‚Äì1997) When approximately 14 or 15 years old, Garland wrote to Sue Aitchison, the Community Relations Specialist of the World Wrestling Federation, inquiring from which professional wrestling school the company recruited the majority of their employees. Aitchison responded by telling him that they did not recruit from any particular school and wished him luck. Garland then attempted to call Vince McMahon, but was unable to speak to McMahon directly. Garland began attending shows at the Cumberland County Civic Center in Portland, Maine, helping the ring crew to construct the wrestling ring. After an independent promoter saw Garland wrestling with his friends, he offered Garland a job. In his first match, Garland wrestled Steve Ramsey in a Portland armory on November 23, 1989, the same night the Survivor Series was taking place. In the same year, Garland began wrestling for the Massachusetts-based New England Wrestling. In August 1991, Garland was introduced to the WWF by fellow NEW wrestler Phil Apollo. Garland made his first appearance with the World Wrestling Federation in October 1991 while still a junior in high school, teaming with Sonny Blaze and using the ring name \\"Scott Taylor\\". Garland appeared sporadically with the WWF as an enhancement talent over the next six years, losing to wrestlers such as The Berzerker, Yokozuna and The Ringmaster. Garland continued to attend college throughout his early tenure, and in 1994, he supplemented his income by working as a Fleet Bank bank teller and as the assistant manager of a Spencer's Gifts outlet. World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (1987 - 1997)Light heavyweight division (1997‚Äì1998)= In 1997, Garland, now working for an insurance company, planned to wrestle tryout matches for Extreme Championship Wrestling. Upon hearing of his plans, President of the WWF Talent Relations, Bruce Prichard, signed him to a contract. Garland began wrestling in the Light Heavyweight division as Scott Taylor. In late 1997, he took part in an eight-man tournament for the vacant WWF Light Heavyweight Championship, but was eliminated in the second round after being chokeslammed by Kane. =Too Much/Too Cool (1998‚Äì2001)= Garland, as Scotty 2 Hotty during his time in Too Cool. On March 29, 1998 at WrestleMania XIV, Taylor and \\"Too Sexy\\" Brian Christopher teamed together for the first time, taking part in a tag team battle royal. Following WrestleMania XIV, Taylor and Christopher continued to team together on the WWF's syndicated Saturday wrestling shows, with Taylor playing the straight man to Christopher's over-the-top, egotistical antics. Soon, Taylor adopted Christopher's flamboyant actions and in-ring mannerisms and became known as Scott \\"Too Hot\\" Taylor, with the duo dubbed \\"Too Much\\". In June 1999, they were renamed \\"Too Cool\\" and given the characteristics of hip hop aficionados, delivering raps aimed at their opponents and parodying aspects of the hip hop culture. Shortly after debuting their new gimmicks, the team was temporarily separated after Christopher tore his anterior cruciate ligament and was sidelined for five months. During this time, Taylor began incorporating breakdancing moves into his matches. In late 1999, Taylor was renamed Scotty 2 Hotty and Christopher was renamed Grandmaster Sexay. They aligned themselves with Rikishi Fatu (whom they quickly renamed Rikishi), forming a faction. Following their matches, they would dance in the center of the ring. In early 2000, the group began feuding with The Radicalz, culminating with Too Cool teaming with Chyna to defeat Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn and Dean Malenko at WrestleMania 2000. After Grandmaster re-injured his leg, Scotty briefly returned to the Light Heavyweight division, and on April 17, 2000, he defeated Radicalz member Dean Malenko to win the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship. He held the title for only 10 days before dropping it back to Malenko on April 27, 2000. Scotty challenged Malenko for the title once more at Backlash, but was defeated. Grandmaster returned in mid-2000, and on May 29, Too Cool defeated Edge and Christian for the WWF World Tag Team Championship with the assistance of rapper Joe C. They held the title until King of the Ring, when Edge and Christian regained the title. Too Cool and Rikishi separated in late 2000 after Rikishi was revealed to have run over Stone Cold Steve Austin. Rikishi subsequently easily defeated his former allies in a handicap match. In February 2001, the intervertebral disc between Scotty's C5, C6 and C6, C7 vertebrae bulged, and he was forced to take time off and do physical therapy 5 days a week. His absence was explained that he suffered a (kayfabe) broken ankle at the hands of Kurt Angle. While Scotty was recuperating, Grandmaster was released from the company for illegally conveying drugs across the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. =Various tag teams and departure (2001‚Äì2007)= Scotty returned to the ring in June 2001, taking part in the rivalry between Team WWF and The Alliance. During this time, he formed a tag team with Albert, who subsequently adopted the nickname \\"The Hip Hop Hippo\\", and they collectively became known as the \\"Zoo Crew\\". The team competed in the tag team division until April 2002, when Albert betrayed Scotty by attacking him. Soon thereafter, Scotty began experiencing pains in his previously injured neck, and on May 7, 2002, Dr. Lloyd Youngblood performed neck surgery (cervical fusion) on him. Scotty spent 17 months recuperating, returning to the ring on television in October 2003. Wrestling on the SmackDown! brand, Scotty formed a tag team with his former ally Rikishi. Together, they competed in the tag team division and ultimately defeated the Basham Brothers to win the WWE Tag Team Championship on February 5, 2004. Scotty and Rikishi successfully defended their titles in a four-way tag team match at WrestleMania XX. Their reign ended on April 22, 2004 when they were defeated by Charlie Haas and Rico. On July 16, 2004, WWE released Rikishi, leaving Scotty on his own. After Rikishi's release, Scotty wrestled mainly on Velocity and in dark matches until early 2007. In April 2007 he returned briefly to the Raw roster, competing in a handful of matches on WWE Heat. He was released from the company on May 18, 2007. =Sporadic appearances (2007‚Äì2014)= On the December 10, 2007 15-Year Anniversary special episode of Raw, Scotty would take part in a \\"15-Year Flashback Battle Royal\\", lasting to the final four before being eliminated by Skinner. On the August 16, 2012 episode of NXT, Scotty would make a surprise appearance, defeating Heath Slater. On the January 6, 2014 episode of Raw, Scotty would reunite with Grand Master Sexay and Rikishi, defeating 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre and Jinder Mahal) in a six-man tag team match. On February 24, at NXT Arrival, Scotty would team with Sexay, challenging The Ascension for the NXT Tag Team Championship in a losing effort. Independent circuit (2007‚Äì2016) thumb After leaving WWE, Garland worked two shows for Puerto Rico's International Wrestling Association (IWA) in mid-June 2007. He then wrestled on the independent circuit, working for at least 31 promotions in 11 countries as Scotty 2 Hotty and Scotty the Hotty. On December 6, 2014, Garland, as Scotty 2 Hotty, made his debut for the Japanese Pro Wrestling Noah promotion, teaming with Funaki and Super Crazy in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated Pesadilla, Yoshinari Ogawa and Zack Sabre, Jr., with Scotty pinning Pesadilla for the win. Second return to WWE (2016‚Äìpresent) On September 7, 2016, Garland returned to WWE as a trainer at the WWE Performance Center. According to Pro Wrestling Torch in 2017, Garland teaches the middle class at the WWE Performance Center, the second of four levels of classes. Firefighting career In February 2013, Garland began training as a firefighter. In June 2013, he graduated from the Lake Tech Fire Academy in Florida. He subsequently began training as an emergency medical technician. Personal life Garland lives in the Orlando, Florida area with his two children. Garland is a fan of Disney (Mick Foley has called him a \\"Disney psychotic\\"), and has been to Disneyland and Walt Disney World many times. He bought a Dumbo Halloween costume, among much other merchandise, for his daughter before she was even born. Other media Garland appeared in-character, alongside Kid Kash in the December 2009 video for the Irish band, Fight Like Apes' single \\"Do You Karate\\". In 2010, he completed filming a movie called Ultimate Death Match 3, which also featured other wrestlers. In 2017, the American music group, Migos, paid homage to Garland's WWE character with their song titled \\"Too Hotty\\".

A later route went to Clinton, Iowa. Incorporated in 1836, the G&CU; became the first railroad built out from Chicago. History The first railroad constructed out of Chicago, the Galena and Chicago Union, was chartered January 16, 1836, to connect Chicago with the lead mines at Galena. \\"The Pioneer,\\" the first locomotive on the road, arrived at Chicago on October 10, 1848, nearly thirteen years after the charter was granted. In 1850, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad was completed as far as Elgin. The railroad and the Illinois and Michigan Canal were vital in the development of Chicago, and the population of the city tripled in the six years after the opening of the canal. Eventually other railroads were built and Chicago became the largest railroad center in the world. In 1862 the G&CU; leased in perpetuity the Cedar Rapids and Missouri Railroad which was to be the first railroad to reach Council Bluffs, Iowa and the First Transcontinental Railroad. The 1862 map by G. Woolworth Colton shown here lays out the various lines in operation at that time.\\"Map Showing the Location of the Galena & Chicago Union Railroad with its Branches & Connections in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota.

The G&CU; consolidated with the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1864, which merged with the Union Pacific Railroad over a century later in 1996. Today, the G&CU;'s main line between Chicago and West Chicago is a busy commuter service, jointly operated by Union Pacific and Metra as the Union Pacific / West Line. Construction The railroad was constructed starting in March 1848, and was completed to Freeport in 1853. The first westbound train out of Chicago departed on October 25, 1848, pulled by a used Baldwin-built locomotive named Pioneer.Rivanna Chapter, National Railway Historical Society (2005), This Month in Railroad History - October. Retrieved October 25, 2005.Chicago Historical Society, History Lab Collections - Riding the Rails . Retrieved October 25, 2005. When construction reached the Fox River at Elgin in 1850 passengers going farther west could transfer to the stagecoach lines. The railroad extended to Rockford by 1851 and ended construction at Freeport in 1853. The Illinois Central Railroad, using the G&CU; construction crew, completed the Freeport to Galena route in 1854 following the stage route already established by Frink, Walker and Company.

Quranic exegesis offers two different depictions of Iblis. One with Azazil beginning as a noble angel who later loses his position, while the other counts him as an ignoble jinn, who works his way up to heaven.Muhammad Mahmoud. ‚ÄúThe Creation Story in ‚ÄòS≈´rat Al-Baqara,\\" with Special Reference to Al-·π¨abarƒ´'s Material: An Analysis.‚Äù Journal of Arabic Literature, vol. 26, no. 1/2, 1995, pp. 201‚Äì214. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4183374. According to whose interpretations legitimated by the authority of Ibn Abbas, Azazil was the leader of angels and sent by God to terminate the jinn, who lived on earth before humanity.Scott B. Noegel, Brannon M. Wheeler The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism Scarecrow Press 2010 page 295 After his victory, he grew arrogant and declined God's command to prostrate himself before Adam. Arguing that he was superior to humans, God expelled him from heaven and he became an accursed shaitan (Shaitan Rajim). When the Quran refers to Iblis as one of the jinn, this tradition states it does not refer to Azazil being one of the jinn who lived on earth, but to a group of angels who were entrusted with the task to guard the entrance to Jannah.Patrick Hughes Dictionary of Islam Asian Educational Servicespage= 135 Therefore, it is their relation to Jannah the term refers to Satan as a jinn in Quran. Another tradition, by Ubay ibn Ka'b, who claimed to have found it in the Torah, states the jinn were angelic creatures, who descended to earth and became endowed with sexual desires. They stayed pious for a while, but started to murder, drink wine, and cause injustice on earth. Azazil parted from his community and committed his life to the worship of God in isolated places. Soon, Azazil was chosen to send messengers to the jinn community, but every time Azazil sent one, the jinn killed the messenger. When God sent down an army of angels under the command of Azazil to defeat their corrupted fellows.Joel L. Kraemer Israel Oriental Studies, Band 13 BRILL, 01.07.1993 p. 122 In yet another tradition, asserted by the Brethren of Purity,Amira El-Zein Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009 page 40N√ºnlist, Tobias (2015). D√§monenglaube im Islam (in German). Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter. p. 44 . Azazil used to be a jinni from earth, but was taken captive by the angels during war. Among the angels, Azazil impressed the angels by his piety and joined them in worship and service, but loses his angelic state after he disobeys God.  Sufism Al-Hallaj mentioned Azazil in his collection Tawasin. Here, Azazils disobedience to refuse God's command is a way to hallow His name. Chapter Six is dedicated to the self-defence of Azazil, and in one section Hallaj explains how each of the letters of Azazil's name relate to his personality. Unlike many other Sufi writers, Hallaj declined that Azazil will be restored to God's grace, thus after the Day of Judgment, he will still be damned.Reynold A. Nicholson Studies in Islamic Mysticism CUP Archive 1978 page 120-121 Since Azazil originated from fire, fire will be his final destiny. Azazil is also mentioned three times in Rumis Masnavi, emphasizing the importance of discipline and humility: > Through discipline and humility this heaven has been filled with light, and > through discipline the angel became immaculate and holy. By reason of > irreverence, the sun was eclipsed, and insolence caused Azazil to be turned > back from the door. When Azazil acted arrogantly, he was abandoned to hell in spite of his former high position.S. Robert Moradi (2010) Love, Pathos, and the Inner Healer: Examples from Analytical Work Using Mythology and Rumi's Poetry, Psychological Perspectives, 53:1, 5-20, DOI: 10.1080/00332920903543526 According to Al-Jili God created the sublime angels out of the light of Muhammad and Azazil and his followers of baser elements. Azazil was an angel of single-minded devotion. Failing to realize that bowing before Adam in accordance with God's command, is equal as bowing to God Himself, he refused to prostrate himself and received God's curse, becoming God's instrument of darkness and misleading.Reynold A. Nicholson Studies in Islamic Mysticism CUP Archive 1978 page 120-121Awn, Peter J. (1983). Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblƒ´s in Sufi Psychology. Leiden, Germany: Brill Publishers. p. 182 Heterogen Traditions In Umm al-Kitab, an 8th century Ismaili work, Azazil is the first creation of God, the High King. God gave him the power of creation, but Azazil boasted with his loaned power, claiming divinity for himself, describing himself as another God beside the High King. To proof that Azazil's creation only depends on the power of his own creator, God makes a new creation, opposed by Azazil. Every time, Azazil again claims to like God, he and his fellow angels lose colour, becoming darker and inferior, and are thrown into lower celestial spheres until they end up on earth, which is made out of the essence of Azazil's creations. As with the Gnostic Demiurge, Azazil traps the life-forces of the heavenly realm and captures them in the material realm.Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition Shambhala Publications 2009 page 707Christoph Auffarth, Loren T. Stuckenbruck The Fall of the Angels BRILL 2004 page 161 Azazil features as one of the first angels in an Alevi oral tradition, there he is informed by the archangel Cebrail (Gabriel), about their creator. Along with the other archangels, Cebrail leads Azazil to a lamp with seven doors. They shall serve here for 1001 days, so the door will open. After the archangels entered the lamp, they saw two lights forming one body. The archangels were commanded to prostrate before the light. All followed the order but Azazil, who refused to prostrate himself, since the light, as something that was created, could not be the creator, so he turned back to the door to stay in the former service of God. This narration explains that Azazil stood at God's service, but he despised that he saw when the door opened and decided to move into the Ego World, causing the later enmity between Satan and humanity.Handan Aks√ºnger Jenseits des Schweigegebots: Alevitische Migrantenselbstorganisationen und zivilgesellschaftliche Integration in Deutschland und den Niederlanden Waxmann Verlag 2013 page 83-84 (German) In Yazidism, Azazil appears as one of the archangels along with Jabra'il, Mika'il, Rafa'il (Israfil), Dadra'il, Azrael and Shamkil (Shemna'il). An eminent Yazidi legend tells about being Azazil, banished to hell. But he repented his sin, by crying until the fires of hell were extinguished. In the Black Book Azazil is erroneously identified with Melek Taus by Western translators, who confused Azrael (or Jabrail) with Azazil.Birg√ºl Acikyildiz The Yezidis: The History of a Community, Culture and Religion I.

He was the 65th man in history to reach sumo's highest rank of yokozuna, and he won 22 tournament championships between 1992 and 2001, the sixth highest total ever. The son of a popular ≈çzeki ranked wrestler from the 1970s, Takanohana's rise through the ranks alongside his elder brother Wakanohana and his rivalry with the foreign born yokozuna Akebono saw interest in sumo and attendance at tournaments soar during the early 1990s. Takanohana was the youngest ever to reach the top division at just 17, and he set a number of other age-related records. He had a solid but aggressive style, looking to get a right hand grip on his opponents' mawashi and move them quickly out of the ring. He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He became the head coach of Takanohana stable in 2004 and was on the board of directors of the Japan Sumo Association from 2010 until January 2018, when he was removed and demoted in the Sumo Association's hierarchy. He resigned from the Sumo Association in September 2018. Background Takanohana comes from a family with a great sumo history, sometimes called the \\"Hanada Dynasty.\\" His uncle Wakanohana Kanji I was a yokozuna from 1958 to 1962, and his father Takanohana Kenshi had held the second highest rank of ≈çzeki for a then record 50 tournaments from 1972 to 1981. Upon his retirement his father established the training stable (heya) Fujishima stable. The young K≈çji Hanada had been practising sumo since elementary school and won the equivalent of a yokozuna title at junior high school. Upon his graduation in 1988 he formally joined his father's stable. His elder brother Masaru had been planning to complete high school but dropped out so as not to lag behind his brother. Early career Tegata (hand print autograph) of Takanohana Ë≤¥‰πÉËä± ÂÖâÂè∏ Takanohana and his brother made their professional debuts together in March 1988, with future rival Akebono also beginning his career in the same month. The two brothers had to move from the family quarters in the stable and join the communal room with all the other new recruits. They were also instructed not to refer to their parents as \\"father\\" and \\"mother\\" any more but as \\"oyakata\\" and \\"okamisan\\" (coach and coach's wife). K≈çji initially wrestled under the name Takahanada, and it was understood that he would only be allowed to adopt his father's shikona of Takanohana (meaning noble flower) when he reached the champion ≈çzeki rank. Their early career attracted much publicity, with each divisional promotion regarded by the media as part of an inevitable rise to the top ranks. Takahanada's progress was rapid and he set numerous age-related records, including the youngest ever makushita division tournament champion (16 years 9 months), youngest ever promoted to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division (17 years 3 months), and the youngest ever promoted to the top makuuchi division (17 years 8 months). In March 1991, in his fourth top division tournament, Takahanada was runner-up with twelve wins, and became the youngest ever sansh≈ç or special prize winner, receiving awards for Fighting Spirit and Technique. In the following tournament in May 1991 he defeated veteran yokozuna Chiyonofuji in a match watched by 44 percent of the Japanese population on TV, and became the youngest ever to defeat a yokozuna. Chiyonofuji retired two days afterwards. In January 1992, he became the youngest ever top division tournament champion (19 years 5 months). He was too young to drink the celebratory sake at the after tournament party, and had to make do with oolong tea instead. After his second championship in September 1992, followed by two good scores of 10‚Äì5 and 11‚Äì4 in the next two tournaments, he was promoted to ≈çzeki in January 1993, the same tournament in which Akebono was elevated to yokozuna. During this period the two brothers created a so-called \\"Waka-Taka boom\\" and were credited with restoring sumo's popularity, particularly amongst younger audiences. Interest in sumo rose to its highest level since the era of Futabayama in the 1930s, with official tournaments (honbasho) selling out of tickets for every day. Both Takahanada and his brother became sex symbols. Promotion to yokozuna Now known as Takanohana, he was also the youngest ever to be promoted to ≈çzeki at 20 years 5 months. With the foreign born Akebono as sumo's only yokozuna, there was a great weight of expectation on Takanohana to make the next step up. However, his lack of consistency, and Akebono's dominance, delayed his promotion to yokozuna. He won his third championship in May 1993, but lost a playoff to Akebono in the following tournament in July, and even produced a make-koshi or losing score of 7‚Äì8 in November. In 1994, a year in which Akebono suffered several injury problems, Takanohana won the January and May tournaments, but was then outshone by Musashimaru, who won in July with a perfect 15‚Äì0 record. After taking the September 1994 championship, Takanohana now had six top division titles, but none had been won consecutively. No previous wrestler had ever accumulated so many titles before reaching sumo's highest rank. The Sumo Association nominated him for yokozuna after the September tournament, but the Yokozuna Deliberation Council failed to endorse it by the required two-thirds majority, the first time this had happened in twenty five years. They insisted that two consecutive championships were required, having demanded the same of Akebono before his promotion. In November 1994, Takanohana at last managed to win two consecutive tournaments, with his second consecutive unbeaten 15‚Äì0 score, and his promotion was confirmed. He had been at the ≈çzeki rank for 11 tournaments, or nearly two years. However, at 22 years and 3 months, he was still the third youngest yokozuna ever at the time. Yokozuna career=1995‚Äì1997 Takanohana's total of seven tournament championships by the start of 1995 was the same as the total won by Akebono, who had reached the yokozuna rank two years before him. However, Takanohana now pulled ahead of his rival. He was at his peak as a yokozuna between 1995 and 1997, during which time he won 11 of the 17 tournaments he entered, finishing runner-up in the other six. He produced two more perfect scores of 15‚Äì0, in September 1995 and September 1996. Overall he won 80 out of 90 bouts he fought in 1995, 70 out of 75 in 1996, and 78 out 90 in 1997, far ahead of any other wrestler. In three of the tournaments Takanohana did not win during this period, he was defeated by stablemates in playoffs: once to Wakanohana and twice to ≈çzeki Takanonami. Sumo rules prevent wrestlers from the same heya meeting in regular tournament bouts (playoffs excepted) which meant Takanohana avoided not only his brother and Takanonami but also sekiwake Akinoshima and Takat≈çriki. The merger of his father's Fujishima stable with his uncle's Futagoyama stable in 1993 had added even more top division wrestlers to this list, giving him an advantage over Akebono, who had to face them all. By September 1996 Takanohana had won 15 tournament championships, and was still only 24 years old. However, after sitting out the first tournament of his career in November 1996 due to a back injury suffered on a regional tour, he put on more weight and began to be more susceptible to injury and illness. 1998‚Äì2000 Takanohana was affected by a liver disorder in the first half of 1998, which caused him withdraw from the January 1998 tournament and miss the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Nagano (his place was taken by Akebono). He pulled out of the March 1998 tournament as well and was still below his best in May. Shunning the traditional treatment methods available from his stable, he turned instead to a physical therapist called Tashiro Tomita, who had a considerable influence over him. He became increasingly isolated from his father and brother, with his father claiming Takanohana had been \\"brainwashed\\" by Tomita. Despite his brother's promotion to yokozuna that year, creating the first ever sibling grand champions, the two were barely on speaking terms. Takanohana recovered to win the July and September 1998 tournaments, and was runner-up that November. In 1999, however, he was even more badly affected by injuries, including a dislocated shoulder, and managed only one score in double figures all year. After making peace with his family, Takanohana regained some of his consistency in 2000, although he was temporarily sidelined by an elbow injury suffered in the July tournament. His brother had retired in March, and several other members of his stable were now past their best. With Akebono dominant once more his best results that year were two runner-up performances. 2001‚Äì2003 Takanohana won his first tournament in over two years in January 2001, winning his first fourteen bouts and then defeating fellow yokozuna Musashimaru in a playoff on the final day. He won his final championship in May 2001, again in a playoff against Musashimaru, but it came at a great cost. He had suffered serious knee ligament damage in a loss to Mus≈çyama on the 14th day but he insisted on fighting on to the end of the tournament. As a result, he then missed an unprecedented seven consecutive tournaments, undergoing surgery in Paris in July 2001 and having a lengthy recuperation after that. Takanohana finally returned to the ring in September 2002, after the Sumo Association declared he must compete or retire. He finished behind Musashimaru on 12‚Äì3, the 16th time he had been a tournament runner-up. Considering how long he had been away, it was seen as an impressive comeback. However, he sat out the next tournament with a recurrence of the knee injury. He made another comeback in January 2003, making a late decision to compete. A shoulder injury caused him to miss two days, and after suffering successive losses to Dejima and Aminishiki he announced his retirement. He said he had no regrets and was thankful to have achieved so much in sumo. His father spoke of his relief at the decision, after seeing his son battle through so many injuries. Takanohana's record of 22 tournament championships was the fourth best in sumo history, behind only Taih≈ç, Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi at the time. Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister, was among those paying tribute. His retirement left no Japanese born wrestlers at the yokozuna rank and was widely regarded as being the end of an era. Takanohana's danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, was held at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on June 1, 2003. Unusually, Takanohana allowed only 50 guests on stage to take a snip of his hair, instead of the normal 300 to 400. The ceremony, and the party held afterwards at the Imperial Hotel, were both broadcast live on Fuji TV. Fighting style Takanohana was largely a yotsu- sumo wrestler, favouring techniques which involved grabbing his opponent's mawashi or belt. His preferred grip was migi-yotsu (right hand inside, left hand outside his opponent). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori- kiri, a simple force out, which accounted for 52 percent of his victories. He also regularly employed uwatenage, or overarm throw, and this was the technique he used to defeat Asash≈çry≈´ in the second of their two meetings, in September 2002. Retirement from sumo judge in March 2005 After his retirement he became an elder (or member) of the Japan Sumo Association. Because of his great achievements in sumo he was given a bonus of 130 million yen and was also made a \\"one generation\\" elder without having to purchase a share in the Association. This enabled him to keep his fighting name and he is now known as Takanohana Oyakata. With his father's health failing, he took over the operation of his training stable in January 2004, renaming it Takanohana stable. Its last sekitori, Takanonami retired shortly afterwards. During 2008, he added four new recruits to his stable, the first for several years, bringing the total number of wrestlers in his charge up to ten. These include his first foreign recruit, a Mongolian with amateur sumo experience named Takanoiwa, and two twins. In July 2012 Takanohana produced his first sekitori level wrestler when Takanoiwa was promoted to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division. He won the j≈´ry≈ç championship in January 2013 and a year later was promoted to the top makuuchi division. Takanohana also coached Takakeish≈ç, who reached the top division in January 2017. Takanohana became a judge of tournament bouts in February 2004, only a year after his retirement, a role for which elders normally have to wait at least four years. After the election of the Association's Board of Directors in February 2008, the Association appointed Takanohana as , replacing former yokozuna Chiyonofuji (Kokonoe- oyakata) who was elected to serve the Board as a director. For an organization that tends to follow seniority over achievement in its organization appointment, it was highly unusual for them to place a 35-year-old to such an influential position. However both former yokozuna, Kitanoumi and Chiyonofuji whom Takanohana is often compared to, served a stint as Associate Manager of Judging prior to their becoming the Board director. In February 2009 he was moved from the judging department to the jungy≈ç (regional tour) department, a less high-profile position. Takanohana mentioned in October 2009 that he was interested in running for a spot on the Board of Directors in the February 2010 elections, and confirmed in January that he would stand, despite the fact that this would mean opposing the two officially sanctioned candidates of the Nishonoseki ichimon or group of stables. As a result, Takanohana and six of his supporters, ≈åtake (the former Takat≈çriki), Futagoyama (the former Dairy≈´), Otowayama (the former Takanonami), Tokiwayama (the former Takamisugi), ≈ånomatsu (the former Masurao), and Magaki (the former Wakanohana II) left the Nishonoseki ichimon. Takanohana told a press conference, \\"I will leave the faction. I bid farewell to everyone in my greetings at the meeting. I have stepped into the race as a candidate.\\" The first contested elections since 2002, they took place by secret ballot on February 1, and Takanohana was elected to the board, replacing ≈åshima. Seen as a reformer, he favours revamping the current ticket sales system and improving support for ex- rikishi, as well as encouraging sumo in primary schools, raising the pay of gy≈çji, yobidashi and tokoyama, and making public the Sumo Association's accounts and assets. His victory was praised by the Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who said Takanohana had let in \\"a new wind of change.\\" In 2014, the JSA made the decision to recognize the Takanohana group formed from the stables ousted in 2010, as an official ichimon. In July 2010, in the wake of a scandal involving several wrestlers admitting to illegal gambling, he denied he had connections with members of the yakuza underworld after media reports that he was seen with a mobster during a visit to Ehime Prefecture to recruit new apprentices. Following the election of Hanaregoma as the new head of the Sumo Association in August 2010, Takanohana returned to the judging department as director of judging. At 38 he was the second youngest director of judging in the history of the Sumo Association. The following month he and his wife were awarded ¬•8.47 million in damages by the Tokyo High Court over 13 articles published by the Shukan Gendai and Gekkan Gendai in 2004 and 2005 concerning match-fixing allegations and the controversy over his father's inheritance. He left the judging department once again in 2012 and became the director of the Osaka tournament. Having reached a peak weight of as an active wrestler, he has lost a great deal of weight since his retirement (more than retired wrestlers typically do) and is now around . In 2009 he published a book detailing his weight loss methods. He ran for the chairmanship of the Sumo Association in 2016, but was defeated by Hakkaku Oyakata (ex-yokozuna Hokutoumi). Following this he was replaced as General Enterprises Director, seen as the third highest position in the Association's hierarchy, by Kagamiyama Oyakata, and became the jungyo (regional tour) director. Takanoiwa affair and resignation Takanohana was criticized for his delay in notifying the Sumo Association that Takanoiwa would miss the November 2017 tournament because of injuries allegedly sustained in an assault by the yokozuna Harumafuji at a restaurant in bar in Tottori Prefecture in late October. Takanohana reported the incident to the police but did not submit a medical certificate for his wrestler until near the start of the tournament. Takanohana refused to speak to the press about the incident or co-operate with the Sumo Association's investigation. An editorial in the Nikkei Asian Review compared his actions to \\"an executive withholding from top management information that could rock the company.\\" Veteran sumo commentator Chris Gould said Takanohana was under fire for breaking sumo's code of secrecy by going to the police, whereas \\"in most other sports he'd be lauded as a whistleblowing hero.\\" It was announced after a meeting of sumo elders on December 1, 2017 that Takanohana would only talk to the Sumo Association's crisis management team once the police investigation was concluded. On December 28 an emergency meeting of the board of directors recommended unanimously to dismiss Takanohana as a director for failing to promptly report Takanoiwa's injuries to the Sumo Association, and for failing to co-operate with the investigation. Their recommendation was certified by a meeting of Sumo Association councilors and external members on January 4, with Takanohana demoted two rungs in the hierarchy. It is the first time that a director has been dismissed before the end of his scheduled term. He failed to gain re-election to the board in the February 2018 elections, receiving only two votes in the ballot. The Takanohana group had selected ≈ånomatsu Oyakata (the former sekiwake Masurao), as their preferred candidate and he was duly elected, but Takanohana decided to run as well. In March 2018 Takanohana was demoted again, to the lowest rank of toshiyori, due mainly to the behaviour of his wrestler Takayoshitoshi, who was suspended for one tournament for punching his attendant in the dressing room after a match. He returned to the shimpan or judging committee. In September 2018 he announced his resignation from the Japan Sumo Association, after refusing to comply with Association's demand to accept the allegations in the letter of complaint that he filed with the Cabinet Office in March over the Association's handling of the Takanoiwa affair (later withdrawn due to Takayoshitoshi's misbehavior) were \\"totally false.\\" He also announced that Takanohana stable will be dissolved with its wrestlers transferring to Chiganoura stable. He called his decision \\"agonizing and gut-wrenching\\" but said he could not \\"bend the truth and say that what was in my complaint was untrue.\\" The JSA in response denied pressurizing Takanohana to do this, or to align his stable with an ichimon, and spokesman Shibatayama said they had not yet accepted his resignation as Takanohana had not used the correct documents. They accepted Takanohana's retirement, and the closure of Takanohana stable, on October 1, 2018. He received 10 million yen for retirement and bonuses, and has been allowed to use the name \\"Takanohana\\" outside of the sumo world. In a press conference on May 19, 2019 Takanohana announced he would be establishing the Takanohana Dojo organization to promote sumo worldwide. He also ruled out any suggestion that he would enter Japanese politics. Relationship with family The Hanada family had generally received very positive press coverage while Takanohana and Wakanohana were active wrestlers, with the press holding them up as the ideal Japanese family and tending to ignore any splits between them. Their different attitudes towards both sumo philosophy and the outside world had been noted, with Takanohana being regarded as somewhat aloof and reserved and Wakanahona having a warmer personality. However, upon their father's death from cancer in May 2005, a bitter rift between the brothers was widely reported in the Japanese media. Takanohana felt he should be the chief mourner at the funeral as he had remained in the Sumo Association whilst his brother had left to become a TV celebrity, but the role went to Wakanohana as the elder brother, as is traditional. However, with their father reported to have left no will, it was suggested that the feud revolved around control of his estate. Takanohana also condemned his mother for her extramarital affair, which led to her divorce from Futagoyama and exit from the stable in July 2001, and had only been rumoured up to that point. She has now reverted to her old name of Noriko Fujita and published a book and appeared on TV, revealing details of life as a stablemaster's wife that are seldom heard outside the sumo world. Takanohana has rarely spoken to her since. In June 2008 he spoke of his distress at the news that she had been named as a defence witness in a civil lawsuit brought by the Sumo Association against the tabloid magazine Sh≈´kan Gendai over allegations that his father benefited from a thrown match for the championship in 1975, saying, \\"she will essentially be fighting against me.\\" He said he would take responsibility by resigning from the Sumo Association if she took the stand. In a radio interview Fujita said she would not testify, saying, \\"I will not drag my child down\\". Marriage In late 1992 Takanohana announced his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa, news which sparked a similar amount of coverage to the royal wedding held that year. However the engagement was broken off the following year, reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana's parents and the Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife. The role of the wife of a head coach in looking after the stable's recruits and liaising with supporter's groups is regarded as a full-time job. In May 1995 Takanohana married television announcer Keiko Kono, eight years older than him. They have a son and two daughters. His son Yuuichi is a shoemaker and radio personality who is married to the daughter of former sumo wrestler Fujinoshin. It was reported in November 2018 that Takanohana and Kono had divorced.

It is found in essentially all eukaryotic cells, where it may be present at a concentration of over 100 ŒºM; its mass is roughly 42-kDa, with a diameter of 4 to 7 nm. An actin protein is the monomeric subunit of two types of filaments in cells: microfilaments, one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton, and thin filaments, part of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells. It can be present as either a free monomer called G-actin (globular) or as part of a linear polymer microfilament called F-actin (filamentous), both of which are essential for such important cellular functions as the mobility and contraction of cells during cell division. Actin participates in many important cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell motility, cell division and cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, cell signaling, and the establishment and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape. Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and intimate interactions of actin with cellular membranes. In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma have been identified. The alpha actins, found in muscle tissues, are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility. It is believed that the diverse range of structures formed by actin enabling it to fulfill such a large range of functions is regulated through the binding of tropomyosin along the filaments. A cell's ability to dynamically form microfilaments provides the scaffolding that allows it to rapidly remodel itself in response to its environment or to the organism's internal signals, for example, to increase cell membrane absorption or increase cell adhesion in order to form cell tissue. Other enzymes or organelles such as cilia can be anchored to this scaffolding in order to control the deformation of the external cell membrane, which allows endocytosis and cytokinesis. It can also produce movement either by itself or with the help of molecular motors. Actin therefore contributes to processes such as the intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles as well as muscular contraction and cellular migration. It therefore plays an important role in embryogenesis, the healing of wounds, and the invasivity of cancer cells. The evolutionary origin of actin can be traced to prokaryotic cells, which have equivalent proteins. Actin homologs from prokaryotes and archaea polymerize into different helical or linear filaments consisting of one or multiple strands. However the in-strand contacts and nucleotide binding sites are preserved in prokaryotes and in archaea. Lastly, actin plays an important role in the control of gene expression. A large number of illnesses and diseases are caused by mutations in alleles of the genes that regulate the production of actin or of its associated proteins. The production of actin is also key to the process of infection by some pathogenic microorganisms. Mutations in the different genes that regulate actin production in humans can cause muscular diseases, variations in the size and function of the heart as well as deafness. The make-up of the cytoskeleton is also related to the pathogenicity of intracellular bacteria and viruses, particularly in the processes related to evading the actions of the immune system.  Discovery and early investigation  Nobel Prize winning physiologist Albert von Szent- Gy√∂rgyi Nagyr√°polt, co-discoverer of actin with Brun√≥ Ferenc Straub Actin was first observed experimentally in 1887 by W.D. Halliburton, who extracted a protein from muscle that 'coagulated' preparations of myosin that he called \\"myosin-ferment\\". However, Halliburton was unable to further refine his findings, and the discovery of actin is credited instead to Brun√≥ Ferenc Straub, a young biochemist working in Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi's laboratory at the Institute of Medical Chemistry at the University of Szeged, Hungary. Following up on the discovery of Ilona Banga & Szent-Gy√∂rgyi in 1941 that the coagulation only occurs in some mysosin extractions and was reversed upon the addition of ATP, Straub identified and purified actin from those myosin preparations that did coagulate. Building on Banga's original extraction method, he developed a novel technique for extracting muscle protein that allowed him to isolate substantial amounts of relatively pure actin, published in 1942. Straub's method is essentially the same as that used in laboratories today. Since Straub's protein was necessary to activate the coagulation of myosin, it was dubbed actin. Realizing that Banga's coagulating myosin preparations contained actin as well, Szent-Gy√∂rgyi called the mixture of both proteins actomyosin. The hostilities of World War II meant Szent-Gyorgyi was unable to publish his lab's work in Western scientific journals. Actin therefore only became well known in the West in 1945, when their paper was published as a supplement to the Acta Physiologica Scandinavica. Straub continued to work on actin, and in 1950 reported that actin contains bound ATP and that, during polymerization of the protein into microfilaments, the nucleotide is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate (which remain bound to the microfilament). Straub suggested that the transformation of ATP-bound actin to ADP-bound actin played a role in muscular contraction. In fact, this is true only in smooth muscle, and was not supported through experimentation until 2001. The amino acid sequencing of actin was completed by M. Elzinga and co-workers in 1973. The crystal structure of G-actin was solved in 1990 by Kabsch and colleagues. In the same year, a model for F-actin was proposed by Holmes and colleagues following experiments using co-crystallization with different proteins. The procedure of co-crystallization with different proteins was used repeatedly during the following years, until in 2001 the isolated protein was crystallized along with ADP. However, there is still no high-resolution X-ray structure of F-actin. The crystallization of F-actin was possible due to the use of a rhodamine conjugate that impedes polymerization by blocking the amino acid cys-374.; Christine Oriol-Audit died in the same year that actin was first crystallized but she was the researcher that in 1977 first crystallized actin in the absence of Actin Binding Proteins (ABPs). However, the resulting crystals were too small for the available technology of the time. Although no high-resolution model of actin's filamentous form currently exists, in 2008 Sawaya's team were able to produce a more exact model of its structure based on multiple crystals of actin dimers that bind in different places. This model has subsequently been further refined by Sawaya and Lorenz. Other approaches such as the use of cryo-electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation have recently allowed increasing resolution and better understanding of the nature of the interactions and conformational changes implicated in the formation of actin filaments.  Structure  Actin's amino acid sequence is one of the most highly conserved of the proteins as it has changed little over the course of evolution, differing by no more than 20% in species as diverse as algae and humans. It is therefore considered to have an optimised structure. It has two distinguishing features: it is an enzyme that slowly hydrolizes ATP, the \\"universal energy currency\\" of biological processes. However, the ATP is required in order to maintain its structural integrity. Its efficient structure is formed by an almost unique folding process. In addition, it is able to carry out more interactions than any other protein, which allows it to perform a wider variety of functions than other proteins at almost every level of cellular life. Myosin is an example of a protein that bonds with actin. Another example is villin, which can weave actin into bundles or cut the filaments depending on the concentration of calcium cations in the surrounding medium. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotes, where it is found throughout the cytoplasm. In fact, in muscle fibres it comprises 20% of total cellular protein by weight and between 1% and 5% in other cells. However, there is not only one type of actin; the genes that code for actin are defined as a gene family (a family that in plants contains more than 60 elements, including genes and pseudogenes and in humans more than 30 elements). This means that the genetic information of each individual contains instructions that generate actin variants (called isoforms) that possess slightly different functions. This, in turn, means that eukaryotic organisms express different genes that give rise to: Œ±-actin, which is found in contractile structures; Œ≤-actin, found at the expanding edge of cells that use the projection of their cellular structures as their means of mobility; and Œ≥-actin, which is found in the filaments of stress fibres. In addition to the similarities that exist between an organism's isoforms there is also an evolutionary conservation in the structure and function even between organisms contained in different eukaryotic domains. In bacteria the actin homologue MreB has been identified, which is a protein that is capable of polymerizing into microfilaments; and in archaea the homologue Ta0583 is even more similar to the eukaryotic actins. Cellular actin has two forms: monomeric globules called G-actin and polymeric filaments called F-actin (that is, as filaments made up of many G-actin monomers). F-actin can also be described as a microfilament. Two parallel F-actin strands must rotate 166 degrees to lie correctly on top of each other. This creates the double helix structure of the microfilaments found in the cytoskeleton. Microfilaments measure approximately 7 nm in diameter with the helix repeating every 37 nm. Each molecule of actin is bound to a molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP) that is associated with a Mg2+ cation. The most commonly found forms of actin, compared to all the possible combinations, are ATP-G-Actin and ADP-F-actin.  G-Actin  Scanning electron microscope images indicate that G-actin has a globular structure; however, X-ray crystallography shows that each of these globules consists of two lobes separated by a cleft. This structure represents the ‚ÄúATPase fold‚Äù, which is a centre of enzymatic catalysis that binds ATP and Mg2+ and hydrolyzes the former to ADP plus phosphate. This fold is a conserved structural motif that is also found in other proteins that interact with triphosphate nucleotides such as hexokinase (an enzyme used in energy metabolism) or in Hsp70 proteins (a protein family that play an important part in protein folding). G-actin is only functional when it contains either ADP or ATP in its cleft but the form that is bound to ATP predominates in cells when actin is present in its free state. Ribbon model of actin extracted from the striated muscle tissue of a rabbit after Graceffa and Dom√≠nguez, 2003. The four subdomains can be seen, as well as the N and C termini and the position of the ATP bond. The molecule is oriented using the usual convention of placing the - end (pointed end) in the upper part and the + end (barbed end) in the lower part. The X-ray crystallography model of actin that was produced by Kabsch from the striated muscle tissue of rabbits is the most commonly used in structural studies as it was the first to be purified. The G-actin crystallized by Kabsch is approximately 67 x 40 x 37 √Ö in size, has a molecular mass of 41,785 Da and an estimated isoelectric point of 4.8. Its net charge at pH = 7 is -7. ;Primary structure Elzinga and co-workers first determined the complete peptide sequence for this type of actin in 1973, with later work by the same author adding further detail to the model. It contains 374 amino acid residues. Its N-terminus is highly acidic and starts with an acetyled aspartate in its amino group. While its C-terminus is alkaline and is formed by a phenylalanine preceded by a cysteine, which has a degree of functional importance. Both extremes are in close proximity within the I-subdomain. An anomalous NœÑ- methylhistidine is located at position 73. ;Tertiary structure ‚Äî domains The tertiary structure is formed by two domains known as the large and the small, which are separated by a cleft centred around the location of the bond with ATP-ADP+Pi. Below this there is a deeper notch called a ‚Äúgroove‚Äù. In the native state, despite their names, both have a comparable depth. The normal convention in topological studies means that a protein is shown with the biggest domain on the left-hand side and the smallest domain on the right-hand side. In this position the smaller domain is in turn divided into two: subdomain I (lower position, residues 1‚Äì32, 70‚Äì144, and 338‚Äì374) and subdomain II (upper position, residues 33‚Äì69). The larger domain is also divided in two: subdomain III (lower, residues 145‚Äì180 and 270‚Äì337) and subdomain IV (higher, residues 181‚Äì269). The exposed areas of subdomains I and III are referred to as the ‚Äúbarbed‚Äù ends, while the exposed areas of domains II and IV are termed the ‚Äúpointed\\" ends. This nomenclature refers to the fact that, due to the small mass of subdomain II actin is polar; the importance of this will be discussed below in the discussion on assembly dynamics. Some authors call the subdomains Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb, respectively. ;Other important structures The most notable supersecondary structure is a five chain beta sheet that is composed of a Œ≤-meander and a Œ≤-Œ±-Œ≤ clockwise unit. It is present in both domains suggesting that the protein arose from gene duplication. * The adenosine nucleotide binding site is located between two beta hairpin-shaped structures pertaining to the I and III domains. The residues that are involved are Asp11-Lys18 and Asp154-His161 respectively. * The divalent cation binding site is located just below that for the adenosine nucleotide. In vivo it is most often formed by Mg2+ or Ca2+ while in vitro it is formed by a chelating structure made up of Lys18 and two oxygens from the nucleotide's Œ±-and Œ≤-phosphates. This calcium is coordinated with six water molecules that are retained by the amino acids Asp11, Asp154, and Gln137. They form a complex with the nucleotide that restricts the movements of the so-called \\"hinge\\" region, located between residues 137 and 144. This maintains the native form of the protein until its withdrawal denatures the actin monomer. This region is also important because it determines whether the protein's cleft is in the \\"open\\" or \\"closed\\" conformation. * It is highly likely that there are at least three other centres with a lesser affinity (intermediate) and still others with a low affinity for divalent cations. It has been suggested that these centres may play a role in the polymerization of actin by acting during the activation stage. * There is a structure in subdomain 2 that is called the ‚ÄúD-loop‚Äù because it binds with DNase I, it is located between the His40 and Gly48 residues. It has the appearance of a disorderly element in the majority of crystals, but it looks like a Œ≤-sheet when it is complexed with DNase I. It has been proposed that the key event in polymerization is probably the propagation of a conformational change from the centre of the bond with the nucleotide to this domain, which changes from a loop to a spiral. However, this hypothesis has been refuted by other studies.  F-Actin  F-actin; surface representation of a repetition of 13 subunits based on Ken Holmes' actin filament model The classical description of F-actin states that it has a filamentous structure that can be considered to be a single stranded levorotatory helix with a rotation of 166¬∞ around the helical axis and an axial translation of 27.5 √Ö, or a single stranded dextrorotatory helix with a cross over spacing of 350‚Äì380 √Ö, with each actin surrounded by four more. The symmetry of the actin polymer at 2.17 subunits per turn of a helix is incompatible with the formation of crystals, which is only possible with a symmetry of exactly 2, 3, 4 or 6 subunits per turn. Therefore, models have to be constructed that explain these anomalies using data from electron microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, crystallization of dimers in different positions and diffraction of X-rays. It should be pointed out that it is not correct to talk of a ‚Äústructure‚Äù for a molecule as dynamic as the actin filament. In reality we talk of distinct structural states, in these the measurement of axial translation remains constant at 27.5 √Ö while the subunit rotation data shows considerable variability, with displacements of up to 10% from its optimum position commonly seen. Some proteins, such as cofilin appear to increase the angle of turn, but again this could be interpreted as the establishment of different structural states. These could be important in the polymerization process. There is less agreement regarding measurements of the turn radius and filament thickness: while the first models assigned a length of 25 √Ö, current X-ray diffraction data, backed up by cryo-electron microscopy suggests a length of 23.7 √Ö. These studies have shown the precise contact points between monomers. Some are formed with units of the same chain, between the \\"barbed\\" end on one monomer and the \\"pointed\\" end of the next one. While the monomers in adjacent chains make lateral contact through projections from subdomain IV, with the most important projections being those formed by the C-terminus and the hydrophobic link formed by three bodies involving residues 39‚Äì42, 201‚Äì203, and 286. This model suggests that a filament is formed by monomers in a \\"sheet\\" formation, in which the subdomains turn about themselves, this form is also found in the bacterial actin homologue MreB. The F-actin polymer is considered to have structural polarity due to the fact that all the microfilament's subunits point towards the same end. This gives rise to a naming convention: the end that possesses an actin subunit that has its ATP binding site exposed is called the \\"(-) end\\", while the opposite end where the cleft is directed at a different adjacent monomer is called the \\"(+) end\\". The terms \\"pointed\\" and \\"barbed\\" referring to the two ends of the microfilaments derive from their appearance under transmission electron microscopy when samples are examined following a preparation technique called \\"decoration\\". This method consists of the addition of myosin S1 fragments to tissue that has been fixed with tannic acid. This myosin forms polar bonds with actin monomers, giving rise to a configuration that looks like arrows with feather fletchings along its shaft, where the shaft is the actin and the fletchings are the myosin. Following this logic, the end of the microfilament that does not have any protruding myosin is called the point of the arrow (- end) and the other end is called the barbed end (+ end). A S1 fragment is composed of the head and neck domains of myosin II. Under physiological conditions, G-actin (the monomer form) is transformed to F-actin (the polymer form) by ATP, where the role of ATP is essential. The helical F-actin filament found in muscles also contains a tropomyosin molecule, which is a 40 nanometre long protein that is wrapped around the F-actin helix. During the resting phase the tropomyosin covers the actin's active sites so that the actin-myosin interaction cannot take place and produce muscular contraction. There are other protein molecules bound to the tropomyosin thread, these are the troponins that have three polymers: troponin I, troponin T, and troponin C.  Folding  Ribbon model obtained using the PyMOL programme on crystallographs () of the prefoldin proteins found in the archaean Pyrococcus horikoshii. The six supersecondary structures are present in a coiled helix ‚Äúhanging‚Äù from the central beta barrels. These are often compared in the literature to the tentacles of a jellyfish. As far as is visible using electron microscopy, eukariotic prefoldin has a similar structure. Actin can spontaneously acquire a large part of its tertiary structure. However, the way it acquires its fully functional form from its newly synthesized native form is special and almost unique in protein chemistry. The reason for this special route could be the need to avoid the presence of incorrectly folded actin monomers, which could be toxic as they can act as inefficient polymerization terminators. Nevertheless, it is key to establishing the stability of the cytoskeleton, and additionally, it is an essential process for coordinating the cell cycle. CCT is required in order to ensure that folding takes place correctly. CCT is a group II chaperonin, a large protein complex that assists in the folding of other proteins. CCT is formed of a double ring of eight different subunits (hetero-octameric) and it differs from group I chaperonins like GroEL, which is found in Eubacteria and in eukaryotic organelles, as it does not require a co-chaperone to act as a lid over the central catalytic cavity. Substrates bind to CCT through specific domains. It was initially thought that it only bound with actin and tubulin, although recent immunoprecipitation studies have shown that it interacts with a large number of polypeptides, which possibly function as substrates. It acts through ATP- dependent conformational changes that on occasion require several rounds of liberation and catalysis in order to complete a reaction. In order to successfully complete their folding, both actin and tubulin need to interact with another protein called prefoldin, which is a heterohexameric complex (formed by six distinct subunits), in an interaction that is so specific that the molecules have coevolved. Actin complexes with prefoldin while it is still being formed, when it is approximately 145 amino acids long, specifically those at the N-terminal. Different recognition sub-units are used for actin or tubulin although there is some overlap. In actin the subunits that bind with prefoldin are probably PFD3 and PFD4, which bind in two places one between residues 60‚Äì79 and the other between residues 170‚Äì198. The actin is recognized, loaded, and delivered to the cytosolic chaperonin (CCT) in an open conformation by the inner end of prefoldin's \\"tentacles‚Äù (see the image and note). The contact when actin is delivered is so brief that a tertiary complex is not formed, immediately freeing the prefoldin. chaperonin CCT The CCT then causes actin's sequential folding by forming bonds with its subunits rather than simply enclosing it in its cavity. This is why it possesses specific recognition areas in its apical Œ≤-domain. The first stage in the folding consists of the recognition of residues 245‚Äì249. Next, other determinants establish contact. Both actin and tubulin bind to CCT in open conformations in the absence of ATP. In actin's case, two subunits are bound during each conformational change, whereas for tubulin binding takes place with four subunits. Actin has specific binding sequences, which interact with the Œ¥ and Œ≤-CCT subunits or with Œ¥-CCT and Œµ-CCT. After AMP-PNP is bound to CCT the substrates move within the chaperonin's cavity. It also seems that in the case of actin, the CAP protein is required as a possible cofactor in actin's final folding states. The exact manner by which this process is regulated is still not fully understood, but it is known that the protein PhLP3 (a protein similar to phosducin) inhibits its activity through the formation of a tertiary complex.  ATPase‚Äôs catalytic mechanism  Actin is an ATPase, which means that it is an enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP. This group of enzymes is characterised by their slow reaction rates. It is known that this ATPase is ‚Äúactive‚Äù, that is, its speed increases by some 40,000 times when the actin forms part of a filament. A reference value for this rate of hydrolysis under ideal conditions is around 0.3 s‚àí1. Then, the Pi remains bound to the actin next to the ADP for a long time, until it is cooperatively liberated from the interior of the filament. The exact molecular details of the catalytic mechanism are still not fully understood. Although there is much debate on this issue, it seems certain that a \\"closed\\" conformation is required for the hydrolysis of ATP, and it is thought that the residues that are involved in the process move to the appropriate distance. The glutamic acid Glu137 is one of the key residues, which is located in subdomain 1. Its function is to bind the water molecule that produces a nucleophilic attack on the ATP's Œ≥-phosphate bond, while the nucleotide is strongly bound to subdomains 3 and 4. The slowness of the catalytic process is due to the large distance and skewed position of the water molecule in relation to the reactant. It is highly likely that the conformational change produced by the rotation of the domains between actin's G and F forms moves the Glu137 closer allowing its hydrolysis. This model suggests that the polymerization and ATPase's function would be decoupled straight away. The \\"open\\" to \\"closed\\" transformation between G and F forms and its implications on the relative motion of several key residues and the formation of water wires have been characterized in molecular dynamics and QM/MM simulations.  Genetics  Principal interactions of structural proteins are at cadherin-based adherens junction. Actin filaments are linked to Œ±-actinin and to the membrane through vinculin. The head domain of vinculin associates to E-cadherin via Œ±-catenin, Œ≤-catenin, and Œ≥-catenin. The tail domain of vinculin binds to membrane lipids and to actin filaments. Actin has been one of the most highly conserved proteins throughout evolution because it interacts with a large number of other proteins. It has 80.2% sequence conservation at the gene level between Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a species of yeast), and 95% conservation of the primary structure of the protein product. Although most yeasts have only a single actin gene, higher eukaryotes, in general, express several isoforms of actin encoded by a family of related genes. Mammals have at least six actin isoforms coded by separate genes, which are divided into three classes (alpha, beta, and gamma) according to their isoelectric points. In general, alpha actins are found in muscle (Œ±-skeletal, Œ±-aortic smooth, Œ±-cardiac), whereas beta and gamma isoforms are prominent in non-muscle cells (Œ≤-cytoplasmic, Œ≥1-cytoplasmic, Œ≥2-enteric smooth). Although the amino acid sequences and in vitro properties of the isoforms are highly similar, these isoforms cannot completely substitute for one another in vivo. The typical actin gene has an approximately 100-nucleotide 5' UTR, a 1200-nucleotide translated region, and a 200-nucleotide 3' UTR. The majority of actin genes are interrupted by introns, with up to six introns in any of 19 well- characterised locations. The high conservation of the family makes actin the favoured model for studies comparing the introns-early and introns-late models of intron evolution. All non-spherical prokaryotes appear to possess genes such as MreB, which encode homologues of actin; these genes are required for the cell's shape to be maintained. The plasmid-derived gene ParM encodes an actin-like protein whose polymerized form is dynamically unstable, and appears to partition the plasmid DNA into its daughter cells during cell division by a mechanism analogous to that employed by microtubules in eukaryotic mitosis. Actin is found in both smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulums.  Assembly dynamics = Nucleation and polymerization  Thin filament formation showing the polymerization mechanism for converting G-actin to F-actin; note the hydrolysis of the ATP. Nucleating factors are necessary to stimulate actin polymerization. One such nucleating factor is the Arp2/3 complex, which mimics a G-actin dimer in order to stimulate the nucleation (or formation of the first trimer) of monomeric G-actin. The Arp2/3 complex binds to actin filaments at 70 degrees to form new actin branches off existing actin filaments. Arp2/3-mediated nucleation is necessary for directed cell migration. Also, actin filaments themselves bind ATP, and hydrolysis of this ATP stimulates destabilization of the polymer. The growth of actin filaments can be regulated by thymosin and profilin. Thymosin binds to G-actin to buffer the polymerizing process, while profilin binds to G-actin to exchange ADP for ATP, promoting the monomeric addition to the barbed, plus end of F-actin filaments. F-actin is both strong and dynamic. Unlike other polymers, such as DNA, whose constituent elements are bound together with covalent bonds, the monomers of actin filaments are assembled by weaker bonds. The lateral bonds with neighbouring monomers resolve this anomaly, which in theory should weaken the structure as they can be broken by thermal agitation. In addition, the weak bonds give the advantage that the filament ends can easily release or incorporate monomers. This means that the filaments can be rapidly remodelled and can change cellular structure in response to an environmental stimulus. Which, along with the biochemical mechanism by which it is brought about is known as the \\"assembly dynamic\\". ; In vitro studies Studies focusing on the accumulation and loss of subunits by microfilaments are carried out in vitro (that is, in the laboratory and not on cellular systems) as the polymerization of the resulting actin gives rise to the same F-actin as produced in vivo. The in vivo process is controlled by a multitude of proteins in order to make it responsive to cellular demands, this makes it difficult to observe its basic conditions. In vitro production takes place in a sequential manner: first, there is the \\"activation phase\\", when the bonding and exchange of divalent cations occurs in specific places on the G-actin, which is bound to ATP. This produces a conformational change, sometimes called G*-actin or F-actin monomer as it is very similar to the units that are located on the filament. This prepares it for the \\"nucleation phase\\", in which the G-actin gives rise to small unstable fragments of F-actin that are able to polymerize. Unstable dimers and trimers are initially formed. The \\"elongation phase\\" begins when there are a sufficiently large number of these short polymers. In this phase the filament forms and rapidly grows through the reversible addition of new monomers at both extremes. Finally, a stationary equilibrium is achieved where the G-actin monomers are exchanged at both ends of the microfilament without any change to its total length. In this last phase the \\"critical concentration Cc\\" is defined as the ratio between the assembly constant and the dissociation constant for G-actin, where the dynamic for the addition and elimination of dimers and trimers does not produce a change in the microfilament's length. Under in vitro conditions Cc is 0.1 ŒºM, which means that at higher values polymerization occurs and at lower values depolymerization occurs. ;Role of ATP hydrolysis As indicated above, although actin hydrolyzes ATP, everything points to the fact that ATP is not required for actin to be assembled, given that, on one hand, the hydrolysis mainly takes place inside the filament, and on the other hand the ADP could also instigate polymerization. This poses the question of understanding which thermodynamically unfavourable process requires such a prodigious expenditure of energy. The actin cycle, which couples ATP hydrolysis to actin polymerization, consists of the preferential addition of G-actin-ATP monomers to a filament's barbed end, and the simultaneous disassembly of F-actin-ADP monomers at the pointed end where the ADP is subsequently changed into ATP, thereby closing the cycle. This aspect of actin filament formation is known as ‚Äútreadmilling‚Äù. ATP is hydrolysed relatively rapidly just after the addition of a G-actin monomer to the filament. There are two hypotheses regarding how this occurs; the stochastic, which suggests that hydrolysis randomly occurs in a manner that is in some way influenced by the neighbouring molecules; and the vectorial, which suggests that hydrolysis only occurs adjacent to other molecules whose ATP has already been hydrolysed. In either case, the resulting Pi is not released; it remains for some time noncovalently bound to actin's ADP. In this way there are three species of actin in a filament: ATP-Actin, ADP+Pi-Actin and ADP-Actin. The amount of each one of these species present in a filament depends on its length and state: as elongation commences the filament has an approximately equal amount of actin monomers bound with ATP and ADP+Pi and a small amount of ADP-Actin at the (-) end. As the stationary state is reached the situation reverses, with ADP present along the majority of the filament and only the area nearest the (+) end containing ADP+Pi and with ATP only present at the tip. If we compare the filaments that only contain ADP-Actin with those that include ATP, in the former the critical constants are similar at both ends, while Cc for the other two nucleotides is different: At the (+) end Cc+=0.1 ŒºM, while at the (-) end Cc‚àí=0.8 ŒºM, which gives rise to the following situations: * For G-actin-ATP concentrations less than Cc+ no elongation of the filament occurs. * For G-actin-ATP concentrations less than Cc‚àí but greater than Cc+ elongation occurs at the (+) end. * For G-actin-ATP concentrations greater than Cc‚àí the microfilament grows at both ends. It is therefore possible to deduce that the energy produced by hydrolysis is used to create a true ‚Äústationary state‚Äù, that is a flux, instead of a simple equilibrium, one that is dynamic, polar, and attached to the filament. This justifies the expenditure of energy as it promotes essential biological functions. In addition, the configuration of the different monomer types is detected by actin binding proteins, which also control this dynamism, as will be described in the following section. Microfilament formation by treadmilling has been found to be atypical in stereocilia. In this case the control of the structure's size is totally apical and it is controlled in some way by gene expression, that is, by the total quantity of protein monomer synthesized in any given moment.  Associated proteins  An actin (green) - profilin (blue) complex.; The profilin shown belongs to group II, normally present in the kidneys and the brain. The actin cytoskeleton in vivo is not exclusively composed of actin, other proteins are required for its formation, continuance, and function. These proteins are called actin-binding proteins (ABP) and they are involved in actin's polymerization, depolymerization, stability, organisation in bundles or networks, fragmentation, and destruction. The diversity of these proteins is such that actin is thought to be the protein that takes part in the greatest number of protein-protein interactions. For example, G-actin sequestering elements exist that impede its incorporation into microfilaments. There are also proteins that stimulate its polymerization or that give complexity to the synthesizing networks. * Thymosin Œ≤-4 is a 5 kDa protein that can bind with G-actin-ATP in a 1:1 stoichiometry; which means that one unit of thymosin Œ≤-4 binds to one unit of G-actin. Its role is to impede the incorporation of the monomers into the growing polymer. * Profilin, is a cytosolic protein with a molecular weight of 15 kDa, which also binds with G-actin-ATP or -ADP with a stoichiometry of 1:1, but it has a different function as it facilitates the replacement of ADP nucleotides by ATP. It is also implicated in other cellular functions, such as the binding of proline repetitions in other proteins or of lipids that act as secondary messengers. The protein gelsolin, which is a key regulator in the assembly and disassembly of actin. It has six subdomains, S1-S6, each of which is composed of a five- stranded Œ≤-sheet flanked by two Œ±-helices, one positioned perpendicular to the strands and the other in a parallel position. Both the N-terminal end, (S1-S3), and the C-terminal end, (S4-S6), form an extended Œ≤-sheet. Other proteins that bind to actin regulate the length of the microfilaments by cutting them, which gives rise to new active ends for polymerization. For example, if a microfilament with two ends is cut twice, there will be three new microfilaments with six ends. This new situation favors the dynamics of assembly and disassembly. The most notable of these proteins are gelsolin and cofilin. These proteins first achieve a cut by binding to an actin monomer located in the polymer they then change the actin monomer's conformation while remaining bound to the newly generated (+) end. This has the effect of impeding the addition or exchange of new G-actin subunits. Depolymerization is encouraged as the (-) ends are not linked to any other molecule. Other proteins that bind with actin cover the ends of F-actin in order to stabilize them, but they are unable to break them. Examples of this type of protein are CapZ, which binds the (+) ends depending on a cell's levels of Ca2+/calmodulin. These levels depend on the cell's internal and external signals and are involved in the regulation of its biological functions). Another example is tropomodulin (that binds to the (-) end). Tropomodulin basically acts to stabilize the F-actin present in the myofibrils present in muscle sarcomeres, which are structures characterized by their great stability. Atomic structure of Arp2/3. Each colour corresponds to a subunit: Arp3, orange; Arp2, sea blue (subunits 1 and 2 are not shown); p40, green; p34, light blue; p20, dark blue; p21, magenta; p16, yellow. The Arp2/3 complex is widely found in all eukaryotic organisms. It is composed of seven subunits, some of which possess a topology that is clearly related to their biological function: two of the subunits, ARP2 and ARP3, have a structure similar to that of actin monomers. This homology allows both units to act as nucleation agents in the polymerization of G-actin and F-actin. This complex is also required in more complicated processes such as in establishing dendritic structures and also in anastomosis (the reconnection of two branching structures that had previously been joined, such as in blood vessels).  Chemical inhibitors  Chemical structure of phalloidin There are a number of toxins that interfere with actin's dynamics, either by preventing it from polymerizing (latrunculin and cytochalasin D) or by stabilizing it (phalloidin): * Latrunculin is a toxin produced by sponges. It binds to G-actin preventing it from binding with microfilaments. * Cytocalasin D, is an alkaloid produced by fungi, that binds to the (+) end of F-actin preventing the addition of new monomers. Cytocalasin D has been found to disrupt actin's dynamics, activating protein p53 in animals. * Phalloidin, is a toxin that has been isolated from the death cap mushroom Amanita phalloides. It binds to the interface between adjacent actin monomers in the F-actin polymer, preventing its depolymerization.  Functions and location  Actin forms filaments ('F-actin' or microfilaments) are essential elements of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, able to undergo very fast polymerization and depolymerization dynamics. In most cells actin filaments form larger-scale networks which are essential for many key functions in cells: * Various types of actin networks (made of actin filaments) give mechanical support to cells, and provide trafficking routes through the cytoplasm to aid signal transduction. * Rapid assembly and disassembly of actin network enables cells to migrate (Cell migration). * In metazoan muscle cells, to be the scaffold on which myosin proteins generate force to support muscle contraction. * In non-muscle cells, to be a track for cargo transport myosins (nonconventional myosins) such as myosin V and VI. Nonconventional myosins use ATP hydrolysis to transport cargo, such as vesicles and organelles, in a directed fashion much faster than diffusion. Myosin V walks towards the barbed end of actin filaments, while myosin VI walks toward the pointed end. Most actin filaments are arranged with the barbed end toward the cellular membrane and the pointed end toward the cellular interior. This arrangement allows myosin V to be an effective motor for the export of cargos, and myosin VI to be an effective motor for import. The actin protein is found in both the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus. Its location is regulated by cell membrane signal transduction pathways that integrate the stimuli that a cell receives stimulating the restructuring of the actin networks in response. In Dictyostelium, phospholipase D has been found to intervene in inositol phosphate pathways. Actin filaments are particularly stable and abundant in muscle fibres. Within the sarcomere (the basic morphological and physiological unit of muscle fibres) actin is present in both the I and A bands; myosin is also present in the latter.  Cytoskeleton  Fluorescence micrograph showing F-actin (in green) in rat fibroblasts Microfilaments are involved in the movement of all mobile cells, including non-muscular types, and drugs that disrupt F-actin organization (such as the cytochalasins) affect the activity of these cells. Actin comprises 2% of the total amount of proteins in hepatocytes, 10% in fibroblasts, 15% in amoebas and up to 50‚Äì80% in activated platelets. There are a number of different types of actin with slightly different structures and functions. This means that Œ±-actin is found exclusively in muscle fibres, while types Œ≤ and Œ≥ are found in other cells. In addition, as the latter types have a high turnover rate the majority of them are found outside permanent structures. This means that the microfilaments found in cells other than muscle cells are present in three forms: * Microfilament networks - Animal cells commonly have a cell cortex under the cell membrane that contains a large number of microfilaments, which precludes the presence of organelles. This network is connected with numerous receptor cells that relay signals to the outside of a cell. A merged stack of confocal images showing actin filaments within a cell. The image has been colour coded in the z axis to show in a 2D image which heights filaments can be found at within cells. * Microfilament bundles - These extremely long microfilaments are located in networks and, in association with contractile proteins such as non-muscular myosin, they are involved in the movement of substances at an intracellular level. * Periodic actin rings - A periodic structure constructed of evenly spaced actin rings is recently found to specifically exist in axons (not dendrites). In this structure, the actin rings, together with spectrin tetramers that link the neighboring actin rings, form a cohesive cytoskeleton that supports the axon membrane. The structure periodicity may also regulate the sodium ion channels in axons. = Yeasts = Actin's cytoskeleton is key to the processes of endocytosis, cytokinesis, determination of cell polarity and morphogenesis in yeasts. In addition to relying on actin these processes involve 20 or 30 associated proteins, which all have a high degree of evolutionary conservation, along with many signalling molecules. Together these elements allow a spatially and temporally modulated assembly that defines a cell's response to both internal and external stimuli. Yeasts contain three main elements that are associated with actin: patches, cables, and rings that, despite not being present for long, are subject to a dynamic equilibrium due to continual polymerization and depolymerization. They possess a number of accessory proteins including ADF/cofilin, which has a molecular weight of 16kDa and is coded for by a single gene, called COF1; Aip1, a cofilin cofactor that promotes the disassembly of microfilaments; Srv2/CAP, a process regulator related to adenylate cyclase proteins; a profilin with a molecular weight of approximately 14 kDa that is related/associated with actin monomers; and twinfilin, a 40 kDa protein involved in the organization of patches. = Plants = Plant genome studies have revealed the existence of protein isovariants within the actin family of genes. Within Arabidopsis thaliana, a dicotyledon used as a model organism, there are ten types of actin, nine types of Œ±-tubulins, six Œ≤-tubulins, six profilins, and dozens of myosins. This diversity is explained by the evolutionary necessity of possessing variants that slightly differ in their temporal and spatial expression. The majority of these proteins were jointly expressed in the tissue analysed. Actin networks are distributed throughout the cytoplasm of cells that have been cultivated in vitro. There is a concentration of the network around the nucleus that is connected via spokes to the cellular cortex, this network is highly dynamic, with a continuous polymerization and depolymerization. Structure of the C-terminal subdomain of villin, a protein capable of splitting microfilamentsPDB ; Even though the majority of plant cells have a cell wall that defines their morphology and impedes their movement, their microfilaments can generate sufficient force to achieve a number of cellular activities, such as, the cytoplasmic currents generated by the microfilaments and myosin. Actin is also involved in the movement of organelles and in cellular morphogenesis, which involve cell division as well as the elongation and differentiation of the cell. The most notable proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton in plants include: villin, which belongs to the same family as gelsolin/severin and is able to cut microfilaments and bind actin monomers in the presence of calcium cations; fimbrin, which is able to recognize and unite actin monomers and which is involved in the formation of networks (by a different regulation process from that of animals and yeasts); formins, which are able to act as an F-actin polymerization nucleating agent; myosin, a typical molecular motor that is specific to eukaryotes and which in Arabidopsis thaliana is coded for by 17 genes in two distinct classes; CHUP1, which can bind actin and is implicated in the spatial distribution of chloroplasts in the cell; KAM1/MUR3 that define the morphology of the Golgi apparatus as well as the composition of xyloglucans in the cell wall; NtWLIM1, which facilitates the emergence of actin cell structures; and ERD10, which is involved in the association of organelles within membranes and microfilaments and which seems to play a role that is involved in an organism's reaction to stress.  Nuclear actin  Nuclear actin was first noticed and described in 1977 by Clark and Merriam. Authors describe a protein present in the nuclear fraction, obtained from Xenopus laevis oocytes, which shows the same features as skeletal muscle actin. Since that time there have been many scientific reports about the structure and functions of actin in the nucleus (for review see: Hofmann 2009.) The controlled level of actin in the nucleus, its interaction with actin-binding proteins (ABP) and the presence of different isoforms allows actin to play an important role in many important nuclear processes. = Transport of actin through the nuclear membrane = The actin sequence does not contain a nuclear localization signal. The small size of actin (about 43 kDa) allows it to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion. Actin however shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus quite quickly, which indicates the existence of active transport. The import of actin into the nucleus (probably in a complex with cofilin) is facilitated by the import protein importin 9. Low level of actin in the nucleus seems to be very important, because actin has two nuclear export signals (NES) into its sequence. Microinjected actin is quickly removed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Actin is exported at least in two ways, through exportin 1 (EXP1) and exportin 6 (Exp6). Specific modifications, such as SUMOylation, allows for nuclear actin retention. It was demonstrated that a mutation preventing SUMOylation causes rapid export of beta actin from the nucleus. Based on the experimental results a general mechanism of nuclear actin transport can be proposed: * In the cytoplasm cofilin bind ADP-actin monomers. This complex is actively imported into the nucleus. * Higher concentration of ATP in the nucleus (compared to the cytoplasm) promote ADP to ATP exchange in the actin-cofilin complex. This weakens the strength of binding of these two proteins. * Cofilin-actin complex finally dissociate after cofilin phosphorylation by nuclear LIM kinase. * Actin is SUMOylated and in this form is retained inside the nucleus. * Actin can form complexes with profilin and leave the nucleus via exportin 6. = The organization of nuclear actin = Nuclear actin exists mainly as a monomer, but can also form dynamic oligomers and short polymers. Nuclear actin organization varies in different cell types. For example, in Xenopus oocytes (with higher nuclear actin level in comparison to somatic cells) actin forms filaments, which stabilize nucleus architecture. These filaments can be observed under the microscope thanks to fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin staining. In somatic cell nuclei, however, actin filaments cannot be observed using this technique. The DNase I inhibition assay, so far the only test which allows the quantification of the polymerized actin directly in biological samples, has revealed that endogenous nuclear actin indeed occurs mainly in a monomeric form. Precisely controlled level of actin in the cell nucleus, lower than in the cytoplasm, prevents the formation of filaments. The polymerization is also reduced by the limited access to actin monomers, which are bound in complexes with ABPs, mainly cofilin. = Actin isoforms in the cell nucleus = Little attention is paid to actin isoforms; however, it has been shown that different isoforms of actin are present in the cell nucleus. Actin isoforms, despite of their high sequence similarity, have different biochemical properties such as polymerization and depolymerization kinetic. They also show different localization and functions. The level of actin isoforms, both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, may change for example in response to stimulation of cell growth or arrest of proliferation and transcriptional activity. Research concerns on nuclear actin are usually focused on isoform beta. However the use of antibodies directed against different actin isoforms allows identifying not only the cytoplasmic beta in the cell nucleus, but also: * gamma actin in the cell nuclei of human melanoma, * alpha skeletal muscle actin in the nuclei of mouse myoblasts, * cytoplasmic gamma actin and also alpha smooth muscle actin in the nucleus of the foetal mouse fibroblast The presence of different isoforms of actin may have a significant effect on its function in nuclear processes, especially because the level of individual isoforms can be controlled independently. = Nuclear actin functions = Functions of actin in the nucleus are associated with its ability to polymerize and interaction with variety of ABPs and with structural elements of the nucleus. Nuclear actin is involved in: * Architecture of the nucleus - Interaction of actin with alpha II-spectrin and other proteins are important for maintaining proper shape of the nucleus. * Transcription ‚Äì Actin is involved in chromatin reorganization, transcription initiation and interaction with the transcription complex. Actin takes part in the regulation of chromatin structure, interacting with RNA polymerase I, II and III. In Pol I transcription, actin and myosin (MYO1C, which binds DNA) act as a molecular motor. For Pol II transcription, Œ≤-actin is needed for the formation of the preinitiation complex. Pol III contains Œ≤-actin as a subunit. Actin can also be a component of chromatin remodelling complexes as well as pre-mRNP particles (that is, precursor messenger RNA bundled in proteins), and is involved in nuclear export of RNAs and proteins. * Regulation of gene activity ‚Äì Actin binds to the regulatory regions of different kinds of genes. Actin's ability to regulate gene activity is used in the molecular reprogramming method, which allows differentiated cells return to their embryonic state. * Translocation of the activated chromosome fragment from under membrane region to euchromatin where transcription starts. This movement requires the interaction of actin and myosin. * Integration of different cellular compartments. Actin is a molecule that integrates cytoplasmic and nuclear signal transduction pathways. An example is the activation of transcription in response to serum stimulation of cells in vitro. * Immune response - Nuclear actin polymerizes upon T-cell receptor stimulation and is required for cytokine expression and antibody production in vivo. Due to its ability to undergo conformational changes and interaction with many proteins, actin acts as a regulator of formation and activity of protein complexes such as transcriptional complex.  Muscular contraction  The structure of a sarcomere, the basic morphological and functional unit of the skeletal muscles that contains actin = Outline of a muscle contraction = In muscle cells, actomyosin myofibrils make up much of the cytoplasmic material. These myofibrils are made of thin filaments of actin (typically around 7 nm in diameter), and thick filaments of the motor-protein myosin (typically around 15 nm in diameter). These myofibrils use energy derived from ATP to create movements of cells, such as muscle contraction. Using the hydrolysis of ATP for energy, myosin heads undergo a cycle during which they attach to thin filaments, exert a tension, and then, depending on the load, perform a power stroke that causes the thin filaments to slide past, shortening the muscle. In contractile bundles, the actin-bundling protein alpha-actinin separates each thin filament by ‚âà35 nm. This increase in distance allows thick filaments to fit in between and interact, enabling deformation or contraction. In deformation, one end of myosin is bound to the plasma membrane, while the other end \\"walks\\" toward the plus end of the actin filament. This pulls the membrane into a different shape relative to the cell cortex. For contraction, the myosin molecule is usually bound to two separate filaments and both ends simultaneously \\"walk\\" toward their filament's plus end, sliding the actin filaments closer to each other. This results in the shortening, or contraction, of the actin bundle (but not the filament). This mechanism is responsible for muscle contraction and cytokinesis, the division of one cell into two. = Actin‚Äôs role in muscle contraction = The helical F-actin filament found in muscles also contains a tropomyosin molecule, a 40-nanometre protein that is wrapped around the F-actin helix. During the resting phase the tropomyosin covers the actin's active sites so that the actin-myosin interaction cannot take place and produce muscular contraction (the interaction gives rise to a movement between the two proteins that, because it is repeated many times, produces a contraction). There are other protein molecules bound to the tropomyosin thread, these include the troponins that have three polymers: troponin I, troponin T, and troponin C. Tropomyosin's regulatory function depends on its interaction with troponin in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Both actin and myosin are involved in muscle contraction and relaxation and they make up 90% of muscle protein. The overall process is initiated by an external signal, typically through an action potential stimulating the muscle, which contains specialized cells whose interiors are rich in actin and myosin filaments. The contraction-relaxation cycle comprises the following steps: # Depolarization of the sarcolemma and transmission of an action potential through the T-tubules. # Opening of the sarcoplasmic reticulum‚Äôs Ca2+ channels. # Increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and the interaction of these cations with troponin causing a conformational change in its structure. This in turn alters the structure of tropomyosin, which covers actin's active site, allowing the formation of myosin-actin cross-links (the latter being present as thin filaments). # Movement of myosin heads over the thin filaments, this can either involve ATP or be independent of ATP. The former mechanism, mediated by ATPase activity in the myosin heads, causes the movement of the actin filaments towards the Z-disc. # Ca2+ capture by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a new conformational change in tropomyosin that inhibits the actin-myosin interaction.  Other biological processes  asymmetric cell division. Then, at 10 s, formation of the contractile actin ring can be observed. The traditional image of actin's function relates it to the maintenance of the cytoskeleton and, therefore, the organization and movement of organelles, as well as the determination of a cell's shape. However, actin has a wider role in eukaryotic cell physiology, in addition to similar functions in prokaryotes. * Cytokinesis. Cell division in animal cells and yeasts normally involves the separation of the parent cell into two daughter cells through the constriction of the central circumference. This process involves a constricting ring composed of actin, myosin, and Œ±-actinin. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, actin is actively formed in the constricting ring with the participation of Arp3, the formin Cdc12, profilin, and WASp, along with preformed microfilaments. Once the ring has been constructed the structure is maintained by a continual assembly and disassembly that, aided by the Arp2/3 complex and formins, is key to one of the central processes of cytokinesis. The totality of the contractile ring, the spindle apparatus, microtubules, and the dense peripheral material is called the \\"Fleming body\\" or \\"intermediate body\\". * Apoptosis. During programmed cell death the ICE/ced-3 family of proteases (one of the interleukin-1Œ≤-converter proteases) degrade actin into two fragments in vivo; one of the fragments is 15 kDa and the other 31 kDa. This represents one of the mechanisms involved in destroying cell viability that form the basis of apoptosis. The protease calpain has also been shown to be involved in this type of cell destruction; just as the use of calpain inhibitors has been shown to decrease actin proteolysis and the degradation of DNA (another of the characteristic elements of apoptosis). On the other hand, the stress-induced triggering of apoptosis causes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (which also involves its polymerization), giving rise to structures called stress fibers; this is activated by the MAP kinase pathway. Diagram of a zonula occludens or tight junction, a structure that joins the epithelium of two cells. Actin is one of the anchoring elements shown in green. * Cellular adhesion and development. The adhesion between cells is a characteristic of multicellular organisms that enables tissue specialization and therefore increases cell complexity. Adhesion of cell epithelia involves the actin cytoskeleton in each of the joined cells as well as cadherins acting as extracellular elements with the connection between the two mediated by catenins. Interfering in actin dynamics has repercussions for an organism's development, in fact actin is such a crucial element that systems of redundant genes are available. For example, if the Œ±-actinin or gelation factor gene has been removed in Dictyostelium individuals do not show an anomalous phenotype possibly due to the fact that each of the proteins can perform the function of the other. However, the development of double mutations that lack both gene types is affected. * Gene expression modulation. Actin's state of polymerization affects the pattern of gene expression. In 1997, it was discovered that cytocalasin D-mediated depolymerization in Schwann cells causes a specific pattern of expression for the genes involved in the myelinization of this type of nerve cell. F-actin has been shown to modify the transcriptome in some of the life stages of unicellular organisms, such as the fungus Candida albicans. In addition, proteins that are similar to actin play a regulatory role during spermatogenesis in mice and, in yeasts, actin-like proteins are thought to play a role in the regulation of gene expression. In fact, actin is capable of acting as a transcription initiator when it reacts with a type of nuclear myosin that interacts with RNA polymerases and other enzymes involved in the transcription process. * Stereocilia dynamics. Some cells develop fine filliform outgrowths on their surface that have a mechanosensory function. For example, this type of organelle is present in the Organ of Corti, which is located in the ear. The main characteristic of these structures is that their length can be modified. The molecular architecture of the stereocilia includes a paracrystalline actin core in dynamic equilibrium with the monomers present in the adjacent cytosol. Type VI and VIIa myosins are present throughout this core, while myosin XVa is present in its extremities in quantities that are proportional to the length of the stereocilia. * Intrinsic chirality. Actomyosin networks have been implicated in generating an intrinsic chirality in individual cells. Cells grown out on chiral surfaces can show a directional left/right bias that is actomyosin dependent.  Molecular pathology  The majority of mammals possess six different actin genes. Of these, two code for the cytoskeleton (ACTB and ACTG1) while the other four are involved in skeletal striated muscle (ACTA1), smooth muscle tissue (ACTA2), intestinal muscles (ACTG2) and cardiac muscle (ACTC1). The actin in the cytoskeleton is involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of many infectious agents, including HIV. The vast majority of the mutations that affect actin are point mutations that have a dominant effect, with the exception of six mutations involved in nemaline myopathy. This is because in many cases the mutant of the actin monomer acts as a ‚Äúcap‚Äù by preventing the elongation of F-actin.  Pathology associated with ACTA1  ACTA1 is the gene that codes for the Œ±-isoform of actin that is predominant in human skeletal striated muscles, although it is also expressed in heart muscle and in the thyroid gland. Its DNA sequence consists of seven exons that produce five known transcripts. The majority of these consist of point mutations causing substitution of amino acids. The mutations are in many cases associated with a phenotype that determines the severity and the course of the affliction. nemaline rods produced by the transfection of a DNA sequence of ACTA1, which is the carrier of a mutation responsible for nemaline myopathy The mutation alters the structure and function of skeletal muscles producing one of three forms of myopathy: type 3 nemaline myopathy, congenital myopathy with an excess of thin myofilaments (CM) and congenital myopathy with fibre type disproportion (CMFTD). Mutations have also been found that produce core myopathies. Although their phenotypes are similar, in addition to typical nemaline myopathy some specialists distinguish another type of myopathy called actinic nemaline myopathy. In the former, clumps of actin form instead of the typical rods. It is important to state that a patient can show more than one of these phenotypes in a biopsy. The most common symptoms consist of a typical facial morphology (myopathic facies), muscular weakness, a delay in motor development and respiratory difficulties. The course of the illness, its gravity, and the age at which it appears are all variable and overlapping forms of myopathy are also found. A symptom of nemaline myopathy is that \\"nemaline rods\\" appear in differing places in type 1 muscle fibres. These rods are non-pathognomonic structures that have a similar composition to the Z disks found in the sarcomere. The pathogenesis of this myopathy is very varied. Many mutations occur in the region of actin's indentation near to its nucleotide binding sites, while others occur in Domain 2, or in the areas where interaction occurs with associated proteins. This goes some way to explain the great variety of clumps that form in these cases, such as Nemaline or Intranuclear Bodies or Zebra Bodies. Changes in actin's folding occur in nemaline myopathy as well as changes in its aggregation and there are also changes in the expression of other associated proteins. In some variants where intranuclear bodies are found the changes in the folding masks the nucleus's protein exportation signal so that the accumulation of actin's mutated form occurs in the cell nucleus. On the other hand, it appears that mutations to ACTA1 that give rise to a CFTDM have a greater effect on sarcomeric function than on its structure. Recent investigations have tried to understand this apparent paradox, which suggests there is no clear correlation between the number of rods and muscular weakness. It appears that some mutations are able to induce a greater apoptosis rate in type II muscular fibres. mutations relevant to the various actinopathies related to ACTA1  In smooth muscle  There are two isoforms that code for actins in the smooth muscle tissue: ACTG2 codes for the largest actin isoform, which has nine exons, one of which, the one located at the 5' end, is not translated. It is a Œ≥-actin that is expressed in the enteric smooth muscle. No mutations to this gene have been found that correspond to pathologies, although microarrays have shown that this protein is more often expressed in cases that are resistant to chemotherapy using cisplatin. ACTA2 codes for an Œ±-actin located in the smooth muscle, and also in vascular smooth muscle. It has been noted that the MYH11 mutation could be responsible for at least 14% of hereditary thoracic aortic aneurisms particularly Type 6. This is because the mutated variant produces an incorrect filamentary assembly and a reduced capacity for vascular smooth muscle contraction. Degradation of the aortic media has been recorded in these individuals, with areas of disorganization and hyperplasia as well as stenosis of the aorta's vasa vasorum. The number of afflictions that the gene is implicated in is increasing. It has been related to Moyamoya disease and it seems likely that certain mutations in heterozygosis could confer a predisposition to many vascular pathologies, such as thoracic aortic aneurysm and ischaemic heart disease. The Œ±-actin found in smooth muscles is also an interesting marker for evaluating the progress of liver cirrhosis.  In heart muscle  The ACTC1 gene codes for the Œ±-actin isoform present in heart muscle. It was first sequenced by Hamada and co-workers in 1982, when it was found that it is interrupted by five introns. It was the first of the six genes where alleles were found that were implicated in pathological processes. rat heart that is showing signs of dilated cardiomyopathy A number of structural disorders associated with point mutations of this gene have been described that cause malfunctioning of the heart, such as Type 1R dilated cardiomyopathy and Type 11 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Certain defects of the atrial septum have been described recently that could also be related to these mutations. Two cases of dilated cardiomyopathy have been studied involving a substitution of highly conserved amino acids belonging to the protein domains that bind and intersperse with the Z discs. This has led to the theory that the dilation is produced by a defect in the transmission of contractile force in the myocytes. The mutations in ACTC1 are responsible for at least 5% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. The existence of a number of point mutations have also been found: * Mutation E101K: changes of net charge and formation of a weak electrostatic link in the actomyosin-binding site. * P166A: interaction zone between actin monomers. * A333P: actin-myosin interaction zone. Pathogenesis appears to involve a compensatory mechanism: the mutated proteins act like toxins with a dominant effect, decreasing the heart's ability to contract causing abnormal mechanical behaviour such that the hypertrophy, that is usually delayed, is a consequence of the cardiac muscle's normal response to stress. Recent studies have discovered ACTC1 mutations that are implicated in two other pathological processes: Infantile idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy, and noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium.  In cytoplasmatic actins  ACTB is a highly complex locus. A number of pseudogenes exist that are distributed throughout the genome, and its sequence contains six exons that can give rise to up to 21 different transcriptions by alternative splicing, which are known as the Œ≤-actins. Consistent with this complexity, its products are also found in a number of locations and they form part of a wide variety of processes (cytoskeleton, NuA4 histone- acyltransferase complex, cell nucleus) and in addition they are associated with the mechanisms of a great number of pathological processes (carcinomas, juvenile dystonia, infection mechanisms, nervous system malformations and tumour invasion, among others). A new form of actin has been discovered, kappa actin, which appears to substitute for Œ≤-actin in processes relating to tumours. Image taken using confocal microscopy and employing the use of specific antibodies showing actin's cortical network. In the same way that in juvenile dystonia there is an interruption in the structures of the cytoskeleton, in this case it is produced by cytochalasin D. Three pathological processes have so far been discovered that are caused by a direct alteration in gene sequence: * Hemangiopericytoma with t(7;12)(p22;q13)-translocations is a rare affliction, in which a translocational mutation causes the fusion of the ACTB gene over GLI1 in Chromosome 12. * Juvenile onset dystonia is a rare degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system; in particular, it affects areas of the neocortex and thalamus, where rod-like eosinophilic inclusions are formed. The affected individuals represent a phenotype with deformities on the median line, sensory hearing loss and dystonia. It is caused by a point mutation in which the amino acid tryptophan replaces arginine in position 183. This alters actin's interaction with the ADF/cofilin system, which regulates the dynamics of nerve cell cytoskeleton formation. * A dominant point mutation has also been discovered that causes neutrophil granulocyte dysfunction and recurring infections. It appears that the mutation modifies the domain responsible for binding between profilin and other regulatory proteins. Actin's affinity for profilin is greatly reduced in this allele. The ACTG1 locus codes for the cytosolic Œ≥-actin protein that is responsible for the formation of cytoskeletal microfilaments. It contains six exons, giving rise to 22 different mRNAs, which produce four complete isoforms whose form of expression is probably dependent on the type of tissue they are found in. It also has two different DNA promoters. It has been noted that the sequences translated from this locus and from that of Œ≤-actin are very similar to the predicted ones, suggesting a common ancestral sequence that suffered duplication and genetic conversion. In terms of pathology, it has been associated with processes such as amyloidosis, retinitis pigmentosa, infection mechanisms, kidney diseases, and various types of congenital hearing loss. Six autosomal-dominant point mutations in the sequence have been found to cause various types of hearing loss, particularly sensorineural hearing loss linked to the DFNA 20/26 locus. It seems that they affect the stereocilia of the ciliated cells present in the inner ear's Organ of Corti. Œ≤-actin is the most abundant protein found in human tissue, but it is not very abundant in ciliated cells, which explains the location of the pathology. On the other hand, it appears that the majority of these mutations affect the areas involved in linking with other proteins, particularly actomyosin. Some experiments have suggested that the pathological mechanism for this type of hearing loss relates to the F-actin in the mutations being more sensitive to cofilin than normal. However, although there is no record of any case, it is known that Œ≥-actin is also expressed in skeletal muscles, and although it is present in small quantities, model organisms have shown that its absence can give rise to myopathies.  Other pathological mechanisms  Some infectious agents use actin, especially cytoplasmic actin, in their life cycle. Two basic forms are present in bacteria: * Listeria monocytogenes, some species of Rickettsia, Shigella flexneri and other intracellular germs escape from phagocytic vacuoles by coating themselves with a capsule of actin filaments. L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri both generate a tail in the form of a \\"comet tail\\" that gives them mobility. Each species exhibits small differences in the molecular polymerization mechanism of their \\"comet tails\\". Different displacement velocities have been observed, for example, with Listeria and Shigella found to be the fastest. Many experiments have demonstrated this mechanism in vitro. This indicates that the bacteria are not using a myosin-like protein motor, and it appears that their propulsion is acquired from the pressure exerted by the polymerization that takes place near to the microorganism's cell wall. The bacteria have previously been surrounded by ABPs from the host, and as a minimum the covering contains Arp2/3 complex, Ena/VASP proteins, cofilin, a buffering protein and nucleation promoters, such as vinculin complex. Through these movements they form protrusions that reach the neighbouring cells, infecting them as well so that the immune system can only fight the infection through cell immunity. The movement could be caused by the modification of the curve and debranching of the filaments. Other species, such as Mycobacterium marinum and Burkholderia pseudomallei, are also capable of localized polymerization of cellular actin to aid their movement through a mechanism that is centered on the Arp2/3 complex. In addition the vaccine virus Vaccinia also uses elements of the actin cytoskeleton for its dissemination. * Pseudomonas aeruginosa is able to form a protective biofilm in order to escape a host organism‚Äôs defences, especially white blood cells and antibiotics. The biofilm is constructed using DNA and actin filaments from the host organism. In addition to the previously cited example, actin polymerization is stimulated in the initial steps of the internalization of some viruses, notably HIV, by, for example, inactivating the cofilin complex. The role that actin plays in the invasion process of cancer cells has still not been determined.  Evolution  The eukaryotic cytoskeleton of organisms among all taxonomic groups have similar components to actin and tubulin. For example, the protein that is coded by the ACTG2 gene in humans is completely equivalent to the homologues present in rats and mice, even though at a nucleotide level the similarity decreases to 92%. However, there are major differences with the equivalents in prokaryotes (FtsZ and MreB), where the similarity between nucleotide sequences is between 40‚àí50 % among different bacteria and archaea species. Some authors suggest that the ancestral protein that gave rise to the model eukaryotic actin resembles the proteins present in modern bacterial cytoskeletons. Structure of MreB, a bacterial protein whose three-dimensional structure resembles that of G-actin Some authors point out that the behaviour of actin, tubulin, and histone, a protein involved in the stabilization and regulation of DNA, are similar in their ability to bind nucleotides and in their ability of take advantage of Brownian motion. It has also been suggested that they all have a common ancestor. Therefore, evolutionary processes resulted in the diversification of ancestral proteins into the varieties present today, conserving, among others, actins as efficient molecules that were able to tackle essential ancestral biological processes, such as endocytosis. Equivalents in bacteria The bacterial cytoskeleton may not be as complex as that found in eukaryotes; however, it contains proteins that are highly similar to actin monomers and polymers. The bacterial protein MreB polymerizes into thin non-helical filaments and occasionally into helical structures similar to F-actin. Furthermore, its crystalline structure is very similar to that of G-actin (in terms of its three-dimensional conformation), there are even similarities between the MreB protofilaments and F-actin. The bacterial cytoskeleton also contains the FtsZ proteins, which are similar to tubulin. Bacteria therefore possess a cytoskeleton with homologous elements to actin (for example, MreB, AlfA, ParM, FtsA, and MamK), even though the amino acid sequence of these proteins diverges from that present in animal cells. However, such proteins have a high degree of structural similarity to eukaryotic actin. The highly dynamic microfilaments formed by the aggregation of MreB and ParM are essential to cell viability and they are involved in cell morphogenesis, chromosome segregation, and cell polarity. ParM is an actin homologue that is coded in a plasmid and it is involved in the regulation of plasmid DNA. ParMs from different bacterial plasmids can form astonishingly diverse helical structures comprising two or four strands to maintain faithful plasmid inheritance. Applications Actin is used in scientific and technological laboratories as a track for molecular motors such as myosin (either in muscle tissue or outside it) and as a necessary component for cellular functioning. It can also be used as a diagnostic tool, as several of its anomalous variants are related to the appearance of specific pathologies. *Nanotechnology. Actin-myosin systems act as molecular motors that permit the transport of vesicles and organelles throughout the cytoplasm. It is possible that actin could be applied to nanotechnology as its dynamic ability has been harnessed in a number of experiments including those carried out in acellular systems. The underlying idea is to use the microfilaments as tracks to guide molecular motors that can transport a given load. That is actin could be used to define a circuit along which a load can be transported in a more or less controlled and directed manner. In terms of general applications, it could be used for the directed transport of molecules for deposit in determined locations, which would permit the controlled assembly of nanostructures. These attributes could be applied to laboratory processes such as on lab-on-a-chip, in nanocomponent mechanics and in nanotransformers that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Western blot for cytoplasmic actin from rat lung and epididymis *Actin is used as an internal control in western blots to ascertain that equal amounts of protein have been loaded on each lane of the gel. In the blot example shown on the left side, 75 ¬µg of total protein was loaded in each well. The blot was reacted with anti-Œ≤-actin antibody (for other details of the blot see the reference ) The use of actin as an internal control is based on the assumption that its expression is practically constant and independent of experimental conditions. By comparing the expression of the gene of interest to that of the actin, it is possible to obtain a relative quantity that can be compared between different experiments, whenever the expression of the latter is constant. It is worth pointing out that actin does not always have the desired stability in its gene expression. *Health. Some alleles of actin cause diseases; for this reason techniques for their detection have been developed. In addition, actin can be used as an indirect marker in surgical pathology: it is possible to use variations in the pattern of its distribution in tissue as a marker of invasion in neoplasia, vasculitis, and other conditions. Further, due to actin's close association with the apparatus of muscular contraction its levels in skeletal muscle diminishes when these tissues atrophy, it can therefore be used as a marker of this physiological process. *Food technology. It is possible to determine the quality of certain processed foods, such as sausages, by quantifying the amount of actin present in the constituent meat. Traditionally, a method has been used that is based on the detection of 3-methylhistidine in hydrolyzed samples of these products, as this compound is present in actin and F-myosin's heavy chain (both are major components of muscle). The generation of this compound in flesh derives from the methylation of histidine residues present in both proteins.

Distribution Pinus mugo is native to the subalpine zones of the Pyrenees, Alps, Erzgebirge, Carpathians, northern and central Apennines, and higher Balkan Peninsula mountains - Rila, Pirin, Korab, Prokletije, etc. It is usually found from , occasionally as low as in the north of the range in Germany and Poland, and as high as in the south of the range in Bulgaria and the Pyrenees. Also in Kosovo it is found in the Bjeshk√´t e Nemuna National Park. In Scandinavia, Finland and the Baltic region, Pinus mugo was introduced in the late 1700's and 1800's where it was planted in coastal regions for sand dune stabilization, and later as ornamental plants around residences. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the species has naturalised and become invasive, displacing fragile dune and dune heath habitats. In Estonia and Lithuania pinus mugo only occasionally naturalises outside plantations, sometimes establishing in raised bogs. Subspecies There are three subspecies: *Pinus mugo subsp. mugo ‚Äî in the east and south of the range (southern & eastern Alps, Balkan Peninsula), a low, shrubby, often multi- stemmed plant to tall with symmetrical cones. *Pinus mugo subsp. uncinata ‚Äî in the west and north of the range (from the Pyrenees northeast to Poland), a larger, usually single-stemmed tree to tall with asymmetrical cones (the scales are much thicker on one side of the cone than the other). Some botanists treat the western subspecies as a separate species, Pinus uncinata, others as only a variety, Pinus mugo var. rostrata. This subspecies in the Pyrenees marks the alpine tree line or timberline, the edge of the habitat at which trees are capable of growing. *Pinus mugo subsp. rotundata ‚Äî hybrid subspecies, of the two subspecies above that intergrade extensively in the western Alps and northern Carpathians. Both subspecies have similar foliage, with dark green leaves (\\"needles\\") in pairs, long. The cones are nut- brown, long: and in subsp. mugo are symmetrical, thin-scaled and matt textured; and in subsp. uncinata are asymmetrical with thick scales on the upper side of the cone, thin on the lower side, and glossy textured. An old name for the species ' is still occasionally seen, and a typographical error \\"mugho\\" (first made in a prominent 18th century encyclopedia) is still repeated surprisingly often.

It is also used in Japanese garden style landscapes, and for larger bonsai specimens. In Kosovo, its trunk is used as construction material for the vernacular architecture in the mountains called \\"Bosonica\\". =Cultivars= Numerous cultivars have been selected. The following have been given the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit: *‚ÄôHumpy‚Äô *‚ÄôMops‚Äô *‚ÄôOphir‚Äô Cultivars with seasonal changes in foliage color include Pinus mugo 'Wintergold' and Pinus mugo 'Ophir'. Culinary use A recent trend is the increase in use of the mugo pine in cooking. Buds and young cones are harvested from the wild in the spring and left to dry in the sun over the summer and into the fall. The cones and buds gradually drip syrup, which is then boiled down to a concentrate and combined with sugar to make pine syrup. The syrup is usually sold as \\"pinecone syrup\\" or \\"pine cone syrup\\". Invasive species Pinus mugo is classed as a wilding conifer, and spreads as an invasive species in the high country of New Zealand, coastal Denmark, and other areas of Scandinavia.

She is one of the first medieval composers whose scores are both extant and able to be interpreted by modern scholars and musicians. Approximately fifty of her hymns are extant and twenty-three are included in Orthodox Church liturgical books. The exact number is difficult to assess, as many hymns are ascribed to different authors in different manuscripts and are often identified as anonymous. Additionally, some 789 of her non-liturgical verses survive. Many are epigrams or aphorisms called \\"gnomic verse\\", for example, \\"I hate the rich man moaning as if he were poor.\\" Kassia is notable as one of at least two women in the middle Byzantine period known to have written in their own names, the other being Anna Comnena. Name Her name is a feminine Greek form of the Latin name Cassius. It is variously spelled ŒöŒ±œÉœÉŒπŒ±ŒΩŒÆ (contemporary pronunciation ), ŒöŒ±œÉ(œÉ)ŒØŒ± (Kas[s]ia), ŒïŒπŒ∫Œ±œÉŒØŒ± (Eikasia), ŒôŒ∫Œ±œÉŒØŒ± (Ikasia), Kassiani, Cas[s]ia, Cassiane, Kassiana. Modern English-language references to her as a composer generally use the name \\"Kassia,\\" while references to her religious life tend to use Kassia or Kassiani. Life Theophilos' choice Kassia was born between 805 and 810 in Constantinople into a wealthy familyTouliatos, Grove online and grew to be exceptionally beautiful and intelligent. Three Byzantine chroniclers, Pseudo- Symeon the Logothete, George the Monk (a.k.a. George the Sinner) and Leo the Grammarian, claim that she was a participant in the \\"bride show\\" (the means by which Byzantine princes/emperors sometimes chose a bride, by giving a golden apple to his choice) organized for the young bachelor Theophilos by his stepmother, the Empress Dowager Euphrosyne. Smitten by Kassia's beauty, the young emperor approached her and said: \\"Through a woman [came forth] the baser [things]\\", referring to the sin and suffering coming as a result of Eve's transgression. Kassia promptly responded by saying: \\"And through a woman [came forth] the better [things]\\", referring to the hope of salvation resulting from the Incarnation of Christ through the Virgin Mary. According to tradition, the verbatim dialogue was: > \\"-.\\" > \\"-.\\" His pride wounded by Kassia's terse rebuttal, Theophilos rejected her and chose Theodora as his wife. When next we hear of Kassia in 843 she had founded a convent in the west of Constantinople, near the Constantinian Walls, and became its first abbess.\\"Other Women's Voices\\" Although many scholars attribute this to bitterness at having failed to marry Theophilos and to become Empress, a letter from Theodore the Studite indicates that she had other motivations for wanting a monastic life. It had a close relationship with the nearby monastery of Stoudios, which was to play a central role in re- editing the Byzantine liturgical books in the 9th and 10th centuries, thus ensuring the survival of her work (Kurt Sherry, p. 56). However, since the monastic life was a common vocation in her day, religious zeal is as likely a motive as either depression or aspiration for artistic renown. The Emperor Theophilos was a fierce iconoclast, and any residual feelings he may have had for Kassia did not preserve her from the imperial policy of persecution for her defence of the veneration of icons. Among other things, she was subjected to scourging with a lash. In spite of this, she remained outspoken in defence of the Orthodox Faith, at one point saying, \\"I hate silence when it is time to speak.\\" After the death of Theophilos in 842 his young son Michael III became Eastern Roman Emperor, with Empress Theodora acting as Regent. Together they ended the second iconoclastic period (814-842); peace was restored to the empire. Kassia traveled to Italy briefly, but eventually settled on the Greek Island of Kasos where she died sometime between 867 and 890 CE. In the city of Panaghia, there is a church where Kassia's tomb/reliquary may be found Works Kassiani wrote many hymns which are still used in the Byzantine liturgy to this day. Kassiani became known to the great Theodore the Studite, while she was still a young girl, and he was impressed by her learning and literary style. She not only wrote spiritual poetry, but composed music to accompany it. She is regarded as an \\"exceptional and rare phenomenon\\" among composers of her daySavas J. Svas, Hymnology of the Eastern Orthodox Church (Byzantine Melodies, 1983), p. 108. At least twenty-three genuine hymns are ascribed to her. Hymn of Kassia The most famous of her compositions is the eponymous Hymn of Kassia (also known as the Troparion of Kassiani), which is chanted each year at matins on Holy Wednesday (which in usual parish practice is sung Tuesday evening) at the end of the aposticha. Tradition says that in his later years the Emperor Theophilus, still in love with her, wished to see her one more time before he died, so he rode to the monastery where she resided. Kassia was alone in her cell, writing her Hymn when she realized that the commotion she heard was because the imperial retinue had arrived. She was still in love with him but was now devoted to God and hid away because she did not want to let her old passion overcome her monastic vow. She left the unfinished hymn on the table. Theophilus found her cell and entered it alone. He looked for her but she was not there; she was hiding in a closet, watching him. Theophilus, overcome with sadness, cried and regretted that moment of pride when he rejected such a beautiful and intellectual woman; then he noticed the papers on the table and read them. When he had finished reading, he sat and added one line to the hymn; then he left. The line attributed to the Emperor is the line \\"those feet whose sound Eve heard at dusk in Paradise and hid herself for fear\\". Legend says that as he was leaving he noticed Kassia in the closet but did not speak to her, out of respect for her wished privacy. Kassia emerged when the emperor was gone, read what he had written and finished the hymn. The music for the hymn is slow, sorrowful and plaintive, lasting about ten to twenty minutes, depending on tempo and style of execution. It requires a very wide vocal range, and is considered one of the most demanding, if not the most demanding, pieces of solo Byzantine chant, and cantors take great pride in delivering it well. It is also sung by choirs in unison, often underpinned by Byzantine vocal bass drone. The faithful make a point of going to church specifically \\"to listen to Kassiani\\" that evening. In many places in Greece, the Bridegroom Matins service of Great Tuesday is popular with sex workers, who may not often be seen in church at other times of the year. They come in great numbers, in order to hear the Hymn of Kassiani, as the hymn is associated with the woman fallen in many sins. Portrayals Many fictitious stories were created around her relationship with Emperor Theofilos. Contemporary historians such as Glykas, Ptochoprodromos, Kodinos, Zonaras and Georgios Amartolos described her exile in Italy during the Iconoclasy wars and later settled and died in Kasos sometime between 867 and 890 CE. She is portrayed by Karima McAdams in the 5th season of the television series Vikings. In August of 2019, English singer- songwriter Frank Turner included a song told from her point of view on his album No Man's Land. Other works Among the other hymns she composed are the following: *The Doxastichon chanted at the Vesperal Divine Liturgy on Christmas Eve *Numerous hymns in honor of saints found in the Menaion (fixed cycle of the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar), such as Feast of the Nativity of the Forerunner, 24 June. * Among her hymns in the Triodion (liturgical book used during Great Lent) are the irmoi for the Matins Canon of Great Thursday. * Her longest composition is a Canon for the Departed, consisting of 32 strophes, to be chanted at a Parastas (memorial services). Religious commemoration The feast day of Saint Kassiani is celebrated by the Orthodox Church on September 7. She is often depicted on the icon of the Sunday of Orthodoxy (the First Sunday of Great Lent), because of her strong defence of the veneration of icons.

This concept of \\"charity\\" differs from the modern Western understanding of \\"charity.\\" The latter is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity; tzedakah is an ethical obligation. Tzedakah refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasizes as an important part of living a spiritual life. Unlike voluntary philanthropy, tzedakah is seen as a religious obligation that must be performed regardless of one's financial standing, and so is mandatory even for those of limited financial means. Tzedakah is considered to be one of the three main acts that can positively influence an unfavorable heavenly decree. The word tzedakah is based on the Hebrew (, Tzedek), meaning righteousness, fairness, or justice, and is related to the Hebrew word Tzadik, meaning righteous as an adjective (or righteous individual as a noun in the form of a substantive). Although the word appears 157 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, typically in relation to \\"righteousness\\" per se, its use as a term for \\"charity\\" in the above sense is an adaptation of Rabbinic Judaism in Talmudic times. In the Middle Ages, Maimonides conceived of an eight-level hierarchy of tzedakah, where the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient becoming self-sufficient instead of living upon others. In his view, the second highest form of tzedakah is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients. Precedents in ancient Israel The Hebrew Bible teaches the obligation to aid those in need, but does not employ one single term for this obligation.Ronald L. RandleThe JPS guide to Jewish traditions Jewish Publication Society, 2004 p. 531 \\"Tzedakah (hqdx) The Bible repeatedly stresses the obligation to aid those in need, but never designates a special term for this requirement. The Rabbis adopted the word \\"tzedakah\\" to apply to charity, primarily in the form ...\\" The term tzedakah occurs 157 times in the Masoretic Text, typically in relation to \\"righteousness\\" per se, usually in the singular, but sometimes in the plural tzedekot, in relation to acts of charity.\\"The word \\"almsgiving\\", however, is far from expressing the full meaning of the Hebrew ·∫ìeda·∏≥ah, which is, charity in the spirit of uprightness or justice. According to the Mosaic conception, wealth is a loan from God, and the poor have a certain claim on the possessions of the rich; while the rich are positively enjoined to share God's bounties with the poor.\\" In the Septuagint this was sometimes translated as eleemosyne, \\"almsgiving.\\"As per Gesenius Lexicon; \\"Deuterony 6:25 Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒªŒµŒ∑ŒºŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑ ·ºîœÉœÑŒ±Œπ...\\"\\"... derived from the Greek ·ºêŒªŒµŒ∑ŒºŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑ (mercifulness), used by Greek-speaking Jews to denote almost exclusively the offering of charity to the needy, from a feeling of both compassion and righteousness (·∫ìeda·∏≥ah). (See LXX. (note: Septuagint) on Prov. xxi. 21, and Dan. iv. 24.)\\" In rabbinical literature of the classical and Middle Ages In classical rabbinical literature, it was argued that the Biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to corn fields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens. The classical rabbinical writers were much stricter as to who could receive the remains. It was stated that the farmer was not permitted to benefit from the gleanings, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions (Hullin 131a, Pe'ah 5:6).Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, 4:11 The farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also argued that the law was only applicable in Canaan (Jerusalem Talmud. Pe'ah 2:5), although many classical rabbinical writers who were based in Babylon observed the laws there (Hullin 134b).Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, 1:14 It was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace.Gittin 59b Maimonides lists his Eight Levels of Giving, as written in the Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot matanot aniyim (\\"Laws about Giving to Poor People\\"), Chapter 10:7‚Äì14: #Giving an interest-free loan to a person in need; forming a partnership with a person in need; giving a grant to a person in need; finding a job for a person in need, so long as that loan, grant, partnership, or job results in the person no longer living by relying upon others. #Giving tzedakah anonymously to an unknown recipient via a person or public fund that is trustworthy, wise, and can perform acts of tzedakah with your money in a most impeccable fashion. #Giving tzedakah anonymously to a known recipient. #Giving tzedakah publicly to an unknown recipient. #Giving tzedakah before being asked. #Giving adequately after being asked. #Giving willingly, but inadequately. #Giving \\"in sadness\\" (giving out of pity): It is thought that Maimonides was referring to giving because of the sad feelings one might have in seeing people in need (as opposed to giving because it is a religious obligation). Other translations say \\"Giving unwillingly.\\" In practice Tzedakah motif on a Jewish gravestone. Jewish cemetery in Otwock (Karczew-Anielin). In practice, most Jews carry out tzedakah by donating a portion of their income to charitable institutions, or to needy people they may encounter. The perception among many modern-day Jews is that if donation of this form is not possible, the obligation of tzedakah still requires that something be given. Traditional Jews commonly practice ma'sar kesafim, tithing 10% of their income to support those in need. Special acts of tzedakah are performed on significant days: At weddings, Jewish brides and bridegrooms would traditionally give to charity to symbolise the sacred character of the marriage. At Passover, a major holiday in Jewish tradition, it is traditional to be welcoming towards hungry strangers and feed them at the table. At Purim it is considered obligatory for every Jew to give food to one other person, and gifts to at least two poor people, in an amount that would equate to a meal each, for the purpose of increasing the total happiness during the month. As for the more limited form of tzedakah expressed in the biblical laws, namely the leaving of gleanings from certain crops, the Shulchan Aruch argues that during The Exile Jewish farmers are not obliged to obey it.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 332:1 Nevertheless, in modern Israel, rabbis of Orthodox Judaism insist that Jews allow gleanings to be consumed by the poor and by strangers, and all crops (not just gleanings) by anyone and everyone (free, not bought nor sold) during sabbatical years. In addition, one must be very careful about how one gives out tzedakah money. It is not sufficient to give to just any person or organization; rather, one must check their credentials and finances to be sure that your tzedakah money will be used wisely, efficiently, and effectively. The meaning of \\"Do not steal from a poor person, for (s)he is poor\\" (Proverbs 22:22) and of Talmudic-era commentaries, including Numbers Rabba 5:2, is that tzedakah money was never yours to begin with. Rather, it always belongs to God, who merely entrusts you with it so that you may use it properly. Hence, you are obliged to ensure that it is received by those who are deserving. There are many examples of tzedakah funds that operate according to Maimonides' principles above (particularly #2), including Hands on Tzedakah (working with nonprofits in the U.S. and in Israel), and Mitzvah Heroes Fund (working mainly with nonprofits in Israel). Paamonim is a nonprofit organization in Israel that operates according to Maimonides' first principle. Keeping a pushke (a collection box) in private homes is traditional. The Gaon of Vilna considered giving tzedakah to all householders in our city with tax-benefit. Dvƒìyre-ƒíster Helfer (1817-1907), known to Vilna's Jews for her integrity and wisdom, was legendary for her ability to help people in trouble, although she and her husband were not wealthy. Aided by her phenomenal memory, she was able to touch the right people at the right time to help individuals throughout her life, many of whom came to see her as a sort of saint who not only found money for her, but also offered special blessings accompanying her charitable gifts. She also helped fund a prayerhouse dedicated to charity for the needy that was known colloquially by her name; in her lifetime she came to be seen as a saint, while her death was commemorated in ways usually reserved for religious figures; and her portrait often hung next to the Gaon's in the homes of Vilna's Jews.  Analogous concept in Islam  The primary counterpart in Islam is Zakat (), as that refers to one's religious obligation based on those Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth.

It is named after George Lansbury, a Poplar councillor and Labour Party MP. History Lansbury Estate is one of the largest such estates in London. It occupies an area bounded by the East India Dock Road to the south, the Docklands Light Railway to the east and the Limehouse Cut canal to the north- west. Layout of the estate, built on a site badly damaged by bombing during the Second World War, began in 1949. Construction of the estate started shortly before 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain, with Frederick Gibberd's Chrisp Street Market area and the Trinity Independent Chapel. The construction of the housing and other land-uses extended eastwards, with the final phase, at Pigott Street, finished in 1982, near Bartlett Park. The philosophy of the design was that new development should comprise neighbourhoods, and that within the neighbourhood should be all that a community required ‚Äì flats, houses, churches, schools, an old people's home, a pedestrianised shopping area and covered market. There should be pubs and open spaces, linked by footways. Traditional materials were used in the construction, such as London stock bricks and Welsh slate to counter the modern architecture.Museum of London ‚Äì The Festival of Britain accessed 4 Jan 2006 SS Mary and Joseph Roman Catholic Church The architecture critic Lewis Mumford wrote of the Lansbury Estate (1953) \\"Its design has been based not solely on abstract aesthetic principles, or on the economics of commercial construction, or on the techniques of mass production, but on the social constitution of the community itself, with its diversity of human interests and human needs. Thus the architects and planners have avoided not only the clich√©s of ¬¥high rise¬¥ building but the dreary prisonlike order that results from forgetting the very purpose of housing and the necessities of neighbourhood living.\\"\\"East End Urbanity\\" in \\"The Highway And The City\\", 1963 English Heritage has recognised the significance of the estate by listing some of the buildings including the SS Mary and Joseph Roman Catholic Church designed by Adrian Gilbert Scott; however, it noted that the estate has suffered considerable neglect, and also some well-meaning but ill-advised modernisation of the facilities within the associated market. John Betjeman thought highly of the estate, along with the nearby St John's Estate on the Isle of Dogs.Betjeman's London 1988 The Lansbury Estate was owned by the GLC and later by Tower Hamlets Council.

The Hawaiian name for the fish, ' (), also spelled humuhumu-nukunuku-a-puaa' or just humuhumu for short (meaning \\"triggerfish with a snout like a pig\\"humuhumunukunukuapuaa. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000 ) is shared with the reef triggerfish (R. rectangulus), the state fish of Hawaii. This species has been studied in a range of research contexts, from locomotion to colour vision research. Behavior Lagoon triggerfish live in the reefs and sandy areas of coral reefs where it eats just about everything that comes along. They are always restlessly swimming around and can vigorously protect their territory against intruders, including divers, especially when guarding their eggs during reproduction season. Their relatively small size makes them much less dangerous than the larger titan triggerfish of the same family. Mating and reproduction Both sexes guard territories, some maintaining a territory for eight years or longer (with males holding territories for significantly longer than females). A typical male territory may overlap with one to five female territories, and their mating system is described as haremic, although not much is known about this (similar mating systems are seen in other Balistidae species). If a male or female is removed or disappears their territories are soon taken over by a new fish. They reproduce multiple times over their lifetimes. Pair-spawning takes place around sunrise, with the egg masses being attached to sand, coral rubble or algae. They hatch on the same day around sunset. Although paternal care is normal in teleost fishes with external fertilization, it is the mothers in this species that guard and care for eggs until they hatch. The mother remains above the eggs for about 12‚Äì14 hours, fanning the eggs with her pectoral fins to improve aeration for perhaps 30% of the time. She chases away most fish that approach and remove other intruders like starfish by mouth. Maternal care is effective in preventing predation, and experimental removal of the mothers reduced survival to almost nothing suggesting this behaviour is adaptive. Unlike fathers, mothers forage less and over a smaller area near the egg mass while caring for the eggs. Since the males have multiple mates, caring for an egg mass would probably be more costly in terms of lost mating opportunities so maternal care is considered to be an evolutionarily stable strategy. Vision This species has one type of single cone (SC), with visual pigment peaking in sensitivity at 413 nm (S),S = short wavelength, M = middle wavelength, L = long wavelength and a double cone with different visual pigments in each member peaking at 480 nm (M) and 530 nm (L) respectively. Behavioural research has provided evidence that individual members of the double cones can act as independent channels of colour information, aiding in understanding double cone function. This research suggests the species has trichromatic vision, like humans. File:Reef trigger fish.

She is second in line to succeed her grandfather King Harald V. A member of the House of Gl√ºcksburg, she is expected to become the country's second female monarch, after the 15th- century Queen Margaret. Birth and baptism Princess Ingrid Alexandra with her father in 2007 Born on 21 January 2004 at 9:13 am in The National Hospital, part of the Oslo University Hospital in Oslo, Princess Ingrid Alexandra is the first child and only daughter of Crown Prince Haakon, heir apparent to the throne, and the second granddaughter of King Harald V and Queen Sonja. Her mother, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has a son named Marius Borg H√∏iby, born in 1997 from a previous relationship. Following Ingrid Alexandra's birth, the already well-regarded royal family experienced an upsurge of popularity. Ingrid Alexandra was baptised by Bishop Gunnar St√•lsett in the chapel of the Royal Palace on 17 April 2004. Her grandfather the King, her aunt Princess M√§rtha Louise, the Crown Prince of Denmark, the Crown Princess of Sweden, the then Prince of Asturias, and her maternal grandmother Marit Tjessem were her godparents. The Crown Prince of Denmark and the Prince of Asturias were unable to attend the christening due to their respective weddings scheduled to occur within a month of the christening. On 31 August 2019, Ingrid Alexandra was confirmed in the Palace Chapel in Oslo with all her godparents present.Princess confirmed The Royal House of Norway, 31 August 2019Princess Ingrid Alexandra's confirmation: The Princess' speech of thanks The Royal House of Norway, 31 August 2019 Education  Ingrid Alexandra started her first day of school on 19 August 2010 at Jansl√∏kka elementary school, a local state school attended by her half-brother. Her parents chose the school because they wanted her to have as ordinary a childhood as possible. Newspaper reports said Princess Ingrid Alexandra would walk to school with her half-brother, and local citizens could expect to see her occasionally out in the community with her classmates on school outings. School officials hoped to make the school a place where the princess could make friends and enjoy some relief from public scrutiny. On 17 June 2014, the Norwegian Royal Family notified the public that from the start of the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, Princess Ingrid Alexandra would transfer to the private English-language Oslo International School, reportedly because her parents wanted her to be fluent in English. Her younger brother, Sverre Magnus, was to transfer to Oslo's Montessori school. Princess Ingrid Alexandra was transferred to Oslo's Uranienborg School to complete her lower secondary education. In the fall of 2020 she is scheduled to start at Elvebakken Upper Secondary School in Oslo. Activities On 19 June 2010, Princess Ingrid Alexandra served as a bridesmaid at the wedding of her godmother, the Crown Princess of Sweden. In December 2012, the Princess attended an interview with her father by a Norwegian television programme in aid of Environmental Agents, the children's environmental organization. Her mother was supposed to attend, but the Crown Prince attended instead as the Crown Princess was ill. She has taken part in traditional celebrations of the Constitution Day, as well as the traditional ski jumping tournament at Holmenkollen in Oslo. On 4 May 2015, Princess Ingrid Alexandra christened the Norwegian Rescue Company's new lifeboat, Elias that she has been made godmother of. In 2016, the Princess Ingrid Alexandra Sculpture Park opened in the Palace Park, with sculptures made for children and by children. The Princess takes active part herself in choosing the designs from among the contributions to the sculpture park from school children all over Norway.Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Queen Sonja unveiled new statues in Palace Park in Oslo royalcentral.co.uk, 7 June 2018 On 12 February 2016, the Princess and her grandfather participated in the opening ceremony of the Winter Youth Olympics in Lillehammer. While the King declared open the Games, the Princess lit the cauldron. Her father Crown Prince Haakon did the same thing 22 years before, during the opening of the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer in 1994.  Constitutional status  The Constitution of Norway was altered in 1990 to introduce absolute primogeniture, ensuring that the crown would pass to the eldest child regardless of sex but keeping the Crown Prince ahead of his elder sister, Princess M√§rtha Louise; the change was to apply for the first time to their children. Princess Ingrid Alexandra has thus been second in the line of succession since birth, preceded only by her father. Because of the reform, her status was not affected by the subsequent birth of her brother, Prince Sverre Magnus, in 2005. The Princess is expected to become Norway's first female monarch since Queen Margaret, who reigned over Norway, Denmark and Sweden from the late 1380s until her death in 1412. Along with her parents and grandparents - but unlike her brother, half-brother Marius, and other relatives - Princess Ingrid Alexandra is a member of the Norwegian Royal House. The family belongs to the House of Gl√ºcksburg. In popular culture Princess Ingrid Alexandra was mentioned in a 2010 episode of The Simpsons, \\"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\\".

Distribution Pinus nigra is a tree of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. The majority of the range is in Turkey. It is found in the higher elevations of the South Apennine mixed montane forests ecoregion in southern Italy and the Tyrrhenian-Adriatic sclerophyllous and mixed forests ecoregion in Sicily. There are remnant populations in the Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests ecoregion, and in the higher Atlas Mountains in Morocco and Algeria. It is found at elevations ranging from sea level to , most commonly from . Several of the varieties have distinct English names.Rushforth, K. (1987). Conifers. Helm . It has naturalized in parts of the midwestern states of the U.S, normally south of the normal native ranges of native pines. Description Pinus nigra is a large coniferous evergreen tree, growing to high at maturity and spreading to 20 to 40 feet wide. The bark is grey to yellow-brown, and is widely split by flaking fissures into scaly plates, becoming increasingly fissured with age. The leaves (\\"needles\\") are thinner and more flexible in western populations (see 'Taxonomy' section below). The ovulate and pollen cones appear from May to June. The mature seed cones are 5‚Äì10 cm (rarely to 11 cm) long, with rounded scales; they ripen from green to pale grey-buff or yellow-buff in September to November, about 18 months after pollination. The seeds are dark grey, 6‚Äì8 mm long, with a yellow- buff wing 20‚Äì25 mm long; they are wind-dispersed when the cones open from December to April. maturity is reached at 15‚Äì40 years; large seed crops are produced at 2‚Äì5 year intervals. Pinus nigra is moderately fast growing, at about per year. It usually has a rounded conic form, that becomes irregular with age. The tree can be long-lived, with some trees over 500 years old. It needs full sun to grow well, is intolerant of shade, and is resistant to snow and ice damage. Taxonomy The species is divided into two subspecies, each further subdivided into three varieties.Gymnosperm Database: Pinus nigraChristensen, K. I. (1993). Comments on the earliest validly published varietal name for the Corsican Pine. Taxon 42: 649-653. Some authorities (e.g. Flora Europaea) treat several of the varieties at subspecific rank, but this reflects tradition rather than sound taxonomy, as the distinctions between the taxa are small.Farjon, A. (2005). Pines Drawings and Descriptions of the Genus Pinus 2nd ed. Brill . ;Subspecies *P. nigra subsp. nigra in the east of the range, from Austria, northeast and central Italy, east to the Crimea and Turkey.

Ecology Pinus nigra var. corsicana‚ÄîCorsican pine, in Corsica. Pinus nigra var. corsicana‚ÄîCorsican pine plantation, in Belgium. In Mediterranean Europe and the Anatolian Peninsula (Asia Minor), trees usually associated with this species include Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Serbian spruce (Picea omorika), Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii), Norway spruce (Picea abies), Taurus cedar (Cedrus libani), European silver fir (Abies alba) and related firs. Several species of juniper (Juniperus spp.), and various broadleaf trees are associates. ;Climate and provenance Pinus nigra is a light-demanding species, intolerant of shade but resistant to wind and drought. The eastern P. nigra subsp. nigra exhibits greater winter frost hardiness (hardy to below ‚àí30 ¬∞C) than the western P. nigra subsp. salzmannii (hardy to about ‚àí25 ¬∞C). Different provenances (seed sources by geographic area) or varieties are adapted to different soil types: Austrian and Pyrenees origins grow well on a wide range of soil types, Corsican origins grows poorly on limestone, while Turkish and Crimean origins grow well on limestone. Most provenances also show good growth on podzolic soils. Uses=Lumber The timber of European black pine is similar to that of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and red pine (Pinus resinosa), being moderately hard and straight-grained. It does however tend to be rougher, softer, and not as strong, due to its faster growth. It is used for general construction, fuel, and in paper manufacture. In the United Kingdom, Pinus nigra is important both as a timber tree and in plantations (primarily Corsican pine subsp.). Recently however, serious problems have occurred with red band needle blight disease, caused by the fungus Dothistroma septosporum, resulting in a major recent decline in forestry planting there.Forestry Commission: Red band needle blight In the United States it is of low importance as a timber species. In regard to Austrian pine, the fungus Dothistroma septosporum is widespread and rapidly spreading out of control throughout the United States. All now growing Austrian pine are expected to be killed by this disease. It is out of control and not recommended for landscaping, especially in groups or rows.  Ethnobotanical and ethnomedicinal usage  In Turkey, this pine (subsp. pallasiana) was and is used in various ways, both topically and internally, as well as for construction and for livestock. Among its uses are curing acne, common cold, osteomyelitis, and viral infections; acting as an oral antiseptic; treating cracked hands and feet in the winter; and sealing wooden roofs. Ornamental usage In the US and Canada, the European black pine is planted as a street tree, and as an ornamental tree in gardens and parks. Its value as a street tree is largely due to its resistance to salt spray (from road de-icing salt) and various industrial pollutants (including ozone), and its intermediate drought tolerance. In the UK the tree is planted as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens. It is planted with great success as far north as Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In both the US and UK most of the specimens planted are from Austrian sources, the Pinus nigra subsp. nigra and Pinus nigra subsp. nigra var. nigra seed selections. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when demand for natural trees was extremely high, its rapid growth, deep green color and low cost made it briefly a popular Christmas tree, but the extreme length of the needles (making it very difficult to decorate) soon led to its fall from favor, and it has long since been abandoned in the US for that purpose. P. nigra is planted for windbreaks and shelterbelts in the US, recommended for windbreaks in the Northern Great Plains on medium to deep moist or upland soils. =Invasive species= Pinus nigra has become naturalised in a few areas of the United States. In New Zealand it is considered an invasive species and noxious weed, along with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), due to their habitat conversion nature in tussock grassland plant communities, shading out the native bunch grasses as their forest canopy develops.

She was the fifth warship and second aircraft carrier to bear the name Illustrious, and was affectionately known to her crew as \\"Lusty\\". In 1982, the conflict in the Falklands necessitated that Illustrious be completed and rushed south to join her sister ship and the veteran carrier . To this end, she was brought forward by three months for completion at Swan Hunter Shipyard, then commissioned on 20 June 1982 at sea en route to Portsmouth Dockyard to take on board extra stores and crew. She arrived in the Falklands to relieve Invincible on 28 August 1982 in a steam past. Returning to the United Kingdom, she was not formally commissioned into the fleet until 20 March 1983. After her South Atlantic deployment, she was deployed on Operation Southern Watch in Iraq, then Operation Deny Flight in Bosnia during the 1990s and Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone in 2000. An extensive re-fit during 2002 prevented her from involvement in the 2003 Iraq War, but she was repaired in time to assist British citizens trapped by the 2006 Lebanon War. Following the retirement of her fixed-wing British Aerospace Harrier II aircraft in 2010, Illustrious operated as one of two Royal Navy helicopter carriers. After 32 years' service, the oldest ship in the Royal Navy's active fleet was formally decommissioned on 28 August 2014 even though she would not be replaced until 's commissioning in 2017. Despite the UK Ministry of Defence's announcement in 2012 that, once decommissioned, Illustrious would be preserved for the nation, in 2016 she was sold and towed to Turkish company Leyal for scrapping. Construction and commissioning Illustrious, the second of the three Invincible-class aircraft carriers, was laid down at Swan Hunter on the River Tyne on 7 October 1976 and launched by Princess Margaret on 1 December 1978. As the ship neared the end of its fitting out period, the Falklands War broke out. As a consequence, work on Illustrious was greatly sped up. The war was won before Illustrious could be finished, but she did perform a useful service in the aftermath. Until the RAF airfield on the Falkland Islands was repaired, air defence of the area was the responsibility of the Fleet Air Arm. After Hermes returned to the UK, Invincible remained on station in the South Atlantic until September 1982. To relieve Invincible, the newly completed Illustrious was rapidly deployed, with 809 Naval Air Squadron (Sea Harrier) and 814 Naval Air Squadron (Sea King) embarked. Additionally, a pair of Sea Kings from 824 Naval Air Squadron were attached to the air group, which had been converted to operate in the AEW role. So rapidly was Illustrious deployed that she was commissioned while at sea. Rear Admiral Derek Reffell, Flag Officer, Third Flotilla, commanded the relief task group from Illustrious during this period. After the RAF airfield was repaired, Illustrious returned to the UK for a full shakedown cruise and workup period, and was formally commissioned on 20 March 1983. Operational history=1983‚Äì1990 The carrier saw no further action during the remainder of the 1980s, but continued to be a valuable asset for the Royal Navy in showing the flag and participating in exercises all around the world. During those years, the ship received several enhancements during refits, including a steeper ski-jump to enable the Harriers in the air wing to take-off with a larger payload. During an 'Extended Dockyard Assisted Maintenance Period (EDAMP)', numerous modifications were made to the ship including the removal of her Sea Dart missile defences at a cost of twelve million pounds. This allowed for extra deck space that enables her to carry up to 22 aircraft, including the Harrier GR7. On 3 April 1986 she suffered a catastrophic gearbox failure which almost saw the end of the vessel's naval career. Just starting out on her \\"fly the flag\\" around the globe trip, at about 23:30 whilst reaching full engine revs, due to an over tightened clamp causing friction and heat it ignited the oil vapour within the gearbox exploded causing a fire lasting well over four hours. Sea Harriers were flown off whilst firefighting continued below decks, and one Sea king took the only casualty ashore (smoke inhalation) Although it was a serious fire it was contained within the forward gearbox room and vertical trunking. Additional vessels including the destroyer HMS Nottingham and Ferry Sea Leopard were in attendance, however Illustrious crew managed to extinguish the fire and she returned to Portsmouth under her own power provided by her aft engine room. Although the ship went to emergency stations at no time was any abandonment considered. There was no loss of life or serious injury, but the trip was put off for several months whilst the ship was taken out of service for extensive repairs. In due course once repairs were completed Illustrious sailed directly to the Far East arriving at Singapore to resume the Eastern end of the Global 86 deployment. 1990‚Äì2002 Illustrious (r) and the American in the Persian Gulf in 1998 During the 1990s, the main task of the aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy was helping to maintain the no-fly zone over Bosnia during the war there. All three of the navy's carriers rotated through the area. In 1998 she operated in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch, the Anglo-Saudi- American enforcement of the no-fly-zone over Southern Iraq. In 2000 Illustrious led Task Group 342.1, a naval task force comprising HM ships ‚Äî , , , ‚Äî and numerous Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships in Operation Palliser, which was aimed at restoring peace and stability to Sierra Leone. A combat deployment for the ship took place in 2001. A large British exercise, Saif Sareea II took place in Oman in late 2001. During the exercise, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center took place. Illustrious remained in theatre while other elements of the task force returned to the United Kingdom. Illustrious had elements of the Royal Marines on board, ready for possible combat operations in Afghanistan. No deployment was made before Illustrious was relieved by Ocean in early 2002 and returned to Portsmouth after seven months at sea. 2003‚Äì2005 Illustrious undergoing maintenance at Portsmouth during 2005 In mid-2003, the ship underwent a further refit at Rosyth Dockyard. This refit involved the total rebuild of the ski jump, the adding of better communications and reconfiguring the ship so that it can be more quickly switched between the light aircraft carrier and helicopter carrier roles. The refit should have enable her to carry on until 2014, when it was expected that the first of the s would come into service. Illustrious returned to Portsmouth following the completion of the refit in December 2004. She was re-dedicated in 2005, and following the death of the ship's original sponsor Princess Margaret, her daughter Lady Sarah Chatto agreed to attend in a new role as \\"ship's friend\\". 2006 Illustrious along with helped in the evacuation of British citizens from Beirut as a result of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon crisis. Later that year, as part of the Royal Navy's Remembrance Day activities, Illustrious sailed up the River Thames on Friday 10 November 2006. She was moored at Wood Wharf, a few hundred yards upriver from the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, London, until Wednesday 15 November. Whilst there, the Falklands War commemorative events in 2007 were announced on board her. 2007 AV-8B Harriers are lined up with, at the rear, an MV-22 Osprey Illustrious in formation with United States Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carriers and on a Joint Task Force Exercise in the Atlantic Ocean, July 2007 Illustrious carried out two weeks of fixed wing flying serials exercises in the North Sea off Hartlepool in March 2007, during which seven GR9 Harriers from No. 4 Squadron RAF, Joint Force Harrier touched down on her flight-deck. Also during these exercises, seven of her crew had to be airlifted to hospital in Middlesbrough on 13 March suffering from fume inhalation and throat and eye irritation after an accident with chemicals in cleaning a junior ratings' toilet area. Illustrious sailed on to Portsmouth, where they rejoined her on leaving hospital. From 25 to 30 May 2007, after an exercise in the Baltic Sea, Illustrious was the first British aircraft carrier ever to visit Tallinn, Estonia. The visit provided rest for the ship's crew after the Baltic exercise, acted as a diplomatic visit, and also involved naval and air exercises with the Estonian Defence Forces. Next, in July 2007, Illustrious took part in a US-led Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFX) off the eastern coast of the United States (for which she hosted 14 US Harrier jets and 200 US Marines) before returning to Portsmouth the following month. On 10 July 2007, during the JTFX, a MV-22 Osprey landed aboard Illustrious, the first time a V-22 had landed on a non-U.S. vessel. 2008 The carrier set sail from Portsmouth on 21 January 2008 as head of the multi-national Task Group 328.01, under Operation Orion 08, which from January to May 2008 carried out exercises and diplomatic visits to twenty ports in the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East, and south-east Asia. However, on 23 January, whilst still off the coast of southern England, she sailed back to Portsmouth for repairs to a minor fault in a meat freezer. It was felt to be important to repair this before sailing to a warmer climate, and Navy spokesman Anton Hanney stated that flying in an emergency plumber whilst she was underway would be more expensive than turning back whilst Illustrious was still in the English Channel. She sailed back out at 1pm on 24 January and made up the lost 24 hours. Her ports of call included Valletta, Malta 26‚Äì29 February 2008. This 2008 assignment was filmed and shown on Channel 5 as the six part TV documentary Warship transmitted on Mondays from 19 May 2008. This documentary aimed to show life on board the aging carrier in much the same way that was shown in the 1976 series Sailor. Illustrious was commanded by Captain Steve Chick CBE BSc, who had also commanded during the 2005 BBC documentary Shipmates. By the end of July, she had returned to Portsmouth where Illustrious took part in the 2008 navy open-day. On board was a full size model of the F-35 Joint Combat Aircraft which will replace the Harriers then used by the ship. Illustrious was the only aircraft carrier to be part of the event, although the inactive was also visible to the public. On 17 October she, along with , sailed into Liverpool where she was open to the public on Saturday 18 October. On 4 November she moored at Greenwich, arriving to take central part in the Royal Navy's remembrance week with the F-35 mock-up still on deck. 2009 A V-22 Osprey landing on the rear flight deck of Illustrious in the Atlantic Ocean in 2007 On 7 May 2009 she returned to Greenwich to serve as the centre piece of the Royal Navy's celebration of a century of British naval aviation; on board were examples of all the Navy's operational helicopters. Beginning on 8 June, she took part in the exercise Loyal Arrow in northern Sweden. The exercise lasted until 16 June. On 17 June 2009, she arrived in Tallinn. On 27 June 2009 she was in the harbour of Oslo, Norway. On 22 October 2009 she arrived at Liverpool for a six-day visit and moored at the cruise terminal. There was a fly past along The River Mersey on 23 October as part of its celebrations to mark that year's centenary of naval aviation. Illustrious was open to members of the public on 25‚Äì26 October and departed Liverpool on 27 October 2009. 2010‚Äì2016 Illustrious (at rear) and HMS Bulwark near Harstad, Norway during Exercise Cold Response in 2012 Illustrious takes fuel from the French supply tanker during Exercise COUGAR 13 As part of Strategic Defence and Security Review, and in addition to the axing of the Harrier force and Illustriouss sister ship , it was announced that a short study would be carried out to determine whether Illustrious or Ocean was the most viable helicopter platform. The decision was subsequently made to retain Ocean for the longer term. In May 2011 Illustrious was made operational after a ¬£40 million refit, and she was handed back to the fleet after sea trials in late July 2011 She took over the helicopter carrier role while Ocean underwent a planned refit, due for completion by 2014; Illustrious was then withdrawn from service. The Ministry of Defence also announced on 12 September 2012 that Illustrious, as the last of the Invincible-class aircraft carriers, would be preserved as a memorial \\"in recognition of the service given by these ships in protecting the UK over the last 30 years\\". In March 2012, Illustrious took part in Exercise 'Cold Response' with , and other Royal Navy vessels. This was a NATO winter war games exercise conducted in northern Norway, where she tested her capabilities as a helicopter carrier. Illustrious was awarded the Bambara Trophy, the trophy is given to a unit each year with the best flight safety record, during 'Cold Response'. Following 'Cold Response' she then took part in Exercise 'Joint Warrior' with vessels from Norway, the Netherlands and the United States and Cougar 12 in the Mediterranean. In May 2013, as part of the 70th Anniversary of The Battle of the Atlantic Commemorations, Illustrious sailed up the River Thames and was moored at Greenwich where she was used as the venue for a charity reception in aid of the Royal Navy's aviation heritage. She was deployed as part of Exercise COUGAR 13 during the autumn of 2013 along with , , and six RFA vessels. She was diverted away from the COUGAR 13 task group in December 2013 to assist in Typhoon Haiyan disaster relief efforts in the Philippines and eventually returned to Portsmouth on 10 January 2014. Illustrious was briefly berthed at Rosyth in the first week of July 2014, in a dock adjacent to , which was formally named on 4 July 2014; Illustrious left Rosyth the following day and arrived back at HMNB Portsmouth on 22 July at the end of active service. By then the oldest operational RN warship, she was decommissioned at HMNB Portsmouth on 28 August 2014. The Royal Navy had hoped to preserve the ship, and in August 2014 it was reported that Kingston upon Hull and two other cities had submitted bids for her. However, these bids were judged to be unviable.

Adult males have pale cerulean blue and white upperparts with a black necklace across the breast and black streaks on the back and flanks. Females and immature birds have greyer or greenish upperparts, a pale stripe over the eye, and no streaking on the back and no neck. All of these birds have wing bars and a thin pointed bill. They are found in deciduous forests of eastern North America during the breeding season and then migrate to forested mountain areas in South America. The species is considered threatened with an IUCN status of near threatened, indicating it does not face any imminent threat of extinction in the wild. Description Adult males have pale cerulean blue upperparts and white underparts with a black necklace across the breast; they also have black streaks on the back and flanks. Females and immature birds have greyer or greenish upperparts, a pale stripe over the eye, and no streaking on the back and no necklace. All of these birds, regardless of their age, have wing bars and a thin pointed bill. Measurements: * Length: 4.3 in (11 cm) * Weight: 0.3-0.3 oz (8-10 g) * Wingspan: 7.9 in (20 cm) Distribution and habitat Their breeding habitats are mature deciduous forests in eastern North America. They migrate to spend the boreal winter in forested mountain areas in South America. Behaviour They forage actively high in trees, sometimes catching insects in flight. These birds mainly eat insects. Their nests are cup-shaped, and are placed on a horizontal branch high in a hardwood tree. The song is a buzzed accelerating zray zray zray zray zeeee. The call is called a slurred chip. Status and conservation The cerulean warbler is the fastest declining Neotropical migrant songbird. Among the many threats they face, their wintering habitat in the northern Andes is dwindling rapidly. Cerulean warblers depend on shade coffee plantations during the winter. This traditional farming technique is at risk as coffee prices fluctuate and pressure to switch to higher-yield sun coffee or other crops intensifies. In fragmented forest areas, this bird is vulnerable to nest parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird. This bird's numbers are declining faster than any other warbler species in the USA; its population in 2006 was less than one-fifth of what it was 40 years before.http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/12/cerulean_warbler.html The American Bird Conservancy (ABC) is working with its Colombian partner, Fundaci√≥n ProAves, to protect wintering habitat for cerulean warblers and other migrating songbirds. Together they have created the Cerulean Warbler Bird Reserve, the first protected area created for a neotropical migrant. In an effort to advance protection of the cerulean warbler, ABC and its South American partners (Fundacion ProAves, ECOAN and Fundacion Jocotoco), in 2009 produced a Cerulean Warbler Wintering Ground Conservation Plan. The cerulean warbler has been recorded as a vagrant to Iceland.√ûr√°insson, Gunnlaugur (1997) Palm Warbler and Cerulean Warbler in Iceland ‚Äì new to the Western Palearctic Birding World 10(10): 392‚Äì393 In art \\"Azure Warbler\\" in Birds of America John James Audubon illustrates the cerulean warbler in Birds of America (London, 1827‚Äì38) as Plate 48 where two birds are shown perched in a bear berry bush. The image was engraved and colored by Robert Havell's London workshops. The original watercolor by Audubon was purchased by the New-York Historical Society where it remains to this day (March 2009). Jonathan Franzen uses the cerulean warbler as a plot device in his 2010 novel, Freedom.

His maternal grandfather Casimir III the Great, the last king of Poland from the Piast dynasty, had no sons and brought him up at his court. After his grandfather's death in 1370, young Casimir initially became his partial successor, as the last will gave him lands of Dobrzy≈Ñ, Bydgoszcz, Kruszwica, Z≈Çot√≥w and Wa≈Çcz as fiefs.

Buchinger was especially noted for his micrography, in which illustrations consist of very small text. Biography Buchinger was born in Ansbach, Germany, without hands or lower legs. An artist and performer, he \\"traveled all over Northern Europe to entertain kings and aristocrats as well as hoi polloi with amazing feats of physical dexterity\\" and was known as ‚ÄúThe Greatest German Living‚Äù and \\"Little Man from Nuremberg\\". He travelled to England trying to get a court appointment with King George I; unsuccessful, he then moved to Ireland where he gave public demonstrations, in Dublin in 1720 and in Belfast in 1722. Buchinger was married four times and had at least 14 children (by eight women). He also is rumored to have had children by as many as 70 mistresses. Buchinger's fame was so widespread that in the 1780s the term \\"Buckinger's boot\\" existed in England as a euphemism for the vagina (because the only \\"limb\\" he had was his penis). Buchinger died in Cork, Ireland. The detailed writing embedded in the engraving Despite his having small, finlike appendages for hands, his engravings were incredibly detailed. One such engraving, a self-portrait, was so detailed that a close examination of the curls of his hair revealed that they were in fact seven biblical psalms and the Lord's Prayer, inscribed in miniature letters. Despite his handicap Buchinger was an accomplished magician, causing balls to disappear from under cups and birds to appear from nowhere. It also was said that he was unbeatable at cards and would dazzle audiences with his amazing displays of marksmanship. Buchinger liked to build ships in a bottle. He had tremendous dexterity, in spite of his disability. Buchinger's musical skills included the ability to play a half-dozen musical instruments including the dulcimer, hautboy, trumpet, and flute and several of his own invention.

Life He was the son of Thomas Godwin, Bishop of Bath and Wells, born at Hannington, Northamptonshire. He was the great uncle of the writer Jonathan Swift. He was elected student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1578, took his bachelor's degree in 1580, and that of master in 1583. After holding two Somerset livings he was in 1587 appointed subdean of Exeter. In 1590 he accompanied William Camden on an antiquarian tour through Wales. He was created bachelor of divinity in 1593, and doctor in 1595. In 1601 he published his Catalogue of the Bishops of England since the first planting of the Christian Religion in this Island, a work which procured him in the same year the diocese of Llandaff. A second edition appeared in 1615, and in 1616 he published an edition in Latin with a dedication to King James, who in the following year conferred upon him the bishopric of Hereford. The work was republished, with a continuation by William Richardson, in 1743. Godwin died, after a lingering illness, in April 1633 in Whitbourne, Herefordshire. Works In 1616 Godwin published Rerum Anglicarum, Henrico VIII., Edwardo VI. et Maria regnantibus, Annales, which was afterwards translated and published by his son Morgan under the title Annales of England (1630). He is also the author of a somewhat remarkable story, published posthumously in 1638, and entitled The Man in the Moone, or a Discourse of a Voyage thither, by Domingo Gonsales, written apparently some time in the 1620s. (On the date of composition, see John Anthony Butler's edition of The Man in the Moon [Dovehouse, 1995], pp. 14‚Äì15.) In this production Godwin not only declares himself a believer in the Copernican system, but adopts so far the principles of the law of gravitation as to suppose that weight decreases with distance from the Earth. The work, which displays considerable fancy and wit, influenced John Wilkins' The discovery of a world in the Moone. Both works were translated into French, and were imitated in several important particulars by Cyrano de Bergerac, from whom (if not from Godwin directly) Jonathan Swift obtained valuable hints in writing of Gulliver's voyage to Laputa. Another work of Godwin's, Nuncius inanimatus, published In Utopia, originally printed in 1629 and again in 1657, seems to have been the prototype of John Wilkins's Mercury, or the Secret and Swift Messenger, which appeared in 1641. Another work was De praesulibus Angliae (1616).

The city's population was 1,879,355 , making it the eighth most populous city in Brazil and the largest in Brazil's South Region. The Curitiba Metropolitan area comprises 26 municipalities with a total population of over 3.2 million (IBGE estimate in 2010), making it the seventh most populous metropolitan area in the country. The city sits on a plateau at above sea level. It is located west of the seaport of Paranagu√° and is served by the Afonso Pena International and Bacacheri airports. Curitiba is an important cultural, political, and economic center in Latin America and hosts the Federal University of Paran√°, established in 1912. In the 1700s Curitiba's favorable location between cattle-breeding countryside and marketplaces led to a successful cattle trade and the city's first major expansion. Later, between 1850 and 1950, it grew due to logging and agricultural expansion in Paran√° State (first Araucaria angustifolia logging, later mate and coffee cultivation and in the 1970s wheat, corn and soybean cultivation). In the 1850s, waves of European immigrants arrived in Curitiba, mainly Germans, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians, contributing to the city's economic and cultural development. Nowadays, only small numbers of immigrants arrive, primarily from Middle Eastern and other South American countries. Curitiba's biggest expansion occurred after the 1960s, with innovative urban planning that allowed the population to grow from some hundreds of thousands to more than a million people. Curitiba's economy is based on industry and services and is the fourth largest in Brazil. Economic growth occurred in parallel to a substantial inward flow of Brazilians from other parts of the country, as approximately half of the city's population was not born in Curitiba. Curitiba is one of the few Brazilian cities with a very high Human Development Index (0.856) and in 2010 it was awarded the Global Sustainable City Award, given to cities and municipalities that excel in sustainable urban development. According to US magazine Reader's Digest, Curitiba is the best \\"Brazilian Big City\\" in which to live. Curitiba's crime rate is considered low by Brazilian standards and the city is considered one of the safest cities in Brazil for youth. The city is also regarded as the best in which to invest in Brazil. Curitiba was one of the host cities of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and again for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Despite its good social indicators, the city has a higher unemployment rate than other cities in the state. Name Aerial view of Batel and √Ågua Verde neighborhoods One theory is that the name \\"Curitiba\\" comes from the Tupi words kur√≠ tyba, \\"many pine seeds\\" due to the large number of pinecones of Paran√° pines in the region prior to its founding.Fenianos, E. (2003) Almanaque Kur'yt'yba, Curitiba: Univer Cidade, p.6 Another version, also using words from the Tupi language, is that it originates in the combination of kurit (pine tree) and yba (large amount). The Portuguese, who founded a settlement on the site in 1693, named it \\"Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais\\" (Village of \\"Our Lady of the Light\\" of the Pines). The name was changed to \\"Curitiba\\" in 1721. Curitiba officially became a town in 1812, spelling its name as \\"Curityba.\\" An alternative spelling was \\"Coritiba.\\" This was used in press and state documents. A state decree in 1919 settled the dispute by adopting \\"Curitiba.\\" History Map of Curitiba in 1894 (Portuguese edition). At the end of the 17th century, Curitiba's agriculture was only for subsistence and its main economic activities were mineral extraction. Waves of European immigrants arrived after 1850, mainly Poles, Italians, Germans (mostly from Russia) and Ukrainians. Cattlemen drove their herds from Rio Grande do Sul to the state of S√£o Paulo, turning Curitiba into an important intermediate trading post. Nossa Senhora da Luz Cathedral and Downtown Curitiba in 1900. The Paranagu√°-Curitiba railroad was opened in 1885. Around the beginning of the 20th century, Curitiba benefited from the wealth of the yerba mate mills. The owners (known as \\"bar√µes da erva-mate\\") built mansions in the capital. These have mostly been preserved in the districts of Batel and Alto da Gl√≥ria. In the 1940s and 1950s, Alfred Agache, co-founder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce its first city plan. It emphasized a \\"star\\" of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. It was followed in part, but the plan was too expensive to complete. Geography=Climate Fog in the Botanical Garden. Curitiba has an always humid subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen: Cfb), with some characteristics of the oceanic climate due to its abundant precipitation all year round and the relatively warm, but not hot, summer. The city's mild winters, due to its low latitude, differentiate its climate from typically temperate ones. It is located on a plateau and the flat terrain with flooded areas contribute to its mild and damp winter, with an average minimum temperature of in the coldest month, occasionally falling below on the coldest nights. During summertime, the average temperature is around at daytime, but it can get above on the hottest days. Snowfall was experienced in 1889, 1892, 1912, 1928 (two days), 1942, 1955, 1957, 1962, 1975, 1988, 2013 and 2020. The terrain's flatness hinders water drainage after rain, therefore providing water vapor for the atmosphere. Cold fronts come year round, often from Antarctica and Argentina, bringing tropical storms in summer and cold winds in the winter. They can move very quickly, with no more than one day between the start of the southern winds and the start of rain. Curitiba's weather is also influenced by the dry air masses that dominate Brazil's midwest most of the year, bringing hot and dry weather, sometimes even in winter. Vegetation Frost in Curitiba. Botanical gardens greenhouse in Curitiba Curitiba is located in the area of the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (also known as Araucaria moist forests), a sub-type of the Atlantic Forest. In Curitiba it is possible to find steppes, forests and other formations. The local vegetation consists of remnants of the Paran√° (or Brazilian) pine (Araucaria angustifolia), which resisted the efforts of settlers. The Paran√° pines are in private and public areas and are protected from logging. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a botanical garden and three greenhouses that produce 150,000 native and exotic seedlings: 16,000 fruit trees, 260,000 flowers, foliage and underbrush specimens and the maintenance of another 350,000 seedlings. Curitiba's green area itself matches the size of other large Brazilian cities. The vegetation of Curitiba encompasses a large population of purple and yellow ip√™s (tabebuias), making a beautiful sight during flowering at winter's end. The yellow ip√™ is the city's most common tree. Hydrography Igua√ßu River, running by the south region of the city. The catchment area of Curitiba consists of rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers that form the city's watershed are: Atuba River, Bel√©m River, Barig√ºi River, Passa√∫na River, Ribeir√£o dos Padilhas and the Igua√ßu River, all with characteristics of dendritic drainage. Curitiba has been working since the 1970s on alternatives to minimize the negative impacts of urbanization on rivers. An example is the construction of parks along the rivers with artificial lakes, which absorb and retain water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods. After many studies of local water flows, most rivers were found to be subject to a canalization process. Other alternatives developed to minimize the negative effects of urbanization are the implementation of programs for environmental education, inspection and monitoring, elaboration and application of legislation and infrastructure works. Topography The Mountain Range of the Sea, \\"Serra do Mar.\\" The city covers on the First Plateau of Paran√°. Curitiba has a topography of smooth, rounded hills, giving it a relatively regular shape. The city has an average altitude of above sea level. The highest point is to the north at , and with lower altitudes at to the south. Mountain ranges and sets of rocky hills surround parts of the city, including the Serra do Mar, a hill range between the shore of the Atlantic Ocean and the First Plateau in Paran√°. Government The Curitiba City Hall , the mayor is Rafael Greca, who replaced Gustavo Fruet. The City Council of Curitiba has 38 councillors elected since 2004. Curitiba is divided into nine regional governments (equivalent to subprefecture), who manage the municipality's 75 districts. The Rua da Cidadania (\\"Street of Citizenship\\") is the symbol of administrative decentralization; it is a reference point and a meeting place. Several units are annexed to public transport terminals. Their nuclei offer services in the local, state and federal areas. Jaime Lerner is perhaps Curitiba's best-known mayor. He has been mayor three times, the first time in the early 1970s. His leadership was crucial to some major changes in the city. Curitiba has built parks instead of canals to reduce flooding; used parks to make the city more liveable; pedestrianised the downtown area; built a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), a bus system that works like a light rail system but is 10 times cheaper; and started a massive recycling scheme that included giving people bus tokens in return for waste. Time magazine listed this former mayor among the world's most influential thinkers of 2010. In the days before free direct elections, mayors were political appointees who were no more than pawns in the game of power politics and were subject to replacement at any time. For an idealistic young architect like Lerner, retaining the mayor's office was particularly precarious. Those holding the reins of power at the time were under the mistaken impression that Lerner's youth would make him easy to control. As it turned out, he was no milquetoast, and subsequently set about enthusiastically pursuing reform. Demographics Ukrainian descent celebrating Easter in Curitiba. According to the 2010 IBGE Census, 1,678,965 people resided in the city of Curitiba.2010 IGBE Census The census revealed 1,381,938 White people (78.9%), 294,127 Pardo (Multiracial) people (16.8%), 49,978 Afro-Brazilian people (2.9%), 23,138 Asian people (1.4%), 2,693 Amerindian people (0.2%).2010 IGBE Census In 2010, Curitiba was Brazil's 8th most populous city. In 2010, the city had 359,201 opposite-sex couples and 974 same-sex couples. The population of Curitiba was 52.3% female and 47.7% male. As with most of Southern Brazil's population, Curitiba is mostly inhabited by European descendants. The first Europeans to arrive were of Portuguese origin, during the 17th century. They intermarried with the native people and with the African slaves. Up until the 19th century, the inhabitants of the city of Curitiba were natives and mixed-race, Portuguese and Spanish immigrants. In 1808 foreigners were granted the right to ownership of land, and in 1853 Parana became an independent province, and these events resulted in a substantial number of immigrants from Europe. The first non-Iberian (Portuguese and Spaniard) immigrants to come to the city were German. The Memorial of Polish Immigration was inaugurated on 13 December 1980, after the visit of Pope John Paul II in June. Its area is and was part of the former Candles plant. The seven wooden log houses are parts of this memorial area, as a memento of the Polish immigrants' struggles and faith. Objects like an old wagon, pipe of cabbage and a print of the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa (patron saint of the Polish people), form parts of the memorial. The first group of Poles arrived in Curitiba around 1871. Curitiba has the biggest colony of Polish immigrants in Brazil. Italian immigrants started arriving in Brazil in 1875 and in Curitiba in 1878, coming mainly from the Veneto and Trento regions of Northern Italy. They settled mostly in the Santa Felicidade neighborhood, still a centre of the Italian community. Nearly 20,000 Ukrainian immigrants settled there between 1895 and 1897, consisting mostly of peasants from Galicia who emigrated to Brazil to become farmers. Around 300,000 Ukrainian- Brazilians live in Paran√°. The State of Paran√° has the largest Ukrainian community and Slavic community. Curitiba has a Jewish communityJews of Brazil site Source listing Curitiba as one of the important Jewish communities.

In 1937 with the rise of Nazi Germany, notable German Jewish academics migrated to Brazil, some settling in Curitiba.A research paper about the Jewish immigration to Brazil during the second world war. Physicist C√©sar Lattes and former mayors Jaime Lerner and Saul Raiz were Jewish. A Holocaust memorial is present in the city. The community centre, a Jewish school, a Chabad house (Beit Chabad), a synagogue,Israel Synagogue in addition to the Hevra Kadisha Synagogue and the Habad Synagogue mentioned in the Chabad reference and two Jewish cemeteries are there,Jewish Genealogy site lists cemeteries. one of which was defiled in 2004. Japanese immigrants began arriving in 1915, with a larger contingent arriving in 1924. Curitiba received a significant Japanese influx. They settled mostly between Paran√° and S√£o Paulo state. The city has the second largest Japanese community in Brazil, behind only S√£o Paulo, according to IBGE. Although both cities have around the same proportion of Japanese descendants, other large cities in the countryside, such as Maring√° and Londrina, have an even higher rate. Some estimates suggest that more than 40,000 Japanese-Brazilians live in Curitiba. Religion According to the 2010 Brazilian Census, most of the population (62.36%) is Roman Catholic, other religious groups include Protestants or evangelicals (24.03%), Spiritists (2.8%), Nones 6.71%, and people with other religions (3.69).¬´As capitais mais (e menos) evang√©licas do Brasil¬ª.

Since it was declared capital of the State of Paran√° in 1853, the city has gone through several major urban planning projects to avoid uncontrolled growth and thus has become an international role model in dealing with issues including transportation and the environment.Curitiba Economy ‚Äì FIFA report The city is Brazil's second largest car manufacturer. Its economy is based on industry, commerce and services. For that reason, Curitiba is considered by many investors to be the best location for investment in Brazil. The city receives more than two million tourists every year. Most arrive via Afonso Pena International Airport, where almost 60,000 flights land annually. According to IPEA data, the GDP in 2006 was 32 billion reals, without including agriculture and livestock (0.03%). Industry represented 34.13% and the commerce and service sectors 65.84%. Cidade Industrial de Curitiba, the industrial district, is home to many multinational industries, such as Nissan, Renault, Volkswagen, Philip Morris, Audi, Volvo, HSBC, Siemens, ExxonMobil, Electrolux and Kraft Foods, as well as many well-known national industries, such as Sadia, O Botic√°rio and Positivo Inform√°tica. Curitiba's infrastructure makes bus travel fast and convenient, effectively creating demand for bus use in the same way that the infrastructure of traditional cities creates demand for private motor vehicles. In July 2001, Curitiba became Brazil's first city to receive the prize \\"Pole of Information Technology\\", granted by InfoExame magazine. According to the magazine, the companies of \\"Technology and Information Technology\\" based in Curitiba in 2001 achieved in revenues, representing a growth of 21% over the previous year. Esta√ß√£o Mall. The city's 30-year economic growth rate is 7.1%, higher than the national average of 4.2%, and per capita income is 66% higher than the Brazilian average. Between 1975 and 1995, Curitiba's domestic product grew by some 75% more than the entire State of Paran√°, and 48% more than Brazil as a whole. In 1994, tourism generated , 4% of the city's net income. Curitiba has municipal health, education and day care networks, neighborhood libraries shared by schools and citizens and Citizenship Streets, where buildings provide essential public services, sports and cultural facilities near transportation terminals. At the Open University, residents can take courses in subjects such as mechanics, hair styling and environmental protection for a small fee. Policies for job creation and income generation became part of the city's strategic planning in the 1990s, for the metropolitan area as well as the city. The \\"Pa√ßo Municipal\\" built in 1916. Since 1990, the Municipal Housing Fund has provided financial support to housing for lower income populations. After national housing finance collapsed in 1985, just as people from the countryside poured into Curitiba, the city's public housing program bought one of the few remaining large plots of land, \\"Novo Bairro\\" (New Neighborhood), as home for 50,000 families. While landowners built the houses themselves, each received a pair of trees and an hour's consultation with an architect to help them develop their plan. COHAB also built Technology Street, an avenue of 24 homes in the centre of Novo Bairro, each built using different construction techniques. Seven massive shopping malls are found in Curitiba: Mueller, Esta√ß√£o, Curitiba, Crystal, Palladium, Patio Batel and Park Barig√ºi. The Rua das Flores (Street of Flowers) is home to the majority of stores. The area is pedestrianized, with no cars around the centre. An essential element of Curitiba shopping is the Feira do Largo da Ordem, or Largo da Ordem Street Fair. In 2008, according to IBGE Curitiba's nominal GDP was (or about of ) (with , or , by nominal GDP per capita, about of more than Brazilian 2008 nominal GDP per capita), making it the fourth richest city in the country, after only S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and the capital Bras√≠lia. Curitiba is the 2nd Pole on Technological Innovation in Brazil, according to IPEA (Applied Economic Research Institute). The 2nd Brazil's Best City for Business and 5th South American Best City for Business, according to America Economia Magazine/2005 and 2006.

These lighthouses are free educational centres that include libraries, Internet access and other cultural resources. Libraries work with municipal schools, offering a collection of approximately 5000 books, and provide cultural reference and leisure. Among Brazilian capitals, Curitiba has the highest literacy rate, and ranks number 1 in education among the Brazilian capitals. Urban planning 24 Hours Street. Curitiba has a planned transportation system, which includes lanes on major streets devoted to a bus rapid transit system. The buses are split into three sections (bi-articulated) and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with access for disabled riders. Buses charge one price regardless of distance.Jonas Rabinovitch and Josef Leitman, \\"Urban Planning in Curitiba\\", Scientific American, vol. 274, no. 3 (March 1996), pp. 46‚Äì53 The city preserves and cares for its green areas, boasting of green space per inhabitant. In the 1940s and 1950s, Alfred Agache, cofounder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a star of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. The plan was too expensive to complete. By the 1960s, Curitiba's population had reached 430,000. Some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to damage the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect Jaime Lerner, who later became mayor, led a team from the Universidade Federal do Paran√° that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl, reduced traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba's Historic Sector and a convenient and affordable public transit system.About Curitiba This plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed XV de Novembro St. to vehicles, because it had high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This used two one-way streets moving in opposite directions that surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have an exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges on the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density development, to pull traffic away from the main roads. In a number of areas subject to floods, buildings were condemned and the land became parks.Parks of Curitiba and floods Today, Curitiba is considered one of the world's best examples of urban planning.Iraz√°bal, Clara Elena (2002) Curitiba and Portland: Architecture, City Making, and Urban Governance in the Era of Globalization, PhD Dissertation in Architecture, University of California, Berkeley, p.112 In June 1996, the chairman of the Habitat II summit of mayors and urban planners in Istanbul praised Curitiba as \\"the most innovative city in the country.\\" 15 November Street. Curitiba was recently recommended by UNESCO as a model for the reconstruction of the cities of Afghanistan. In the 1980s, the RIT (Rede Integrada de Transporte, Integrated Transport Network) was created. At the same time, the city began building the \\"Far√≥is de Saber\\" (Lighthouses of Knowledge) educational centres. The city has more than of public parks and forests. In 2007, the city placed third in a list of \\"15 Green Cities\\" in the world, according to Grist magazine, after Reykjav√≠k in Iceland and Portland, Oregon in the United States. As a result, according to one survey, 99% of Curitibans are happy with their hometown. Jaime Lerner suggests urban acupuncture as the future solution for contemporary urban issues; focusing on very narrow pressure points in cities, can create positive ripple effects. Urban \\"acupuncture\\" reclaims land for the public and emphasizes the importance of community development through small interventions in design of cities.Urban Acupuncture ‚Äì Understanding Space 2011 It emphasises pinpoint interventions that can be accomplished quickly to create a make an immediate impact.Curitiba: Jaime Lerner‚Äôs Urban Acupuncture ‚Äì Bill Hinchberger, Brazilmax 2/2006 The \\"capacity building job line\\" was created to accelerate economic development. Key initiatives include the South- Circular bus line, which links the southern and eastern regions of town; Entrepreneurial \\"Sheds\\", business incubators designed to help small companies get established and prosper; and the Crafts Lyc√©e, which trains people for professions such as marketing and finance. Specifically, the goal is to provide jobs and income for the unemployed among 400,000 people living in 15 peripheral towns, and to structure and develop the region according to integrated planning principles. About 15,000 new jobs were generated by 2013. According to Jonas Rabinovitch, a United Nations senior adviser and former planner at the Curitiba Research and Urban Planning Institute (IPPUC), up to 8% of Curitiba's population still lived in favelas as of 2016. According to 2010 census data collected by IBGE, 49700 homes in Curitiba form part of irregular settlements. This is equivalent to 163300 people. The population growth of favelas was 12.4% between 2000 and 2010, higher than the population in general (10.3%). The transit service is used by more than 2 million people a day. Curitiba has more car owners per capita than anywhere else in Brazil. The population has doubled since 1974, yet auto traffic declined by 30%, and atmospheric pollution is the lowest in Brazil. Culture Musicians in Feirinha do largo da ordem. In January 1973 the Funda√ß√£o Cultural de Curitiba was set up, with the aim of promoting culture. Wire Opera House. The Cultural Complex Solar do Bar√£o features the Photography Museum, the Engravings Museum and the Posters Museu. The MuMA ‚Äì Museu Metropolitano de Arte (Museum of Metropolitan Art) displays artists from the state of Paran√° as well as renowned Brazilian painters such as Pancetti, Guignard and Di Cavalcanti The Polish Immigrants Memorial, also known as The Pope's Woods, offers an enjoyable area surrounded by trees, which makes it a perfect choice for a stroll. The Pope himself blessed the first replica of the traditional Polish houses that beautifully make up the Bosque do Papa when he visited the city in 1980. In 2003, Curitiba received the \\"American Capital of Culture\\" title, granted by the OAS (Organization of American States). Museum of Contemporary Art of Paran√°. Arts and entertainment Curitiba was Brazil's first city to have an IMAX movie theatre. Curitiba has many theaters. The largest and most important one is the Gua√≠ra Theater. Every year, in April, it hosts the Curitiba Theater Festival. Museums Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer designed the extravagant state museum of Curitiba. Its design includes a gravity-defying construction that was intended to look like a Paran√° Pine, one of the city's symbols, but is widely interpreted by locals as an eye, which gave the Museum its nickname ‚Äì Museu do Olho, or Museum of the Eye. In keeping with Curitiba's history and culture of science, the museum offers many science exhibitions, including biennial exhibitions. The Curitiba museum includes the Oscar Niemeyer auditorium. * Museu Paranaense (\\"Paranaense Museum\\") ‚Äì dedicated to arts and history; * Oscar Niemeyer Museum ‚Äì the largest museum of South America, dedicated to plastic arts; * Museu de Arte Sacra (\\"Religious Art Museum\\") ‚Äì the focus is Christian art; * Museu do Expedicion√°rio (\\"Museum of the Expeditionary\\") ‚Äì dedicated to Brazilian participation in World War II; * Museu de Arte Contempor√¢nea (\\"Museum of Contemporary Art\\"); * Museu da Imagem e do Som (\\"Image and Sound Museum\\") ‚Äì about cinema and photography; * Museu Metropolitano de Arte de Curitiba (\\"Metropolitan Museum of Art in Curitiba\\") ‚Äì modern art; * Museu de Hist√≥ria Natural (\\"Natural History Museum\\") ‚Äì biology and botany. * Museu do Holocausto (\\"Holocaust Museum\\") Festivals Curitiba has yearly festivals related to arts, such as Curitiba Theatre Festival and the Music Workshop of Curitiba.

The four Matsuri set in Curitiba are: Imin Matsuri (Japanese: ÁßªÊ∞ëÁ•≠„Çä, \\"Immigration Festival\\") which celebrates the arrival of Japanese immigrants in Brazil, Haru Matsuri (Japanese: Êò•Á•≠„Çä, \\"Spring Festival\\") which celebrates the end of winter and coming of spring, Hana Matsuri (Japanese: Ëä±Á•≠„Çä, \\"Flower Festival\\"), which celebrates the birth of Sakyamuni, and Seto Matsuri (\\"Seto Festival\\"), in honor of Cl√°udio Seto, comic artist, precursor of the manga in Brazil and idealist of the first Matsuri in Curitiba. Curitiba also hold the famous Psycho Carnival, a three-day festival that happens during the Brazilian Carnival, but devoted to psychobilly and rockabilly genres, attracting people from all over the world. In the same occasion the Zombie Walk also happens. The 2016 edition took more than 20.000 people to the streets. UN Convention on Biodiversity On 20‚Äì31 March 2006 the Convention on biodiversity took place in Pinhais (a city near Curitiba), addressing items of the 1993 Convention on Biological Diversity adopted by 188 countries. Transportation tube-shaped bus stops in Curitiba. The orange taxis of Curitiba. Public transport Curitiba's public transportation consists entirely of buses. It opened the world's second bus rapid transit (BRT) system, Rede Integrada de Transporte, in 1974. The popularity of Curitiba's BRT has effected a modal shift from automobile travel to bus travel. Based on 1991 traveler survey results, it was estimated that the introduction of the BRT had caused a reduction of about 27 million auto trips per year, annually saving about 27 million liters of fuel. In particular, 28 percent of BRT riders previously traveled by car. Compared to eight other Brazilian cities of its size, Curitiba uses about 30 percent less fuel per capita, resulting in one of the country's lowest rates of ambient air pollution. Some 1,100 buses make 12,500 trips every day, serving more than 1.3 million passengers, 50 times the number from 20 years ago. Eighty percent of travelers use the express or direct bus services. Curitibanos spend only about 10 percent of their income on travel, much below the national average. The city government has been planning to introduce an underground metro for a number of years and in 2014 announced opened tenders for a 35-year public private partnership contract to build and operate a , 14-station north‚Äìsouth line. The cost is estimated at 4.62 billion reais. Roads Moving around in a car can be difficult in and around the city centre because of the many one-way streets and frequent traffic jams. The Trinary Road System allows quick access to the city centre for drivers. Some avenues are spacious and laid out in a grid. Apart from some points around the city centre, Munhoz da Rocha Street and Batel Avenue, traffic jams are not severe. Air Aerial view of Afonso Pena International Airport. Afonso Pena International Airport is Curitiba's main airport. It is located in the nearby city of S√£o Jos√© dos Pinhais.

A number of top stars in mixed martial arts are Curitiba natives, including the Rua brothers Maur√≠cio \\"Shogun\\" and Murilo \\"Ninja\\", Wanderlei Silva, Anderson Silva, and women's MMA pioneer Cris Cyborg. Much of the city's success in MMA comes from it hosting the influential Chute Boxe Academy and its successor Universidade da luta. Neighborhoods Map of Curitiba, with the neighborhoods and boroughs. :See also: Most districts of Curitiba were born of colonial groups, formed by families of European immigrants in the second half of the nineteenth century. The centro (downtown or central business district), where the city was founded, is the most bustling area, housing most of the financial institutions of Curitiba. Bairros (neighborhoods) of Curitiba define the city's geographical divisions. Administrative powers are not delegated to neighborhoods, although neighborhood associations work to improve their communities. Curitiba is divided into 9 regional governments (boroughs) covering the 75 neighborhoods. Civic Center (In Portuguese: Centro C√≠vico) is where the main government buildings are located. It was the first neighborhood in the municipality of Curitiba, capital of the state of Paran√°. The name means 'Center of the Citizen', or with a more direct interpretation, 'center where the subjects related to the citizen are solved'. It was conceived in 1953, with the greater independence which came with the creation of a new state. In August 2011, the Civic Center was listed as an urban and architectural ensemble. The buildings on the central axis of Avenida C√¢ndido de Abreu are protected, including Plaza 19 de Dezembro, Tiradentes State College, Courts of Justice, Accounts and Jury buildings, the Igua√ßu Palace, the Oscar Niemeyer Museum and the Square Our Lady of Salette.

He was the patroon of Van Cortlandt Manor and was on the governor's executive council from 1691 to 1700. He was the first resident of Sagtikos Manor in West Bay Shore on Long Island, which was built around 1697. A number of his descendants married English military leaders and Loyalists active in the American Revolution, and their descendants became prominent members of English society.  Early life  Stephanus van Cortlandt was born on May 7, 1643, the son of Captain Olof Stevense van Cortlandt. His father had been born at Wijk bij Duurstede, in the Dutch Republic, and in 1637 arrived in New Amsterdam. Beginning as a soldier and bookkeeper, Olof Stevense van Cortland rose to high office in the colonial service of the Dutch West India Company, serving many terms as burgomaster and alderman before dying in 1684. His mother was Anna (\\"Annetje\\") Loockermans van Cortlandthttp://flemishamerican.blogspot.com/2011/03/anna-loockermans-flemish- mother-of.html (born Turnhout March 17, 1618) who may have been the person who began the custom of Santa Claus in America.http://flemishamerican.blogspot.com/search/label/Santa%20Claus His parents had four children: Stephanus van Cortlandt (1643 ‚Äì1700); Jacobus van Cortlandt (1658‚Äì1739), who married Eva de Vries Philipse (born 1660); Maria van Cortlandt, who married Jeremias van Rensselaer (1632‚Äì1674); and Catherine van Cortlandt, who married firstly Johannes Derval and secondly, after his death, Frederick Philipse (1626‚Äì1702), the first lord of Philipsborough Manor. Philipse was previously married to Margaret Hardenbroeck (1637‚Äì1691) and during that marriage, had adopted her daughter, Eva de Vries (born 1660), who thus took the name of Philipse. Eva's father and Margaret's first husband was Peter Rudolphus de Vries (died 1661). Career In 1668, he was appointed ensign of one of the militia companies of New York City. In 1677, he was appointed mayor of New York City, at the age of thirty-four, becoming the first mayor of New York City who had been born in America. He was reportedly appointed due to his intelligence, and social position in the community, as he was appointed by the English Governor. During his time in office, he remained an adherent of the aristocratic party, especially during the Leisler affair from 1689 to 1691. When Delanoy, the Leisler candidate, was elected to the mayoralty, in place of Van Cortland, the latter refused to deliver up the city seal. It has been said that when a committee came to his home, his wife shut the door in their faces.Sketches of the Mayors of New York Personal life Van Cortlandt married Gertruj van Schuyler (b. 4 February 1654), the daughter of Philip Pieterse Schuyler (1628‚Äì1683) and the sister of Pieter Schuyler, a colonial governor of New York and mayor of Albany. They lived at the \\"Waterside,\\" on the present line of Pearl street, near Broad, where he engaged in business as a merchant. Together, they had: *Margaretta van Cortlandt (1674‚Äì?), who married Judge Samuel Bayard (1669-?), the son of Nicholas Bayard (1644‚Äì1707) and descendant from the Stuyvesant family.

The scheme can supply a maximum power of and has a storage capacity of around .  Purpose  The scheme was built at a time when responsibility for electricity generation in England and Wales was in the hands of the government's Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB); with the purpose of providing peak capacity, very rapid response, energy storage and frequency control. Dinorwig's very rapid response capability significantly reduced the need to hold spinning reserve on part loaded thermal plant. When the plant was conceived the CEGB used low efficiency old coal and oil fired capacity to meet peaks in demand. More efficient 500 MW thermal sets were introduced in the 1960s, initially for baseload operation only. Dinorwig could store cheap energy produced at night by low marginal cost plant and then generate during times of peak demand, so displacing low efficiency plant during peak demand periods. There were plans for a pumped storage facility near Exmoor but it was not built. With the increase of renewables such as wind and solar power, the need for storage is expected to increase to deal with intermittency.\\"Understanding the Balancing Challenge\\" Imperial College London, August 2012.

Today, Dinorwig is operated not only to help meet peak loads but also as a short term operating reserve (STOR), providing a fast response to short-term rapid changes in power demand or sudden loss of power stations. In a common scenario (known as TV pickup), the end of a popular national television programme or advertising breaks in commercial television programmes results in millions of consumers switching on electric kettles in the space of a few minutes, leading to overall demand increases of up to 2800 MW. In anticipation of this surge, an appropriate number of units at Dinorwig (or other services competing for National Grid Reserve Service duty) may be brought on line as the closing credits start to roll. The monitoring of popular television channels is an important factor in electricity grid control centres. Financial case In Britain's open energy market the financial justification for pumped hydro-electric storage (PHES) is hard to quantify. Arbitrage allows PHES operators to charge high prices for energy supplied at short notice when demand is high but studies suggest that revenue from sales alone, even at peak prices, does not warrant the initial investment; projections for similar projects indicate a payback time of up to forty years. Additionally, however, Dinorwig PHES receives a steady income for maintaining a permanent on-call capacity for urgent frequency regulation; in 2016 this was approximately ¬£10.8 million.  Construction  The scheme was constructed in the abandoned Dinorwic slate quarry. To preserve the natural beauty of Snowdonia National Park, the power station itself is located deep inside the mountain Elidir Fawr, inside tunnels and caverns. The project ‚Äì begun in 1974 and taking ten years to complete at a cost of ¬£425 millionDinorwig ‚Äì The Electric Mountain, Elaine Williams, A National Grid Publication, 1991 ‚Äì was the largest civil engineering contract ever awarded by the UK government at the time. The work was undertaken by an Alfred McAlpine / Brand / Zschokke consortium.Gray, p. 14 Twelve million tonnes (12,000,000 long tons; 13,000,000 short tons) of rock had to be moved from inside the mountain, creating tunnels wide enough for two lorries to pass comfortably and an enormous cavern tall, long, and wideInternational Power known as \\"the concert hall\\". The power station comprises of tunnels, one million tons of concrete, 200,000 tons of cement and 4,500 tons of steel. The scheme paid for itself within two years. The power station is connected to the National Grid substation at Pentir by 400 kV cables that are buried for approximately , rather than using transmission towers or pylons to transmit the electricity across an area of outstanding natural beauty. A 50 MW pumped storage facility at nearby Glyn Rhonwy in disused slate pits was approved in 2013, with an expected cost of ¬£120m. As at 2019 this project has reached the \\"detailed engineering design\\" stage.  Operation  Elidir Fawr with Marchlyn Mawr at right Looking down on the power station from the slate trail above Water is stored at above sea level in Marchlyn Mawr reservoir. When power needs to be generated, water from the reservoir is sent down through the turbines into Llyn Peris, which is at approximately . Water is pumped back from Llyn Peris to Marchlyn Mawr during off-peak times. Although it uses more energy to pump the water up than is generated on the way down, pumping is generally done when electricity is cheaper and generation when it is more expensive. The power station comprises six 300 MW GEC generator/motors coupled to Francis-type reversible turbines. The generators are vertical-shaft, salient-pole, air-cooled units each having 12 electromagnetic poles weighing 10 tonnes each, producing a terminal voltage of 18 kV; synchronous speed is 500 rpm. From standstill, a single 450-tonne generator can synchronise and achieve full load in approximately 75 seconds. With all six units synchronised and spinning-in-air (water is dispelled by compressed air and the unit draws a small amount of power to spin the shaft at full speed), 0 MW to 1800 MW load can be achieved in approximately 16 seconds.First Hydro webpage Once running, at full flow, the station can provide power for up to six hours before running out of water. The energy storage capacity of the station is approximately 9.1 GWh. At peak output water flows through the generators at 390 cubic metres per second (about the volume of a 25m swimming pool every second). Another important feature of Dinorwig is that it has been designed to assist restarting the National Grid on the occasion of a complete power failure (a black start). It includes diesel generators and large batteries which would allow the plant to restart even in the event of a complete shutdown of the grid (Dinorwig is not unique in this respect as some fossil-fuel plants are also able to self-start). The plant runs on average at 74‚Äì76% efficiency. It fills an important need in the system by responding to sudden surges in electricity demand because of its rapid ability to deliver power on load spikes. One of the alternatives would be to have spare capacity from conventional power stations running part loaded (\\"spinning reserve\\"), hence at lower efficiency than otherwise, and thus capable of being rapidly run up to full load. Other forms of power plant compete in this market for reserve power such as gas turbines and diesel generators for the National Grid Reserve Service. Excess water overflows to Llyn Padarn and is lost from the reservoir system. Both Llyn Peris and Llyn Padarn were ancestral homes to the Arctic char, a rare fish in the United Kingdom. When the scheme was commissioned, a fish rescue was undertaken to transfer the char from Llyn Peris to other local suitable lakes and it is believed that due to the very variable water levels in Llyn Peris, Arctic char are now absent from the lake. The power station is also promoted as a tourist attraction, with visitors able to take a minibus trip from \\"Electric Mountain\\" - the name of its nearby visitor centre - to see the workings inside the power station; 132,000 people visited the attraction in 2015.

Each of the three positions shot during the match has a fixed time limit that the shooter is able to shoot unlimited numbers of sighting shots and 10 or 20 shots for record. In qualification rounds, shots are scored as integers, so each shot scores from 0-10 with no decimal points, while in finals shots are scred as decimal values (i.e. 9.8 instead of what would have been a 9 under integer scoring.) The center of the bullseye is commonly the 10 and the score drops points as it distances from the center. It is up to the organization's discretion to score using outside ring or inside ring scoring. Outside ring scoring measures what ring the hole breaks and measures accordingly. Inside ring scoring scores by determining whether the hole breaks the inside line of the bullseye. Standard 50m target: total √ò = 154.4 mm. 4 ring √ò = 106.4 mm. 9 ring √ò = 26.4 mm. 10 ring √ò = 10.4 mm  Types of three positions matches  The International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) recognizes four three position events. Two of these events, both called 50 m Rifle, are shot in the Olympics, one for men, the other for women. The two Olympic events are shot with a rimfire rifle at 50m. The two three position events not in the Olympics, 300 m Rifle and 300 m Standard Rifle, are shot with a centerfire rifle at a distance of 300m. For the Olympic events, up until the 2016 Olympics Games, men would shoot a 3 X 40, or rather 40 shots in prone, 40 shots in standing, and 40 shots in kneeling, and women a 3 X 20, 20 shots in each position. This is considered the qualification round, and shots are scored as integers. In January 2018, these rules were changed so that men and women now both shoot a 3x40. The maximum qualification score is 1200. This will first be seen in the Olympic Games in 2020. Following the qualification round, the top eight shooters participate in a final. Previously, this would consist of an additional 10 shots in the standing position, with the winner of the match being the shooter with the highest aggregate in both the qualification round and the final. However, in 2013 a new finals format was introduced, still for the top eight shooters in the qualification round. Both men and women shoot an additional 45 shots - 15 in each position - and qualification scores are discarded. The 15 shots in kneeling position come first, followed by the 15 prone shots, then once 10 standing shots have been fired, the two lowest-ranking shooters are eliminated, then after every single shot thereafter the lowest-ranked shooter is again eliminated until the 15th shot decides the gold and silver medallists. The two non-Olympic 300m three position events are shot historically by men only. The first course of fire is with a free rifle, for a 3 X 40. The second course of fire is with a standard rifle, for a 3 X 20. Neither of these events have a final. The 300m events are no longer in the Olympics primarily due to the price of constructing a 300m range. In the United States, a coalition of the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP), USA Shooting, JROTC, 4-H, and the American Legion recognize three position events for juniors using air rifles. The course of fire is a 3 X 20, or 3 X 10, depending on the organization and location, with the top eight shooters competing in a final. The winner is again the shooter with the highest aggregate between the qualification round and the final. In most cases junior shooting is done at either 10m or 50 ft. distances. The CMP manages these matches for the National Three-Position Air Rifle Council, and recognizes the best junior shooters via the Distinguished program.  Shooting a three Position Match  At the beginning of a standard match the range officer will go over the rules of the range and the competition. They will state the course of fire and any change over times. In between each string of shooting the range will generally give about 10-minute change over time to get ready for the next position. During this time shooters can get their spotting scope set up, adjust rifle butt plates, or anything else without handling or shouldering the rifle. In addition to this time the range officer may also give a three- minute prep time for shooters to shoulder their rifle and do their last changes before the string starts. When the range officer gives the command to commence firing the timer is started for the match being shot. Shooters start by shooting sighting shots to ensure the rifle is sighted in and boost the confidence of the shooter. Shooters use a simple spotting scope to review their shots and adjust accordingly. The scopes come very useful for seeing any patterns with their shots or any missed bulls eyes. When the shooter has finished shooting all the shots for record they must wait for the range officer instructions to begin preparing for the next position.  Types  The kneeling, prone and standing positions all are equally as important when shooting a three position match. Each count for the same number of points and have specific guidelines for each position. In ISSF three position matches, the first position is kneeling, followed by prone and then standing.  Kneeling  Kneeling and Standing Position The first position in a three positions match is the kneeling position. Shooters generally use a kneeling roll and place it under the rear foot while aiming downrange. They sit on their rear foot and the other foot is pointed downrange. Shooters are allowed to use a sling just like the prone position. This sling is extremely important for creating a stable position. For many shooters kneeling begins as a struggle. With practice each shooter finds different keys for their position to make the most comfortable and stable position. There is a great fluctuation in scores and often depends on the stability and comfort of the shooters position.  Prone  Prone Position The prone position comes second in the match and is often the first learned shooting position. The prone position is the easiest to master and is often is easy to sight in rifles using this position due to its stability. The added stability that this position gives the shooter makes this position, in most cases, the easiest to learn and typically is the highest scoring string of the match. Shooters are able to use a ‚Äúsling‚Äù to support the rifle. The sling is a belt like device that goes around the non-shooting bicep and wraps around the wrist and attaches to the handstop of the rifle. This gives support so the sling holds up the weight instead of your arms.  Standing  The standing position is the final part of the three position match. This position is the hardest to master in most cases. Most competitors have a standing stand that they rest the rifle on then pick up to aim down range. The standing position is a freestanding position. For more stability it is common for shooters to place a fist or grip the rifle near or under the trigger guard and place their forearm against their body. Natural point of aim is especially crucial in this position. Natural point of aim is where your body is naturally aiming at while aiming downrange. If shooters fight their natural point of aim it is very difficult to stay stable and make a good shot. There are many tricks for finding a shooters natural point of aim and can be very difficult to teach to new shooters.

Toxteth is located to the south of Liverpool city centre, bordered by Aigburth, Canning, Dingle, and Edge Hill. The area was originally part of a royal park and known as Toxteth Park. It remained predominantly rural up until the 18th century. Toxteth was then developed during this time and into the 19th century, mainly as a residential area to accommodate the increasing working-class community centred on Liverpool following the Industrial Revolution. The Welsh Streets in Toxteth were constructed in the mid-19th century to accommodate this demand. Immigration continued into the 20th century, resulting in a significant number of ethnic minority communities in the area. Toxteth was badly hit by economic stagnation and unemployment in the late 1970s, culminating in riots in July 1981. Although attempts have been made to regenerate the area and improve living standards, significant problems with unemployment and crime remain into the 21st century. Many Victorian properties in the area continue to lie derelict awaiting redevelopment. Description The district lies within the borders of the ancient township of Toxteth Park. Industry and commerce are confined to the docks on its western border and a few streets running off Parliament Street. Toxteth is primarily residential, with a mixture of old terraced housing, post-World War II social housing and a legacy of large Victorian houses. In the 18th and 19th centuries, as Liverpool expanded the ancient park of Toxteth was gradually urbanised. Large Georgian houses were built in the Canning area, followed in the Victorian era by more grand houses, especially along the tree-lined Prince's Road/Avenue boulevard and around Prince's Park. The district quickly became home to the wealthy merchants of Liverpool, alongside a much larger poor population in modest Victorian terraces. Now, some of these streets of terraces are boarded up, awaiting demolition. Two of the city's largest parks, Sefton Park and Princes Park, are located in or around Toxteth. The earlier Princes Park was laid out by Richard Vaughan Yates around 1840, intending it to be used as open space, funded by the grand houses to be constructed around its edge, as would later happen with Sefton Park. Sefton Park was created by the Corporation of Liverpool in 1872, inspired partly by Birkenhead Park, across the River Mersey. Sefton Park has a large glass Palm House, which contains a statue of William Rathbone V unveiled in 1887, and originally had many other features including an aviary and an open-air theatre. History=Toponymy There is some ambiguity as to the origin of the name. One theory is that the etymology is \\"Toki's landing- place\\". However, Toxteth is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, and at this time, it appears as \\"Stochestede\\", i.e. \\"the stockaded or enclosed place\\", from the Anglo-Saxon stocc \\"stake\\" and Anglo-Saxon stede \\"place\\" (found in many English placenames, usually spelled stead). The manor Before the time of the Norman conquest, Toxteth was divided into two manors of equal size. One was owned by Bernulf and the other by Stainulf. After the conquest, part was granted by Count Roger of Poitou to the ancestor of the Earl of Sefton. From this time to about 1604, the land formed part of West Derby forest. The boundaries of the manor are described in the perambulation of 1228 as follows, \\"'Where Oskell's brook falls into the Mersey; up this brook to Haghou meadow, from this to Brummesho, following the syke to Brumlausie, and across by the old turbaries upon two meres as far as Lombethorn; from this point going down to the \\"waterfall\\" of the head of Otter pool, and down this pool into the Mersey. \\" In 1327, Toxteth was granted to Henry, Earl of Lancaster. Over the years, various leases and grants were made and the park was owned by Adam, son of William de Liverpool, in 1338. In 1385, William de Liverpool had licence \\"to take two cartloads of gorse weekly from the park for 12d. a year rent.\\" In 1383 a grant was made to William Bolton and Robert Baxter, in 1394 the lease was resigned and handed over to Richard de Molyneux. The park finally came into the hands of Sir Thomas Stanley in 1447. The parkland descended within the Stanley family until 1596, when it was sold by William Stanley, Earl of Derby, to Edmund Smolte and Edward Aspinwall. In 1604, the Earl sold it to Richard Molyneux of Sefton at a cost of ¬£1,100. The estate descended from this time until 1972 with the death of the 7th Earl. Toxteth Park The ancient township of Toxteth contains the village of Smeedon or Smithdown. It stretches over an area of three miles along the River Mersey and two miles inland, the highest point being on the corner of Smithdown Lane and Lodge Lane. A brook ran from the northern end of the area, near the boundary of Parliament Street, where it was used to power a water wheel before it ran into the river. Along the river are two creeks; the one near the middle is known as Knot's Hole, and another further south, called Dickinson's Dingle, received a brook which ran past the east end of St Michael's Church, Aigburth. At some time in history the creeks were filled in. The Dingle is now in the area where the old northern creek was situated, and St Michael's Hamlet is situated around the southern creek. Outside the southern boundary of the area lies the creek known as Otterspool, which formed the boundary between Wavertree and West Derby. The major road through the area was Park Lane, now Park Place and Park Road. The road ran from the Coffee House, which stood near Fairview Place, down towards the Dingle, and the \\"Ancient Chapel of Toxteth\\". Toward the end of the 16th century, the royal park ceased to be and Puritan farmers from Bolton settled in the area. Setting up 25 farms on land outside Church of England control, which became Toxteth Village, these Dissenters worshipped at the \\"Ancient Chapel\\" on Park Road, now known as the Toxteth Unitarian Chapel (not to be confused with Ullet Road Unitarian Church, in Toxteth, south Liverpool). In 1611, they built a school at the Dingle, appointing Richard Mather as schoolmaster. Some years later, he began preaching to the local farmers in the chapel. In 1796, the Herculaneum Pottery was established on the site of an old copper works. The site later became Herculaneum Dock, which was filled in during the 1980s. Smithdown Smithdown, referred to as Esmedune in the Domesday Book, and variously as Smededon, Smeddon, Smethesdune, Smethedon, Smethdon, Smethden, has been merged into Toxteth Park since the granting of the Liverpool Charter in 1207. The definite boundaries of Smithdown have never been fully recorded, but the name continued in use from 1207 until the 16th century, although it is thought to have reached from Lodge Lane to the eastern boundary of Toxteth Park. In 1066, Smithdown was held as a separate manor, by Ethelmund. During the reign of King John the Manor of Smithdown was taken from its owner, and the king gave him Thingwall instead. Second World War During the Second World War, the Free French 13th Demi Brigade of the French Foreign Legion were stationed in Toxteth. On 30 August 1940, the Demi Brigade departed Liverpool for operations against Vichy forces that would include the abortive Battle of Dakar and the storming of Libreville. Places of worship Wellington Road Chapel, in Toxteth, was closed in 1932 and has been left vacant ever since. As the area began to develop and become more urbanised, several places of worship were built to serve the growing community. The first church was St James's, in 1774. Other churches built during the 19th century include St Patrick's, 1827; St John the Baptist's, 1832; St Thomas's, 1840; St Barnabas's, 1841; St Clement's Windsor, 1841; St Matthew's, 1847; St Paul's, 1848; Holy Trinity, 1858; St Silas's, 1865; St Cleopas's, 1866; St Margaret's, 1869; Christ Church, 1870; St Philemon's, 1874; Our Lady of Mount Carmel, 1878; All Saints', 1884; St Gabriel's, 1884; St Agnes's, 1884; St Bede's, 1886; and St Andrew's, 1893;. In addition, the following may be considered landmarks: the Welsh Presbyterian Church, nicknamed \\"Toxteth Cathedral\\", 1868; the Ullet Road Unitarian Church, 1899, \\"one of the most elaborate Non-conformist ensembles in the country\\";The church and the attached church hall have been separately designated by English Heritage as Grade I listed buildings. the Church of St. Agnes and St. Pancras, also in Ullet Road; the Church of St Clare on the corner of Arundel Avenue and York Avenue, and the Princes Road Synagogue, 1874, \\"impressively combining Gothic revival and Moorish revival architecture\\". The Al-Rahma Mosque on Hatherley Street opened in 2008. Politics Politically, Toxteth is within the parliamentary constituency of Liverpool Riverside. In the 2019 United Kingdom general election, Kim Johnson of the Labour Party, was elected the Member of Parliament. The council ward is Princes Park, and has three Labour councillors. Demographics Immigration to Toxteth has taken place from the 19th century with the arrival of African and Chinese sailors and thousands of Irish Catholic and Welsh migrants, to the present day, most recently from the Caribbean, Yemen and Somalia with relatively few from the Indian sub-continent. The area has a very large community of mixed ethnicity as a result. Unrest and crime After the end of World War II, Toxteth became a popular destination for Commonwealth immigrants who arrived in Liverpool from the West Indies and the Indian subcontinent. However, the economic decline of Britain during the 1970s and early 1980s hit Toxteth and most of the rest of Liverpool particularly hard, leaving it with some of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Crime increased as a result. The standard of housing in both the public and private sector also declined, which would lead to eventual widespread demolition and refurbishment. July 1981 saw riots in which dozens of young males clashed with police, resulting in numerous injuries on both sides as well as extensive damage to properties and vehicles. Poverty, unemployment, racial tension, racism and hostility towards the police were largely blamed for the disturbances, which were among the worst scenes of unrest seen during peacetime in Britain. Hundreds of people were injured, one man was killed by a police Land Rover, and numerous buildings and vehicles were damaged. This wave of rioting was perhaps the most prominent of a series of riots which other inner city areas during the spring and summer of 1981 - Brixton in London being the scene of another similarly violent riot. A second, less serious riot occurred in Toxteth on 1 October 1985. However, this was largely overshadowed the riots which occurred that autumn in the Handsworth area of Birmingham and the Tottenham area of London. As well as racial and civil unrest, vehicle crime has also blighted Toxteth since around 1980. A notable tragedy occurred in Toxteth on 30 October 1991, when two children (nine-year-old Daniel Davies and 12-year-old Adele Thompson) were fatally injured by a speeding sports car driven by 18-year-old joyrider Christopher Lewin in Granby Street. Lewin was found guilty on a double manslaughter charge at Liverpool Crown Court on 24 September 1992 and sentenced to seven and a half years in prison, as well as being banned from driving for seven years. At the end of his trial, relatives and friends of the two victims pelted him with missiles and threatened to attack him. Five of them were ejected from the court. With Toxteth still fresh in the mind of the British media and public a decade after the 1981 riots, it was reported in the international media during December 1991 that the area still suffered from many of the problems that were said to have triggered the original riots, and some local residents claimed that things had gone from bad to worse. Despite the efforts of community groups and other services to help train young people for jobs, youth unemployment in the area was reported to be above 50%. In April 1994, The Independent newspaper highlighted that Toxteth was still one of the most deprived areas in Britain, with unemployment in some districts exceeding 40%, with theft, drug abuse and violent crime being rife. A third wave of rioting broke out in Toxteth on the evening of 8 August 2011 at a time when riots flared across England, although again this wave of rioting was overshadowed by worse riots in Birmingham and London. Vehicles and wheelie bins were set alight in the district, as well as in nearby Dingle and Wavertree, and a number of shops were looted as well. Two police officers suffered minor injuries as a result of the rioting. It was brought under control in the early hours of the following morning. Individuals arrested and charged in relation to the 2011 rioting were from addresses all across the city, with Toxteth residents being a clear minority. However, as had been the case in 1991, it was rioting various districts of London rather than Liverpool which were most notably affected by this wave of national rioting, once again at a time when unemployment and social unrest were high as a result of a recession. Regeneration Once elegant glazed yellow-brick derelict terraced houses in tree-lined Ducie Street, Toxteth. Much of the area continues to suffer from poverty and urban degradation. House prices reflect this; in summer 2003, the average property price was just ¬£45,929 (compared to the national average of ¬£160,625). Despite government-led efforts to regenerate Toxteth after the 1981 riots, few of the area's problems appeared to have improved by 1991, by which time joyriding had also become a serious problem; on 30 October that year, a 12-year-old was killed by a speeding stolen car on Granby Street, seriously injuring a nine-year-old who died in hospital from his injuries six days later. By the time of the riot's 20th anniversary in July 2001, it was reported that many of the issues which contributed to the riots were still rife; not least unemployment and racial tension, as well as a decline in the sense of community in some neighbourhoods. Urban dereliction and gun crime remained a significant problem. However, there had already been some significant improvements by this stage, including the rebuilding of the Rialto complex (which was destroyed in the 1981 riot) as a mix of retail, residential and commercial properties. Housing in Toxteth tends to be in terraces but there is a growing number of flats available as larger Victorian properties are broken up into separate dwellings. This is particularly the case in Canning, and around Princes Park. Extensive regeneration has taken place in Toxteth over the last few years, including demolition of many of the Victorian terraces in the area. This has created much new development but also scarred the area with cleared sites and derelict streets. There has been strong local opposition to demolition of the Granby Triangle and the Welsh Streets, attracting extensive coverage in the national media and ultimately the Granby Four Streets were removed from the clearance plans. In 2015 a community regeneration initiative which involved a collaboration between a Community Land Trust, Steinbeck Studios and the artists collective Assemble was nominated for the Turner Prize. The prize was awarded to Assemble in December 2015. Welsh Streets By 1850, over 20,000 Welsh builders worked in Liverpool who required housing and land in Toxteth was leased for housing development. The Welsh Streets were designed by Richard Owens and built by David Roberts, Son and Co. Through this collaboration, Owens designed over 10,000 terraced houses in the city of Liverpool, particularly those in the surrounding Toxteth area where the Welsh Streets are located. The streets were named after Welsh towns, valleys and villages and were built for Welsh migrants, by Welsh builders. Musician Ringo Starr was born in 9 Madryn Street, where he lived until the age of 4 before moving to Admiral Grove. Council survey data published in 2005 showed the Welsh Streets were broadly popular with residents and in better than average condition, but were condemned for demolition because of a perceived 'over-supply' of 'obsolete' terraced houses in Liverpool. The proposals have divided the local community. Following unsuccessful demolition plans in 2013, Voelas Street was the first in 2017 to be fully refurbished and offered for rent to tenants. Popularity of the scheme would determine whether further regeneration of the other streets would be undertaken. Parks Sefton Park Toxteth has two parks within its borders: * Sefton Park, one of the last remnants of the royal hunting park.

The station is on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network with trains departing to Southport via Liverpool city centre and to Hunts Cross. St. James Station is a disused railway station in Toxteth. It was located at the corner of St. James Place and Parliament Street, on the Merseyrail Northern Line. This station is in a deep cutting, cut into the Northern Line tunnel, being in effect an underground station with no roof. It was closed in 1917 as being too near to the terminus at Liverpool Central High Level railway station. Liverpool City Region Combined Authority announced in August 2019 that they were planning to use part of a ¬£172m funding package to reopen the station, subject to the plans being approved. The station is well located to serve the Liverpool Echo Arena at King's Dock and Liverpool Cathedral. Sefton Park railway station, another disused station, was located at Smithdown Road and Garmoyle Road in nearby Wavertree. The station was closed to passengers in 1960.

Fisher was born in London and started writing poetry in 1962. In the late 1960s, he was involved with Fluxshoe, the United Kingdom offshoot of Fluxus, and performance has remained an important part of his practice. He established himself as a poet through his early, decade-long, poetry project Place, which was published in a series of books and pamphlets during the 1970s. This project which drew, in part, on the Olson tradition of 'open field' projective verse poetics and, in part, on the procedural tradition of poets like Jackson Mac Low, was one of the major works of the British Poetry Revival, although it wasn't published as a single volume until 2005, when it was brought out by Ken Edwards's Reality Street. After the abandonment (as planned) of Place, he worked on a project called Gravity as a consequence of shape from 1982 which he completed in 2007. As with Place', this was published in a series of books and pamphlets throughout this period. The total work amounts to some 800 pages. This project was followed by a book of emblems (poem-image-commentary) called \\"Proposals\\" and, in 2014, a collage book of poetry, visual images and prose quotations called \\"SPUTTOR\\". Fisher also made an important contribution to the British Poetry Revival as a publisher. As editor of Spanner and \\"New London Pride\\", he published many of the British Poetry Revival poets. He was also co-editor of Aloes Books. Fisher has also sustained a concurrent art practice. During the 1980s, he gained an MA from Goldsmiths' College, University of London, where he was taught by Harry Thubron. He has had a number of solo shows, including 'Possession and Cure' at Hereford Museum and Art Gallery. His last retrospective painting show was in Hereford Museum & Art Gallery in 1993. He has over 150 publications in his name consisting of art documentation, poetry and theory. A book of essays \\"Imperfect Fit: Aesthetic Function, Facture and Perception\\" regarding American and British Poetry & Art Since 1950 and other essays on poetics was published by the University of Alabama in 2016. An edited collection of essays on his work from the start through to \\"SPUTTOR\\", \\"The Allen Fisher Companion\\", edited by Robert Hampson and cris cheek, was published by Shearsman in 2020. Forthcoming:an \\"Allen Fisher Reader\\". Fisher is Emeritus Professor of Poetry and Art at Manchester Metropolitan University. He has exhibited widely and his work is represented in the Tate Gallery. He edits the magazine Spanner.

Their common name opossum shrimps stems from the presence of a brood pouch or \\"marsupium\\" in females. The fact that the larvae are reared in this pouch and are not free-swimming characterises the order. The mysid's head bears a pair of stalked eyes and two pairs of antennae. The thorax consists of eight segments each bearing branching limbs, the whole concealed beneath a protective carapace and the abdomen has six segments and usually further small limbs. Mysids are found throughout the world in both shallow and deep marine waters where they can be benthic or pelagic, but they are also important in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many benthic species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the water column. Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in laboratories for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality. Description The head of a mysid bears two pairs of antennae and a pair of large, stalked eyes. The head and first segment (or sometimes the first three segments) of the thorax are fused to form the cephalothorax. The eight thoracic segments are covered by the carapace which is attached only to the first three. The first two thoracic segments bear maxillipeds which are used to filter plankton and organic particulate from the water. The other six pairs of thoracic appendages are biramous (branching) limbs known as pereopods, and are used for swimming, as well as for wafting water towards the maxillipeds for feeding. Unlike true shrimps (Caridea), females have a marsupium beneath the thorax. This brood pouch is enclosed by the large, flexible oostegites, bristly flaps which extend from the basal segments of the pereopods and which form the floor of a chamber roofed by the animal's sternum. This chamber is where the eggs are brooded, development being direct in most cases. The abdomen has six segments, the first five of which bear pleopods, although these may be absent or vestigial in females. The fourth pleopod is longer than the others in males and has a specialized reproductory function. The majority of species are long, and vary in colour from pale and transparent, through to bright orange or brown. They differ from other species within the superorder Peracarida by featuring statocysts on their uropods (located on the last abdominal segment). These help the animal orient itself in the water and are clearly seen as circular vesicles: together with the pouch the statocysts are often used as features that distinguish mysids from other shrimp-like organisms. Distribution Mysids have a cosmopolitan distribution and are found in both marine and freshwater environments, the deep sea, estuaries, shallow coastal waters, lakes, rivers and underground waters. They are primarily marine and fewer than ten percent are found in freshwater. There are about 72 freshwater species in total, being predominantly found in the Palearctic and Neotropical realms. These non-marine mysids occur in four distinct types of habitats; some are estuarine species; some were isolated in the Ponto-Caspian Basin where Paramysis has since radiated enormously (23 species); some are glacial relicts and some are subterranean Tethyan relicts. Behavior Mysis relicta Some species are benthic (living on the seabed) and others pelagic (living in mid-water), but most are found close to, crawling on or burrowing into the mud or sand. Most marine species are benthic by day but leave the seabed at night to become planktonic. Locomotion is mostly by swimming, the pleopods being used for this purpose. Some mysids live among algae and seagrasses, some are solitary while many form dense swarms. Mysids form an important part of the diet of such fish as shad and flounder. In general, they are free-living, but a few species, mostly in the subfamily Heteromysinae, are commensal and are associated with sea anemones and hermit crabs. Several taxa have also been described from different freshwater habitats and caves. Mysis relicta and its close relatives inhabit cold, deep lakes and have a diurnal cycle of vertical migrations. The majority of Mysida are omnivores, feeding on algae, detritus, and zooplankton. Scavenging and cannibalism are also common, with the adults sometimes preying on their young once they emerge from the marsupium. The pelagic and most other species are filter feeders, creating a feeding current with the exopods of their pereopods. This wafts food particles into a ventral food groove along which they are passed before being filtered by setae (bristles) on the second maxillae. Larger planktonic prey can be caught in a trap composed of the endopods of the thoracic appendages. Some benthic species, especially members of the subfamily Erythropinae, have been observed feeding on small particles which they collected by grooming the surfaces of their bodies and legs. Neomysis integer Individual mysids are either male or female, and fertilisation is external. The gonads are in the thorax and are tubular in shape. Males have two gonopores in the eighth thoracic segment and a pair of long penises. The female gonopores are in the sixth thoracic segment and the oostegites are attached to the first to seventh pereopods to form a brood pouch. Mating usually takes place at night and lasts only a few minutes. During the process, the male inserts his penises into the marsupium and releases sperm. This stimulates the female and the eggs are usually released into the marsupium within an hour. Here they are fertilised and retained, development of the embryos in the brood pouch being direct with the young hatching from the eggs as miniature adults. The size of a mysid brood generally correlates with body length and environmental factors such as density and food availability. The age at which mysids reach sexual maturity depends on water temperature and food availability. For the species Mysidopsis bahia, this is normally at 12 to 20 days. The young are released soon afterwards, and although their numbers are usually low, the short reproductive cycle of mysid adults means a new brood can be produced every four to seven days. Uses Some species of mysids are easy to culture on a large scale in the laboratory as they are highly adaptive, and can tolerate a wide range of conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle which means they can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or flow-through systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher stocking density than a static system. In flow- through systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. Artemia (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids to increase their nutritional value. Cultured mysids are thought to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms. They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and commercial farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost. Their high protein and fat content also makes them a good alternative to live enriched Artemia when feeding juveniles (especially those that are difficult to maintain such as young seahorses) and other small fauna. Their sensitivity to water quality also makes them suitable for bioassays. Americamysis bahia and Americamysis almyra are frequently used to test for pesticides and other toxic substances, with A. bahia found to be more sensitive during the periods when it is moulting. Systematics The Mysida belong to the superorder Peracarida, which means ‚Äúnear to shrimps‚Äù. Although in many respects mysids appear similar to some shrimps, the main characteristic separating them from the superorder Eucarida is their lack of free-swimming larvae. The order Mysida is extensive and currently includes approximately 160 genera, containing more than 1000 species. Traditionally, Mysida were united with another, externally similar group of pelagic crustaceans, the Lophogastrida, into a broader order Mysidacea, but that classification is generally abandoned at present.Brusca, R.; Brusca, G. (2003). Invertebrates. Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer AssociatesPeracarida fact sheet - Guide to the marine zooplankton of south eastern Australia Anderson, Gary (2010-01-20): Peracarida Taxa and Literature (Cumacea, Lophogastrida, Mysida, Stygiomysida and Tanaidacea) While the previous grouping had good morphological support, molecular studies do not corroborate the monophyly of this group. Previously Mysida included two other families, Lepidomysidae and Stygiomysidae, but these have now been placed in a separate order, Stygiomysida.

It is a fast-growing, short-lived tree with opposite, compound leaves. It is sometimes considered a weedy or invasive species, and has been introduced to and naturalized throughout much of the world, including in South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, much of Europe, and parts of Asia. Common names Indicative of its familiarity to many people over a large geographic range, A. negundo has numerous common names. The names \\"box elder\\" and \\"boxelder maple\\" are based upon the similarity of its whitish wood to that of boxwood and the similarity of its pinnately compound leaves to those of some species of elder. Other common names are based upon this maple's similarity to ash, its preferred environment, its sugary sap, a description of its leaves, its binomial name, and so on. These names include \\"Manitoba maple\\", \\"ash-leaf maple\\", \\"cut-leaved maple\\", \\"three-leaf maple\\", \\"ash maple\\", \\"sugar maple\\", \\"negundo maple\\", and \\"river maple\\". Some of the common names given in this reference are questionable, \\"stinking ash\\" and \\"black ash\\" typically refer to Ptelea trifoliata and Fraxinus nigra, respectively. This reference is retained as an example of the confusion which arises when plants such as A. negundo are discussed by other than their scientific names. Names vary regionally. Box elder, boxelder maple, ash-leaved maple, and maple ash are among its common names in the United States. In Canada it is commonly known as Manitoba maple and occasionally as elf maple. in the British Isles it is known as box elder or ashleaf maple. In Russia it is known as American maple () as well as ash- leaf maple (). Description Acer negundo is a fast-growing and fairly short-lived tree that grows up to tall, with a trunk diameter of }, rarely up to } diameter. It often has several trunks and can form impenetrable thickets.van Gelderen, C.J. & van Gelderen, D.M. (1999). Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia. The typical lifespan of box elder is only 60 years. Under exceptionally favorable conditions, it may live to 100 years. The shoots are green, often with a whitish to pink or violet waxy coating when young. Branches are smooth, somewhat brittle, and tend to retain a fresh green color rather than forming a bark of dead, protective tissue. The bark on its trunks is pale gray or light brown, deeply cleft into broad ridges, and scaly. Unlike most other maples (which usually have simple, palmately lobed leaves), Acer negundo has pinnately compound leaves that usually have three to seven leaflets. Simple leaves are also occasionally present; technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves. Although some other maples (such as Acer griseum, Acer mandshuricum and the closely related A. cissifolium) have trifoliate leaves, only A. negundo regularly displays more than three leaflets. The leaflets are about } long and } wide with slightly serrate margins. Leaves have a translucent light green color and turn yellow in the fall. The yellow-green flowers are small and appear in early spring, with staminate flowers in clusters on slender pedicels and pistillate flowers on drooping racemes } long. The fruits are paired samaras on drooping racemes, each seed slender, } long, with a } incurved wing; they drop in autumn or they may persist through winter. Seeds are usually both prolific and fertile. Unlike most other maples, A. negundo is fully dioecious and both a male and female tree are needed for reproduction to occur.

Subspecies Acer negundo is often divided into three subspecies, each of which was originally described as a separate species. These are: * Acer negundo subsp. negundo, native from the Atlantic Coast to the Rocky Mountains. * Acer negundo subsp. interius, with more leaf serration than the nominate subspecies and a more matte leaf surface, is native from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, between the other two subspecies. * Acer negundo subsp. californicum, with larger leaves with a velvety texture, is found in parts of California and Arizona. Some authors further subdivide A. negundo subsp. negundo into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct taxa is disputed by many. Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient speciation. Distribution and habitat Acer negundo often grows alongside waterbodies Growing as a weed in pavement crack in Russia Acer negundo is native across much of the United States and Canada, and can be found as far south as Guatemala. Although native to North America, it is considered a weedy species in some areas, such as in parts of the Northeastern United States, and has increased greatly in these areas.Uva, R.H., J.C. Neal,and J.M. DiTomaso. 1997. Weeds of the Northeast. Cornell University Press. Ithaca, New York. In 1928, Joseph Illick, chief forester for the state of Pennsylvania, wrote in Pennsylvania Trees that box elder was \\"rare and localized\\" in the state. After World War II, box elder's rapid growth made it a popular landscaping tree in suburban housing developments despite its poor form, vulnerability to storm damage, and tendency to attract large numbers of box elder bugs. Intentional cultivation has thus made the tree far more abundant than it once was. It can quickly colonize both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe, including Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, and Poland) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas, and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become naturalized in eastern China and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the Australian continent where it is listed as a pest invasive species. This species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as riparian habitats. Human influence has greatly favored this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots. Ecology Boxelder bugs (Boisea trivittata) feed on Acer negundo Several birds and some squirrels feed on the seeds. The evening grosbeak uses them extensively. The boxelder bug (Boisea trivittata) lays its eggs on all maples, but prefers this species, clustering the eggs in bark crevices. The rosy maple moth (Dryocampa rubicunda) also lays its eggs on the leaves of maple trees, including Acer negundo. The larvae feed on the leaves, and in very dense populations can cause defoliation. Small galls are formed on the leaves by a bladder mite, Aceria negundi. A gall midge, Contarinia negundinis joins and enlarges the galls of Aceria negundi. The midge sometimes creates a separate, tubular gall on the midrib or veins of the undersides of the leaves. The cottony maple leaf scale, Pulvinaria acericola, occurs on the foliage of Acer negundo. A leaf spot fungus, Septoria negundinis creates black-ringed lesions on the leaves. Uses=Wood Heartwood of Acer negundo with red stain Although its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most commercial uses, this tree has been considered as a source of wood fiber, for use in fiberboard. There is also some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens). Such purposes generally use burl or injured wood, as the injured wood develops a red stain. The wood has been used for a variety of purposes by Native Americans, such as by the Navajo to make tubes for bellows,Elmore, Francis H. (1944). Ethnobotany of the Navajo. Sante Fe, NM.

Cultivation 'Variegatum' cultivar with white-margined leaves Although its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding might make it seem like a poor choice for a landscape tree, A. negundo is one of the most common maples in cultivation and many cultivars have been developed, such as: * 'Auratum' ‚Äì yellowish leaves with smooth undersides * 'Aureomarginatum' ‚Äì creamy yellow leaf margins * 'Baron' ‚Äì Hardier & seedless variety * 'Elegans' ‚Äì distinctively convex leaves * 'Flamingo' ‚Äì pink and white variegation (very popular) * 'Pendulum' ‚Äì with weeping branches. * 'Variegatum' ‚Äì creamy white leaf margins * 'Violaceum' ‚Äì younger shoots and branches have bluish color Medical impacts Acer negundo flowers Toxicology A protoxin present in the seeds of Acer negundo, hypoglycin A, has been identified as a major risk factor for, and possibly the cause of, a disease in horses, seasonal pasture myopathy (SPM). SPM is an equine neurological disease which occurs seasonally in certain areas of North America and Europe, with symptoms including stiffness, difficulty walking or standing, dark urine and eventually breathing rapidly and becoming recumbent. Ingestion of sufficient quantities of box elder seeds or other parts of the plant results in breakdown of respiratory, postural, and cardiac muscles. The cause of SPM was unknown for centuries despite the disease being well known among affected areas and was only positively determined in the 21st century. It is analogous to Jamaican vomiting sickness in humans, also caused by hypoglycin A. Allergenicity Acer negundo pollen is a severe allergen. Pollen is released in winter or spring, varying with latitude and elevation. ReferencesBibliography * Philips, Roger. Trees of North America and Europe.

There are three distinct varieties of Lancashire cheese. Young Creamy Lancashire and mature Tasty Lancashire are produced by a traditional method, whereas Crumbly Lancashire (more commonly known as Lancashire Crumbly within Lancashire) is a more recent creation suitable for mass production. It is traditionally paired with Eccles cakes and Chorley cakes. Creamy Lancashire For centuries, Lancashire dairy farmers' wives made cheese from surplus milk. On small farms there was insufficient milk from a single day to make a cheese, and so each day's milk was curdled and accumulated for several days until there was enough curd to make a cheese. Uniquely amongst all British cheeses, two or three days' curd of varying maturity are blended together, giving Lancashire cheese a distinctive character. The traditional method was standardised in the 1890s by Joseph Gornall of Garstang and Pilling, a county council employee, who visited many Lancashire farms to establish a method and recipe that is still used today - the \\"Gornall method\\".British Cheese Board - Lancashire, retrieved 13 December 2011Creamy Lancashire Cheese Trail , retrieved 15 July 2010 His \\"Gornall Patent Cheesemaker\\" was sold between 1892 and 1919.Lancashire Pioneers: Joseph Gornall - Lancashire's \\"Mr Cheese\\" (on two pages), retrieved 20 July 2010 Creamy Lancashire cheese is made by this traditional method and matured for a period of four to twelve weeks.

It was drafted by the European Convention and solemnly proclaimed on 7 December 2000 by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission. However, its then legal status was uncertain and it did not have full legal effect until the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009. Under the Charter, the European Union must act and legislate consistently with the Charter and the EU's courts will strike down legislation adopted by the EU's institutions that contravenes it. The Charter applies to the Institutions of the European Union and its member states when implementing European Union law. Background The Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (Treaty of Rome) did not include any reference to fundamental or human rights. The EEC Treaty was written a few years after the failure of the European Defence Community Treaty and the European Political Community Treaty. The latter treaty had included rights provisions and Craig and de B√∫rca argue that, in light of that failure, the drafters of the EEC Treaty wished to eschew any implicitly political elements. However, the idea that the purely economic end of the new EEC Treaty would be unlikely to have any implications for fundamental rights was soon to be tested. Court cases Soon after the entry into force of the EEC Treaty, the Community established itself as a major political entity with policy ramifications beyond its economic aims. In 1964, the European Court of Justice handed down its decision in Costa v ENEL, in which the Court decided that Union law should take precedence over conflicting national law. This meant that national governments could not escape what they had agreed to at a European level by enacting conflicting domestic measures, but it also potentially meant that the EEC legislator could legislate unhindered by the restrictions imposed by fundamental rights provisions enshrined in the constitutions of member states. This issue came to a head in 1970 in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case when a German court ruled that a piece of EEC legislation infringed the German Basic Law. On a reference from the German court, the ECJ ruled that whilst the application of Union law could not depend on its consistency with national constitutions, fundamental rights did form an \\"integral part of the general principles of [European Community] law\\" and that inconsistency with fundamental rights could form the basis of a successful challenge to a European law.Case 228/69, Internationale Handelsgesellschaft mbH v. Einfuhr und Vorratsstelle f√ºr Getreide und Futtermittel [1970] ECR 1125; [1972] CMLR 255. In ruling as it did in Internationale Handelsgesellschaft the ECJ had in effect created a doctrine of unwritten rights which bound the Community institutions. While the court's fundamental rights jurisprudence was approved by the institutions in 1977Joint Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission Concerning the Protection of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (OJ C 103, 27/04/1977 P. 1) and a statement to that effect was inserted into the Maastricht TreatyArticle F of the Maastricht Treaty Maastricht Treaty. it was only in 1999 that the European Council formally went about the initiating the process of drafting a codified catalogue of fundamental rights for the EU. Proclamation In 1999 the European Council proposed that a \\"body composed of representatives of the Heads of State and Government and of the President of the Commission as well as of members of the European Parliament and national parliaments\\" should be formed to draft a fundamental rights charter. On being constituted in December of that year the \\"body\\" entitled itself the European Convention. The Convention adopted the draft on 2 October 2000 and it was solemnly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission on 7 December 2000. It was at the same time, however, decided to defer making a decision on the Charter's legal status. However, it did come with the political weight of having been approved by three powerful institutions and as such was regularly cited by the ECJ as a source of fundamental rights. Legal force A modified Charter formed part of the defunct European Constitution (2004). After that treaty's failure, its replacement, the Lisbon Treaty (2007), also gave force to the Charter albeit by referencing it as an independent document rather than by incorporating it into the treaty itself. However, both the version included in the Constitution and the one referenced in the Lisbon Treaty were amended versions of the Charter. On the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding proposed that Commissioners should swear to uphold all EU treaties and the Charter. On 3 May 2010, the European Commission swore a solemn declaration at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the EU Treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate. For the first time, the Commissioners also explicitly pledged to respect the new Charter of Fundamental Rights. Several states insisted upon an opt-out from national application of the charter (see below for details). Legal status Article 2 of the Charter affirms the prohibition on capital punishment in the EU Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 the fundamental rights charter has the same legal value as the European Union treaties. The Charter referred to in the Treaty is an amended version of the 2000 document which was solemnly declared by the same three institutions a day before the signing of the Lisbon Treaty itself. Article 51(1) of the Charter addresses the Charter to the EU's institutions, bodies established under EU law and, when implementing EU laws, the EU's member states. In addition both Article 6 of the amended Treaty of European Union and Article 51(2) of the Charter itself restrict the Charter from extending the competences of the EU. A consequence of this is that the EU will not be able to legislate to vindicate a right set out in the Charter unless the power to do such is set out in the Treaties proper. Furthermore, individuals will not be able to take a member state to court for failing to uphold the rights in the Charter unless the member state in question was implementing EU law. It is this last point that has been subject to the most debate. The Charter is not the first attempt to place human rights principles at the core of European Union law. All EU member states are, and candidate states are required to be, signatories to the Council of Europe's European Convention on Human Rights, so that many principles from the convention, such as the right to a fair trial, were taken as the baseline for European Court of Justice jurisprudence even before their formal reiteration in Charter. In interpreting the human rights protections provided by the general principles of EU law (described in the Court cases section above), the ECJ had already dealt with the issue of whether the rights protected by those general principles applied to member states. Having ruled in Johnston v Royal Ulster ConstabularyCase 222/84 [1986] ECR 1651, [1986] 3 CMLR 240. that a right to fair procedures was one of the general principles of EU law, in Kremzow v AustriaC-299/95 [1997] ECR I-2629, [1997] 3 CMLR 1289. the ECJ had to decide whether or not a member state was obliged to apply that principle in relation to a wrongful conviction for murder. Kremzow's lawyers argued that his case came within the scope of EU law on the grounds that his wrongful conviction and sentence had breached his right to free movement within the EU. The ECJ responded by saying that since the laws under which Kremzow had been convicted were not enacted to secure compliance with EU law, his predicament fell outside the scope of EU law. The wording in Kremzow v Austria, referring to the \\"field of application of EU law\\", differs from the wording in the Charter which refers to the implementation of EU law. However, the amended explanatory memorandum issued alongside the Charter in 2007 describes the wording used in the Charter as reflecting ECJ precedent. The British and Polish protocol In the negotiations leading up to the signing to the Lisbon Treaty, Poland and the United Kingdom secured a protocol to the treaty relating to the application of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights in their respective countries. The protocol, in article 1(1) states that the \\"Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or actions of Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms.\\" Article 1(2) then says that the Title IV of the Charter, which contains economic and social rights, does not create justiciable rights, unless Poland and the UK have provided for such rights in their national laws. Poland and the UK wanted the protocol for different reasons. The United Kingdom originally opposed a legally binding charter over concerns that it would result in a stream of British citizens going to the European Court of Justice in attempts to enforce their Charter rights in the UK, and in increased costs for business. While the British accepted a legally binding rights charter during the negotiations of the failed European Constitution, they negotiated a protocol during the Lisbon negotiations which, according to the then British Minister for Europe, would ensure that the Charter would not extend the powers of the European Court of Justice over United Kingdom law. Poland, on the other hand, disliked what it perceived as the Charter's liberal stance on social issues, and so in September 2007 the Polish government indicated that they wished to be included in the British protocol. There is considerable debate concerning the legal effect of the protocol. One view, shared by Jan Jir√°sek, is that the protocol is an opt-out that excludes the application of the Charter to Poland and the United Kingdom. Another, shared by Ingolf Pernice, is that the protocol is only an interpretative protocol which will either have limited or no legal consequence. Craig and de Burc√° argue that the protocol is merely declaratory. It says that the \\"Charter does not extend the ability\\" of the ECJ or other court to overturn UK or Polish law, but the ECJ already had the power to do this in any case. Accordingly, the Protocol is \\"unlikely that it will have any significant effect in practice.\\" In NS v Home Secretary, the ECJ ruled that Article 1(1) of the protocol \\"explains Article 51 of the Charter with regard to the scope thereof and does not intend to exempt the Republic of Poland or the United Kingdom from the obligation to comply with the provisions of the Charter or to prevent a court of one of those Member States from ensuring compliance with those provisions.\\"Joined Cases C-411/10 and C-493/10, N.S. v Home Secretary and M.E. v. Refugee Applications Commissioner [2011] EUECJ C-411/10 (21 December 2011). Quoted from para. 120. =The United Kingdom's Exit from the European Union (\\"Brexit\\")= Under section 5(4) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, the Charter of Fundamental Rights was not retained in UK law after its exit from the EU.EU (Withdrawal) Bill - Factsheet 6: The Charter of Fundamental Rights The National Archives Proposed Czech protocol During the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Czech President V√°clav Klaus expressed concern that the Charter would allow families of Germans who were expelled from territory in modern-day Czech Republic after the Second World War to challenge the expulsion before the EU's courts, though legal experts have suggested that the laws under which the German were expelled, the Bene≈° decrees, did not fall under the jurisdiction of EU law. After Klaus refused to finalize the Czech Republic's ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon unless the country was excluded from the Charter, as Poland and the United Kingdom had been, EU leaders agreed in October 2009 to amend the protocol to include the Czech Republic at the time of the next accession treatyMahony, Honor (30 October 2009) EU treaty closer to ratification after Czech deal agreed, EU ObserverGardner, Andrew (29 October 2009) Klaus gets opt-out, European Voice in a measure designed to persuade Klaus to sign the treaty. He subsequently signed the treaty. In September 2011, the Czech government formally submitted a request to the Council that the promised treaty revisions be made to extend the protocol to the Czech Republic, and a draft amendment to this effect was proposed by the European Council. However, the Czech Senate passed a resolution in October 2011 opposing their accession to the protocol. When Croatia's Treaty of Accession 2011 was signed in late 2011, the Czech protocol amendment was not included. During the Czech Republic's parliamentary ratification of the accession treaty in the spring of 2012, the government attempted to combine the approval of the Charter opt-out with the ratification bill. However, with the Senate controlled by the opposition parties, their objections to the opt-out could have led to the accession treaty being rejected. As a result, the government decided to separate the proposed opt-out from the accession treaty bill. A vote on a draft report by the European Parliament Constitutional Affairs Committee in January 2012 recommending against granting the Czech Republic's request to be added to Protocol 30 resulted in a tie. The report argued that Protocol 30 was not functioning as a general opt-out from the Charter, but only allowed the countries to limit the application of subsequent EU laws based solely on the charter. Thus, the Czech Republic would still be bound by the Charter even if they were added to the Protocol. In October 2012, the committee approved the report, and a third draft of the report was published on 11 December 2012. The report was tabled in Parliament during its session on 22 May 2013, and the Parliament voted in favour of calling on the European Council \\"not to examine the proposed amendment of the Treaties\\". The Parliament did, however, give its consent in advance that a treaty revision to add the Czech Republic to Protocol 30 would not require a new convention. In January 2014, after presidential and parliamentary elections the previous year had resulted in new leadership in the country, new Czech Human Rights Minister Ji≈ô√≠ Dienstbier said that he would attempt to have his country's request for an opt-out withdrawn. This was confirmed on 20 February 2014 by the new Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, who withdrew the request for an opt-out during a meeting with President of the European Commission Jos√© Manuel Barroso shortly after his newly elected government won the confidence of Parliament. In May 2014, the Council of the European Union formally withdrew their recommendation to hold an Intergovernmental Conference of member states to consider the proposed amendments to the treaties. The text The Charter contains some 54 articles divided into seven titles. The first six titles deal with substantive rights under the headings: dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens' rights and justice, while the last title deals with the interpretation and application of the Charter. Much of Charter is based on the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), European Social Charter, the case-law of the European Court of Justice and pre-existing provisions of European Union law. * The first title (Dignity) guarantees the right to life and prohibits torture, slavery, the death penalty, eugenic practices and human cloning. Its provisions are mostly based on the ECHR, although Article 1 closely reflects Article 1 of the German Basic Law. * The second title (Freedoms) covers liberty, personal integrity, privacy, protection of personal data, marriage, thought, religion, expression, assembly, education, work, property and asylum. * The third title (Equality) covers equality before the law, prohibition of all discrimination including on basis of disability, age and sexual orientation, cultural, religious and linguistic diversity, the rights of children and the elderly. * The fourth title (Solidarity) covers social and workers' rights including the right to fair working conditions, protection against unjustified dismissal, and access to health care, social and housing assistance. * The fifth title (Citizen's Rights) covers the rights of the EU citizens such as the right to vote in election to the European Parliament and to move freely within the EU. It also includes several administrative rights such as a right to good administration, to access documents and to petition the European Parliament. * The sixth title (Justice) covers justice issues such as the right to an effective remedy, a fair trial, to the presumption of innocence, the principle of legality, non-retrospectivity and double jeopardy. * The seventh title (General Provisions) concerns the interpretation and application of the Charter. These issues are dealt with above. Raising the Charter's profile The EU has attempted to raise the profile of the Charter so that citizens are more aware of their rights. For example, the EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) has produced apps for iOS and Android with the text of the Charter in all EU languages and related information. It has also published mini-versions of the Charter in all EU languages. In 2010, the FRA put out a tender for poets to turn the Charter into an 80-minute-long epic poem, with music, dance and multimedia elements. This was also to raise awareness and to simplify the legal text into more understandable language.Charter of Fundamental Rights to be re-written as 80-minute-long epic poem EUobserver, 1 April 2010 However, Viviane Reding, the European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom & Security, wrote to the director of the FRA slamming the idea on cost and dignity grounds and instructing him to cancel the project.Phillips, Leigh (29 April 2010) EU commissioner kills off 'undignified' rights charter poem, EU Observer  See also  *Capital punishment in Europe *Fundamental Rights Agency *European Single Market *European Social Charter *Fundamental rights *Three generations of human rights *LGBT rights in the European Union ReferencesFurther reading * *  External links  * Charter (2000), original version as proclaimed by the institutions * Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2007), version incorporated in the Treaty of Lisbon and explanation relating to it * The Charter in the latest (2012) consolidated version of the Lisbon Treaty * European Parliament‚Äôs explanation of the Charter * The Charter on the European Commission's website Category:European Union law Category:Declarations of the European Union Category:Human rights instruments Category:2000 in law Category:2000 in the European Union Category:Political charters Category:2000 documents ","title":"Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union"},{"id":"439043","text":"Metal target used for plinking Plinking refers to informal target shooting done for pleasure typically at non-standard targets such as tin cans, logs, soda bottles, or any other homemade or naturally occurring target. A person engaging in the plinking exercise is colloquially known as a \\"plinkster\\". Practice In contrast to shooting done at established target ranges, plinking is generally done at home, in a gravel pit, open field, or other private land for no fee. The term plinking is an onomatopoeia of the sharp, metallic sound (or \\"plink\\") that a projectile makes when hitting a metal target such as a tin can.Deflective Skepticism and Critical Plinking, Parisian Laundry Montreal, Quebec, 2014; see mawcollective.com The most common calibre used for plinking is the .22 Long Rifle rimfire cartridge, since these rounds are relatively inexpensive and have a low recoil; however, any caliber can be used in plinking, and it is not unusual to see a person plinking with a full power rifle or pistol. Generally it is also very cheap. Air guns and airsoft guns are also used, often for cost or safety reasons or because they are subject to less stringent regulation - a similar practice with a bow and arrow is usually termed \\"stump shooting\\". Appeal A stop sign used for target practice, Southern Indiana The primary attributes of plinking that make it appealing as a sport are as follows: the easy availability and broad variety of locations, minimum of cost, freedom in practice, an outdoors environment, and a more engaging shooting experience when compared to established target ranges. Since not all people have reasonable access to a target range, outdoor shooting done at home or other nearby piece of land is a natural alternative, and for many, homemade shooting ranges are the only way to keep up good marksmanship. Since target ranges generally charge a fee for the use of their facilities, and shooters usually have to buy their own paper targets, going to a target range can incur significant costs, especially when added up cumulatively over time. In addition, gun ranges by necessity have many strict rules concerning the use of their facilities, with rules concerning shot rate, types of ammunitions and firearms permitted, where the shooter is allowed to stand and when they can go downrange to check their targets, which some shooters may find stifling. Many shooters also find the open air to be a much more pleasant shooting environment than the inside of a target range, which is usually made of concrete and steel. By contrast, plinking can be done at home whenever the urge strikes, for merely the cost of ammunition, as the targets used are generally any item of suitable size that conveniently comes to hand, with beverage cans being one of the more popular choices. Plinking can be done alone at the individual pace of the shooter, who is free to move around at will, or in a group, which of course requires the use of some pre-determined safety measures. The targets themselves that are used are one of the main reasons why plinking is popular among gun enthusiasts, especially hunters. A three dimensional target in an outdoors setting is much more akin to a real world hunting scenario, allowing a hunter the opportunity for practice. Since any reasonably sized object, from a soda can or a charcoal briquetSingle Action Sixguns, page 294; John Taffin, Krause Publications, year 2005 to an arbitrary spot on a tree can be used as a target, a three dimensional plinking range can easily be set up that will simulate situations commonly found while hunting small game, such as when the animal is behind cover, or up in a tree. A plinking target will also often react much more positively to a hit than a paper target will, either with an audible impact, or visually confirmable by moving, splattering or falling over. Steel targets, which are used for formal action and long range shooting competitions, are also popular among plinksters due to their relative ease to set up, as well as being easy to confirm good hits.

It organised the Ireland national football team from 1880 to 1950, which after 1954, became the Northern Ireland national football team. History Original Irish FA crest Foundation of the IFA The IFA was formed on 18 November 1880 by seven football clubs mostly in the Belfast area, as the organising body for the sport across all of Ireland. A meeting was called by Cliftonville of other football clubs that followed the rules set out by the Scottish Football Association (SFA). At that meeting, on 18 November of that year, seven clubs formed the IFA, making it the fourth oldest national football association in the world (after those of England, Scotland and Wales). The founding members were: Alexander, Avoniel, Cliftonville, Distillery, Knock, Moyola Park and Oldpark.M. Brodie (1980) 100 Years of Irish Football. Belfast:Blackstaff Press The IFA's first decision was to form an annual challenge cup competition similar to the FA Cup and Scottish Cup competitions, called the Irish Cup. Two years later, Ireland played its first international against England, losing 13‚Äì0 (which remains a record for both teams; a record win for England, and a record loss for (Northern) Ireland). North/South Split and the foundation of the Football Association of Ireland Belfast Headquarters of the Irish Football Association at 20 Windsor Avenue, Belfast. Shortly after the partition of Ireland, in 1921, the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) was established as a rival association to regulate the game in what was to become the Irish Free State. The immediate cause of the split lay in a bitter dispute over the venue for the replay of an Irish Cup match in 1921 involving Glentoran of Belfast and Shelbourne of Dublin. When the first cup match was drawn in Belfast, because of the Irish war of independence, the IFA reneged on a promise to play the replay in Dublin and scheduled the rematch again for Belfast. Shelbourne refused to comply and forfeited the Cup. Such was the anger over the issue that the Leinster Football Association broke away from the IFA and formed its own national association. Those behind the FAI believed that football should be regulated by a federation based in the Irish Free State's capital, Dublin; they also accused the IFA of neglecting the development of the game in the South. The IFA's supporters argued that the federation should be based where the game was mainly played ‚Äì namely Ulster, and its principal city Belfast. Both associations claimed to represent the whole of the island, each competing internationally under the name \\"Ireland\\" and selecting players from both the rival national leagues, which also split at this time. Interventions by FIFA gave the FAI de jure organising rights over the 26 counties of the Republic, with the IFA restricted to Northern Ireland. From the 1950s onwards, the IFA no longer claimed it was the association for the whole of Ireland. In 1960, the association moved to its present location on Windsor Avenue in south Belfast, in a building once occupied by Thomas Andrews. The IFA continued to regulate the game in Northern Ireland, and all results obtained by the Irish national side and records in the Irish Football League and the cup competition stand as Northern Irish records.

He was also a god in Chinese folk religion, and titled Five Forms of the Highest Deity (). Calculated by Jesuit missionaries on the basis of Chinese chronicles and later accepted by the twentieth-century promoters of a universal calendar starting with the Yellow Emperor, Huangdi's traditional reign dates are 2697‚Äì2597 or 2698‚Äì2598 BCE. Huangdi's cult became prominent in the late Warring States and early Han dynasty, when he was portrayed as the originator of the centralized state, as a cosmic ruler, and as a patron of esoteric arts. A large number of texts ‚Äì such as the Huangdi Neijing, a medical classic, and the Huangdi Sijing, a group of political treatises ‚Äì were thus attributed to him. Having waned in influence during most of the imperial period, in the early twentieth century Huangdi became a rallying figure for Han Chinese attempts to overthrow the rule of the Qing dynasty, which they considered foreign because its emperors were Manchu people. To this day the Yellow Emperor remains a powerful symbol within Chinese nationalism. Traditionally credited with numerous inventions and innovations ‚Äì ranging from the Chinese calendar to an ancestor of football ‚Äì the Yellow Emperor is now regarded as the initiator of Chinese culture, and said to be the ancestor of all Chinese.. Names Temple of Huangdi in Xinzheng, Zhengzhou, Henan \\"Huangdi\\": Yellow Emperor, Yellow Thearch Until 221 BCE when Qin Shi Huang of the Qin dynasty coined the title huangdi () ‚Äì conventionally translated as \\"emperor\\" ‚Äì to refer to himself, the character di did not refer to earthly rulers but to the highest god of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600‚Äì1046 BCE) pantheon. In the Warring States period (c. 475‚Äì221 BCE), the term di on its own could also refer to the deities associated with the five Sacred Mountains of China and colors. Huangdi (), the \\"yellow di\\", was one of the latter. To emphasize the religious meaning of di in pre-imperial times, historians of early China commonly translate the god's name as \\"Yellow Thearch\\" and the first emperor's title as \\"August Thearch\\", in which \\"thearch\\" refers to a godly ruler. In the late Warring States period, the Yellow Emperor was integrated into the cosmological scheme of the Five Phases, in which the color yellow represents the earth phase, the Yellow Dragon, and the center. The correlation of the colors in association with different dynasties was mentioned in the L√ºshi Chunqiu (late 3rd century BCE), where the Yellow Emperor's reign was seen to be governed by earth. The character huang (\\"yellow\\") was often used in place of the homophonous huang , which means \\"august\\" (in the sense of 'distinguished') or \\"radiant\\", giving Huangdi attributes close to those of Shangdi, the Shang supreme god. Xuanyuan and Youxiong The Records of the Grand Historian, compiled by Sima Qian in the first century BCE, gives the Yellow Emperor's name as \\"Xuan Yuan\\" (). Third-century scholar Huangfu Mi, who wrote a work on the sovereigns of antiquity, commented that Xuanyuan was the name of a hill where Huangdi had lived and that he later took as a name. The Qing dynasty scholar Liang Yusheng (, 1745‚Äì1819) argued instead that the hill was named after the Yellow Emperor. Xuanyuan is also the name of the star Regulus in Chinese, the star being associated with Huangdi in traditional astronomy.Ho, Peng Yoke. Li, Qi and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China. Courier Corporation, 2000. . p. 135 He is also associated to the broader constellations Leo and Lynx, of which the latter is said to represent the body of the Yellow Dragon ( Hu√°ngl√≥ng), Huangdi's animal form. Huangdi was also referred to as \\"Youxiong\\" (). This name has been interpreted as either a place name or a clan name. According to British sinologist Herbert Allen Giles (1845‚Äì1935), that name was \\"taken from that of [Huangdi's] hereditary principality\\". William Nienhauser, a modern translator of the Records of the Grand Historian, states that Huangdi was originally the head of the Youxiong clan, which lived near what is now Xinzheng in Henan. R√©mi Mathieu, a French historian of Chinese myths and religion, translates \\"Youxiong\\" as \\"possessor of bears\\" and links Huangdi to the broader theme of the bear in world mythology.

Historicity Map of tribes and tribal unions in Ancient China, including tribes of Huang Di (Yellow Emperor), Yan Di (Flame Emperor) and Chiyou The Chinese historian Sima Qianand much Chinese historiography following himconsidered the Yellow Emperor to be a more historical figure than earlier legendary figures such as Fu Xi, N√ºwa, and Shennong. Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian begins with the Yellow Emperor, while passing over the others., and chapter endnotes. Throughout most of Chinese history, the Yellow Emperor and the other ancient sages were considered to be historical figures. Their historicity started to be questioned in the 1920s by historians such as Gu Jiegang, one of the founders of the Doubting Antiquity School in China. In their attempts to prove that the earliest figures of Chinese history were mythological, Gu and his followers argued that these ancient sages were originally gods who were later depicted as humans by the rationalist intellectuals of the Warring States period. (description of Gu's general purpose); (rest of the information). Yang Kuan, a member of the same current of historiography, noted that only in the Warring States period had the Yellow Emperor started to be described as the first ruler of China.. Yang thus argued that Huangdi was a later transformation of Shangdi, the supreme god of the Shang dynasty's pantheon.. Also in the 1920s, French scholars Henri Maspero and Marcel Granet published critical studies of China's accounts of high antiquity.. In his Danses et l√©gendes de la Chine ancienne [\\"Dances and legends of ancient China\\"], for example, Granet argued that these tales were \\"historicized legends\\" that said more about the time when they were written than about the time they purported to describe.. Most scholars now agree that the Yellow Emperor originated as a god who was later represented as a historical person.: \\"modern scholars of myth generally agree that the sage kings were partially humanized transformations of earlier, supernatural beings who figured in shamanistic rituals, cosmogonic myths or tales of the origins of tribes and clans.\\" K.C. Chang sees Huangdi and other cultural heroes as \\"ancient religious figures\\" who were \\"euhemerized\\" in the late Warring States and Han periods. Historian of ancient China Mark Edward Lewis speaks of the Yellow Emperor's \\"earlier nature as a god\\", whereas Roel Sterckx, a professor at University of Cambridge, calls Huangdi a \\"legendary cultural hero\\".; . Origin of the myth Twentieth-century statue of the Yellow Emperor on display at the National Palace Museum in Taipei The origin of Huangdi's mythology is unclear, but historians have formulated several hypotheses about it. Yang Kuan, a member of the Doubting Antiquity School (1920s‚Äì40s), argued that the Yellow Emperor was derived from Shangdi, the highest god of the Shang dynasty. Yang reconstructs the etymology as follows: Shangdi ‚Üí Huang Shangdi ‚Üí Huangdi ‚Üí Huangdi , in which he claims that huang (\\"yellow\\") either was a variant Chinese character for huang (\\"august\\") or was used as a way to avoid the naming taboo for the latter. Yang's view has been criticized by Mitarai Masaru and by Michael Puett. Historian Mark Edward Lewis agrees that huang and huang were often interchangeable, but disagreeing with Yang, he claims that huang meaning \\"yellow\\" appeared first. Based on what he admits is a \\"novel etymology\\" likening huang to the phonetically close wang (the \\"burned shaman\\" in Shang rainmaking rituals), Lewis suggests that \\"Huang\\" in \\"Huangdi\\" might originally have meant \\"rainmaking shaman\\" or \\"rainmaking ritual.\\" Citing late Warring States and early Han versions of Huangdi's myth, he further argues that the figure of the Yellow Emperor originated in ancient rain-making rituals in which Huangdi represented the power of rain and clouds, whereas his mythical rival Chiyou (or the Yan Emperor) stood for fire and drought. Also disagreeing with Yang Kuan's hypothesis, Sarah Allan finds it unlikely that such a popular myth as the Yellow Emperor's could have come from a taboo character. She argues instead that pre-Shang \\"'history',\\" including the story of the Yellow Emperor, \\"can all be understood as a later transformation and systematization of Shang mythology.\\" In her view, Huangdi was originally an unnamed \\"lord of the underworld\\" (or the \\"Yellow Springs\\"), the mythological counterpart of the Shang sky deity Shangdi. At the time, Shang rulers claimed that their mythical ancestors, identified with \\"the [ten] suns, birds, east, life, [and] the Lord on High\\" (i.e., Shangdi), had defeated an earlier people associated with \\"the underworld, dragons, west.\\" After the Zhou dynasty overthrew the Shang dynasty in the eleventh century BCE, Zhou leaders reinterpreted Shang myths as meaning that the Shang had vanquished a real political dynasty, which was eventually named the Xia dynasty. By Han times ‚Äì as seen in Sima Qian's account in the Shiji ‚Äì the Yellow Emperor, who as lord of the underworld had been symbolically linked to the Xia, had become a historical ruler whose descendants were thought to have founded the Xia. Given that the earliest extant mention of the Yellow Emperor was on a fourth-century BCE Chinese bronze inscription claiming that he was the ancestor of the royal house of the state of Qi, Lothar von Falkenhausen speculates that Huangdi was invented as an ancestral figure as part of a strategy to claim that all ruling clans in the \\"Zhou dynasty culture sphere\\" shared common ancestry. History of Huangdi's cult A section of the poem from the Tung Shing Earliest mention Explicit accounts of the Yellow Emperor started to appear in Chinese texts the Warring States period. \\"The most ancient extant reference\\" to Huangdi is an inscription on a bronze vessel made during the first half of the fourth century BCE by the royal family (surnamed Tian ) of the state of Qi, a powerful eastern state. (quotation); (who calls it \\"the most ancient document on Huangdi\\" [\\"le plus ancient document sur Houang Ti\\"]); (who calls the inscription \\"the earliest existing and datable source of the Yellow Emperor cult\\" and claims that the vessel dates either from 375 or 356 BCE; (who gives the date as 356 BCE); (Huangdi's \\"first appearance in early Chinese literature is a passing reference in a bronze inscription, where he is mentioned as an ancestor of the patron of the vessel\\"); (\\"earliest extant reference\\" to Huangdi is \\"in a bronze inscription dedicated by King Wei\\" (r. 357‚Äì320); . Harvard University historian Michael Puett writes that the Qi bronze inscription was one of several references to the Yellow Emperor in the fourth and third centuries BCE within accounts of the creation of the state.. Noting that many of the thinkers who were later identified as precursors of the Huang‚ÄìLao ‚Äì \\"Huangdi and Laozi\\" ‚Äì tradition came from the state of Qi, Robin D. S. Yates hypothesizes that Huang‚ÄìLao originated in that region. Warring States period The cult of Huangdi became very popular during the Warring States period (5th century‚Äì221 BCE), a period of intense competition between rival states which ended with the unification of the realm by the state of Qin. In addition to his role as ancestor, he became associated with \\"centralized statecraft\\" and emerged as a figure paradigmatic of emperorship. The state of Qin In his Shiji, Sima Qian claims that the state of Qin started worshipping the Yellow Emperor in the fifth century BCE, along with Yandi, the Fiery Emperor. The altars were established at Yong (near modern Fengxiang County in Shaanxi province), which was the capital of Qin from 677 to 383 BC. By the time of King Zheng, who became king of Qin in 247 and First Emperor of a unified China in 221 BCE, Huangdi had become by far the most important of the four \\"thearchs\\" (di ) who were then worshiped at Yong. The Shiji version The figure of Huangdi had appeared sporadically in Warring States texts. Sima Qian's Shiji (or Records of the Grand Historian, completed around 94 BCE) was the first work to turn these fragments of myths into a systematic and consistent narrative of the Yellow Emperor's \\"career\\". The Shijis account was extremely influential in shaping how the Chinese viewed the origin of their history. The Shiji begins its chronological account of Chinese history with the life of Huangdi, whom it presents as a sage sovereign from antiquity. It recounts that Huangdi's father was Shaodian and his mother was Fu Pao ().Chinareviewnews.com, \\"The ugliest among the empresses and consorts of past ages\\" . Retrieved on August 8, 2010.

The emperor had a total of 25 sons,. 14 of whom began their own surnames and clans. The oldest was Shao Hao or Xuan Xiao, who lived in Qingyang by the Yangtze River. Chang Yi, the youngest, lived by the Ruo River. When the Yellow Emperor died, he was succeeded by Chang Yi's son, Zhuan Xu. The chronological tables found in chapters 13 of the Shiji represent all past rulers ‚Äì legendary ones such as Yao and Shun, the first ancestors of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, as well as the founders of the main ruling houses in the Zhou sphere ‚Äì as descendants of Huangdi, giving the impression that Chinese history was the history of one large family.

This painting is based on the story, first recounted in the Zhuangzi, that the Yellow Emperor traveled to the Kongtong Mountains to inquire about the Dao with the Daoist sage Guangchengzi. The Yellow Emperor was credited with an enormous number of cultural legacies and esoteric teachings. While Taoism is often regarded in the West as arising from Laozi, Chinese Taoists claim the Yellow Emperor formulated many of their precepts. The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon ( Hu√°ngd√¨ N√®ijƒ´ng), which presents the doctrinal basis of traditional Chinese medicine, was named after him.

Retrieved on 2010-08-29. In Taoism In the second century CE, Huangdi's role as a deity was diminished because of the rise of a deified Laozi. A state sacrifice offered to \\"Huang-Lao jun\\" was not offered to Huangdi and Laozi, as the term Huang-Lao would have meant a few centuries earlier, but to a \\"yellow Laozi\\". Nonetheless, Huangdi kept being considered as an immortal: he was seen as a master of longevity techniques and as a god who could reveal new teachings ‚Äì in the form of texts such as the sixth-century Huangdi Yinfujing ‚Äì to his earthly followers. Twentieth century The Yellow Emperor became a powerful national symbol in the last decade of the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911) and remained dominant in Chinese nationalist discourse throughout the Republican period (1911‚Äì49). The early twentieth century is also when the Yellow Emperor was first referred to as the ancestor of all Chinese people. =Late Qing= Starting in 1903, radical publications started using the projected date of his birth as the first year of the Chinese calendar. Intellectuals such as Liu Shipei (1884‚Äì1919) found this practice necessary in order to \\"preserve the [Han] race\\" (baozhong ) from both dominance by Manchu people and foreign encroachment. Revolutionaries motivated by Anti-Manchuism such as Chen Tianhua (1875‚Äì1905), Zou Rong (1885‚Äì1905), and Zhang Binglin (1868‚Äì1936) tried to foster the racial consciousness they thought was missing from their compatriots, and thus depicted the Manchus as racially inferior barbarians who were unfit to rule over Han Chinese. Chen's widely circulated pamphlets claimed that the \\"Han race\\" formed one big family descended from the Yellow Emperor. The first issue (Nov. 1905) of the Minbao (\\"People's Journal\\"), which was founded in Tokyo by revolutionaries of the Tongmenghui, featured the Yellow Emperor on its cover and called Huangdi \\"the first great nationalist of the world.\\" It was one of several nationalist magazines that featured the Yellow Emperor on their cover in the early twentieth century. The fact that Huangdi meant \\"yellow\\" emperor also served to buttress the theory that he was the originator of the \\"yellow race\\". Many historians interpret this sudden popularity of the Yellow Emperor as a reaction to the theories of French scholar Albert Terrien de Lacouperie (1845‚Äì94), who in a book called The Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization, from 2300 B.C. to 200 A.D. (1892) had claimed that Chinese civilization was founded around 2300 BCE by Babylonian immigrants. Lacouperie's \\"Sino-Babylonianism\\" posited that Huangdi was a Mesopotamian tribal leader who had led a massive migration of his people into China around 2300 BCE and founded what later became Chinese civilization. European sinologists quickly rejected these theories, but in 1900 two Japanese historians, Shirakawa Jir≈ç and Kokubu Tanenori, omitted these criticisms and published a long summary that presented Lacouperie's views as the most advanced Western scholarship on China. Chinese scholars were quickly attracted by \\"the historicization of Chinese mythology\\" that the two Japanese authors advocated. Anti-Manchu intellectuals and activists who searched for China's \\"national essence\\" (guocui ) adapted Sino-Babylonianism to their needs. Zhang Binglin explained Huangdi's battle with Chi You as a conflict opposing the newly arrived civilized Mesopotamians to backward local tribes, a battle that transformed China into one of the most civilized places in the world. Zhang's reinterpretation of Sima Qian's account \\"underscored the need to recover the glory of early China.\\" Liu Shipei also presented these early times as the golden age of Chinese civilization. In addition to tying the Chinese to an ancient center of human civilization in Mesopotamia, Lacouperie's theories suggested that China should be ruled by the descendants of Huangdi. In a controversial essay called History of the Yellow Race (Huangshi ), which was published serially from 1905 to 1908, Huang Jie (; 1873‚Äì1935) claimed that the \\"Han race\\" was the true master of China because it was descended from the Yellow Emperor. Reinforced by the values of filial piety and the Chinese patrilineal clan, the racial vision defended by Huang and others turned vengeance against the Manchus into a duty owed to one's ancestors. =Republican period= The Yellow Emperor continued to be revered after the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty. In 1912, for instance, banknotes carrying Huangdi's effigy were issued by the new Republican government. After 1911, however, the Yellow Emperor as national symbol changed from first progenitor of the Han race to ancestor of China's entire multi-ethnic population. Under the ideology of the Five Races Under One Union, Huangdi became the common ancestor of the Han Chinese, the Manchu people, the Mongols, the Tibetans, and the Hui people, who were said to form the Zhonghua minzu, a broadly understood Chinese nation. Sixteen state ceremonies were held between 1911 and 1949 to Huangdi as the \\"founding ancestor of the Chinese nation\\" () and even \\"the founding ancestor of human civilization\\" (). Modern significance Xuanyuan Temple, dedicated to the worship of Huangdi, in Huangling, Yan'an, Shaanxi The cult of the Yellow Emperor was forbidden in the People's Republic of China until the end of the Cultural Revolution. The prohibition was halted during the 1980s when the government reversed itself and resurrected the \\"Yellow Emperor cult\\". Starting in the 1980s, the cult was revived and phrases relating to the \\"Descendants of Yan and Huang\\" were sometimes used by the Chinese state when referring to people of Chinese descent. In 1984, for example, Deng Xiaoping argued for Chinese reunification saying \\"Taiwan is rooted in the hearts of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor,\\" whereas in 1986 the PRC acclaimed the Chinese-American astronaut Taylor Wang as the first of the Yellow Emperor's descendants to travel in space. In the first half of the 1980s, the Party had internally debated whether this usage would make ethnic minorities feel excluded. After consulting experts from Beijing University, the Chinese Academy of Social Science, and the Central Nationalities Institute, the Central Propaganda Department recommended on March 27, 1985, that the Party speak of the Zhonghua Minzu ‚Äì the \\"Chinese nation\\" broadly defined ‚Äì in official statements, but that the phrase \\"sons and grand-sons of Yandi and the Yellow Emperor\\" could be used in informal statements by party leaders and in \\"relations with Hong Kong and Taiwanese compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots\\". After retreating to Taiwan in late 1949 at the end of the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang (KMT) ruled that the Republic of China (ROC) would keep paying homage to the Yellow Emperor on April 4, the National Tomb Sweeping Day, but neither he nor the three presidents that succeeded him ever paid homage in person.. In 1955, the KMT, which was led by Mandarin speakers and still poised on retaking the mainland from the Communists, sponsored the production of the movie Children of the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi zisun ), which was filmed mostly in Taiwanese Hokkien and showed extensive passages of Taiwanese folk opera. Directed by Bai Ke (1914‚Äì1964), a former assistant of Yuan Muzhi, it was a propaganda effort to convince speakers of Taiyu that they were linked to mainland people by common blood. In 2009 Ma Ying-jeou was the first ROC president to celebrate the Tomb Sweeping Day rituals for Huangdi in person, on which occasion he proclaimed that both Chinese culture and common descent from the Yellow Emperor united people from Taiwan and the mainland. Later the same year, Lien Chan ‚Äì a former Vice President of the Republic of China who is now Honorary Chairman of the Kuomintang ‚Äì and his wife Lien Fang Yu paid homage at the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor in Huangling, Yan'an, in mainland China.. Gay studies researcher Louis Crompton... has cited Ji Yun's report in his popular Notes from the Yuewei Hermitage (1800), that some claimed the Yellow Emperor was the first Chinese to take male bedmates, a claim that Ji Yun dismissed. Ji Yun argued that this was probably a false attribution.. Elements of Huangdi's myth turtle-based steles at Shou Qiu, Qufu, Shandong, the legendary birthplace of the Yellow Emperor As with any myth, there are numerous versions of Huangdi's story, emphasizing different themes and interpreting the main character's significance in different ways. Birth According to Huangfu Mi (215‚Äì282), the Yellow Emperor was born in Shou Qiu (\\"Longevity Hill\\"),, note 6. which is today on the outskirts of the city of Qufu in Shandong. Early on, he lived with his tribe near the Ji River ‚Äì Edwin Pulleyblank states that \\"there seems to be no record of a Ji River outside the myth\\" ‚Äì and later migrated to Zhuolu in modern-day Hebei. He then became a farmer and tamed six different special beasts: the bear (), the brown bear (), the p√≠ () and xi≈´ () (which later combined to form the mythical Pixiu), the ferocious ch≈´ (), and the tiger (). Huangdi is sometimes said to have been the fruit of extraordinary birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning bolt from the Big Dipper. She delivered her son on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan, after which he was named.Yves Bonnefoy, Asian Mythologies.

In traditional Chinese accounts, the Yellow Emperor is credited with improving the livelihood of the nomadic hunters of his tribe. He teaches them how to build shelters, tame wild animals, and grow the Five Grains, although other accounts credit Shennong with the last. He invents carts, boats, and clothing. Other inventions credited to the emperor include the Chinese diadem (), throne rooms (), the bow sling, early Chinese astronomy, the Chinese calendar, math calculations, code of sound laws (),. and cuju, an early Chinese version of football.Liu Xiang (77‚Äì6 BCE), Bielu Ôºö\\"It is said that cuju was invented by Huangdi; others claim that it arose during the Warring States period\\" (); cited in Book of the Later Han (5th century), chapter 34, p. 1178 of the standard Zhonghua shuju edition.

In traditional accounts, he also goads the historian Cangjie into creating the first Chinese character writing system, the Oracle bone script, and his principal wife Leizu invents sericulture and teaches his people how to weave silk and dye clothes.

Retrieved on 2010-09-04.. This beast explained to him there were 11,522 (or 1,522) kinds of supernatural creatures. Chi You, the mythical opponent of the Yellow Emperor at the Battle of Zhuolu, here depicted in a Han-dynasty tomb relief Battles The Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor were both leaders of a tribe or a combination of two tribes near the Yellow River. The Yan Emperor hailed from a different area around the Jiang River, which a geographical work called the Shuijingzhu identified as a stream near Qishan in what was the Zhou homeland before they defeated the Shang. Both emperors lived in a time of warfare.. The Yan Emperor proving unable to control the disorder within his realm, the Yellow Emperor took up arms to establish his domination over various warring factions. According to traditional accounts, the Yan Emperor meets the force of the \\"Nine Li\\" () under their bronze-headed leader, Chi You, and his 81 horned and four-eyed brothers and suffers a decisive defeat. He flees to Zhuolu and begs the Yellow Emperor for help. During the ensuing Battle of Zhuolu the Yellow Emperor employs his tamed animals and Chi You darkens the sky by breathing out a thick fog. This leads the emperor to develop the south-pointing chariot, which he uses to lead his army out of the miasma. He next calls upon the drought demon N√ºba to dispel Chi You's storm. He then destroys the Nine Li and defeats Chi You. Later he engages in battle with the Yan Emperor, defeating him at Banquan and replacing him as the primary ruler. Death The Yellow Emperor was said to have lived for over a hundred years before meeting a phoenix and a qilin and then dying.

Modern-day Chinese people sometimes refer to themselves as the \\"Descendants of Yan and Yellow Emperor\\", although non-Han minority groups in China may have their own myths or not count as descendants of the emperor.. Meaning as a deity=Symbol of the centre of the universe Jinyun, Lishui, Zhejiang, China As the Yellow Deity with Four Faces ( Hu√°ngd√¨ S√¨mi√†n) he represents the centre of the universe and vision of the unity which controls the four directions. It is explained in the Huangdi Sijing (\\"Four Scriptures of the Yellow Emperor\\") that regulating \\"heart within brings order without\\". In order to reign one must \\"reduce himself\\" abandoning emotions, \\"drying up like a corpse\\", never allowing oneself to be carried away, as according to the myth the Yellow Emperor himself did during his three years of refuge on Mount Bowang in order to find himself. This practice creates an internal void where all the vital forces of creation gather, and the more indeterminate they remain and the more powerful they will be. It is from this centre that equilibrium and harmony emanate, equilibrium of the vital organs which becomes harmony between the person and the environment. As sovereign of the centre, the Yellow Emperor is the very image of the concentration or re-centering of the self. By self-control, taking charge of his own body one becomes powerful without. The centre is also the vital point in the microcosm by means of which the internal universe viewed as an altar is created. The body is a universe, and by going into himself and by incorporating the fundamental structures of the universe, the sage will gain access to the gates of Heaven, the unique point where communication between Heaven, Earth and Man can occur. The centre is the convergence of within and without, the contraction of chaos on the point which is equidistant from all directions. It is the place which is no place, where all creation is born and dies. The Great Deity of the Central Peak ( Zh≈çngyu√®d√†d√¨) is another epithet representing Huangdi as the hub of creation, the axis mundi (which in Chinese mythology is Kunlun) that is the manifestation of the divine order in physical reality, that opens to immortality. As ancestor Throughout history, several sovereigns and dynasties claimed (or were claimed) to descend from the Yellow Emperor. Sima Qian's Shiji presented Huangdi as ancestor of the two legendary rulers Yao and Shun, and traced various lines of descent from Huangdi to the founders of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. He claimed that Liu Bang, the first emperor of the Han dynasty, was a descendant of Huangdi. He accepted that the ruling house of the Qin dynasty was also issued from the Yellow Emperor, but by stating that Qin Shihuang was in fact the child of Qin chancellor L√º Buwei, he perhaps meant to leave the First Emperor out of Huangdi's descent. Claiming descent from illustrious ancestors remained a common tool of political legitimacy in the following ages. Wang Mang (c. 45 BCE ‚Äì 23 CE), of the short-lived Xin dynasty, claimed to descend from the Yellow Emperor in order to justify his overthrow of the Han. As he announced in January of 9 CE: \\"I possess no virtue, [but] I rely upon the fact that] I am a descendant of my august original ancestor, the Yellow Emperor...\\" About two hundred years later a ritual specialist named Dong Ba , who worked for at the court of the Cao Wei, which had recently succeeded the Han, promoted the idea that the Cao family was descended from Huangdi via Emperor Zhuanxu. During the Tang dynasty, non-Han rulers also claimed descent from the Yellow Emperor, for individual and national prestige, as well as to connect themselves to the Tang. Most Chinese noble families also claimed descent from Huangdi. This practice was well established in Tang and Song times, when hundreds of clans claimed such descent. The main support for this theory ‚Äì as recorded in the Tongdian (801 AD) and the Tongzhi (mid 12th century) ‚Äì was the Shijis statement that Huangdi's 25 sons were given 12 different surnames, and that these surnames had diversified into all Chinese surnames. After Emperor Zhenzong (r. 997‚Äì1022) of the Song dynasty dreamed of a figure he was told was the Yellow Emperor, the Song imperial family started to claim Huangdi as its first ancestor. A number of overseas Chinese clans that keep a genealogy also trace their family ultimately to Huangdi, explaining their different surnames as name changes claimed to have derived from the fourteen surnames of Huangdi's descendants. Many Chinese clans, both overseas and in China, claim Huangdi as their ancestor to reinforce their sense of being Chinese. Gun, Yu, Zhuanxu, Zhong, Li, Shujun, and Yuqiang are various emperors, gods, and heroes whose ancestor was also supposed to be Huangdi. The Huantou, Miaomin, and Quanrong peoples were said to be descended from Huangdi. Traditional dates Martino Martini, a seventeenth-century Jesuit who, based on Chinese historical records, calculated that the Yellow Emperor's reign began in 2697 BCE. Martini's dates are still used today. Although the traditional Chinese calendar did not mark years continuously, some Han-dynasty astronomers tried to determine the years of the life and reign of the Yellow Emperor. In 78 BCE, under the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han, an official called Zhang Shouwang () calculated that 6,000 years had passed since the time of Huangdi; the court refused his proposal for reform, countering that only 3,629 years had elapsed. In the proleptic Julian calendar, the court's calculations would have placed the Yellow Emperor in the late 38th century BCE rather than in the 27th century BCE that is conventional nowadays. During their Jesuit missions in China in the seventeenth century, the Jesuits tried to determine what year should be considered the epoch of the Chinese calendar. In his Sinicae historiae decas prima (first published in Munich in 1658), Martino Martini (1614‚Äì1661) dated the royal ascension of Huangdi to 2697 BCE, but started the Chinese calendar with the reign of Fuxi, which he claimed started in 2952 BCE. Philippe Couplet's (1623‚Äì1693) \\"Chronological table of Chinese monarchs\\" (Tabula chronologica monarchiae sinicae; 1686) also gave the same date for the Yellow Emperor. The Jesuits' dates provoked great interest in Europe, where they were used for comparisons with Biblical chronology. Modern Chinese chronology has generally accepted Martini's dates, except that it usually places the reign of Huangdi in 2698 BCE (see next paragraph) and omits Huangdi's predecessors Fuxi and Shennong, who are considered \\"too legendary to include.\\" Helmer Aslaksen, a mathematician who teaches at the National University of Singapore and specializes in the Chinese calendar, explains that those who use 2698 BCE as a first year probably do so because they want to have \\"a year 0 as the starting point\\", or because \\"they assume that the Yellow Emperor started his year with the Winter solstice of 2698 BCE\\", hence the difference with the year 2697 BCE calculated by the Jesuits.Helmer Aslaksen, \\"The Mathematics of the Chinese Calendar,\\" section \\"Which Year is it in the Chinese Calendar?\\" (retrieved on 2011-11-18) Starting in 1903, radical publications started using the projected date of birth of the Yellow Emperor as the first year of the Chinese calendar. Different newspapers and magazines proposed different dates. Jiangsu, for example counted 1905 as year 4396 (making 2491 BCE the first year of the Chinese calendar), whereas the Minbao (the organ of the Tongmenghui) reckoned 1905 as 4603 (first year: 2698 BCE). Liu Shipei (1884‚Äì1919) created the Yellow Emperor Calendar to show the unbroken continuity of the Han race and Han culture from earliest times. There is no evidence that this calendar was used before the 20th century. Liu's calendar started with the birth of the Yellow Emperor, which was reckoned to be 2711 BCE. When Sun Yat-sen declared the foundation of the Republic of China on January 2, 1912, he decreed that this was the 12th day of the 11th month of year 4609 (epoch: 2698 BCE), but that the state would now be using the solar calendar and count 1912 as the first year of the Republic. Chronological tables published in the 1938 edition of the Cihai () dictionary followed Sun Yat-sen in using 2698 as the year of Huangdi's accession; this chronology is now \\"widely reproduced, with little variation.\\" Cultural references * The emperor appears as an ancestor hero in the strategy game Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom made by Sierra Entertainment.

The term originates in the 16th-century works of Paracelsus, who describes sylphs as (invisible) beings of the air, his elementals of air. Since the term sylph itself originates with Paracelsus, there is relatively little pre-Paracelsian legend and mythology that can be confidently associated with it, but a significant number of subsequent literary and occult works have been inspired by the idea. Robert Alfred Vaughan noted that \\"the wild but poetical fantasies\\" of Paracelsus had probably exercised a larger influence over his age and the subsequent one than is generally supposed, particularly on the Rosicrucians, but that through the 18th century they had become reduced to \\"machinery for the playwright\\" and \\"opera figurantes with wings of gauze and spangles\\". Paracelsus' conception La Sylphide Bourbon, A.M. Bininger & Co. Bourbon advertising label in the shape of a glass showing a man pursuing three sylphs The Swiss German physician and alchemist Paracelsus first coined the term sylph in the 16th century to describe an air spirit in his overarching scheme of elemental spirits associated with the four Classical elements. Paracelsus drew from earlier sources, but his systematic treatment of the idea was definitive, with the names of three of the four types having originated in his works. The other three elemental spirits named were Gnomes (earth), Salamanders (fire), and Undines (water). These ideas were adopted in Rosicrucianism and were widely encountered in subsequent hermetic literature. In the Liber de Nymphis of the Philosophia Magna, Paracelsus discusses the characteristics of the elementals at length. Sylphs, he says, are rougher, coarser, taller, and strongerreuher, gr√∂ber, lenger und sterker than humans. The elementals are said to be able to move through their own elements as human beings move through air. Because of this, sylphs are the closest to humans in his conception because they move through air like we do, while in fire they burn, in water they drown, and in earth, they get stuck. In literature The French pseudo-novel Comte de Gabalis (1670) was important in passing sylphs into the literary sphere. It appears to have originated the derivative term \\"sylphid\\" (French sylphide), which it uses as the feminine counterpart to \\"sylph\\". While modern scholars consider Comte de Gabalis to have been intended as a satire of occult philosophy, many of its contemporaries considered it to be an earnest exposition of occult lore. Its author, Abb√© de Montfaucon de Villars, was assassinated on the road in 1673 and one rumor had it that he had been killed by a gang of sylphs for disclosing their secrets. One of the best- known discussions of sylphs comes with Alexander Pope. In Rape of the Lock (final ed. 1717), Pope satirizes French Rosicrucian and alchemical writings when he invents a theory to explain the sylph. In a parody of heroic poetry and the \\"dark\\" and \\"mysterious\\" alchemical literature, and in particular the sometimes esoterically Classical heroic poetry of the 18th century in England and France, Pope pretends to have a new alchemy, in which the sylph is the mystically, chemically condensed humors of peevish women. In Pope's poem, women who are full of spleen and vanity turn into sylphs when they die because their spirits are too full of dark vapors to ascend to the skies. Belinda, the heroine of Pope's poem, is attended by a small army of sylphs, who foster her vanity and guard her beauty. The poem is a parody of Paracelsian ideas, inasmuch as Pope imitates the pseudo-science of alchemy to explain the seriousness with which vain women approach the dressing room. In a slight parody of the divine battle in Pope's Rape of the Lock, when the Baron of the poem attempts to cut a lock of Belinda's hair, the sylphs interpose their airy bodies between the blades of the scissors (to no effect whatsoever). Ariel, the chief sylph in the Rape of the Lock, has the same name as Prospero's servant Ariel in Shakespeare's The Tempest (ca. 1611), and Shakespeare's character is described literally as an \\"airy spirit\\" in the dramatis personae.Shakespeare, William. The Tempest. Vol. XLVI, Part 5. The Harvard Classics. New York: P.F. Collier & Son, 1909‚Äì14; Bartleby.com, 2001. www.bartleby.com/46/5/ This name is generally thought to have been original with Shakespeare, though the exact inspiration for the character is unclear.Johnson, W. Stacy. \\"The Genesis of Ariel.\\" Shakespeare Quarterly. (July 1951) 2.3 pgs. 205-210 Pope explicitly cited Comte de Gabalis as a source for elemental lore in the dedication. In the 1778 British novel The Sylph, a sylph appears as a guardian spirit for the female protagonist. By 1765, the French author Jean-Fran√ßois Marmontel had found the sylph legend notable enough that he included among his Moral Tales the story of \\"the Sylph- Husband,\\" in which a young woman obsessed with the idea of marrying a sylph is deluded into falling in love with her arranged-husband after he impersonates one. Marie Taglioni in La Sylphide In ballet and opera The famous ballet La Sylphide (\\"The (Female) Sylph\\", Paris, 1832) is a prominent example of sylph lore in theater in the 19th century. It appeared in a second version in Denmark in 1836. A similarly themed opera The Mountain Sylph appeared in England in 1834. Sylphs again took to the stage in the 1909 ballet Les Sylphides. In popular culture *Willow, a character in Terry Brooks' Magic Kingdom of Landover series of novels (1986), is a sylph and the wife of protagonist Ben Holiday. She is the daughter of the River Master and a wood elemental, giving her pale green skin and emerald hair. Her dual nature is reflected in the fact that she must transform into a willow tree once every 21 days to maintain her life force. She has a tense and distant relationship with her father, as her existence serves as a permanent reminder to him of the brief relationship he desires to reclaim, but never can. And so it is to her mother that she turns for guidance. *The Silph Company, featured prominently within the Pok√©mon franchise, manufactures a device called the Silph Scope, which allows the user to view spectral entities otherwise unidentifiable to the naked eye. Association with fairies Because of their association with the ballet La Sylphide, where sylphs are identified with fairies and the medieval legends of fairyland, as well as a confusion with other \\"airy spirits\\" (e.g., in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream), a slender girl may be referred to as a sylph. \\"Sylph\\" has passed into general language as a term for minor spirits, elementals, or faeries of the air. Fantasy authors will sometimes employ sylphs in their fiction, for example creating giant artistic clouds in the skies with airy wings.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Elemental\\" p 313-4, Etymology \\"Sylph\\" is possibly a portmanteau from Latin sylvestris and nympha, sylvestris being a common synonym for sylph in Paracelsus. Anthon and Trollope note a similar usage in the Aeneid, where silvestris is taken as an elliptical form of nympha silvestris (\\"forest nymph\\"). Jacob Grimm uses this phrase as a gloss for the Anglo-Saxon wudu-m√¶r (roughly equivalent to \\"woodmare\\"), which he also takes as a metaphorical name for an echo. Jan Baptist van Helmont, a near contemporary of Paracelsus and coiner of the word \\"gas\\", uses sylvestris in the sense of \\"wild\\" to describe gaseous emissions, which may be connected to the Paracelsian usage. Thorpe's Northern Mythology connects the adjective sylvestres and the related silvaticas to European wild man legends. A related idea is that \\"sylph\\" is from a hyper-urbane respelling of a Latin neologism silves, but in either case this connection to the Latin root silva (\\"forest\\") is supported by Paracelsus' use of sylphes as a synonym for schr√∂tlein, a German word for a tree spirit or especially an earth spirit in his Liber de Sanguine ultra Mortem. An alternative theory is that it derives from the Ancient Greek œÉŒØŒªœÜŒ∑ (silphƒì), which a number of etymological sources gloss as \\"moth\\",E.g. though the most authoritative reference for Ancient Greek, A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon, is unaware of this sense and defines it as a \\"cockroach\\" or \\"book worm\\". French etymological sources often derive it from a Latin word sylphus, glossed as \\"genius\\" (in the Latin sense, a type of spirit) and only known from inscriptions rather than literary Latin.E.g. The Deutsches W√∂rterbuch however indicates that this idea arises from a 19th- century misreading of the inscription in question. Similarly, the œÉŒØŒªœÜŒ∑ etymology can be dismissed from the lack of an objective historical and thus semantic connection. The idea of an intentional portmanteau is also considered doubtful, though extensive evidence can be found that indicates that Paracelsus considered the various sylvan spirits and wild men of legend to be examples of sylphs, which he occasionally took to be earth elementals rather than air elementals.

The area is located on the Irish Sea coast, approximately a mile away from the centre of Southport. From 1894 to 1912, Birkdale and the adjoining suburb/village of Ainsdale were administered by Birkdale Urban District Council before becoming part of the county borough of Southport. Until 1 April 1974, Birkdale lay in the traditional borders of the county of Lancashire. At the 2001 census, the local government ward called Birkdale had a population of 12,265. The population of the area at the 2011 Census is shown under Birkdale(Ward)(qv). Other parts of Birkdale are included in Dukes Wardwhich contains a significant part of the village centre and the Royal Birkdale Golf ClubKew Ward and Ainsdale ward. Birkdale also inspired the name for a new urban mixed use community in the United States twelve miles north of Charlotte, North Carolina in Huntersville, North Carolina called Birkdale Village. Etymology Birkdale probably takes its name from two Old Norse words, birki meaning \\"birch-copse\\" and dalr meaning \\"dale\\" or \\"valley\\". Governance Birkdale is part of the Southport constituency for elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, it is currently represented by the Conservative Party MP, Damien Moore. For elections to Sefton Council Birkdale acts as a single electoral ward, it currently has three councillors, their names are Iain Brodie - Browne, Richard Hands, and Simon Shaw, all are members of the Liberal Democrats.

It assumes a self-conscious role of mediating the analytic, synthetic, and normative language of political inquiry and politics itself. Put simply, it is dialogue about the way politics will talk (and does speak) about itself. The language used for studying, analyzing, and describing a language is a metalanguage.

When mathematicians are concerned with utilizing the formula, signs, and language of mathematics in order to talk about the formal system itself they are engaging in a metalanguage. To discuss the system of axioms which constitutes the foundation of mathematical talk (ie., calculus or set theory), mathematicians (or any lay person) would occupy themselves with metamathematics (talk about mathematical talk).

Hair coloring, or hair dyeing, is the practice of changing the hair color. The main reasons for this are cosmetic: to cover gray or white hair, to change to a color regarded as more fashionable or desirable, or to restore the original hair color after it has been discolored by hairdressing processes or sun bleaching. Hair coloring can be done professionally by a hairdresser or independently at home. Today, hair coloring is very popular, with 75% of women and 18% of men living in Copenhagen having reported using hair dye (according to a study by the University of Copenhagen). At-home coloring in the United States reached $1.9 billion in 2011 and was expected to rise to $2.2 billion by 2016. History Diodorus Siculus, a Greek historian, described in detail how Celtic people dyed their hair blonde: \\"Their aspect is terrifying... They are very tall in stature, with rippling muscles under clear white skin. Their hair is blond, but not naturally so: they bleach it, to this day, artificially, washing it in lime and combing it back from their foreheads. They look like wood-demons, their hair thick and shaggy like a horse's mane. Some of them are clean- shaven, but others--especially those of high rank--shave their cheeks but leave a moustache that covers the whole mouth...\\". Lafayette in 1830, aged 73, with pitch-black hair (painting by Louise-Ad√©one Dr√∂lling). The dyeing of hair is an ancient art that involves treatment of the hair with various chemical compounds. In ancient times, the dyes were obtained from plants.Corbett, J. F. Hair Colorants: Chemistry and Toxicology; Micelle Press: Dorset, U.K., 1998; Thompson, R. H. \\"Naturally Occurring Quinones\\" Academic Press: New York, 1957. Some of the most well known are henna (Lawsonia inermis), indigo, Cassia obovata, senna, turmeric and amla. Others include katam (buxus dioica), black walnut hulls, red ochre and leeks. In the 1661 book Eighteen Books of the Secrets of Art & Nature, various methods of coloring hair black, gold, green, red, yellow, and white are explained. The development of synthetic dyes for hair is traced to the 1860s discovery of the reactivity of para-phenylenediamine (PPD) with air. Eug√®ne Schueller, the founder of L'Or√©al, is recognized for creating the first synthetic hair dye in 1907. In 1947 the German cosmetics firm Schwarzkopf launched the first home color product, \\"Poly Color\\". Hair dyeing is now a multibillion-dollar industry that involves the use of both plant-derived and synthetic dyes. Application techniques=Off-scalp  Hair with blonde highlights Hair color was traditionally applied to the hair as one overall color. The modern trend is to use several colors to produce streaks or gradations, but not all work on top of a single base color. These are referred to as: * Highlighting, where sections of hair are treated with lighteners * Lowlighting, where sections of hair are treated with darker hair colors * Splashlighting a horizontal band of bleached hair from ear to ear There are also newer coloring techniques such as ombr√©, shatush, balayage, airtouch, in which hair is dark on the crown and bit by bit becomes lighter toward the ends. These are off-the-scalp techniques, and can be applied by the following methods: * Foiling, where pieces of foil or plastic film are used to separate the hair to be colored, especially when applying more than one color (This ensures the color is applied only to the desired strands of hair, and protects the strands of hair not intended to be dyed.) * Cap, when a plastic cap is placed tightly on the head and strands are pulled through with a hook (This method is not frequently practiced, with the exception of highlighting short hair.) * Balayage, where hair color is painted directly onto sections of the hair with no foils used to keep the color contained (This method is growing in popularity because of its ability to look more natural.) The difference between balayage and ombr√© is that a balayage requires more precise hand-painting sections of hair and typically costs more. * Dipping or tip dyeing, similar to balayage in that the color is painted directly on the hair (This results in a more solid level of coverage on the ends of the hair.) All coloring techniques can be used with any type of color. For lightening, the hair sometimes has to be bleached before coloring. On- scalp Hair coloring can also be applied on the scalp for a more solid level of coverage * Root touch-up, where color is applied only to the most recent section of re-growth (usually the first inch of hair nearest the scalp) Root touch-ups are repeated every 4‚Äì6 weeks as the natural color grows in and becomes apparent. People who color their hair to disguise gray often have these root touch-ups. * All-over color, where the person wants all of their hair to be a different solid color * Block coloring, where the person wants two or more colors applied to their hair, resulting in dimension and contrast All coloring techniques can be used with any type of color. For lightening, the hair sometimes has to be bleached before coloring. Types  The four most common classifications are permanent, demi-permanent (sometimes called deposit only), semi-permanent, and temporary.  Permanent  Permanent hair color generally contains ammonia and must be mixed with a developer or oxidizing agent in order to permanently change hair color. Ammonia is used in permanent hair color to open the cuticle layer so that the developer and colorants together can penetrate into the cortex. The developer, or oxidizing agent, comes in various volumes. The higher the developer volume, the higher the \\"lift\\" will be of a person's natural hair pigment. Someone with dark hair wishing to achieve two or three shades lighter may need a higher developer whereas someone with lighter hair wishing to achieve darker hair will not need one as high. Timing may vary with permanent hair coloring but is typically 30 minutes or 45 minutes for those wishing to achieve maximum color change. Demi-permanent  Demi-permanent hair color is hair color that contains an alkaline agent other than ammonia (e.g. ethanolamine, sodium carbonate) and, while always employed with a developer, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in that developer may be lower than used with a permanent hair color. Since the alkaline agents employed in demi-permanent colors are less effective in removing the natural pigment of hair than ammonia these products provide no lightening of hair's color during dyeing. As the result, they cannot color hair to a lighter shade than it was before dyeing and are less damaging to hair than their permanent counterpart. Demi-permanents are much more effective at covering gray hair than semi-permanents, but less so than permanents. Demi- permanents have several advantages as compared with permanent color. Because there is essentially no lifting (i.e., removal) of natural hair color, the final color is less uniform/homogeneous than a permanent and therefore more natural looking; they are gentler on hair and therefore safer, especially for damaged hair; and they wash out over time (typically 20 to 28 shampoos), so root regrowth is less noticeable and if a change of color is desired, it is easier to achieve. Demi-permanent hair colors are not permanent but the darker shades in particular may persist longer than indicated on the packet. Semi- permanent  Semi-permanent hair coloring involves little or no developer, hydrogen peroxide or ammonia, and is thus less damaging to hair strands. The reduced amount of developer, whether peroxide or ammonia, means that hair previously damaged by applying permanent color or permanent reshaping is less likely to be damaged during the color application process. Semi-permanent hair color uses compounds of lower molecular weight than are found in temporary hair color dyes. These dyes penetrate the hair shaft only partially, because of the reduced amount of developer used. For this reason, the color will survive repeated washing, typically 4‚Äì5 shampoos or a few weeks, before undergoing significant fading or washing out entirely. Semi-permanents may still contain the suspected carcinogen p-phenylenediamine (PPD) or other related colorants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that in rats and mice chronically exposed to PPD in their diet, the PPT appears to simply depress body weight of the animals, with no other clinical signs of toxicity observed in several studies.p-Phenylenediamine, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency The final color of each strand of hair will depend on its original color and porosity. Because hair's color and porosity across the head and along the length of a hair strand, there will be subtle variations in shade across the entire head. This gives a more natural-looking result than the solid, all over color of a permanent color. Because gray or white hairs have a different starting color than other hair, they will not appear as the same shade as the rest of the hair when treated with semi-permanent color. If there are only a few grey/white hairs, the effect will usually be enough for them to blend in, but as the gray spreads, there will come a point where it will not be disguised as well. In this case, the move to permanent color can sometimes be delayed by using the semi-permanent as a base and adding highlights. Semi-permanent color cannot lighten the hair. Temporary color Temporary hair color is available in various forms including rinses, shampoos, gels, sprays, and foams. Temporary hair color is typically brighter and more vibrant than semi-permanent and permanent hair color. It is most often used to color hair for special occasions such as costume parties and Halloween. The pigments in temporary hair color are high molecular weight and cannot penetrate the cuticle layer. The color particles remain adsorbed (closely adherent) to the surface of the hair shaft and are easily removed with a single shampooing. Temporary hair color can persist on hair that is excessively dry or damaged in a way that allows for migration of the pigment to the interior of the hair shaft. Alternative color Hair and beard colored blue Alternative hair coloring products are designed to create hair colors not typically found in nature. These are also referred to as \\"vivid color\\" in the hairstyling industry. The available colors are diverse, such as the colors green and fuchsia. Permanent alternatives in some colors are available. More recently, blacklight-reactive hair dyes have been brought to market that fluoresce under blacklights, such as those often used at nightclubs. The chemical formulae of alternative color dyes typically contain only tint and have no developer. This means that they will only create the bright color of the packet if they are applied to light blond hair. Darker hair (medium brown to black) would need to be bleached in order for these pigment applications to take to the hair desirably. Some types of fair hair may also take vivid colors more fully after bleaching. Gold, yellow and orange undertones in hair that has not been lightened enough can muddy the final hair color, especially with pink, blue and green dyes. Although some alternative colors are semi-permanent, such as blue and purple, it could take several months to fully wash the color from bleached or pre-lightened hair.  Maintaining hair color  There are many ways that people can maintain their hair color, such as: * Using color-protecting shampoos and conditioners * Using sulfate-free shampoo * Using purple shampoos and conditioners to maintain or enhance the blond color in their hair * Using leave-in treatments with UV absorbents * Getting deep-conditioning treatments to smooth and add luster * Avoiding chlorine * Using heat protecting products before using styling appliances  Adverse effects  Hair coloring involves the use of chemicals capable of removing, replacing, and/or covering up pigments naturally found inside the hair shaft. Use of these chemicals can result in a range of adverse effects, including temporary skin irritation and allergy, hair breakage, skin discoloration and unexpected hair color results. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), in vitro and in vivo studies (in exposed human populations) have shown that some hair dyes and many chemicals used in the hair dyeing process can be considered mutagenic and carcinogenic. Skin irritation and allergy In certain individuals, the use of hair coloring can result in allergic reactions and/or skin irritation. Individuals allergic to gluten for example, will need to be cautious when purchasing hair color since certain hair dye includes gluten. Gluten does not need to be ingested for it to cause an allergy. Skin contact with gluten may cause a reaction; therefore, leading to an allergy. Symptoms of these reactions can include redness, sores, itching, burning sensation and discomfort. Symptoms will sometimes not be apparent immediately following the application and processing of the tint, but can also arise after hours or even a day later. To help prevent or limit allergic reactions, the majority of hair color products recommend that the client conduct a patch test before using the product. This involves mixing a small quantity of tint preparation and applying it directly to the skin for a period of 48 hours. If irritation develops, manufacturers recommend that the client not use the product. European dermatologists have, however, strongly advised against such pre-use testing, as it entails additional sensitisation (allergy) risk and the interpretation by lay people may not be sufficiently accurate. Skin discoloration Skin and fingernails are made of a similar type of keratinized protein as hair. That means that drips, slips and extra hair tint around the hairline can result in patches of discolored skin. This is more common with darker hair colors and persons with dry absorbent skin. That is why it is recommended that latex or nitrile gloves be worn to protect the hands. This discoloration will disappear as the skin naturally renews itself and the top layer of skin is removed (typically takes a few days or at most a week). Ways of preventing skin discoloration are to wear latex or nitrile gloves to protect the hands and also by applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly or oil-based preparation around the hairline. Gentle abrasives such as moist baking soda or a small amount of toothpaste applied with a toothbrush may also help remove the uppermost layer of skin and dye (neither removes just the dye). Acetone and nail polish remover are not considered effective; laundry detergent may sometimes work as may moist cigarette ash rubbed into the stained area.Alexandra Tunell, How to Get Hair Dye off Your Skin, Harper's Bazaar, Oct 2, 2016 Unintended results Several factors influence the final color of the hair following the coloring process. * For semi-permanent and demi-permanent color, the final color is a blend of the natural color of the hair and the dye color. * Bleached hair will often require pre- pigmentation before a color application. Dyeing bleached hair brown can result in grey or very ashy (grey sheen) hair. * Previously color treated hair can react unpredictably with subsequent color treatments. * Previous use of shampoos which deposit a layer of plastic on the hair can block the action of the dye. * Presence of minerals, salts, chlorine or other contaminants in the water used in the coloring process * Certain prescription drugs can alter hair chemistry * Coloring dark hair to achieve a desirable shade of blond requires bleaching, followed by a secondary color treatment. Bleached hair can still have a yellow or coppery shade. A violet-based color can cancel out yellow tones, and a blue-based shade will cancel out coppery orange. * Porosity of hair can affect the final shade. Porous hair often absorbs more color, which sometimes results darker than expected Health concerns * The salt lead acetate (the active ingredient in gradual darkening products such as Grecian formula) is toxic. Lead acetate trihydrate has also been shown to cause reproductive toxicity. * Articles link the development of some forms of cancer (including leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bladder cancer, blood cancer, and multiple myeloma) with use of hair color. More specifically, prolonged use of permanent dark hair dyes can double a person's risk of getting some types of blood cancer.Hair Dye Linked to Blood Cancer. Webmd.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-21. *In 2004 a known human carcinogen, 4-aminobiphenyl or 4-ABP, was found in some commercial hair dyes. However, evidence is limited and inconsistent for the link between cancer from hair dye.Hair Dyes and Cancer Risk ‚Äì National Cancer Institute. Cancer.gov (2009-10-09). Retrieved on 2010-12-21. *Phenylenediamine is known to cause health concerns, such as skin irritation. Exposure to phenylenediamine can occur during manufacturing or during the use of hair dyes. According to the Product Safety Summary Sheet by DuPont, Para-Phenyenediamine (PPD) is labeled as toxic and can cause adverse effects on aquatic organisms and could cause long-term effects in aquatic environments. In October 2017, the leading breast surgeon Professor Kefah Mokbel published a meta-analysis showing that use of hair dyes might increase the risk of developing breast cancer by 20% among users. Chemistry of permanent hair coloring Permanent hair coloring requires three components: (1) 1,4-diaminobenzene (historically) or 2,5-diaminotoluene (currently), (2) a coupling agent, and (3) an oxidant. The process is typically performed under basic conditions. The mechanism of oxidation dyes involves three steps: 1) Oxidation of 1,4-diaminobenzene derivative to the quinone state. 2) Reaction of this diimine with a coupler compound (more detail below). 3) Oxidation of the resulting compound to give the final dye. The preparation (dye precursors) is in the leuco (colorless) form. Oxidizing agents are usually hydrogen peroxide, and the alkaline environment is usually provided by ammonia. The combination of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia causes the natural hair to be lightened, providing a \\"blank canvas\\" for the dye. Ammonia opens the hair shaft pores so that the dye can actually diffuse inside the fiber. These dye intermediates and coupler compounds can undergo oxidation and coupling reaction as shown in the scheme below to form high molecular weight products, which are trapped in the hair matrix and cannot be readily removed through washing. Various combinations of primary intermediates and coupler compounds provide a spectrum of shades of hair colors. The primary intermediates are aromatic para compounds, such as 1,4-diaminobenzene or 4-aminophenol. The coupler compounds (couplers) are meta-substituted derivatives of aniline. They come in three major classes based on the color that they produce when they react with the primary intermediate. :Couplers are chemical compounds that define the color of the hair dye. Shown here are three red couplers (A, B, C), two yellow-green couplers (D, E) and a blue coupler (F). *Blue couplers include 1,3-diaminobenzene and its derivatives. *Red couplers include phenols and naphthols, such as 3-aminophenol (CAS#591-27-5), 5-amino-2-methylphenol (CAS#2835-95-2) and 1-naphthol (CAS#90-15-3). The combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler 3-aminophenol gives a magenta-brown dye, while the combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler 1-naphthol gives a purple dye. *Yellow-green couplers include resorcinol, 4-chlororesorcinol, and benzodioxoles. These compounds produce broad-band absorption when they react to form dyes, allowing for more natural-looking hair colors. The combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler resorcinol gives a greenish brown dye. The first step shows the oxidation of p-phenylenediamine to the quinonediimine (C6H4(NH)2): ::200px This species exists in equilibrium with the monoprotonated form (C6H4(NH)(NH2)+) (not shown). The second step involves the attack of this quinonediimine on the coupler. In organic chemistry, this reaction is called electrophilic aromatic substitution: :520px In the third and final step, the product from the quinonediimine-coupler reaction oxidizes to the final hair dye. :520px It was once believed that the dye forms in the above reaction bonds to hair permanently.\\"Hair Preparations,\\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim (2006). It was later shown that the main reason that this reaction imparts a permanent color on hair is that it produces larger dye molecules, which is locked inside the hair.Alexander Chan, Sean Kung, (September, 2006), \\"Hair Colorant Technology Advances Further\\", Personal Care, p. 11-16 Plant-based dyes Henna is an orange dye commonly used as a deposit-only hair color whose active component, lawsone, binds to keratin. It is therefore considered semi-permanent to permanent, depending on a person's hair type. Most people will achieve a permanent color from henna, especially after the second dye. With repeated use the orange color builds up into red and then auburn. While \\"natural\\" henna is generally a red color, variations exist. These variations usually contain ingredients from other plants and even synthetic dyes. Indigo is natural dye from a plant (Indigofera tinctoria, suffructicosa, or arrecta) that can be added to henna or layered on top of it to create brown to black colors in the hair. Henna is orange, and indigo is blue, so as complementaries on a standard color wheel, the two colors' combined effect is to create brown tones. Like henna, indigo may fade after one application, but it becomes permanent on the hair with repeated use. Using a plant-based color such as henna can cause problems later when trying to do a perm or permanent hair color. Some store- bought henna contains metallic salts which reacts to hydrogen peroxide that is used in hair lightening. This may lead to unpredictable results, such as green or blue tones in the hair. Henna is a healthy way to color hair, as long as no metallic salts are used. In 2018, a system for making semi-permanent hair dyes from renewable waste blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) fruit skins from the fruit pressing industry was developed. Anthocyanin pigments were extracted from the blackcurrant skin waste and formulated into hair dyes. The dyes showed high buildup on hair and gave an intense blue color, which was stable to multiple washes.  Legal restrictions  Hair dyes are cosmetic compounds that make contact with the skin during application. Because of this skin contact, there exists some health risk associated with use of hair dyes. Thus, hair dyes are regulated in the commercial marketplace and, as new toxicity data is generated for some hair dyes and health risks are discovered, some of these hair dyes are being legally restricted from the cosmetic marketplace. The European Union is particularly stringent with regard to health regulations. To ensure that hair dyes contain only safe substances, the European Commission adopted the Directive 2012/21/EU to restrict the use of around 45 chemicals in hair dyes.\\"Commission implementing Directive 2012/21/EU\\", Official Journal of the European Union, 2 August 2012, Retrieved 7 April 2015 The directive on dyes is part of a general and comprehensive set of regulations, the EU Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EC.  Religion  For Muslims, if a man is not of advanced age, there is no harm in his using black dye. Some of the early Muslims, including some sahabah, permitted the use of black dye. As narrated in a hadith, the best thing with which to dye gray hair is henna and katm (a plant from Yemen which colors it black tinged with red).

In mathematics, a moving frame is a flexible generalization of the notion of an ordered basis of a vector space often used to study the extrinsic differential geometry of smooth manifolds embedded in a homogeneous space. Introduction In lay terms, a frame of reference is a system of measuring rods used by an observer to measure the surrounding space by providing coordinates. A moving frame is then a frame of reference which moves with the observer along a trajectory (a curve). The method of the moving frame, in this simple example, seeks to produce a \\"preferred\\" moving frame out of the kinematic properties of the observer. In a geometrical setting, this problem was solved in the mid 19th century by Jean Fr√©d√©ric Frenet and Joseph Alfred Serret. The Frenet‚ÄìSerret frame is a moving frame defined on a curve which can be constructed purely from the velocity and acceleration of the curve.D. J. Struik, Lectures on classical differential geometry, p. 18 The Frenet‚ÄìSerret frame plays a key role in the differential geometry of curves, ultimately leading to a more or less complete classification of smooth curves in Euclidean space up to congruence. The Frenet‚ÄìSerret formulas show that there is a pair of functions defined on the curve, the torsion and curvature, which are obtained by differentiating the frame, and which describe completely how the frame evolves in time along the curve. A key feature of the general method is that a preferred moving frame, provided it can be found, gives a complete kinematic description of the curve. orthogonal unit vectors e1, e2, and e3 which is adapted to a surface in the sense that P lies on the surface, and e3 is perpendicular to the surface. In the late 19th century, Gaston Darboux studied the problem of constructing a preferred moving frame on a surface in Euclidean space instead of a curve, the Darboux frame (or the tri√®dre mobile as it was then called). It turned out to be impossible in general to construct such a frame, and that there were integrability conditions which needed to be satisfied first. Later, moving frames were developed extensively by √âlie Cartan and others in the study of submanifolds of more general homogeneous spaces (such as projective space). In this setting, a frame carries the geometric idea of a basis of a vector space over to other sorts of geometrical spaces (Klein geometries). Some examples of frames are: * A linear frame is an ordered basis of a vector space. * An orthonormal frame of a vector space is an ordered basis consisting of orthogonal unit vectors (an orthonormal basis). * An affine frame of an affine space consists of a choice of origin along with an ordered basis of vectors in the associated difference space.\\"Affine frame\\" Proofwiki.org * A Euclidean frame of an affine space is a choice of origin along with an orthonormal basis of the difference space. * A projective frame on n-dimensional projective space is an ordered collection of n+1 linearly independent points in the space. * Frame fields in general relativity are four-dimensional frames, or vierbeins, in German. In each of these examples, the collection of all frames is homogeneous in a certain sense. In the case of linear frames, for instance, any two frames are related by an element of the general linear group. Projective frames are related by the projective linear group. This homogeneity, or symmetry, of the class of frames captures the geometrical features of the linear, affine, Euclidean, or projective landscape. A moving frame, in these circumstances, is just that: a frame which varies from point to point. Formally, a frame on a homogeneous space G/H consists of a point in the tautological bundle G ‚Üí G/H. A moving frame is a section of this bundle. It is moving in the sense that as the point of the base varies, the frame in the fibre changes by an element of the symmetry group G. A moving frame on a submanifold M of G/H is a section of the pullback of the tautological bundle to M. IntrinsicallySee Cartan (1983) 9.I; Appendix 2 (by Hermann) for the bundle of tangent frames. Fels and Olver (1998) for the case of more general fibrations. Griffiths (1974) for the case of frames on the tautological principal bundle of a homogeneous space. a moving frame can be defined on a principal bundle P over a manifold. In this case, a moving frame is given by a G-equivariant mapping œÜ : P ‚Üí G, thus framing the manifold by elements of the Lie group G. One can extend the notion of frames to a more general case: one can \\"solder\\" a fiber bundle to a smooth manifold, in such a way that the fibers behave as if they were tangent. When the fiber bundle is a homogenous space, this reduces to the above-described frame-field. When the homogenous space is a quotient of special orthogonal groups, this reduces to the standard conception of a vierbein. Although there is a substantial formal difference between extrinsic and intrinsic moving frames, they are both alike in the sense that a moving frame is always given by a mapping into G. The strategy in Cartan's method of moving frames, as outlined briefly in Cartan's equivalence method, is to find a natural moving frame on the manifold and then to take its Darboux derivative, in other words pullback the Maurer-Cartan form of G to M (or P), and thus obtain a complete set of structural invariants for the manifold.  Method of the moving frame  formulated the general definition of a moving frame and the method of the moving frame, as elaborated by . The elements of the theory are * A Lie group G. * A Klein space X whose group of geometric automorphisms is G. * A smooth manifold Œ£ which serves as a space of (generalized) coordinates for X. * A collection of frames ∆í each of which determines a coordinate function from X to Œ£ (the precise nature of the frame is left vague in the general axiomatization). The following axioms are then assumed to hold between these elements: * There is a free and transitive group action of G on the collection of frames: it is a principal homogeneous space for G. In particular, for any pair of frames ∆í and ∆í‚Ä≤, there is a unique transition of frame (∆í‚Üí∆í‚Ä≤) in G determined by the requirement (∆í‚Üí∆í‚Ä≤)∆í = ∆í‚Ä≤. * Given a frame ∆í and a point A ‚àà X, there is associated a point x = (A,∆í) belonging to Œ£. This mapping determined by the frame ∆í is a bijection from the points of X to those of Œ£. This bijection is compatible with the law of composition of frames in the sense that the coordinate x‚Ä≤ of the point A in a different frame ∆í‚Ä≤ arises from (A,∆í) by application of the transformation (∆í‚Üí∆í‚Ä≤). That is, ::(A,f') = (f\\\\to f')\\\\circ(A,f). Of interest to the method are parameterized submanifolds of X. The considerations are largely local, so the parameter domain is taken to be an open subset of RŒª. Slightly different techniques apply depending on whether one is interested in the submanifold along with its parameterization, or the submanifold up to reparameterization.  Moving tangent frames  The most commonly encountered case of a moving frame is for the bundle of tangent frames (also called the frame bundle) of a manifold. In this case, a moving tangent frame on a manifold M consists of a collection of vector fields e1, e2, ..., en forming a basis of the tangent space at each point of an open set U ‚äÇ M. If (x^1,x^2,...,x^n) is a coordinate system on U, then each vector field ej can be expressed as a linear combination of the coordinate vector fields \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^i}:e_j = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n A^i_j \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^i},where each A^i_j is a function on U. These can be seen as the components of a matrix A. This matrix is useful for finding the coordinate expression of the dual coframe, as explained in the next section. Coframes A moving frame determines a dual frame or coframe of the cotangent bundle over U, which is sometimes also called a moving frame. This is a n-tuple of smooth 1-forms :Œ∏1, Œ∏2 , ..., Œ∏n which are linearly independent at each point q in U. Conversely, given such a coframe, there is a unique moving frame e1, e2, ..., en which is dual to it, i.e., satisfies the duality relation Œ∏i(ej) = Œ¥ij, where Œ¥ij is the Kronecker delta function on U. If (x^1,x^2,...,x^n) is a coordinate system on U, as in the preceding section, then each covector field Œ∏i can be expressed as a linear combination of the coordinate covector fields dx^i:\\\\theta^i = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n B^i_j dx^j,where each B^i_j is a function on U. Since dx^i\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^j}\\\\right) = \\\\delta^i_j, the two coordinate expressions above combine to yield \\\\sum_{k=1}^n B^i_k A^k_j = \\\\delta^i_j; in terms of matrices, this just says that A and B are inverses of each other. In the setting of classical mechanics, when working with canonical coordinates, the canonical coframe is given by the tautological one-form. Intuitively, it relates the velocities of a mechanical system (given by vector fields on the tangent bundle of the coordinates) to the corresponding momenta of the system (given by vector fields in the cotangent bundle; i.e. given by forms). The tautological one-form is a special case of the more general solder form, which provides a (co-)frame field on a general fiber bundle. Uses Moving frames are important in general relativity, where there is no privileged way of extending a choice of frame at an event p (a point in spacetime, which is a manifold of dimension four) to nearby points, and so a choice must be made. In contrast in special relativity, M is taken to be a vector space V (of dimension four). In that case a frame at a point p can be translated from p to any other point q in a well-defined way. Broadly speaking, a moving frame corresponds to an observer, and the distinguished frames in special relativity represent inertial observers. In relativity and in Riemannian geometry, the most useful kind of moving frames are the orthogonal and orthonormal frames, that is, frames consisting of orthogonal (unit) vectors at each point. At a given point p a general frame may be made orthonormal by orthonormalization; in fact this can be done smoothly, so that the existence of a moving frame implies the existence of a moving orthonormal frame. Further details A moving frame always exists locally, i.e., in some neighbourhood U of any point p in M; however, the existence of a moving frame globally on M requires topological conditions. For example when M is a circle, or more generally a torus, such frames exist; but not when M is a 2-sphere. A manifold that does have a global moving frame is called parallelizable. Note for example how the unit directions of latitude and longitude on the Earth's surface break down as a moving frame at the north and south poles. The method of moving frames of √âlie Cartan is based on taking a moving frame that is adapted to the particular problem being studied. For example, given a curve in space, the first three derivative vectors of the curve can in general define a frame at a point of it (cf. torsion tensor for a quantitative description ‚Äì it is assumed here that the torsion is not zero). In fact, in the method of moving frames, one more often works with coframes rather than frames. More generally, moving frames may be viewed as sections of principal bundles over open sets U. The general Cartan method exploits this abstraction using the notion of a Cartan connection.  Atlases In many cases, it is impossible to define a single frame of reference that valid globally. To overcome this, frames are commonly pieced together to form an atlas, thus arriving at the notion of a local frame. In addition, it is often desirable to endow these atlases with a smooth structure, so that the resulting frame fields are differentiable. Generalizations Although this article constructs the frame fields as a coordinate system on the tangent bundle of a manifold, the general ideas move over easily to the concept of a vector bundle, which is a manifold endowed with a vector space at each point, that vector space being arbitrary, and not in general related to the tangent bundle.

This method avoids drawbacks of full cheek piercings, which have a tendency to leak or secrete lymph fluid, which has a saliva-like texture and can create an unpleasant odor. Though microdermals do have a slightly larger chance to leave a scar than a piercing, they will heal eventually and be almost unnoticeable. The rate of infection is also lower in the long run. Because the piercing does not penetrate the cheek completely, there is little to no chance of tooth or gum damage. Microdermals are like a 'one hole' piercing, where the 'foot' of the jewelry sits below the skin and the decorative jewel or flat disc is above the skin. Jewelry Create man-made deep dimples Cheek piercings are sometimes pierced with 1.6mm flat backed labret studs, but is mostly done with a regular barbell so the cheek tissues do not grow over the back of the jewelry. Also, so the wearer doesn't accidentally break/crack the jewelry by means of unintentional biting. The flat back provides comfort and lessens the chance of the jewelry damaging the teeth and gums of the wearer. However it proves problematic during the healing process because the cheek will likely heal over the flat back if the bar's length is too short. In this case, the piercer will have to cut the barbell out from the inside of the mouth. The cheek is pierced with a 22 - 24 mm labret/barbell during the procedure. This will accommodate for swelling. After the piercing is healed, shortened jewelry further reduces the chance of damage to the teeth from unintentional biting. History and culture Cheek piercing at a ritual in Qionghai, Hainan, China Permanent cheek piercing appears to be of primarily contemporary origin. Ritual cheek piercings were and are common throughout the world in both primitive and modern cultures. Perhaps the most well known of these rituals is the annual vegetarian festivals in Phuket, Thailand where \\"mediums\\" (both lay people and monks) pierce their cheeks with an array of objects in varying sizes, while in an altered state. Category:Facial piercings ","title":"Cheek piercing"},{"id":"439102","text":"Facials may include the use of a facial mask. A facial is a family of skin care treatments for the face, including steam, exfoliation, extraction, creams, lotions, facial masks, peels, and massage. They are normally performed in beauty salons, but are also a common spa treatment. They are used for general skin health as well as for specific skin conditions. Types of facials include European facial, LED light therapy facials, hydrafacials and mini- facials.  Facial mask  There are different kinds of masks (e.g. cactus, cucumber, etc.) for different purposes: deep-cleansing, by penetrating the pores; healing acne scars or hyper-pigmentation; brightening, for a gradual illumination of the skin tone. Some masks are designed to dry or solidify on the face, almost like plaster; others just remain wet. The perceived effects of a facial mask treatment include revitalizing, healing, or refreshing; and, may yield temporary benefits (depending on environmental, dietary, and other skincare factors). There is little to no objective evidence that there are any long-term benefits to the various available facial treatments. Masks are removed by either rinsing the face with water, wiping off with a damp cloth, or peeling off of the face. Duration for wearing a mask varies with the type of mask, and manufacturer's usage instructions. The time can range from a few minutes to overnight. Those with sensitive skin are advised to first test out the mask on a small portion of the skin, in order to check for any irritations. Some facial masks are not suited to frequent use. A glycolic mask should not be used more frequently than once a month without the risk of burning the skin. Masks can be found anywhere from drugstores to department stores, and can vary in consistency and form. Setting masks include: clay, which is a thicker consistency, and will draw out impurities (and sometimes, natural oils, too) from the pores; a cream, which stays damp to hydrate the skin; sheet-style, in which a paper mask is dampened with liquid to tone and moisturize the skin; and lastly, a hybrid/clay and cream form that includes small beads for removing dead surface skin cells. Non-setting facial masks include warm oil and paraffin wax masks. These different forms are made to suit different skin types (e.g., oily or dry), and different skincare goals or needs (e.g., moisturizing, cleansing, exfoliating). Clay and mud masks suit oily and some \\"combination\\" skin types, while cream-based masks tend to suit dry and sensitive skin types.  \\"Back\\" facial A back facial applies the same techniques as would normally be applied to the face, to the back in order to alleviate rough skin and \\"backne\\" acne which appears on the back.

Located on the northeastern shore of Gander Lake, it is the site of Gander International Airport, once an important refuelling stop for transatlantic aircraft and the largest airport in the world. The airport is still a preferred emergency landing point for aircraft facing on-board medical or security issues. Most of the streets in Gander are named after famous aviators, including Alcock and Brown, Amelia Earhart, Charles Lindbergh, Eddie Rickenbacker, Marc Garneau and Chuck Yeager. History Gander was chosen for the construction of an airport in 1935 because it is very close to the great circle route between New York and London. In 1936, construction of the base began, and the town started to develop. On 11 January 1938, Captain Douglas Fraser made the first landing at \\"Newfoundland Airport,\\" now known as Gander International Airport, or \\"CYQX,\\" in a single-engine biplane, Fox Moth VO-ADE. During the Second World War, as many as 10,000 Canadian, British and American military personnel resided in Gander. The area became a strategic post for the Royal Air Force Air Ferry Command, with approximately 20,000 American- and Canadian-built fighters and bombers stopping at Gander en route to Europe. After the war, the airbase became a civilian airport, and the location of the town was moved a safe distance from the runways. Construction of the present town site began in the 1950s, and the present municipality was incorporated in 1958; the settlement around the airport was eventually abandoned.History of Gander After the Second World War, the town grew as the airport was used as a refuelling stop for transatlantic flights, earning its name \\"Cross-roads of the world.\\" Efforts have been made to diversify the economy from being dependent on the airport, particularly as new aircraft designs permitted longer-range flights without the need for landing to refuel. Gander was the site of a major aircraft accident, Arrow Air Flight 1285, on 12 December 1985. 256 people were killed in the disaster, making it the deadliest air crash ever to happen in Canada. In 2001, Gander International Airport played an integral role in world aviation in the hours immediately following the September 11 attacks when all of North America's airspace was closed by Transport Canada and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). As part of Operation Yellow Ribbon, 38 civilian and 4 military flights bound for the United States were ordered to land at the airport--more flights than any Canadian airport other than Halifax International. More than 6,600 passengers and airline crew members, equivalent to 66 percent of the local population-- third highest number of passengers, behind Vancouver International Airport, which received 8,500, and Halifax--found themselves forced to stay in the Gander area for up to six days until airspace was reopened and flights resumed. Residents of Gander and surrounding communities volunteered to house, feed, and entertain the travellers as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon. This was largely because Transport Canada and Nav Canada asked that transatlantic flights avoid diverting to major airports in central Canada, such as Toronto Pearson and Montr√©al-Dorval. Lufthansa named one of its Airbus A340 (registration D-AIFC) aircraft Gander/Halifax to thank both cities for their handling of rerouted travellers on 11 September. A book, The Day The World Came to Town, included several stories about Gander's role during that and subsequent days. A radio play, The Day the Planes Came, by Caroline and David Stafford, dealing with the effect on Gander of the 11 September passengers was first broadcast in June 2008 on BBC Radio 4 and was repeated in October 2009. A TV movie, Diverted, was made in 2009. In February 2010, NBC aired a report by Tom Brokaw on Gander's role in the displacement of hundreds of planes on 9/11 during coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. A musical by Irene Sankoff and David Hein, Come from Away, which retells stories of the people who were diverted to Gander and the people of the town who had helped out was mounted on Broadway in 2017. The town was also profiled in Moze Mossanen's 2018 documentary film You Are Here.\\"TV review: You Are Here proves the enduring power of the Come From Away story\\" . Now, 11 September 2018.

There are a total of 4,887 private dwellings and the town's total area is , with a population density of . As of the 2006 census, the population of Gander was found to be 97.4% white with all visible minorities totaling 0.9% of the population and the aboriginal population totaling 1.7%. Climate Gander has a cool to cold humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb). It combines moderately warm and rainy summers with cold and very snowy winters. Due to the maritime influence from the Atlantic Ocean, seasonal changes are slightly less pronounced than in Canada's interior, but still substantial given its near- coastal position.  Services  Gander offers all the conveniences of a major centre. The newest development is a continually-expanding business park with big box stores such as Walmart Canada and Kent Building Supplies. There are two malls: the Gander Mall, with stores such as Canadian Tire, Sport Chek, Dollarama, Claire's, Pseudio, Eclipse, and Nan's Pantry, and the Fraser Mall, with a Foodland (Sobeys) and various government offices. Town Square at the intersection of Elizabeth Drive and Airport Boulevard has several local businesses, including Riff's, and a Co-op grocery store. All five major Canadian banks have branches in Gander. TD Canada Trust and RBC Royal Bank are located in Town Square, CIBC in the Fraser Mall, as well as Bank of Montreal and Scotiabank on Airport Boulevard and Roe Avenue, respectively. There are two credit unions: Newfoundland and Labrador Credit Union and Hamilton Sound Credit Union, both on Roe Avenue. Medical services are provided by the James Paton Memorial Health Centre, on the Trans-Canada Highway. The hospital opened in May 1964 and has undergone many changes since then, making it a prominent hospital in the central region. The hospital has a rated beds capacity of 92. Telephone services are provided by Bell Aliant, formerly NewTel Communications. Bell Aliant also provides DSL high-speed internet service and FibreOp high-speed internet. Rogers Communications is the cable TV and cable internet provider for the town. Cellular phone service is also available through Telus, its subsidiary Koodo, and Bell's Virgin Mobile. The Gander Public Library is located at 6 Bell Place as of 1987.  In popular culture  Gander airport features in the Nevil Shute novel No Highway and the film adaptation, called No Highway in the Sky in Anglophone countries other than the UK. In 2013, Come from Away, a musical by Irene Sankoff and David Hein based on the events in Gander on and after 11 September (starring Chad Kimball and Jenn Colella) was first performed at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario, following a workshop there the previous year.

Implement Judicial birching of a delinquent; Germany, 17th century A magistrate's committal for birching of two children dated 4 December 1899 displayed in West Midlands Police Museum, Sparkhill, Birmingham, England A birch rod (often shortened to \\"birch\\") is a bundle of leafless twigs bound together to form an implement for administering corporal punishment. Contrary to what the name suggests, a birch rod is not a single rod and is not necessarily made from birch twigs, but can also be made from various other strong and smooth branches of trees or shrubs, such as willow.In the Australian state of Victoria, birches for the judicial punishment of juvenile offenders were made of \\"willow withes soaked in water\\". Benson, G. Flogging: The Law and Practice in England, Howard League for Penal Reform, London, 1937, Appendix I: The Law and Practice of Other Countries. A hazel rod is particularly painful; a bundle of four or five hazel twigs was used in the 1960s and 1970s on the Isle of Man, the last jurisdiction in Europe to use birching as a judicial penalty.Such a birch is illustrated in \\"Birching - The Facts\\", Isle of Man Courier, Ramsey, 17 March 1972. Another factor in the severity of a birch rod is its size - i.e. its length, weight and number of branches. In some penal institutions, several versions were in use, which were often given names. For example, in Dartmoor Prison the device used to punish male offenders above the age of 16 - weighing some , and long - was known as the senior birch. In the 1860s, the Royal Navy abandoned the use of the cat o' nine tails on boy seamen. The cat had acquired a nasty reputation because of its use in prisons, and was replaced by the birch, with which the wealthy classes were more familiar, having been chastised with it during their schooling.\\"Kissing the Gunner's Daughter\\", Part II - The Ryder Reforms at World Corporal Punishment Research. Around the same time, the civilian courts system followed the Navy's example and switched to birches for the judicial corporal punishment of boys and young men, where previously a whip or cat had been used. In an attempt to standardise the Navy's birches, the Admiralty had specimens called patterned birch (as well as a patterned cane), kept in every major dockyard, as birches had to be procured on land in quantities. The term judicial birch generally refers to the severe type in use for court-ordered birchings, especially the Manx hazel birch. A 1951 memorandum (possibly confirming earlier practice) ordered all UK male prisons to use birches (and cats-o'-nine-tails) from only a national stock at south London's Wandsworth prison, where they were to be 'thoroughly' tested before being supplied in triplicate to a prison whenever required for use as prison discipline.Prison Commission Memorandum, 20 July 1951, PRO HO 323/13. By contrast, terms like \\"Eton birch\\" are used for a school birch made from smaller birch tree twigs. Position Medieval schoolboy birched on the bare buttocks (by Hans Holbein the Younger) Only if the recipient was a small child could he or she practicably be punished over the knee of the applicant. Otherwise the child would be bent over an object such as a chair. For judicial punishments the recipient could even be tied down if likely to move about too much or attempt to escape. In some prisons and reformatories, a wooden apparatus known as birching donkey or birching pony was specially constructed for birchings. As there were no detailed rules, prisons and police stations devised, adapted and used many different contraptions under various names that juvenile and adult offenders were bent over for punishment. Some models also allowed a standing or leaning position for other implements. A simple alternative position known from school discipline is horsing, where the person to be punished is held by the arms over the back of another person (e.g. a classmate), or on the shoulders of two or more colleagues. However, at Eton College and schools of similar standing, the recipient was made to kneel on a special wooden block. Another device used to immobilise offenders was a birching table, used in Scotland, with two holes in it through which the offender's arms were inserted but otherwise left free and untied. The offender's feet were tied into position and a strap fastened immediately above the waist.The Birching Table, West Highland Museum. Whatever position is adopted, care must be taken (e.g. by having the recipient's legs kept together) not to strike the back of the genitals. History Birching in a women's prison, USA (ca. 1890) 1839 caricature by George Cruikshank of a school flogging Edmund Bonner punishing a heretic in Foxe's Book of Martyrs (1563) It was the most common school and judicial punishment in Europe up to the mid-19th century, when caning gained increasing popularity. According to some accounts, even the legendary sting of the cat o' nine tails was less feared than the birch in certain prisons. The birch was always applied to the bare buttocks (as also on the continent), a humiliation usually befalling boys (like the boy's cat, likewise on the naked posterior), the 'adult' cat to the back or shoulders of adults‚Äîalthough in the 20th century, judges increasingly ordered the birch rather than the cat, even for robbery with violence (the only offence for which adult judicial corporal punishment was ordered in the latter decades of its use in mainland Britain). Birching featured in the French Revolution. One leader of the revolution, Anne-Jos√®phe Th√©roigne de M√©ricourt, went mad, ending her days in an asylum after a public birching. On 31 May 1793 the Jacobin women seized her, stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the Tuileries.Roudinesco, Elisabeth. (1992) Madness and Revolution: The Lives and Legends of Theroigne de Mericourt, Verso, p.198. Judicial birching in 20th- century Britain was used much more often as a fairly minor punishment for male juveniles, typically for petty larceny, rather than as a serious penalty for adult men. This was applied to boys aged up to 14 in England and Wales, and up to 16 in Scotland. In this juvenile version, the birch was much lighter and smaller, and the birch was administered privately by a policeman, usually immediately after the magistrate's court hearing, either in a room in the court building or at the nearest police station. In Lewis Carroll's early poem The Two Brothers 1853 one laments: \\"Oh would I were back at Twyford School, Learning lessons in fear of the birch !\\" as his sadistic brother uses him as fish bait. Today birching is rarely used as a judicial punishment, and it has also almost completely died out as a punishment for children. In the United Kingdom, birching as a judicial penalty, in both its juvenile and adult versions, was abolished in 1948, but it was retained until 1962 as a punishment for violent breaches of prison discipline. The Isle of Man (a small island between Britain and Ireland with its own legal system as a British Crown dependency) caused a good deal of controversy by continuing to birch young offenders until 1976.\\"Birching in the Isle of Man 1945 to 1976\\", article at World Corporal Punishment Research.Tyrer v. the United Kingdom The birch was also used on offending teenage boys until the mid-1960s on the Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey. In Trinidad and Tobago, the Corporal Punishment Act 1953 allows the High Court to order males, in addition to another punishment (often concurrent with a prison term), to undergo corporal punishment in the form of either a 'flogging' with a knotted cat o' nine tails (made of cords, as in the Royal Navy tradition) or a 'whipping' with a 'rod' [i.e. switch] of tamarind, birch or other switches, and it allows the President to approve other instruments; in 2000, the minimum age was raised from 16 to 18, the legal threshold of adulthood. It may now be the only country in the world still officially using the birch. Non-punitive uses In Scandinavia, Baltics, Russia and Finland there is a tradition to strike one's own body with soaked birch twigs in the sauna or banya, as a form of massage and to increase blood circulation and open the pores. The twigs are chosen carefully and do not have their leaves removed, and are often softened by keeping them in hot water prior to use. Being struck by the twigs induces a pleasant stinging sensation but very little actual pain.

Anatomy and physiology Spring peepers are tan or brown with a dark cross that roughly forms an X on their dorsa (thus the Latin name crucifer, meaning cross-bearer), though sometimes the marking may be indistinct. They have a body length between less than to and a mass between . The species has large toe pads for climbing, although it is more at home amid the loose debris of the forest floor. The color variations of P. crucifer are mostly tan, brown, olive green, and gray. Females are lighter- colored, while males are slightly smaller and usually have dark throats. All have a slight pale yellow coloration on the inside of the thighs. Located by its throat, this frog has a vocal sac which expands and deflates like a balloon to create a short and distinct peeping sound. Only males have the ability to make this loud high-pitched noise, and they use it to attract mates. Spring peeper-Florida.jpgSpring peeper, adult, Florida Spring peeper.jpgSpring peepers are distinguished by a dark X-shaped marking on their back Pseudacris crucifer.jpg Pseudacris crucifer01.jpg Ecology Spring peepers live primarily in forests and regenerating woodlands near ephemeral or semipermanent wetlands. This amphibious species requires marshes, ponds, or swamp regions to support the aquatic environment the eggs and tadpoles need. In the northern reaches of their range, spring peepers must frequently endure occasional periods of subfreezing temperatures during the breeding season. The species can tolerate the freezing of some of its body fluids, and undergoes hibernation under logs or behind loose bark on trees. It is capable of surviving the freezing of its internal body fluids to temperatures as low as -8 ¬∞C.Adaptations of Frogs to Survive Freezing This species frequently occurs in breeding aggregations of several hundred individuals, and commonly breeds in many small wetlands, including swamps and temporary pools and disturbed habitats, such as farm ponds and borrow pits. Geographic range and habitat The southern spring peeper's habitat includes the Gulf Coast from southeastern Texas to southeastern Georgia and northern Florida, United States. Its northern conspecific occurs in the entire United States east of the Mississippi and spreads to eastern and central Canada. Behavior=Diet Spring peepers are nocturnal insectivores, emerging at night to feed primarily on small invertebrates, such as beetles, ants, flies, and spiders. They do not climb high into trees, but hunt in low vegetation. Spring peepers living in deep, damp forests are active hunters both day and night, whereas those found in woodland edges restrict most hunting and other activity to night. Tadpoles feed on algae and other organisms in the water. Their predators include great diving beetle larvae (when in tadpole form), snakes, skunks, and larger frogs. Vocalization As their common name implies, the spring peeper has a high-pitched call similar to that of a young chicken, only much louder and rising slightly in tone. They are among the first frogs in the regions to call in the spring. As a chorus, they resemble the sounds of sleigh bells. They are heard early in spring not long after the ice melts on the wetlands. The males usually call from the edges of the bodies of water in which they breed, hidden near the bases of shrubs or grasses. Even when calling, they may be difficult to locate, and are most easily seen when in amplexus in the shallows. As in other frogs, an aggressive call is made when densities are high. This call is a rising trill closely resembling the breeding call of the southern chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita nigrita). P. c. crucifer tadpoles, about 4‚Äì5 wk old and 24 hours away from complete metamorphosis Breeding and reproduction Spring peepers breed in southern areas from October to March, depending on the local temperature. In northern areas, they breed between March and June, when the warm rains start. P. crucifer typically lays around 900 eggs per clutch, but up to 1000 are possible. Egg clusters are hidden under vegetation or debris at the water base. After they hatch, they remain tadpoles for two to three months before they transform into frogs and are ready to leave the water. In very cold weather, they hibernate under logs and loose bark. Spring peepers often call day and night as long as the temperature is above freezing, but they are mostly heard and usually not seen because they hide in dense plants. They are especially easy to hear due to their extremely loud mating call which gives them the name \\"peeper\\", but it is often hard to pinpoint the source of the sound, especially when many are peeping at once. The peepers generally breed close to dusk and throughout the evening and early morning hours. Their calls can be heard from as far as one to two and a half miles, depending on their numbers. The spring peeper can live an estimated three years in the wild. Conservation status The spring peeper has no special status in most areas. They are common and widespread frogs in the eastern regions. However, their habitats are quickly changing due to loss of wetlands. In some areas, their populations have decreased significantly. The species is listed as threatened in both Iowa and Kansas.

The ship was built at the Chatham Dockyard; her keel was laid down in March 1895, her completed hull was launched in September 1896, and she was commissioned into the fleet in April 1898. She was armed with a main battery of four guns and a secondary battery of twelve guns. The ship had a top speed of . Illustrious was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until 1904. Transferred to the Channel Fleet (which was subsequently reorganised to the Atlantic Fleet) she underwent a refit which was duly completed in early 1906. Rendered obsolete by the emergence of the new dreadnoughts, she served with the Home Fleet from 1908. One of the oldest battleships in the Royal Navy when World War I broke out, she served as a guard ship at various regions around Northern England until late 1915. Her main armament was removed and she then served as a store ship for the remainder of the war. She was decommissioned in 1919 and scrapped the following year.  Design  Right elevation, deck plan, and hull section as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1902 Illustrious was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced up to at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple expansion engines powered by eight coal-fired cylindrical boilers. By 1907‚Äì1908, she was re-boilered with oil-fired models. Her engines provided a top speed of at . The Majestics were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. She had a crew of 672 officers and ratings. The ship was armed with a main battery of four BL 12-inch Mk VIII guns in twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The turrets were placed on circular barbettes, unlike six of her sisters, which retained earlier pear- shaped barbettes. Illustrious also carried a secondary battery of twelve QF 6-inch /40 guns. They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships. She also carried sixteen QF 12-pounder guns and twelve QF 2-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. She was also equipped with five torpedo tubes, four of which were submerged in the ship's hull, with the last in a deck- mounted launcher. Illustrious and the other ships of her class had 9 inches (229 mm) of Harvey armour, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed Illustrious and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection. The barbettes for the main battery were protected with of armour, and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides. The ship's armoured deck was thick.  Service history  The keel for HMS Illustrious was laid down at the Chatham Dockyard on 11 March 1895 and the ship was launched on 17 September 1896. She commissioned at Chatham for service in the Fleet Reserve on 15 April 1898, Captain Sir Richard Poore in command. She went into full commission there on 10 May 1898 for service in the Mediterranean Fleet. While in the Mediterranean, Illustrious participated between September and December 1898 in the operations at Crete of the International Squadron, a multinational force made up initially of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), Imperial Russian Navy, and Royal Navy that intervened between February 1897 and December 1898 in the 1897-1898 Greek Christian uprising against the Ottoman Empire‚Ä≤s rule on the island. By the time Illustrious joined the squadron, Austria-Hungary and the German Empire had withdrawn from the squadron, but the other four countries remained active in it. Its senior admirals formed an \\"Admirals Council\\" that governed Crete during the intervention, and the admirals decided in early September 1898 that the British should take control of the customs house at Candia (now Heraklion) in order to exact an export duty to fund the administration of the island. This resulted in a violent riot by Cretan Turks against British soldiers, sailors, and Christian civilians in Candia on 6 September 1898, which in turn prompted a flood of reinforcements to the town by the International Squadron. Illustrious was among the ships that arrived in the harbour in mid-September 1898 to help maintain order in the wake of the riot. Captain Frank Finnis was appointed in command in February 1900, and in 1901 she underwent a refit at Malta. Captain Francis John Foley was appointed in command on 24 March 1902, and the following June she was the lead ship in a coronation f√™te at Gibraltar. In July 1904, Illustrious transferred to the Channel Fleet. As a result of a reorganisation on 1 January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet, and she became an Atlantic Fleet ship. Illustrious ended her Atlantic Fleet service in September 1905 and began a refit at Chatham. Emerging from the refit, she commissioned into the Reserve at Chatham on 14 March 1906, then went into full commission for service in the new Channel Fleet (formerly the Home Fleet) on 3 April 1906, serving as Flagship, Rear Admiral. She collided with schooner Christa in the English Channel in fog on 13 June 1906. She was relieved as flagship and ended her Channel Fleet service on 1 June 1908, paying off at Chatham. Illustrious recommissioned at Chatham on 2 June 1908 for service with the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet. On 22 March 1909 she collided with third-class cruiser in Portsmouth Harbour, but suffered no damage. She suffered another mishap on 21 August 1909 when she damaged her bottom by striking a reef in Babbacombe Bay. She underwent a refit in 1912, and later that year was transferred to the 3rd Fleet and participated in manoeuvres as Flagship, Vice Admiral, 7th Battle Squadron. In late July 1914, the Royal Navy began a precautionary mobilisation, as war seemed imminent. The ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy. At first, it was planned that Illustrious would pay off to provide crewmen for the new dreadnought battleship , but instead she was placed in full commission to serve as a guard ship for the Grand Fleet once World War I began in August 1914. She began guard ship duty at Loch Ewe on 23 August 1914, transferring to Loch Na Keal on 17 October 1914, to the Tyne in November 1914, and to Grimsby on the Humber in December 1914. She remained on guard ship duty on the Humber until November 1915. Illustrious paid off at Grimsby on 26 November 1915 to be converted to a disarmed harbour ship; two of her 12-inch (305-mm) guns were re-used in the Tyne Turrets. Her conversion was completed in March 1916. She served at Grimsby in her new role until August 1916, when she transferred to Chatham. Illustrious commissioned there on 20 November 1916 for use as a munitions storeship, and on 24 November 1916 she transferred to the Tyne to serve in this role. In November 1917, she transferred to Portsmouth to continue service as a munitions storeship there. Illustrious paid off on 21 April 1919 and was placed on the sale list at Portsmouth on 24 March 1920. She was sold for scrapping on 18 June 1920, and was broken up at Barrow.

That is, given a number of functions on a moduli space, a modular equation is an equation holding between them, or in other words an identity for moduli. The most frequent use of the term modular equation is in relation to the moduli problems for elliptic curves. In that case the moduli space itself is of dimension one. That implies that any two rational functions F and G, in the function field of the modular curve, will satisfy a modular equation P(F,G) = 0 with P a non-zero polynomial of two variables over the complex numbers. For suitable non-degenerate choice of F and G, the equation P(X,Y) = 0 will actually define the modular curve. This can be qualified by saying that P, in the worst case, will be of high degree and the plane curve it defines will have singular points; and the coefficients of P may be very large numbers. Further, the 'cusps' of the moduli problem, which are the points of the modular curve not corresponding to honest elliptic curves but degenerate cases, may be difficult to read off from knowledge of P. In that sense a modular equation becomes the equation of a modular curve. Such equations first arose in the theory of multiplication of elliptic functions (geometrically, the n2-fold covering map from a 2-torus to itself given by the mapping x ‚Üí n¬∑x on the underlying group) expressed in terms of complex analysis.

Her work is based in conceptual art and shows some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art, and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She has been acknowledged as one of the most important living artists to come out of Japan.Yamamura, Midori (2015) Yayoi Kusama: Inventing the Singular. MIT Press. Kusama was raised in Matsumoto, and trained at the Kyoto School of Arts and Crafts in a traditional Japanese painting style called nihonga. Kusama was inspired, however, by American Abstract impressionism. She moved to New York City in 1958 and was a part of the New York avant-garde scene throughout the 1960s, especially in the pop-art movement. Embracing the rise of the hippie counterculture of the late 1960s, she came to public attention when she organized a series of happenings in which naked participants were painted with brightly colored polka dots. Since the 1970s, Kusama has continued to create art, most notably installations in various museums around the world. Kusama has been open about her mental health. She says that art has become her way to express her mental disease.  Biography = Early life: 1929‚Äì1949  Yayoi Kusama was born on 22 March 1929 in Matsumoto, Nagano. Born into a family of merchants who owned a plant nursery and seed farm,Farah Nayeri (14 February 2012), Man-Hating Artist Kusama Covers Tate Modern in Dots: Interview Bloomberg. Kusama began drawing pictures of pumpkins in elementary school and created artwork she saw from hallucinations, works of which would later define her career. Her mother was not supportive of her creative endeavors; Kusama would rush to finish her art because her mother would take it away to discourage her. Her mother was also apparently physically abusive, and Kusama remembers her father as \\"the type who would play around, who would womanize a lot\\". The artist says that her mother would often send her to spy on her father's extramarital affairs, which instilled within her a lifelong contempt for sexuality, particularly the male body and the phallus: \\"I don't like sex. I had an obsession with sex. When I was a child, my father had lovers and I experienced seeing him. My mother sent me to spy on him. I didn't want to have sex with anyone for years [...] The sexual obsession and fear of sex sit side by side in me.\\" Her traumatic childhood, including her fantastic visions, can be said to be the origin of her artistic style. When she was ten years old, she began to experience vivid hallucinations which she has described as \\"flashes of light, auras, or dense fields of dots\\". These hallucinations also included flowers that spoke to Kusama, and patterns in fabric that she stared at coming to life, multiplying, and engulfing or expunging her, a process which she has carried into her artistic career and which she calls \\"self-obliteration\\". Kusama's art became her escape from her family and her own mind when she began to have hallucinations. She was reportedly fascinated by the smooth white stones covering the bed of the river near her family home, which she cites as another of the seminal influences behind her lasting fixation on dots. When Kusama was 13, she was sent to work in a military factory where she was tasked with sewing and fabricating parachutes for the Japanese army, then embroiled in World War II. Discussing her time in the factory, she says that she spent her adolescence \\"in closed darkness\\" although she could always hear the air-raid alerts going off and see American B-29s flying overhead in broad daylight. Her childhood was greatly influenced by the events of the war, and she claims that it was during this period that she began to value notions of personal and creative freedom. She went on to study Nihonga painting at the Kyoto Municipal School of Arts and Crafts in 1948. Frustrated with this distinctly Japanese style, she became interested in the European and American avant-garde, staging several solo exhibitions of her paintings in Matsumoto and Tokyo in the 1950s.  Early success in Japan: 1950‚Äì1956  By 1950, Kusama was depicting abstract natural forms in watercolour, gouache, and oil, primarily on paper. She began covering surfaces‚Äîwalls, floors, canvases, and later, household objects, and naked assistants‚Äîwith the polka dots that would become a trademark of her work. The vast fields of polka dots, or \\"infinity nets\\", as she called them, were taken directly from her hallucinations. The earliest recorded work in which she incorporated these dots was a drawing in 1939 at age 10, in which the image of a Japanese woman in a kimono, presumed to be the artist's mother, is covered and obliterated by spots.Yayoi Kusama, 18 November 1998 ‚Äì 8 January 1999 Victoria Miro Gallery, London.

On her 1954 painting Flower (D.S.P.S) Kusama has said:  New York City: 1957‚Äì1972  An Infinity Room installation After living in Tokyo and France, Kusama left Japan at the age of 27 for the United States. She has stated that she began to consider Japanese society \\"too small, too servile, too feudalistic, and too scornful of women\\". Before leaving Japan to the United states, she destroyed many of her early works.In 1957, she moved to Seattle, where she had an exhibition of paintings at the Zoe Dusanne Gallery.Zo√´ Dusanne: An Art Dealer Who Made a Difference, p99, by Jo Ann Ridley; Fithian Press, 2011 She stayed there for a year before moving on to New York City, following correspondence with Georgia O'Keeffe in which she professed an interest in joining the limelight of the city, and sought O'Keeffe's advice. During her time in the US, she quickly established her reputation as a leader in the avant-garde movement and received praise for her work from the anarchist art critic Herbert Read.Midori Yoshimoto, Into Performance: Japanese Women Artists in New York (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2005) p.68 In 1961 she moved her studio into the same building as Donald Judd and sculptor Eva Hesse; Hesse became a close friend. In the early 1960s Kusama began to cover items such as ladders, shoes and chairs with white phallic protrusions.Yayoi Kusama MoMA Collection, New York. Despite the micromanaged intricacy of the drawings, she turned them out fast and in bulk, establishing a rhythm of productivity which she still maintains. She established other habits too, like having herself routinely photographed with new workHolland Cotter (12 July 2012), Vivid Hallucinations From a Fragile Life ‚Äì Yayoi Kusama at Whitney Museum of American Art The New York Times. and regularly appearing in public wearing her signature bobbed wigs and colorful, avant-garde fashions. Since 1963, Kusama has continued her series of Mirror/Infinity rooms. In these complex infinity mirror installations, purpose-built rooms lined with mirrored glass contain scores of neon-colored balls, hanging at various heights above the viewer. Standing inside on a small platform, an observer sees light repeatedly reflected off the mirrored surfaces to create the illusion of a never-ending space.Yayoi Kusama: Soul under the moon (2002) Queensland Art Gallery, Queensland. During the following years, Kusama was enormously productive, and by 1966 she was experimenting with room-size, freestanding installations that incorporated mirrors, lights, and piped-in music. She counted Judd and Joseph Cornell among her friends and supporters. However, she did not profit financially from her work. Around this time, Kusama was hospitalized regularly from overwork, and O'Keeffe convinced her own dealer Edith Herbert to purchase several works to help Kusama stave off financial hardship.Yayoi Kusama Timeline Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. Many men artists copied her creativity, which made the men famous, but not Kusama. Thus, she was not able to make the money she believed she deserved. This frustration became so extreme that she attempted suicide. In the 1960s, Kusama organized outlandish happenings in conspicuous spots like Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge, often involving nudity and designed to protest the Vietnam War. In one, she wrote an open letter to Richard Nixon offering to have sex with him if he would stop the Vietnam war. Between 1967 and 1969 she concentrated on performances held with the maximum publicity, usually involving Kusama painting polka dots on her naked performers, as in the Grand Orgy to Awaken the Dead at the MoMA (1969), which took place at the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art. During the unannounced event, eight performers under Kusama's direction removed their clothing, stepped nude into a fountain, and assumed poses mimicking the nearby sculptures by Picasso, Giacometti, and Maillol. In 1968, Kusama presided over the happening Homosexual Wedding at the Church of Self-obliteration at 33 Walker Street in New York and performed alongside Fleetwood Mac and Country Joe and the Fish at the Fillmore East in New York City. She opened naked painting studios and a gay social club called the Kusama 'Omophile Kompany (kok).Carl Swanson (8 July 2012), The Art of the Flame-Out New York. The nudity present in Kusama's art and art protests was severely shameful for her family. This made her feel alone, and she attempted suicide again. In 1966, Kusama first participated in the Venice Biennale for its 33rd edition. Her Narcissus Garden comprised hundreds of mirrored spheres outdoors in what she called a \\"kinetic carpet\\". As soon as the piece was installed on a lawn outside the Italian pavilion, Kusama, dressed in a golden kimono, began selling each individual sphere for 1,200 lire (US$2), until the Biennale organizers put an end to her enterprise. Narcissus Garden was as much about the promotion of the artist through the media as it was an opportunity to offer a critique of the mechanization and commodification of the art market.Sullivan, Marin R. \\"Reflective Acts and Mirrored Images: Yayoi Kusama‚Äôs Narcissus Garden\\". History of Photography 39.4 (2015): 405‚Äì423. Taylor & Francis Online. Web. 20 February 2018. During her time in New York, Kusama had a brief relationship with artist Donald Judd. She then began a passionate, but platonic, relationship with the surrealist artist Joseph Cornell. She was 26 years his junior ‚Äì they would call each other daily, sketch each other, and he would send personalized collages to her. Their lengthy association would last until his death in 1972.  Return to Japan: 1973‚Äì1977  In 1973, Kusama returned to Japan in ill health, where she began writing shockingly visceral and surrealistic novels, short stories, and poetry. She became an art dealer, but her business folded after several years and in 1977 Kusama checked herself into a hospital for the Mentally Ill, where she eventually took up permanent residence. She has been living at the hospital since, by choice. Her studio, where she has continued to produce work since the mid-1970s, is a short distance from the hospital in Tokyo. Kusama is often quoted as saying: \\"If it were not for art, I would have killed myself a long time ago.\\" From this base, she has continued to produce artworks in a variety of media, as well as launching a literary career by publishing several novels, a poetry collection, and an autobiography. Her painting style shifted to high-colored acrylics on canvas, on an amped-up scale.  Revival: 1980s‚Äìpresent  Her organically abstract paintings of one or two colors (the Infinity Nets series), which she began upon arriving in New York, garnered comparisons to the work of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman. When she left New York she was practically forgotten as an artist until the late 1980s and 1990s, when a number of retrospectives revived international interest. Yayoi Kusama: A Retrospective was the first critical survey of Yayoi Kusama presented at the Center for International Contemporary Arts (CICA) in New York in 1989, and was organized by Alexandra Munroe. Following the success of the Japanese pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1993, a dazzling mirrored room filled with small pumpkin sculptures in which she resided in color- coordinated magician's attire, Kusama went on to produce a huge, yellow pumpkin sculpture covered with an optical pattern of black spots. The pumpkin came to represent for her a kind of alter-ego or self-portrait. Kusama's later installation I'm Here, but Nothing (2000‚Äì2008) is a simply furnished room consisting of table and chairs, place settings and bottles, armchairs and rugs, however its walls are tattooed with hundreds of fluorescent polka dots glowing in the UV light. The result is an endless infinite space where the self and everything in the room is obliterated. left The multi-part floating work Guidepost to the New Space, a series of rounded \\"humps\\" in fire-engine red with white polka dots, was displayed in Pandanus Lake. Perhaps one of Kusama's most notorious works, various versions of Narcissus Garden have been presented worldwide venues including Le Consortium, Dijon, 2000; Kunstverein Braunschweig, 2003; as part of the Whitney Biennial in Central Park, New York in 2004; and at the Jardin de Tuileries in Paris, 2010.Yayoi Kusama: Flowers That Bloom Tomorrow, 7 October ‚Äì 13 November 2010 Victoria Miro Gallery, London. In her ninth decade, Kusama has continued to work as an artist. She has harkened back to earlier work by returning to drawing and painting; her work remained innovative and multi-disciplinary, and a 2012 exhibition displayed multiple acrylic-on-canvas works. Also featured was an exploration of infinite space in her Infinity Mirror rooms. These typically involve a cube-shaped room lined in mirrors, with water on the floor and flickering lights; these features suggest a pattern of life and death. In 2015-2016 the first retrospective exhibition in Scandinavia, curated by Marie Laurberg, travelled to four major museums In the region, opening at Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark and continuing to Heine Onstadt Museum, Norway, Moderna Museum in Sweden, and Helsinki Art Museum in Finland. This major show contained more than 100 objects and large scale mirror room installations. It presented several early works that had not been shown to the public since they were first created, including a presentation of Kusama‚Äôs experimental fashion design from the 1960s. Naoshima (Japan) In 2017, a 50-year retrospective of her work opened at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC. The exhibit featured six Infinity Mirror rooms, and was scheduled to travel to five museums in the US and Canada. On 25 February 2017, Kusama's All the Eternal Love I Have for the Pumpkins exhibit, one of the six components to her Infinity Mirror rooms at the Hirshhorn Museum, was temporarily closed for three days following damage to one of the exhibit's glowing pumpkin sculptures. The room, which measures and was filled with over 60 pumpkin sculptures, was one of the museum's most popular attractions ever. Allison Peck, a spokeswoman for the Hirshhorn, said in an interview that the museum \\"has never had a show with that kind of visitor demand\\", with the room averaging over 8,000 visitors between its opening and the date of its temporary closing. While there were conflicting media reports about the cost of the damaged sculpture and how exactly it was broken, Allison Peck stated that \\"there is no intrinsic value to the individual piece. It is a manufactured component to a larger piece.\\" The exhibit was reconfigured to make up for the missing sculpture, and a new one was to be produced for the exhibit by Kusama. The Infinity Mirrors exhibit became a sensation among art critics as well as on social media. Museum visitors shared 34,000 images of the exhibition to their Instagram accounts, and social media posts using the hashtag #InfiniteKusama garnered 330 million impressions, as reported by the Smithsonian the day after the exhibit's closing. The works provided the perfect setting for Instagram-able selfies which inadvertently added to the performative nature of the works. Also in 2017, the Yayoi Kusama Museum opened in Tokyo, featuring her works. On 9 November 2019, Kusama's Everyday I Pray For Love exhibit was shown at David Zwirner Gallery until 14 December 2019. This exhibition incorporated sculptures and paintings. The exhibition was accompanied by a catalogue published by David Zwirner books containing texts and poems from the artist. This exhibition also included the debut of her INFINITY MIRRORED ROOM - DANCING LIGHTS THAT FLEW UP TO THE UNIVERSE, 2019. In January 2020, the Hirshhorn announced it would debut new Kusama acquisitions, including two Infinity Mirror Rooms, at a forthcoming exhibition called, \\"One with Eternity: Yayoi Kusama in the Hirshhorn Collection.\\" The name of the exhibit is derived from an open letter Kusama wrote to then-President Richard Nixon in 1968, writing: \\"let‚Äôs forget ourselves, dearest Richard, and become one with the absolute, all together in the altogether.\\"  Meaning and origins of her work  Curator Mika Yoshitake has stated that Kusama's works on display are meant to immerse the whole person into Kusama's accumulations, obsessions, and repetitions. These infinite, repetitive works were originally meant to eliminate Kusama's intrusive thoughts, but she now shares it with the world. Claire Voon has described one of Kusama's mirror exhibits as being able to, \\"...transport you to quiet cosmos, to a lonely labyrinth of pulsing light, or to what could be the enveloping innards of a leviathan with the measles\\". Creating these feelings amongst audiences was intentional. These experiences seem to be unique to her work because Kusama wanted others to sympathise with her in her troubled life. Bedatri D. Choudhury has described how Kusama's lack of feeling in control throughout her life made her, either consciously or subconsciously, want to control how others perceive time and space when entering her exhibits. This statement seems to imply that without her trauma, Kusama would not have created these works as well or perhaps not at all. Art had become a coping mechanism for Kusama.  Works and publications  Installation at Matsumoto City Museum of Art Performance In Yayoi Kusama's Walking Piece (1966), a performance that was documented in a series of eighteen color slides, Kusama walked along the streets of New York City in a traditional Japanese kimono while holding a parasol. The kimono suggested traditional roles for women in Japanese custom. The parasol, however, was made to look inauthentic, as it was actually a black umbrella, painted white on the exterior and decorated with fake flowers. Kusama walked down unoccupied streets in an unknown quest. She then turned and cried without reason, and eventually walked away and vanished from view. This performance, through the association of the kimono, involved the stereotypes that Asian-American women continued to face. However, as an avant-garde artist living in New York, her situation altered the context of the dress, creating a cross-cultural amalgamation. Kusama was able to highlight the stereotype in which her white American audience categorized her, by showing the absurdity of culturally categorizing people in the world's largest melting pot.  Film  In 1968, the film Kusama's Self-Obliteration which Kusama produced and starred in won a prize at the Fourth International Experimental Film Competition in Belgium and the Second Maryland Film Festival and the second prize at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. In 1991, Kusama starred in the film Tokyo Decadence, written and directed by Ryu Murakami, and in 1993, she collaborated with British musician Peter Gabriel on an installation in Yokohama.  Fashion  In 1968, Kusama established Kusama Fashion Company Ltd, and began selling avantgarde fashion in the \\"Kusama Corner\\" at Bloomingdales.Midori Matsui, Interview: Yayoi Kusama, 1998 Index Magazine. In 2009, Kusama designed a handbag-shaped cell phone entitled Handbag for Space Travel, My Doggie Ring-Ring, a pink dotted phone in accompanying dog-shaped holder, and a red and white dotted phone inside a mirrored, dotted box dubbed Dots Obsession, Full Happiness With Dots, for Japanese mobile communication giant KDDI Corporation's \\"iida\\" brand.Art Editions: Yayoi Kusama KDDI Corporation. Each phone was limited to 1,000 pieces. In 2011, Kusama created artwork for six limited-edition lipglosses from Lanc√¥me.Emili Vesilind (24 May 2011), Lanc√¥me collaborates with Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama on new Juicy Tubes Los Angeles Times. That same year, she worked with Marc Jacobs (who visited her studio in Japan in 2006) on a line of Louis Vuitton products, including leather goods, ready-to-wear, accessories, shoes, watches, and jewelry.Ann Binlot (9 January 2012), Marc Jacobs Recruits Yayoi Kusama for Latest Louis Vuitton Collaboration BLOUINARTINFO. The products became available in 2012 at a SoHo pop-up shop, which was decorated with Kusama's trademark tentacle-like protrusions and polka-dots. Eventually, six other pop-up shops were opened around the world. When asked about her collaboration with Marc Jacobs, Kusama replied that \\"his sincere attitude toward art\\" is the same as her own.  Writing  In 1977, Kusama published a book of poems and paintings entitled 7. One year later, her first novel Manhattan Suicide Addict appeared. Between 1983 and 1990, she finished the novels The Hustler's Grotto of Christopher Street (1983), The Burning of St Mark's Church (1985), Between Heaven and Earth (1988), Woodstock Phallus Cutter (1988), Aching Chandelier (1989), Double Suicide at Sakuragazuka (1989), and Angels in Cape Cod (1990), alongside several issues of the magazine S&M; Sniper in collaboration with photographer Nobuyoshi Araki. Her most recent writing endeavor includes her autobiography Infinity Net published in 2003 that depicts her life from growing up in Japan, her departure to the United States, and her return to her home country, where she now resides. Infinity Net also includes some of the artist's poetry and photos of her exhibitions.  Commissions  Red Pumpkin (2006), Naoshima To date, Kusama has completed several major outdoor sculptural commissions, mostly in the form of brightly hued monstrous plants and flowers, for public and private institutions including Pumpkin (1994) for the Fukuoka Municipal Museum of Art; The Visionary Flowers (2002) for the Matsumoto City Museum of Art; Tsumari in Bloom (2003) for Matsudai Station, Niigata; Tulipes de Shangri-La (2003) for Euralille in Lille, France; Pumpkin (2006) at Bunka-mura on Benesse Island of Naoshima; Hello, Anyang with Love (2007) for Pyeonghwa Park, Anyang; and The Hymn of Life: Tulips (2007) for the Beverly Gardens Park in Los Angeles.Kusama, 16 April ‚Äì 27 June 2009 Gagosian Gallery, New York/Los Angeles. In 1998, she realized a mural for the hallway of the Gare do Oriente subway station in Lisbon. Alongside these monumental works, she has produced smaller scale outdoor pieces including Key-Chan and Ryu-Chan, a pair of dotted dogs. All the outdoor works are cast in highly durable fiberglass-reinforced plastic, then painted in urethane to glossy perfection.Yayoi Kusama: Outdoor Sculptures, 23 June ‚Äì 25 July 2009 Victoria Miro Gallery, London. In 2010, Kusama designed a Town Sneaker styled bus, which she titled Mizutama Ranbu (Wild Polka Dot Dance) and whose route travels through her hometown of Matsumoto. In 2011, she was commissioned to design the front cover of millions of pocket London Underground maps; the result is entitled Polka Dots Festival in London (2011). Coinciding with an exhibition of the artist's work at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2012, a reproduction of Kusama's painting Yellow Trees (1994) covered a condominium building under construction in New York's Meatpacking District.Laura Kusisto (2 August 2012), 'Yellow Trees' Growing The Wall Street Journal.

OCLC 954134388  Exhibitions  In 1959, Kusama had her first solo exhibition in New York at the Brata Gallery, an artist's co-op. She showed a series of white net paintings which were enthusiastically reviewed by Donald Judd (both Judd and Frank Stella then acquired paintings from the show). Kusama has since exhibited work with Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Jasper Johns, among others. Exhibiting alongside European artists including Lucio Fontana, Pol Bury, Otto Piene, and Gunther Uecker, in 1962 she was the only female artist to take part in the widely acclaimed Nul (Zero) international group exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.Yayoi Kusama: Mirrored Years, 23 August ‚Äì 19 October 2008 Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam.

Other major retrospectives of her work have been held at the Museum of Modern Art (1998), the Whitney Museum (2012), and the Tate Modern (2012).Love Forever : Yayoi Kusama, 1958‚Äì1968, 9 July ‚Äì 22 September 1998, The Museum of Modern Art, New York.YAYOI KUSAMA, 12 July ‚Äì Sept 30, 2012, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.Yayoi Kusama, 9 February ‚Äì 5 June 2012, Tate Modern, London. In 2015, the website Artsy named Kusama one of its top 10 living artists of the year. Kusama has received many awards, including the Asahi Prize (2001); Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2003); the National Lifetime Achievement Award from the Order of the Rising Sun (2006); and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Women's Caucus for Art. In October 2006, Kusama became the first Japanese woman to receive the Praemium Imperiale, one of Japan's highest honors for internationally recognized artists. She also received the Person of Cultural Merit (2009) and Ango awards (2014). In 2014, Kusama was ranked the most popular artist of the year after a record-breaking number of visitors flooded her Latin American tour, Yayoi Kusama: Infinite Obsession. Venues from Buenos Aires to Mexico City received over 8,500 visitors each day. The octogenarian also gained media attention for partnering with the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden to make her 2017 Infinity Mirror rooms accessible to visitors with disabilities or mobility issues; in a new initiative among art museums, the venue mapped out the six individual rooms and provided handicapped individuals visiting the exhibition access to a complete 360-degree virtual reality headset that allowed them to experience every aspect of the rooms, as if they were actually walking through them.  Art market  Kusama's work has performed strongly at auction: top prices for her work are for paintings from the late 1950s and early 1960s. As of 2012, her work has the highest turnover of any living woman artist.Sarah Thornton (20 May 2012), The price of being female The Economist.

Two years later he finished third in the junior division at the world amateur championships in England, and he won the Pacific Cup junior championship in Australia the following year. After turning professional in 1990, Slater struggled during his first two years on the professional tour, finishing 90th and 43rd in the world rankings those years. In 1992 he secured podium (top-three) finishes in three of his first five events before winning his first professional tour event, the Rip Curl Pro, in France. His win in that year's prestigious Pipeline Masters in Hawaii secured his first world title, and at age 20 he became the youngest surfing world champion ever. Slater finished sixth in the 1993 rankings but came back in 1994 to win the world tour during 1994‚Äì1998, during which time televised surfing events had become increasingly popular. He then took a break from competitive surfing at the end of 1998, after Baywatch had become increasingly unpopular.  Accomplishments = Surfing  Slater, having grown up in Florida, was never truly comfortable in waves of consequence until a trip to Oahu in 1987. A giant northwest swell was pounding the coast, closing out breaks from Waimea to Sunset. He drove to Makaha, where he was greeted with 40' (Hawaiian scale) waves breaking across the bay. Slater parked and saw charger Brandon \\"Big Wave\\" Davis waxing up his 11' board. Big Wave Davis simply gave Slater a wink and they paddled out, trading waves all afternoon. Slater credits Davis in his biography stating \\"Brandon's knowledge and poise in large surf had a huge impact on my career. Anytime I'm dropping in a big wave, I think back to that wink in the Makaha parking lot and I push myself over the ledge.\\"Slater at leftSome of his favorite surf spots include Mondos in Ventura, California, Pipeline in Hawaii, Kirra in Australia, Jeffreys Bay in South Africa, Minis in Ireland, Taghazout in Morocco, Veiny's in New Zealand, Soup Bowls in Barbados, and Sebastian Inlet near his home in Florida. Musical appearances and collaborations Slater plays guitar and ukulele, and has performed with Jack Johnson and Angus Stone. Kelly Slater joined Rob Machado and Peter King in a band called The Surfers. Slater performed a song with Ben Harper during Harper's concert in Santa Barbara on August 1, 2006. He also performed Rockin' in the Free World with grunge band Pearl Jam on July 7, 2006 in San Diego. In 1999, he appeared alongside Garbage singer Shirley Manson in the promotional video for the band's single \\"You Look So Fine\\". He played a man washed up on a seashore, then rescued by Manson. Mixed media Slater played the recurring character Jimmy Slade on twenty-seven episodes of the popular TV show Baywatch in the early 1990s.baywatch database: actors: Kelly Slater . Baywatchun.tripod.com (November 2, 1972). Retrieved on 2011-08-16. He appeared in an episode of the reality show The Girls Next Door, and has starred in many surf films during his career. In the late 1990s Slater, with friends and fellow pro surfers Rob Machado and Peter King, formed a band called The Surfers. The trio released an album in 1998 titled Songs from the Pipe, a reference to the famous surf spot Pipeline on Oahu, Hawaii. Slater toured Australia with his band, performing in venues such as the Opera House and parliament house. He was given an honorary membership to the Rickson Cricket Club in northwest Sydney. A video game named Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer by Treyarch and published by Activision was released in 2002. Slater also appeared as a playable character in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 prior to this, complete with a surfboard. In addition to the ASP tour, Slater competed in the X-Games in 2003 and 2004. Environmentalism and philanthropy Slater is an advocate of a sustainable and clean living lifestyle. Slater is also a fundraiser and spokesperson for suicide prevention awareness. He has surfed in celebrity events for Surfers Against Suicide, telling sports website 'Athletes Talk': \\"I've lost a couple of friends myself to suicide and it's just a horrible thing that can be prevented. People get in this dark place and they don't know what to do so it's always nice to see a non-profit that isn't turning into anything else other than just trying to help people.\\"Surfing Life's Killer Wave - Kelly Slater chats with www.athletestalk.com Athletes Talk - April 14, 2013 Slater is passionate about preserving oceans globally and protecting temperate reefs in California through his relationship with Reef Check. On May 8, 2010, the United States House of Representatives honored Slater in H. Res. 792 for his \\"outstanding and unprecedented achievements in the world of surfing and for being an ambassador of the sport and excellent role model.\\" This resolution, sponsored by Florida representative Bill Posey and sponsored by 10 representatives, passed without objection by a voice vote. Slater is on the Board of Advisors (the Ocean Advocacy Advisory Board) of ocean conservation organization Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Professional development Slater historically and exclusively rode Channel Islands Surfboards equipped with his own signature series of FCS fin masons. As the media hype grew around Slater's lack of board stickers in 2015, Slater had been seen riding unlabelled Firewire surfboards, acquiring the company in 2014. In 2016 Slater released his own line of boards. there are four Slater Designs models in the Firewire range: the Gamma, Cymatic, Omni and Sci-fi. Since 1990 Slater had been sponsored primarily by surfwear industry giant Quiksilver until his departure on April 1, 2014 to collaborate with fashion brand conglomerate Kering. In a statement released on his social media accounts, Slater states \\"For years I've dreamt of developing a brand that combines my love of clean living, responsibility and style. The inspiration for this brand comes from the people and cultures I encounter in my constant global travels and this is my opportunity to build something the way I have always wanted to.\\" After Leaving Quiksilver, Slater, in collaboration with Kering, established the eco-friendly and sustainable apparel company 'Outerknown'. Slater also established the beverage company Purps, and became a brand ambassador for The Chia Co. Wave Pool Wave Pool was a ten-year 'experiment' to create the perfect inland wave situated in inland California. Kelly modeled the wave after a combination of Lower Trestles, a wave in Oahu, and a secret right in the Marshall Islands. The project was a success and the surfing world was abuzz with the possibilities, mostly due to the wave's perfect shape and speed. In 2016 the World Surf League (WSL) acquired a majority stake in the Kelly Slater Wave Company (KSWC) for an undisclosed sum. The WSL held a test event for 300 or more, including Filipe Toledo, Mick Fanning, Kanoa Igarashi, Gabriel Medina and others, at the Kelly Slater Surf Ranch on Tuesday, September 19, 2017. The Surf Ranch also hosted the WSL Founders Cup on May 5‚Äì6, 2018. The contest featured five teams - US, Brazil, Australia, Europe and World - made up of men's and women's surfers from the WSL Championship Tour. The WSL Surf Ranch was constructed outside of Lemoore, California and has remained private and exclusive. There is speculation he is developing Surf Ranch Florida, a man-made surfing lake in Palm Beach County. County commissioners unanimously approved plans for the county to evaluate the proposed surf facility in 2017. Brian Waxman, project leader for Surf Ranch Florida, said the World Surf League is considering bringing the wave lake to the Sunshine State for its weather and heritage of world-class surfers. It would encompass an 80-acre industrial lot east of Jupiter Farms, near the Pine Glades natural area. Coral Mountain is a proposed $200-million complex on in La Quinta, California that would include a hotel and housing built around a surfing basin created by Kelly Slater Wave Co. Competitive achievements alt= Slater has been crowned World Surf League Champion a record 11 times, including five consecutive titles in 1994‚Äì98. He is the youngest (at age 20) and the oldest (at age 39) to win the WSL men's title. Upon winning his fifth world title in 1997, Slater passed Australian surfer Mark Richards to become the most successful male champion in the history of the sport. In 2007 he also became the all-time leader in career event wins by winning the Boost Mobile Pro event at Lower Trestles near San Clemente, California. The previous record was held by Slater's childhood hero, three-time world champion Tom Curren.Sports Illustrated, September 24, 2007, p. 24 After earlier being awarded the title prematurely as a result of a miscalculation by the Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP), on November 6, 2011 Slater officially won his eleventh ASP world title at the Rip Curl Pro Search San Francisco, by winning his 4th round heat. Slater competing at the US Open at alt= In May 2005, in the final heat of the Billabong Tahiti Pro contest at Teahupo'o, Slater became the first surfer ever to be awarded two perfect scores for a total 20 out of 20 points under the ASP two-wave scoring system (fellow American Shane Beschen made the first perfect score under the previous three-wave system in 1996). Slater did it again in June 2013 at the quarter finals at the Volcom Fiji Pro with two perfect ten waves, only the fourth person in history to do so. 2013 stats and results World ranking: 2nd Points: 54,150 Event results in 2013http://www.aspworldtour.com/athletes/553/kelly-slater Quiksilver Pro (Gold Coast, Australia): 1st Rip Curl Pro (Bells Beach, Victoria, Australia): 13th Volcom Fiji Pro (Tavarua/Namotu, Fiji): 1st Oakley Pro Bali (Keramas, Bali, Indonesia): 9th Billabong Pro Teahupoo (Teahupoo, Taiarapu, French Polynesia): 2nd Billabong Pipeline Masters (Pipeline, Oahu, Hawaii): 1st He also won many other surfing titles. 2012 stats and results World ranking: 2nd Points: 55,450 Event results in 2012Schedule  ASP World Tour ‚Äì The Association of Surfing Professionals .

Data demonstrating such a relationship in Swedish moose (Eurasian elk) are shown. Bergmann's rule is an ecogeographical rule that states that within a broadly distributed taxonomic clade, populations and species of larger size are found in colder environments, while populations and species of smaller size are found in warmer regions. Although originally formulated in terms of species within a genus, it has often been recast in terms of populations within a species. It is also often cast in terms of latitude. It is possible that the rule also applies to some plants, such as Rapicactus. The rule is named after nineteenth century German biologist Carl Bergmann, who described the pattern in 1847, although he was not the first to notice it. Bergmann's rule is most often applied to mammals and birds which are endotherms, but some researchers have also found evidence for the rule in studies of ectothermic species, such as the ant Leptothorax acervorum. While Bergmann's rule appears to hold true for many mammals and birds, there are exceptions. Larger-bodied animals tend to conform more closely to Bergmann's rule than smaller-bodied animals, at least up to certain latitudes. This perhaps reflects a reduced ability to avoid stressful environments, such as by burrowing. In addition to being a general pattern across space, Bergmann's rule has been reported in populations over historical and evolutionary time when exposed to varying thermal regimes. In particular, temporary, reversible dwarfing of mammals has been noted during two relatively brief upward excursions in temperature during the Paleogene: the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum and the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2. Examples=Humans Human populations near the poles, including the Inuit, Aleut, and Sami people, are on average heavier than populations from mid-latitudes, consistent with Bergmann's rule. They also tend to have shorter limbs and broader trunks, consistent with Allen's rule. According to Marshall T. Newman in 1953, Native American populations are generally consistent with Bergmann's rule although the cold climate and small body size combination of the Eastern Inuit, Canoe Nation, Yuki people, Andes natives and Harrison Lake Lillooet runs contrary to the expectations of Bergmann's rule. Newman contends that Bergmann's rule holds for the populations of Eurasia, but it does not hold for those of sub- Saharan Africa. Birds A 2019 study of changes in the morphology of birds used bodies of birds which had collided with buildings in Chicago from 1978 to 2016. The length of birds' lower leg bones (an indicator of body size) shortened by an average of 2.4% and their wings lengthened by 1.3%. The morphological changes are regarded as resulting from global warming, and demonstrate an example of evolutionary change following Bergmann's rule. Reptiles Bergmann's rule has been reported to be generally followed by crocodilians. However, for turtles or lizards the rule's validity has not been supported. Plants Bergmann's rule cannot generally be applied to plants. Regarding Cactaceae, the case of the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), once described as \\"a botanical Bergmann trend\\", has instead been shown to depend on rainfall, particularly winter precipitation, and not temperature. Members of the genus Rapicactus are larger in cooler environments, as their stem diameter increases with altitude and particularly with latitude. However, since Rapicactus grow in a distributional area in which average precipitation tends to diminish at higher latitudes, and their body size is not conditioned by climatic variables, this could suggest a possible Bergmann trend. Explanations Bergmann's rule illustrated by red foxes from northern and southern populations The earliest explanation, given by Bergmann when originally formulating the rule, is that larger animals have a lower surface area to volume ratio than smaller animals, so they radiate less body heat per unit of mass, and therefore stay warmer in cold climates. Warmer climates impose the opposite problem: body heat generated by metabolism needs to be dissipated quickly rather than stored within. Thus, the higher surface area- to-volume ratio of smaller animals in hot and dry climates facilitates heat loss through the skin and helps cool the body. It is important to note that when analyzing Bergmann's Rule in the field that groups of populations being studied are of different thermal environments, and also have been separated long enough to genetically differentiate in response to these thermal conditions. In marine crustaceans, it has been proposed that an increase in size with latitude is observed because decreasing temperature results in increased cell size and increased life span, both of which lead to an increase in maximum body size (continued growth throughout life is characteristic of crustaceans). The size trend has been observed in hyperiid and gammarid amphipods, copepods, stomatopods, mysids, and planktonic euphausiids, both in comparisons of related species as well as within widely distributed species. Deep-sea gigantism is observed in some of the same groups, possibly for the same reasons. An additional factor in aquatic species may be the greater dissolved oxygen concentration at lower temperature. This view is supported by the reduced size of crustaceans in high-altitude lakes. A further possible influence on invertebrates is reduced predation pressure at high latitude. A study of shallow water brachiopods found that predation was reduced in polar areas relative to temperate latitudes (the same trend was not found in deep water, where predation is also reduced, or in comparison of tropical and temperate brachiopods, perhaps because tropical brachiopods have evolved to smaller sizes to successfully evade predation).  Hesse's rule In 1937 German zoologist and ecologist Richard Hesse proposed an extension of Bergmann's rule. Hesse's rule, also known as the heart‚Äìweight rule, states that species inhabiting colder climates have a larger heart in relation to body weight than closely related species inhabiting warmer climates. Criticism In a 1986 study, Valerius Geist claimed Bergmann's rule to be false: the correlation with temperature is spurious; instead, Geist found that body size is proportional to the duration of the annual productivity pulse, or food availability per animal during the growing season. Because many factors can affect body size, there are many critics of Bergmann's Rule. Some believe that latitude itself is a poor predictor of body mass. Examples of other selective factors that may contribute to body mass changes are the size of food items available, effects of body size on success as a predator, effects of body size on vulnerability to predation, and resource availability. For example, if an organism is adapted to tolerate cold temperatures, it may also tolerate periods of food shortage, due to correlation between cold temperature and food scarcity. A larger organism can rely on its greater fat stores to provide the energy needed for survival as well being able to procreate for longer periods. Resource availability is a major constraint on the overall success of many organisms. Resource scarcity can limit the total number of organisms in a habitat, and over time can also cause organisms to adapt by becoming smaller in body size. Resource availability thus becomes a modifying restraint on Bergmann's Rule.

He spent a period of time in the shops of Pierre Jaquet- Droz, who was in the business of producing watches, clocks, and automata. With his brothers Jaques-Rodolphe and Jean David Maillardet, Henri produced a series of automata depicting magicians. In 1805 Henri Maillardet built a spring-activated automaton that draws pictures and writes verses in both French and English. The motions of the hand are produced by a series of cams located on shafts in the base of the automaton, which produces the necessary movement to complete seven sketches and the text. It is believed that this automaton has the largest cam-based memory of any automaton of the era. When first presented to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 1928, the automaton was of unknown origin. Once restored to working order, the automaton itself provided the answer when it penned the words \\"written by the automaton of Maillardet\\". Maillardet died in Malines, Belgium, in 1830 where he is buried.

It is located between the northern coast of Siberia, the Taimyr Peninsula, Severnaya Zemlya and the New Siberian Islands. Its northern boundary passes from the Arctic Cape to a point with co-ordinates of 79¬∞N and 139¬∞E, and ends at the Anisiy Cape. The Kara Sea lies to the west, the East Siberian Sea to the east. The sea is named after the Russian explorers Dmitry Laptev and Khariton Laptev; formerly, it had been known under various names, the last being Nordenski√∂ld Sea (), after explorer Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld. The sea has a severe climate with temperatures below 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F) over more than nine months per year, low water salinity, scarcity of flora, fauna and human population, and low depths (mostly less than 50 meters). It is frozen most of the time, though generally clear in August and September. The sea shores were inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous tribes of Yukaghirs and then Evens and Evenks, which were engaged in fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry. They were then settled by Yakuts and later by Russians. Russian explorations of the area started in the 17th century. They came from the south via several large rivers which empty into the sea, such as the prominent Lena River, the Khatanga, the Anabar, the Olenyok, the Omoloy and the Yana. The sea contains several dozen islands, many of which contain well-preserved mammoth remains. Extent Laptev Sea's limits as defined by the International Hydrographic Organization.

Geography The shore of the Anabar Bay. The Lena River, with its large delta, is the biggest river flowing into the Laptev Sea, and is the second largest river in the Russian Arctic after Yenisei.Ecological assessment of pollution in the Russian Arctic region, Global International Waters Assessment Final Report Other important rivers include the Khatanga, the Anabar, the Olenyok or Olenek, the Omoloy and the Yana. The sea shores are winding and form gulfs and bays of various sizes. The coastal landscape is also diverse, with small mountains near the sea in places. The main gulfs of the Laptev Sea coast are the Khatanga Gulf, the Olenyok Gulf, the Buor-Khaya Gulf and the Yana Bay. There are several dozens of islands with the total area of , mostly in the western part of the sea and in the river deltas. Storms and currents due to the ice thawing significantly erode the islands, so the Semenovsky and Vasilievsky islands (74¬∞12\\"N, 133¬∞E) which were discovered in 1815 have already disappeared. The most significant groups of islands are Severnaya Zemlya, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Vilkitsky and Faddey, and the largest individual islands are Bolshoy Begichev (1764 km2), Belkovsky (500 km2), Maly Taymyr (250 km2), Stolbovoy (170 km2), Starokadomsky (110 km2), and Peschanyy (17 km2). (see Islands of the Laptev Sea) More than half of the sea (53%) rests on a continental shelf with the average depths below , and the areas south from 76¬∞N are shallower than 25 m.Arnoldus Schytte Blix (2005) Arctic animals and their adaptations to life on the edge, pp. 57‚Äì58 In the northern part, the sea bottom sharply drops to the ocean floor with the depth of the order of (22% of the sea area). There it is covered with silt, which is mixed with ice in the shallow areas. The Laptev Sea is bound to the south by the East Siberian Lowland, an alluvial plain mainly composed of sediments of marine origin dating back to the time when the whole area was occupied by the Verkhoyansk Sea, an ancient sea at the edge of the Siberian Craton in the Permian period. As centuries went by, gradually, most of the area limiting the sea to the south became filled with the alluvial deposits of modern rivers.Sea basins and land of the East Siberian Lowland Climate The climate of the Laptev Sea is Arctic continental and, owing to the remoteness from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, is one of the most severe among the Arctic seas. Polar night and midnight sun last about 3 months per year on the south and 5 months on the north. Air temperatures stay below 0 ¬∞–° 11 months a year on the north and 9 months on the south. The average temperature in January (coldest month) varies across the sea between and and the minimum is . In July, the temperature rises to 0 ¬∞–° (maximum 4 ¬∞–°) in the north and to 5 ¬∞–° (maximum 10 ¬∞–°) in the south, however, it may reach 22‚Äì24 ¬∞–° on the coast in August. The maximum of was recorded in Tiksi. Strong winds, blizzards and snow storms are common in winter. Snow falls even in summer and is alternating with fogs. The winds blow from south and south-west in winter with the average speed of 8 m/s which subsides toward the spring. In summer, they change direction to the northerly, and their speed is 3‚Äì4 m/s. Relatively weak winds result in low convection in the surface waters, which occurs only to the depth of 5‚Äì10 meters. Ice The frozen Laptev Sea. Thinning of the ice reveals blue and green water color. New Siberian Islands are near the middle and the Great Siberian Polynya is in the left part of the image. The Laptev Sea is a major source of arctic sea ice. With an average outflow of 483,000 km2 per year over the period 1979‚Äì1995, it contributes more sea ice than the Barents Sea, Kara Sea, East Siberian Sea and Chukchi Sea combined. Over this period, the annual outflow fluctuated between 251,000 km2 in 1984‚Äì85 and 732,000 km2 in 1988‚Äì89. The sea exports substantial amounts of sea ice in all months but July, August and September. Ice formation starts in September on the north and October on the south. It results in a large continuous sheet of ice, with the thickness up to in the south-eastern part of the sea as well as near the coast. The coastal sheet ends at the water depth of 20‚Äì25 m which occurs at several hundred kilometers from the shore, thus this coastal ice covers some 30% of the sea area. Ice is drifting north to this coastal band, and several polynyas are formed by the warm south winds around there. They have various names, such as the Great Siberian Polynya, and can stretch over many hundreds kilometers. The ice sheet starts melting in late May-early June, creating fragmented ice agglomerates on the north-west and south-east and often revealing remains of the mammoths. The ice formation varies from year to year, with the sea either clear or completely covered with ice. Hydrology The sea is characterized by the low water temperatures, which ranges from in the north to in the south- eastern parts. The medium water layer is warmer, up to 1.5 ¬∞–° because it is fed by the warm Atlantic waters. It takes them 2.5‚Äì3 years to reach the Laptev Sea from their formation near Spitsbergen. The deeper layer is colder at about ‚àí0.8 ¬∞–°. In summer, the surface layer in the ice-free zones warms up by the sun up to 8‚Äì10 ¬∞–° in the bays and 2‚Äì3 ¬∞–° in the open sea, and remains close to 0 ¬∞–° under ice. The water salinity is significantly affected by the thawing of ice and river runoff. The latter amounts to about 730 km3 and would form a 135 cm freshwater layer over the entire sea; it is the second largest in the world after the Kara Sea. The salinity values vary in winter from 20 to 25‚Ä∞ (parts per thousand) in the south-east to 34‚Ä∞ in the northern parts of the sea; it decreases in summer to 5‚Äì10‚Ä∞ and 30‚Äì32‚Ä∞ respectively. Most of the river runoff (about 70% or 515 km3/year) is contributed by the Lena River. Other major contributions are from Khatanga (more than 100 km3), Olenyok (35 km3), Yana (greater than 30 km3) and Anabar (20 km3), with other rivers contributing about 20 km3. Owing to the ice melting season, about 90% of the annual runoff occurs between June and September with 35‚Äì40% in August alone, whereas January contributes only 5%. Sea currents form a cyclone consisting of the southward stream near Severnaya Zemlya which reaches the continental coast and flows along it from west to east. It is then amplified by the Lena River flow and diverts to the north and north-west toward the Arctic Ocean. A small part of the cyclone leaks through the Sannikov Strait to the East Siberian Sea. The cyclone has a speed of 2 cm/s which decreases toward the center. The center of the cyclone drifts with time that slightly alters the flow character. The tides are mostly semi-diurnal (rise twice a day), with the average amplitude of . In the Khatanga Gulf it may reach 2 m because of the funnel-like shape of the gulf. This tidal wave is then noticeable up to the unusually long distance of 500 km up to the Khatanga River ‚Äì the tidal wave is damped at much shorter distance in other rivers of the Laptev Sea. The seasonal variations of the sea level are relatively small ‚Äì the sea level rises up to in summer near the river deltas and lowers in winter. Wind-induced changes are observed all through the year, but are more frequent in autumn when the winds are strong and steady. In general, the sea level rises with northern and lowers with southern winds, but depending on the area, the maximum amplitude is observed for a specific wind direction (e.g. western and north-western in the south- eastern part of the sea). They average amplitudes are 1‚Äì2 m and may exceed near Tiksi. Owing to the weak winds and shallow waters, the sea is relatively calm with the waves typically within . In July‚ÄìAugust waves up to 4‚Äì5 m are observed near the sea center, and they may reach in autumn. History and exploration The distribution of Yukaghirs in the 17th century (hatched). Chuvans are marked in pink. Even women in ethnic costume, early 20th century. The coast of the Laptev Sea was inhabited for ages by the native peoples of northern Siberia such as Yukaghirs and Chuvans (sub-tribe of Yukaghirs).–ß—É–≤–∞–Ω—Ü—ã. Narodru.ru. Retrieved on 2013-03-21. Those tribes were engaged in fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry, as reindeer sleds were essential for transportation and hunting. They were joined and absorbed by Evens and Evenks around the 2nd century and later, between 9th and 15th centuries, by much more numerous Yakuts. All those tribes moved north from the Baikal Lake area avoiding confrontations with Mongols. Whereas they all practiced shamanism, they spoke different languages.Yukaghirs, Great Soviet Encyclopedia (in Russian)Evenks, Great Soviet Encyclopedia (in Russian)Bella Bychkova Jordan, Terry G.

Many early explorations were likely unreported, as indicated by finding of graves on some islands by their official discoverers. In 1629, Siberian Cossacks went through the Lena River and reached its delta. They left a note that the river flows into a sea.

Catherine II granted the permission and named the islands after Lyakhov. While exploring the area in the 1770s, Lyakhov described several other islands, including Kotelny, which he named so after a large kettle ( ‚Äì kotel) left there by previous visitors.

Extrapolated, they give the following annual estimates (in thousand tonnes) by species: sardine (1.2), Arctic cisco (2.0), Bering cisco (2.7), broad whitefish (2.6), Muksun (2.4) and others (3.6). Hunting sea mammals is only practiced by native people. In particular, walrus hunting is only allowed by scientific expeditions and local tribes for subsistence.Mammals in the Seas: Pinniped species summaries and report on sirenians. Volume 2, Food & Agriculture Org., 1979, p. 57 Despite freezing, navigation is a major human activity on the Laptev Sea with the major port in Tiksi. During Soviet times, the Laptev Sea coastal areas experienced a limited boom owing to the first icebreaker convoys plying the Northern Sea Route and the creation of the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route. The route was difficult even for icebreakers ‚Äì so Lenin (pictured) and her convoy of five ships were trapped in ice in the Laptev Sea around September 1937. They spent an enforced winter there and were rescued by another icebreaker Krasin in August 1938. The major transported goods were timber, fur and construction materials.

More or less regular shipping is to be found only from Murmansk to Dudinka in the west and between Vladivostok and Pevek in the east. Ports between Dudinka and Pevek see next to no shipping at all. Logashkino was abandoned in 1998 and is now a ghost town.Resolution No. 443 of 29 September 1998 On Exclusion of Inhabited Localities from the Records of Administrative and Territorial Division of the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic Mining In the 1930, deposits of coal, oil and salt were discovered around the Nordvik Bay. In order to explore them in the extreme Arctic conditions, a Gulag penal labor camp was established in Nordvik. Drilling revealed only small, shallow oil pockets in connection with salt structures with little commercial significance. However the salt was extracted on a large scale by means of forced laborers in a penal colony. From the 1930s onwards Nordvik became an important source of salt supply for the northern fisheries. Although the original prospects for oil at Nordvik did not materialize, experience was gained in the exploration for hydrocarbons within the continuous permafrost zones. This experience proved invaluable in the later exploration and exploitation of the massive oil and gas fields of Western Siberia. The penal colony was closed and its traces erased in the mid-1940s right before Americans arrived in Nordvik as allies of the Soviet Union. In 2017, Rosneft found oil in the Laptev Sea at its Tsentralno-Olginskaya-1 well. In the Anabar District of Sakha, in the village of Mayat there is one of the northernmost diamond mines. There are also tin and gold mines in the Ust-Yansky District. Research The meteorological station of Tiksi has been renovated in 2006 (for example, it has internet connection and security cameras with a wireless interface) and has become part of the Atmospheric Observatory program of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agency. The program aims at long-term, systematic and thorough measurements of clouds, radiation, aerosols, surface energy fluxes and chemistry in the Arctic. It is based on four Arctic stations at one of the world's northernmost settlements, namely Eureka and Alert in Canada (in particular, Alert is the northernmost permanently inhabited place on Earth, only from the North Pole (\\"Twice a year, the military resupply Alert, the world's northernmost settlement.\\")), Tiksi in Russia, and Utqiagvik in Alaska.A Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) Arctic Atmospheric Observatories, NOAA Pollution The water pollution is relatively low and mostly originates from the numerous plants and mines standing on the Lena, Yana and Anabar rivers. Their waste is contaminated with phenols (0.002‚Äì0.007 mg/L), copper (0.001‚Äì0.012 mg/L) and zinc (0.01‚Äì0.03 mg/L) and is continuously washed down the rivers into the sea. Another regular polluter is the coastal Urban-type settlement of Tiksi. Occasional petrol spills occurred due to navigation and petrol mining. Another major contaminant is associated with floating and sunken wood in the sea, due to decades of rafting activities. As a result, the phenol concentration in the Laptev Sea is the highest over the Arctic waters. Laptev sea sunset.JPGLaptev Sea. Sunset. Laptev sea ice hummocks.JPGLaptev Sea. Ice hummocks.

LaBute (born March 19, 1963) is an American playwright, film director, screenwriter, and actor. He is best-known for a play that he wrote and later adapted for film, In the Company of Men (1997), which won awards from the Sundance Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Awards, and the New York Film Critics Circle. He wrote and directed the films Your Friends & Neighbors (1998), Possession (2002) (based on the A.S. Byatt novel), The Shape of Things (2003) (based on his play of the same name), The Wicker Man (2006), Some Velvet Morning (2013), and Dirty Weekend (2015). He directed the films Nurse Betty (2000), Lakeview Terrace (2008), and the American adaptation of Death at a Funeral (2010). LaBute created the TV series Billy & Billie, writing and directing all of the episodes. He is also the creator of the TV series Van Helsing. Recently, he executive produced, co-directed and co-wrote the Netflix's The I-Land. He also directed several episodes for shows such as Hell on Wheels and Billions. Early life LaBute was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Marian, a hospital receptionist, and Richard LaBute, a long-haul truck driver. LaBute is of French Canadian, English, and Irish ancestry, and was raised in Spokane, Washington. He studied theater at Brigham Young University (BYU), where he joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. At BYU he also met actor Aaron Eckhart, who would later play leading roles in several of his films. He produced a number of plays that pushed the envelope of what was acceptable at the conservative religious university, some of which were shut down after their premieres. However, he also was honored as one of the \\"most promising undergraduate playwrights\\" at the BYU theater department's annual awards.People in the arts, Deseret News.

In 1993, he returned to Brigham Young University to premiere his play In the Company of Men, for which he received an award from the Association for Mormon Letters. He taught drama and film at IPFW in Fort Wayne, Indiana in the early 1990s where he adapted and filmed the play, shot over two weeks and costing $25,000, beginning his career as a film director. The film won the Filmmakers Trophy at the Sundance Film Festival, and major awards and nominations at the Deauville Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Awards, the Thessaloniki Film Festival, the Society of Texas Film Critics Awards and the New York Film Critics Circle. In the Company of Men portrays two businessmen (one played by Eckhart) cruelly plotting to romance and emotionally destroy a deaf woman. His next film Your Friends & Neighbors (1998), with an ensemble cast including Eckhart and Ben Stiller, was a shocking portrayal of the sex lives of three yuppie couples in the big city. His play Bash: Latter-Day Plays is a set of three short plays (Iphigenia in Orem, A Gaggle of Saints, and Medea Redux) depicting essentially good Latter-day Saints doing disturbing and violent things. It ran Off-Broadway at the Douglas Fairbanks Theatre in 1999. Medea Redux is a one-person performance by Calista Flockhart.Brantley, Ben. \\"Theater Review.

He has since formally left the LDS Church. Times & Seasons, An Interview with Neil LaBute In 2001, LaBute wrote and directed the play The Shape of Things, which premi√®red in London, featuring film actors Paul Rudd and Rachel Weisz. It was turned into a film in 2003 with the same cast and director. Set in a small university town in the American Midwest, it focuses on four young students who become emotionally and romantically involved with each other, questioning the nature of art and the lengths to which people will go for love. Weisz's character manipulates Rudd's character into changing everything about himself and discarding his friends in order to become more attractive to her. She even pretends to fall in love with him, prompting an offer of marriage, whereupon she cruelly exposes and humiliates him before an audience, announcing that he has simply been an \\"art project\\" for her MFA thesis.

Ben Brantley, THEATER REVIEW: Yes, He Survived Sept. 11, bu What's in It for Him?, The New York Times, 19 December 2002 While hesitant to term The Mercy Seat \\"political theater\\", Labute said, \\"I refer to this play in the printed introduction as a kind of emotional terrorism that we wage on those we profess to love.\\" He dedicated this edition to David Hare, in response to Hare's \\"straightforward, thoughtful, probing work\\". His next play, reasons to be pretty, played Off-Broadway from May 14 to July 5, 2008, in a production by MCC Theater at the Lucille Lortel Theatre. It went on Broadway in 2009, with previews at the Lyceum Theatre beginning 13 March, and its opening on 2 April. The play was nominated for three 2009 Tony Awards, including Best Play, Best Leading Actor in a Play (Thomas Sadoski), and Best Featured Actress in a Play (Marin Ireland), but did not win in any category.

Jailbait Evokes a More Human Neil LaBute, Village Voice, April 7, 2009 The New York Times said that critics labeled him a misanthrope on the release of his film Your Friends & Neighbors because of the film's strong misanthropic plot and characters. Britain's Independent newspaper in May 2008 dubbed him \\"America's misanthrope par excellence\\". Citing the misanthropic tone of the plot in the films, In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors and The Shape of Things, film critic Daniel Kimmel identified a pattern running through LaBute's work of being that the unlikeable, main antagonists of those three films end up getting away with their lying, scheming and mid-deeds, coming out on top of all the other characters as the real winners of those stories by quoting: \\"Neil LaBute is a misanthrope who assumes that only callous and evil people, who use and abuse others, can survive in this world.\\" Critics labeled him a misogynist after the release of In the Company of Men. Neil LaBute has a Thing About Beauty, The New York Times, March 25, 2009 LaBute directed Death at a Funeral, a remake of a 2007 British film of the same name. It was written by Dean Craig (who also wrote the original screenplay) and starred Chris Rock. LaBute wrote a new Introduction and new scenes for the Chicago Shakespeare Theater production of The Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare from April 7 to June 6, 2010. LaBute framed the classic play in overtly metatheatrical terms and added a lesbian romance in a subplot.

The screenplay was written by Labute and was adapted from Labute's own 2005 play. In an interview with Screen Comment's Sam Weisberg, he said: \\"I have had a lot of people direct my material for the theater, but I haven't had anyone do my work on film.

It happens when the frequency of incident radiation coincides with the natural frequency of rotation of electrons in magnetic fields. A free electron in a static and uniform magnetic field will move in a circle due to the Lorentz force. The circular motion may be superimposed with a uniform axial motion, resulting in a helix, or with a uniform motion perpendicular to the field (e.g., in the presence of an electrical or gravitational field) resulting in a cycloid.

In plasma physics An ionized plasma may be efficiently produced or heated by superimposing a static magnetic field and a high-frequency electromagnetic field at the electron cyclotron resonance frequency. In the toroidal magnetic fields used in magnetic fusion energy research, the magnetic field decreases with the major radius, so the location of the power deposition can be controlled within about a centimeter. Furthermore, the heating power can be rapidly modulated and is deposited directly into the electrons. These properties make electron cyclotron heating a very valuable research tool for energy transport studies. In addition to heating, electron cyclotron waves can be used to drive current. The inverse process of electron cyclotron emission can be used as a diagnostic of the radial electron temperature profile. {Example of cyclotron resonance between a charged particle and linearly polarized electric field (shown in green).

Geller, Peroc. 1st Int. Con. Ion Source, Saclay, p. 537, 1969 Dr. Claude Lyneis, and Dr. H. Postma; respectively from French Atomic Energy Commission, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the use of electron cyclotron resonance for efficient plasma generation, especially to obtain large numbers of multiply charged ions, has acquired a unique importance in various technological fields. Many diverse activities depend on electron cyclotron resonance technology, including * advanced cancer treatment, where ECR ion sources are crucial for proton therapy, * advanced semiconductor manufacturing, especially for high density DRAM memories, through plasma etching or other plasma processing technologies, * electric propulsion devices for spacecraft propulsion, where a broad range of devices (HiPEP, some ion thrusters, or electrodeless plasma thrusters), * for particle accelerators, on-line mass separation and radioactive ion charge breeding,Handbook of Ion Source, B. Wolf, , p136-146 * and, as a more mundane example, painting of plastic bumpers for cars. The ECR ion source makes use of the electron cyclotron resonance to ionize a plasma. Microwaves are injected into a volume at the frequency corresponding to the electron cyclotron resonance, defined by the magnetic field applied to a region inside the volume. The volume contains a low pressure gas. The alternating electric field of the microwaves is set to be synchronous with the gyration period of the free electrons of the gas, and increases their perpendicular kinetic energy. Subsequently, when the energized free electrons collide with the gas in the volume they can cause ionization if their kinetic energy is larger than the ionization energy of the atoms or molecules. The ions produced correspond to the gas type used, which may be pure, a compound, or vapor of a solid or liquid material. ECR ion sources are able to produce singly charged ions with high intensities (e.g. H+ and D+ ions of more than 100 mA (electrical) in DC modeR. Gobin et al., Saclay High Intensity Light Ion Source Status The Euro. Particle Accelerator Conf. 2002, Paris, France, June 2002, p1712 using a 2.45 GHz ECR ion source). For multiply charged ions, the ECR ion source has the advantages that it is able to confine the ions for long enough for multiple collisions and multiple ionization to take place, and the low gas pressure in the source avoids recombination. The VENUS ECR ion source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has produced in intensity of 0.25 mA (electrical) of Bi29+.VENUS reveals the future of heavy-ion sources CERN Courier, 6 May 2005 Some important industrial fields would not exist without the use of this fundamental technology, which makes electron cyclotron resonance ion and plasma sources one of the enabling technologies of today's world. In condensed matter physics Within a solid the mass in the cyclotron frequency equation above is replaced with the effective mass tensor m^*. Cyclotron resonance is therefore a useful technique to measure effective mass and Fermi surface cross-section in solids. In a sufficiently high magnetic field at low temperature in a relatively pure material :\\\\begin{align} \\\\omega_\\\\text{ce} &> \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau} \\\\ \\\\hbar{\\\\omega}_\\\\text{ce} &> k_B T \\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\tau is the carrier scattering lifetime, k_B is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. When these conditions are satisfied, an electron will complete its cyclotron orbit without engaging in a collision, at which point it is said to be in a well-defined Landau level.

The pursuit of folk devils frequently intensifies into a mass movement that is called a moral panic. When a moral panic is in full swing, the folk devils are the subject of loosely organized but pervasive campaigns of hostility through gossip and the spreading of urban legends. The mass media sometimes get in on the act or attempt to create new folk devils in an effort to promote controversy. Sometimes the campaign against the folk devil influences a nation's politics and legislation.  Concept  The concept of the folk devil was introduced by sociologist Stanley Cohen in 1972, in his study Folk Devils and Moral Panics,Cohen, S. (1973). Folk Devils and Moral Panics. St Albans: Paladin which analysed media controversies concerning Mods and Rockers in the United Kingdom of the 1960s. Cohen‚Äôs research was based on the media storm over a violent clash between two youth subcultures, the mods and the rockers, on a bank holiday on a beach in England, 1964. Though the incident only resulted in some property damage without any serious physical injury to any of the individuals involved, several newspapers published sensationalist articles surrounding the event. Cohen examined articles written about the topic and noted a pattern of distorted facts and misrepresentation, as well as a distinct, simplistic depiction of the respective images of both groups involved in the disturbance. He articulated three stages in the media's reporting on folk devils: # Symbolisation: the folk devil is portrayed in one singular narrative, their appearance and overall identify oversimplified to be easily recognizable. # Exaggeration: the facts of the controversy surrounding the folk devil are distorted, or fabricated all together, fueling the ‚Äúmoral crusade‚Äù. # Prediction: further immoral actions on the part of the folk devil are anticipated. In the case of the mods and rockers, increased police presence the following year on the bank holiday led to another occurrence of violence. Cohen noted that the depiction of mods and rockers as violent, unruly troublemakers actually led in itself to a rise in ‚Äúdeviant behaviour‚Äù by the subcultures.\\"Labelling Theory and the Media: Moral Panics.\\" North Wales 14-19 Network. N.p., 6 Oct. 2012. Web. 13 Nov. 2014. .  Historic and modern cases  The basic pattern of agitations against folk devils can be seen in the history of witchhunts and similar manias of persecution; the histories of predominately Catholic and Protestant European countries present examples of adherents of the rival Western Christian faith as folk devils; minorities and immigrants have often been seen as folk devils; in the long history of anti- Semitism, which frequently targets Jews with allegations of dark, murderous practices, such as blood libel; or the Roman persecution of Christians that blamed the military reverses suffered by the Roman Empire on the Christians' abandonment of paganism. In modern times, political and religious leaders in many nations have sought to present atheists and secularists as deviant outsiders who threaten the social and moral order. The identification of folk devils may reflect the efforts of powerful institutions to displace social anxieties. Another example of religious and ethnic discrimination associated with Cohen's folk devil theory would be Islamophobia, the discrimination of Muslims and those perceived as being Middle Eastern in origin. Post-9/11 reactions by Western countries stereotyped Muslims as violent, hateful, and of possessing fanatical extremist ideology. The group was depicted as posing a threat to social peace and safety in the Western world, and was subject to much hostility politically, from the media and from society.Al-Natour, Ryan J. \\"Folk Devils and the Proposed Islamic School in Camden.\\" Continuum: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies 24.4 (2010): 573-85. Print.  Columbine as a case study  In a 2014 study, the media reaction to the Columbine massacre was applied to Cohen‚Äôs folk devil theory. On April 20, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, two students from Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado, went on a shooting spree which resulted in the deaths of 15 people. News reports in the weeks following the tragedy labelled the shooters as being ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù with gothic subculture, and suggested a link between Harris and Klebold‚Äôs alleged identification with gothic subculture and their acts of violence. In their attempt to make sense of the Columbine shootings, journalists and other media commentators linked goths to terrorism, Charles and Marilyn Manson, self- mutilation, hostage-taking, gang culture, the Waco cult, the Oklahoma City bombing, Satanism, mass murder, ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, suicide, the Internet, video games, skinhead music, white extremism, and Adolf Hitler. The ABC news program 20/20 aired a special entitled ‚ÄúThe Goth Phenomenon‚Äù in which it reinforced claims that the shooters were heavily submerged in goth culture, and suggested that individuals of gothic subculture were to blame for homicidal activity in the past. The hostility and hysteria over the perceived ‚Äòevil‚Äô goth culture amplified in the years following the shooting. Goths were stereotyped in the media as being perpetuators or supporters of violence donned in black trench coats. Several high schools across the United States banned black trench coats and other apparel perceived as being linked to goth culture. Some police departments in the United States labelled gothic subculture as being ‚Äúgang-based‚Äù, and as something that should be subjected to ‚Äúincreased police surveillance‚Äù. From the time of the Columbine shooting until 2003, there were reports of individuals sporting what was seen as gothic dress being interrogated, ticketed and arrested. In 2002, U.S. Representative Sam Graves caused Blue Springs, Missouri to be granted US$273,000 to combat the ‚Äúnew gothic threat‚Äù. The backlash against goth subculture after the Columbine shooting draws many parallels to Stanley Cohen‚Äôs research on the mods and rockers, two other youth subcultures cast as folk devils by society. In both instances the groups were portrayed in one distinct, dumbed-down image, ostracized, stripped of any redeeming qualities, and blamed for wrongdoings in society.Griffiths, Richard. \\"The Gothic Folk Devils Strike Back!

The operation was undertaken by General Sir Harold Alexander's 15th Army Group (comprising General Mark W. Clark's Fifth Army and General Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army) and followed the successful invasion of Sicily. The main invasion force landed around Salerno on 9 September on the western coast in Operation Avalanche, while two supporting operations took place in Calabria (Operation Baytown) and Taranto (Operation Slapstick). Background=Allied plan Map of the Invasion of Italy. Following the defeat of the Axis Powers in North Africa in May 1943, there was disagreement between the Allies as to what the next step should be. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, in particular, wanted to invade Italy, which in November 1942 he called \\"the soft underbelly of the axis\\" (and General Mark W. Clark, in contrast, later called \\"one tough gut\\").. Popular support in Italy for the war was declining, and he believed an invasion would remove Italy from the Axis, and thus the influence of Axis forces in the Mediterranean Sea, opening it to Allied traffic. This would reduce the amount of shipping capacity needed to supply Allied forces in the Middle East and Far East,. at a time when the disposal of Allied shipping capacity was in crisis,. and increase British and American supplies to the Soviet Union. In addition, it would tie down German forces. Joseph Stalin, the Premier of the Soviet Union, had been pressing Churchill and Roosevelt to open a \\"second front\\" in Europe, which would lessen the German Army's focus on the Eastern Front, where the bulk of its forces were fighting in the largest armed conflict in history against the Soviet Red Army. However, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, General George Marshall, and much of the American staff, wanted to avoid operations that might delay the main invasion of Europe, which had been discussed and planned as early as 1942, and which finally materialized as Operation Overlord in 1944. When it became clear that no cross-channel invasion of occupied France could be undertaken in 1943, it was agreed to invade Sicily, with no commitment made to any follow-up operations. However, both Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the U.S. President, accepted the necessity of Allied armies continuing to engage the Axis in the period after a successful campaign in Sicily and before the start of one in northwest Europe.Molony, p. 186. The discussion continued through the Trident Conference in Washington in May but it was not until late July, after the course of the Sicilian campaign had become clear and with the fall of Benito Mussolini, the Italian Prime Minister and fascist leader, that the Joint Chiefs of Staff instructed General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO), to go ahead at the earliest possible date.Molony, pp. 185-197. Joint Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) were operationally responsible for all Allied land forces in the Mediterranean theatre, and it was they who planned and commanded the invasion of Sicily and the Italian mainland. The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, codenamed Operation Husky, was highly successful, although many of the Axis forces managed to avoid capture and escape to the mainland. The Axis viewed this as a success. More importantly, in late July, a coup deposed Mussolini as head of the Italian government, which then began approaching the Allies to make peace. It was believed a quick invasion of Italy might hasten an Italian surrender and produce quick military victories over the German troops that could be trapped fighting in a hostile country. However, Italian fascist (and more so German) resistance proved relatively strong, and fighting in Italy continued even after the fall of Berlin in April 1945. In addition, the invasion left the Allies in a position of supplying food and supplies to conquered territory, a burden which would otherwise have fallen on Germany. As well, Italy occupied by a hostile German army would have created additional problems for the German Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C), Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring.Grigg, Prior to Sicily, Allied plans envisioned crossing the Strait of Messina, a limited invasion in the \\"instep\\" area (Taranto), and advancing up the toe of Italy,The Italian peninsula resembles the shape of a high-heeled boot. The toe refers to the southwest tip of the peninsula, where the toe would be in the boot. anticipating a defense by both German and Italian forces. The overthrowing of Mussolini and the Fascisti made a more ambitious plan feasible, and the Allies decided to supplement the crossing of the British Eighth Army, under General Bernard Montgomery, with a seizure of the port of Naples. Although the Americans favored Napoleon's maxim that Italy, like a boot, should be entered from the top, the range limits of Allied fighter planes based in Sicily reduced Allied choices to two landing areas: one at the Volturno River basin and the other at Salerno.Atkinson p.181 Salerno was chosen because it was closer to air bases, experienced better surf conditions for landing, allowed transport ships to anchor closer to the beaches, had narrower beaches for the rapid construction of exit roads, and had an excellent pre-existing road network behind the beaches. Operation Baytown was the preliminary step in the plan in which the British Eighth Army would depart from the port of Messina on Sicily, to cross the Straits of Messina and land near the tip of Calabria (the \\"toe\\" of Italy), on 3 September 1943. The short distance from Sicily meant landing craft could launch from there directly, rather than be carried by ship. The British 5th Infantry Division (Major- General Gerard Bucknall) of XIII Corps, under Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey, would land on the north side of the \\"toe\\" while its 1st Canadian Infantry Division (Major-General Guy Simonds) would land at Cape Spartivento on the south side. Montgomery was strongly opposed to Operation Baytown. He predicted it would be a waste of effort since it assumed the Germans would give battle in Calabria; if they failed to do so, the diversion would not work, and the only effect of the operation would be to place the Eighth Army 480 km (300 miles) south of the main landing at Salerno. He was proved correct; after Operation Baytown, the British Eighth Army marched 480 km north to the Salerno area against no opposition other than engineering obstacles. Salerno D-Day plan. Plans for the use of Allied airborne forces took several forms, all of which were cancelled. The initial plan to land glider-borne troops in the mountain passes of the Sorrento Peninsula above Salerno was abandoned 12 August. Six days later it was replaced by Operation Giant, in which two regiments of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division (Matthew Ridgway) would seize and hold crossings over the Volturno River. This was at first expanded to include the entire division, including an amphibious landing by the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment, then deemed logistically unsupportable and reduced to a two-battalion drop at Capua to block the highway there. The Italian surrender on 3 September led to the cancellation of Operation Giant I and its replacement by Operation Giant II, a drop of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment on Stazione di Furbara and Cerveteri airfields, 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Rome. This was intended to aid Italian forces in saving Rome, possibly the most historically important city in the world, from German razing, a condition of the Italian armistice.Reports surfaced that the Germans had mined the colliseum and in the event of defeat, an order would be given from the high command to destroy the city. Similar orders were given to German general Dietrich von Choltitz as Paris fell back into Allied hands, which he claims to have defied. Because the distance from the Allied beachheads precluded any substantial Allied support of the airborne troops, Brigadier General Maxwell D. Taylor, the acting assistant division commander (ADC) of the 82nd Airborne Division, was spirited into Rome to assess the willingness of Italian troops to cooperate with the Americans. Taylor's judgment was that the operation would be a trap and he advised cancellation, which occurred late on the afternoon of 8 September after pathfinders had already taken off aboard their troop carrier aircraft. The main landings (Operation Avalanche) were scheduled to take place on 9 September, during which the main force would land around Salerno on the western coast. It would consist of the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, comprising the U.S. VI Corps under Major General Ernest J. Dawley, the British X Corps under Lieutenant-General Richard McCreery, with the 82nd Airborne Division in reserve, a total of eight divisions and two brigade-sized units. Its primary objectives were to seize the port of Naples to ensure resupply, and to cut across to the east coast, trapping Axis troops further south. The naval task force of warships, merchant ships and landing craft totaling 627 vessels came under the command of Vice Admiral Henry K. Hewitt.Molony, p. 261. Following the disappointing air cover from land-based aircraft during the Sicily landings, Force V of and four escort carriers augmented the cruisers , , , and fourteen destroyers of Hewitt's command.Atkinson p.184 Cover for the task force was provided by Force H, a group of four British battleships and two fleet carriers with destroyers in support, which was directly subordinate to the C‚Äìin‚ÄìC Mediterranean Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham. Men of the 2nd Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment, part of 17th Brigade of British 5th Division, wait to board landing craft at Catania for the invasion of Italy, 2 September 1943. In the original planning, the great attraction of capturing the important port of Taranto in the \\"heel\\" of Italy had been evident and an assault had been considered but rejected because of the very strong defenses there. However, with the signing of the armistice with the Italians on 3 September the picture changed. It was decided to carry the British 1st Airborne Division (Major-General George F. Hopkinson) to Taranto using British warships, seize the port and several nearby airfields and follow up by shipping in Lieutenant-General Charles Allfrey's British V Corps and a number of fighter squadrons. The airborne division, which was undergoing training exercises in two locations apart, was ordered on 4 September to embark on 8 September. With such short notice to create plans, Operation Slapstick was soon nicknamed Operation Bedlam.Molony, p. 242. The Avalanche plan using less than half the troops landed during Operation Husky was daring, considering possible resistance by six German divisions.Atkinson p.185 The Fifth Army would be landing on a very broad front, using only three assault divisions (one American, the 36th, under Major General Fred L. Walker, in VI Corps, and two British, the 46th, under Major- General John Hawkesworth, and 56th, under Major-General Douglas Graham, in X Corps),Terdoslavich, William. \\"Nothing Goes Right in Italy\\", in Fawcett, Bill, ed. How to Lose WWII (New York: Harper, 2000), p.157. and the two corps were widely separated, both in distance () and by the Sele River.Terdoslavich, p.157. Clark initially provided no troops to cover the river, offering the Germans an easy route to attack, and only belatedly landed two battalions to protect it. Furthermore, the terrain was highly favorable to the defender. Planning for the Salerno phase was accomplished in only forty-five days, rather than the months that might be expected. A U.S. Army Ranger force, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William O. Darby, consisting of three U.S. Ranger battalions (the 1st, 3rd and 4th) and two British Commando units, under Brigadier Robert Laycock (consisting of No. 2 (Army) Commando and No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando) was tasked with holding the mountain passes leading to Naples, but no plan existed for linking the Ranger force up with X Corps' follow-up units. Finally, although tactical surprise was unlikely, Clark ordered no naval preparatory bombardment or naval gunfire support take place, despite experience in the Pacific Theater demonstrating it was necessary. (Major General Walker, commanding the U.S. 36th \\"Arrowhead\\" Division, believed the defenders, from Traugott Herr's LXXVI Panzer Corps, were too scattered for it to be effective.) The element of surprise was further limited by belated discovery of naval minefields off Salerno requiring landing craft to spend two hours traveling from the transports to the landing beaches.Atkinson pp.184&204 On the German side, Kesselring lacked the strength to push the Salerno landing back, and was refused two panzer divisions from northern Italy to assist him. Operation Avalanche was planned under the name Top Hat and supported by a deception plan, Operation Boardman, a false threat of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. Axis defensive organization In mid-August, the Germans had activated Army Group B (Heeresgruppe B) under Erwin Rommel with responsibility for German troops in Italy as far south as Pisa.Molony, p. 210. Army Command South (OB S√ºd) under Albert Kesselring continued to be responsible for southern ItalyMolony, p. 212. and the German High Command formed a new army headquarters to be Army Command South's main field formation. The new German 10th Army (10. Armee) headquarters, commanded by Heinrich von Vietinghoff, was activated on 22 August.Molony, pp. 209 -210. The German 10th Army had two subordinate corps with a total of six divisions which were positioned to cover possible landing sites. Under Hermann Balck's XIV Panzer Corps (XIV Panzerkorps) was the Hermann G√∂ring Panzer Division (Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G√∂ring, under Wilhelm Schmalz), 15th Panzergrenadier Division (15. Panzergrenadier-Division, Eberhard Rodt) and 16th Panzer Division (16. Panzer-Division, Rudolf Sieckenius); and under Traugott Herr's LXXVI Panzer Corps (LXXVI Panzerkorps) was 26th Panzer Division (26. Panzer- Division, Heinrich Freiherr von Luttwitz), 29th Panzergrenadier Division (29. Panzergrenadier-Division, Walter Fries) and 1st Parachute Division (1. Fallschirmj√§ger-Division, Fritz-Hubert Graser).Molony, p. 213. Von Vietinghoff specifically positioned the 16th Panzer Division in the hills above the Salerno plain. Battle=Operations in southern Italy Lieutenant General Mark Clark on board during the landings at Salerno, Italy, 12 September 1943. On 3 September 1943, the British Eighth Army's XIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey and composed of the 1st Canadian and British 5th Infantry Divisions, launched Operation Baytown under General Bernard Montgomery's direction. Opposition to the landings was light and the Italian units surrendered almost immediately. Albert Kesselring and his staff did not believe the Calabria landings would be the main Allied point of attack, the Salerno region or possibly even north of Rome being more logical. He had already therefore ordered General Traugott Herr's LXXVI Panzer Corps to pull back from engagement with the Eighth Army, leaving only 29th Panzergrenadier Division's 15th Panzergrenadier Regiment in the 'toe' of Italy. By 3 September, most of this unit was in prepared positions at Bagnara, some from the landings which it had orders to hold until 6 September. After this they were to withdraw to join the rest of 29th Panzergrenadier Division which was concentrating at Castrovillari, some to the rear. The Kr√ºger Battle Group (two battalions of 71st Panzergrenadier Regiment, 129th Reconnaissance Battalion and detachments of artillery and engineers) under 26th Panzer Division, would then stand at Nicotera, roughly up the coast from Bagnara.Molony, p. 239. General Montgomery salutes his troops from a DUKW, Reggio, Italy, September 1943. On 4 September, the British 5th Infantry Division reached Bagnara Calabra, linked up with 1st Special Reconnaissance Squadron (which arrived by sea) and drove the 3rd Battalion, 15th Panzergrenadier Regiment from its position. On 5 September the allies flew above Soveria Mannelli (central Calabria) and bombed all along the downstream area of the town, where Nazis bases and warehouses stood. Fortunately, the urban area was barely damaged. On 7 September, contact was made with the Kr√ºger Battle Group. On 8 September, the 231st Independent Brigade Group, under Brigadier Robert \\"Roy\\" Urquhart, was landed by sea at Pizzo Calabro, some behind the Nicotera defenses. They found themselves attacked from the north by a mobile force from 26th Panzer Division and from the south by the Kr√ºger Battle Group which was withdrawing from the Nicotera position. After an initial attack which made no headway, the Kr√ºger Battle Group veered away but the northern attack continued throughout the day before the whole German force withdrew at dusk.Molony, p. 241. Progress was slow as demolished bridges, roadblocks and mines delayed the Eighth Army. The nature of the countryside in the toe of Italy made it impossible to by-pass obstacles and so the Allies' speed of advance was entirely dependent on the rate at which their engineers could clear obstructions. Thus, Montgomery's objections to the operation were proved correct: the Eighth Army could not tie down German units that refused battle and the main obstacle to their advance was the terrain and German demolitions of roads and bridges. By 8 September, Kesselring had concentrated Heinrich von Vietinghoff's 10th Army, ready to make a rapid response to any Allied landing.Clark, p.20. In Calabria, Herr's LXXVI Panzer Corps had two divisions concentrated in the Castrovillari area. Its third division, 1st Parachute Division (1. Fallschirmj√§ger-Division), was deployed toward Taranto. The rearguard in the toe was BattleGroup von Usedom, comprising a single battalion (1/67th Panzergrenadier Regiment) with detachments of artillery and engineers.Molony, p. 245. Meanwhile, Balck's XIV Panzer Corps was positioned to face possible landings from the sea with 16th Panzer Division in the Gulf of Salerno, the Hermann G√∂ring Division near Naples and the 15th Panzergrenadier Division to the north in the Gulf of Gaeta.Molony, p. 267. On 8 September (before the main invasion), the surrender of Italy to the Allies was announced, first by General Eisenhower, then in the Badoglio Proclamation by the Italian government. Italian units ceased combat and the Navy sailed to Allied ports to surrender. The German forces in Italy were prepared for this and implemented Operation Achse to disarm Italian units and occupy important defensive positions. Operation Slapstick commenced on 9 September. The first echelon of the British 1st Airborne Division arrived on four British cruisers, a U.S. cruiser, and the British fast minelayer . The Italian battleships Andrea Doria and with two cruisers passed by, en route to surrender in Malta. There were no Germans in Taranto and so disembarkation was unopposed. The only casualties occurred when Abdiel, at anchor, struck a mine and sank in minutes, with 168 killed and 126 injured.Molony, p. 243. On 11 September, as patrols were sent further afield, there were some sharp encounters with elements of the German 1st Parachute Division. But 1st Parachute could do little but skirmish and fall back because most of its strength was attached to the 26th Panzer and Herman G√∂ring Divisions at Salerno. Major-General George Frederick Hopkinson, General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the British 1st Airborne Division, was killed in one of these actions. By 11 September the ports of Bari and Brindisi, still under Italian control, were occupied. Salerno landings Operation Avalanche‚Äìthe main invasion at Salerno by the American Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark Clark‚Äìbegan on 9 September 1943, and in order to secure surprise, it was decided to assault without preliminary naval or aerial bombardment. However, as Admiral Henry Hewitt, the amphibious force commander, had predicted, tactical surprise was not achieved. As the first wave of Major General Fred Walker's U.S. 36th Infantry Division approached the Paestum shore at 03:30Atkinson p.204 a loudspeaker from the landing area proclaimed in English: \\"Come on in and give up. We have you covered.\\" The Allied troops attacked nonetheless.Potter & Nimitz pp.595-598 U.S. Navy tank landing craft offloads a U.S. Army jeep at Salerno. Major General Rudolf Sieckenius, commander of the 16th Panzer Division had organised his forces into four mixed arms battle groups which he had placed roughly apart and between back from the beaches. The D≈ërnemann group was just east of Salerno (and therefore were opposite Major General John Hawkesworth's British 46th Infantry Division when it landed), the Stempel battle group was between Pontecagnano and Battipaglia (and so faced Major General Douglas Graham's British 56th Infantry Division), the Holtey battle group was in a reserve role at Persano on the Sele river which formed the corps boundary between Lieutenant General Richard McCreery's British X Corps and Major General Ernest Dawley's U.S. VI Corps, while the von Doering battle group responsible for the Albanella to Rutino sector was south-east of Ogliastro, somewhat south of the U.S. 36th Division's beaches.Molony, p. 268. The British X Corps, composed of the British 46th and 56th Infantry Divisions and a light infantry force of U.S. Army Rangers and British Commandos of Brigadier Robert \\"Lucky\\" Laycock's 2nd Special Service Brigade, experienced mixed reactions to its landings. The U.S. Rangers met no opposition and with support from the guns of seized their mountain pass objectives while the Commandos, from No. 2 (Army) Commando and No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando, were also unopposed and secured the high ground on each side of the road through Molina Pass on the main route from Salerno to Naples. At first light units of No. 2 Commando moved towards Salerno and pushed back a small force of tanks and armoured cars from the 16th Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion. The British Commandos captured the town of Salerno after some serious fighting that cost 40 (Royal Marine) Commando and 41 Commando nine killed and thirty-seven wounded.By Land and By Sea: The Story of the Royal Marine Commandos, Robin Neillands, p. 86, Pen and Sword, 2004 Map of the Salerno beachhead at the end of 11 September 1943. The two British infantry divisions, however, met determined resistance and had to fight their way ashore with the help of naval bombardments. The depth and intensity of German resistance forced British commanders to concentrate their forces, rather than driving for a linkup with the Americans to the south. At Paestum, the two lead battalions of the 36th (Texas) Division (from the 141st and 142nd Infantry Regiments) received stiff resistance from two companies of the von Doering group.Molony, p. 280. German observers on Monte Soprano directed fire onto the landing craft. LST 336 took 18 hits, and some LCTs and DUKWs sheered away to avoid German shellfire. The division had not been in combat before and as a result of the Italian surrender, there was a general belief amongst the soldiers that the landings would be routine.Molony, pp. 280-281. The 141st Infantry lost cohesion and failed to gain any depth during the day which made the landing of supporting arms and stores impossible, leaving them without artillery and anti-tank guns.Molony, p. 281. However, the 142nd Infantry fared better and with the support of the 143rd Infantry, the reserve formation which had landed by 08:00, were able to push forward. Minesweepers cleared an inshore channel shortly after 09:00; so by late morning destroyers could steam within of the shoreline to shell German positions on Monte Soprano. USS Philadelphia and Savannah focused their guns on concentrations of German tanks, beginning a barrage of naval shells which would total eleven-thousand tons before the Salerno beachhead was secured.Atkinson p.207 By the end of the first day the Fifth Army, although it had not gained all its objectives, had made a promising start: the British X Corps' two assault divisions had pushed between inland and the special forces had advanced north across the Sorrento Peninsula and were looking down on the Plain of Naples. To the south, the U.S. 36th Division had established itself in the plain to the right of the Sele river and the higher ground to a depth of , although the 141st Infantry was still stuck near the beach. However, the XIV Panzer Corps commander, Hermann Balck, had seen the 16th Panzer Division's battle groups perform as intended and he had ordered both the Hermann G√∂ring Division south to the battle and later in the day had been able to order 15th Panzergrenadier likewise. Meanwhile, to the south, the 29th Panzergrenadier Division from LXXVI Panzer Corps had also been directed to Salerno.Molony, p. 276. Neither side had gained the initiative. Luftwaffe response Luftwaffe planes began strafing and bombing the invasion beaches shortly after 04:00 on the morning of 9 SeptemberAtkinson p.205 before X Corps seized the Montecorvino airfield inland later that day destroying three dozen German planes; but failure to capture the high ground inland left the airfield within easy range of German artillery and therefore unusable by Allied aircraft.Atkinson p.209 On 10 September German bombers began targeting Admiral Hewitt's flagship while the ship was serving as General Clark's headquarters. The flagship called thirty \\"red alerts\\" over a period of 36 hours in response to 450 Luftwaffe sorties. Admiral Hewitt reported: \\"Air situation here critical.\\"Atkinson pp.214&216 The aircraft carriers had intended to withdraw on 10 September, but remained with the invasion shipping so their Supermarine Seafires could provide the air cover invasion planners had expected to operate from Montecorvino.Atkinson p.213 Eighty-five Allied vessels were hit by German bombs off Salerno.Atkinson p.219 Fritz X glide bombs dropped by Dornier Do 217s disabled USS Savannah and narrowly missed USS Philadelphia on the morning of 11 September.Atkinson p.217 The following morning Clark moved his headquarters ashore, and Hewitt transferred with his staff to the small amphibious force flagship so the large Ancon with its conspicuous antenna array could retire to North Africa.Atkinson pp.219&227 Consolidation of the beachhead Men of the 2/6th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) advance past a pair of burning German PzKpfw IV tanks in the Salerno area, 22 September 1943. The Allies fought to expand their beachhead for three days while the Germans defended stubbornly to mask the build-up of their reinforcements for a counter-offensive.Molony, p. 289. On 10 September, Clark visited the battlefield and judged that it was unlikely that X Corps would be able to push quickly east past Battipaglia to link with VI Corps. Since X Corps' main line of thrust was to be north towards Naples, he decided to move the VI Corps left hand boundary north of the Sele river and move the bulk of Major General Troy Middleton's U.S. 45th Division into the gap. In view of the enemy reinforcements approaching from the north he also ordered a battalion-sized mixed arms group to reinforce the Rangers the next day.Molony, p. 293. Over the same period, German reinforcements filtered into the battlefield. Units, short of transport and subjected to other delays, arrived piecemeal and were formed into ad-hoc battle groups for immediate action. By 13 September, all the immediately available reinforcements had arrived including additional elements from the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division which had been released by Generalfeldmarschall Kesselring from further north near Rome.Molony, p. 294. By contrast, the Allied build-up was constrained by the limited transport available for the operation and the pre-determined schedule of the build-up based on how, during the planning phase, it had been anticipated the battle would develop. By 12 September, it had become clear that the Fifth Army had an acute shortage of infantry on the ground.Molony, p. 304. On 12 September, General Sir Harold Alexander, the 15th Army Group commander, reported to General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), in London: \\"I am not satisfied with the situation at Avalanche. The build-up is slow and they are pinned down to a bridgehead which has not enough depth. Everything is being done to push follow-up units and material to them. I expect heavy German counter-attack to be imminent.\\"Molony, p. 299. By 12 September, X Corps had taken a defensive posture because every battalion was committed and there were no reserves available to form an attack.Molony, p. 300. In the south, the 36th Division made some progress but towards midday a counterattack by elements of the 29th Panzergrenadier Division overran the 1st Battalion, 142nd Infantry Regiment. German counterattacks On 13 September, the Germans launched their counteroffensive. While the Herman G√∂ring battle groups attacked the northern flank of the beachhead, the main attack was on the boundary between the two Allied Corps which ran roughly from Battipaglia to the sea, with the greatest weight due to fall on the VI Corps side Molony, p. 308. On the morning of 13 September elements of Major General Walker's 36th Division attacked and captured Altavilla in the high ground some behind Paestum, but a counterattack forced them to withdraw as darkness fell. During the afternoon, two German battlegroups, the Kleine Limburg and the Kr√ºger, had attacked Persano and overrun the 1st Battalion, 157th Infantry before crossing the Sele to engage the 2nd Battalion of the 143rd Infantry and virtually wipe it out.Molony, pp. 309-310. The battle groups continued their strike south and south-west until reaching the confluence of the Sele and its large tributary the Calore, where it was stopped by artillery firing over open sights, naval gunfire and a makeshift infantry position manned by artillerymen, drivers, cooks and clerks and anyone else that Major General Walker could scrape together.Molony, p. 310. Clark's staff formulated various evacuation plans: Operation Brass Rail envisioned Clark and his 5th Army headquarters staff leaving the beachhead to establish headquarters afloat aboard . Operation Sealion envisioned shifting British X Corps to Paestum with VI Corps, while the alternative Operation Seatrain envisioned shifting VI Corps to the X Corps sector. The navy protested that reversing the landing process would be impossible, since loading beached landing craft would make them heavier and unable to withdraw from the beach. Advice from superiors and subordinates convinced Clark to continue fighting, and he later denied seriously considering evacuation.Atkinson pp.226&228 Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander of the German forces in Italy. The U.S. VI Corps had by this time lost the best part of three battalions, and so the forward units of both its divisions were withdrawn to reduce the length of the defensive line. The 45th Division consolidated at the Sele - Calore position while the 36th Division was on the high ground on the seaward side of the La Caso stream (which flowed into the Calore).Molony, p. 312. The new perimeter was held with the assistance of Major General Matthew Ridgway's 82nd Airborne Division. Two battalions (roughly 1,300 paratroopers) of Colonel Reuben Tucker's 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), after the cancellation of Giant II, had been assigned to execute the final version of Operation Giant I at Capua on the evening of 13 September. Instead they jumped inside the beachhead, guided by Rebecca/Eureka beacons and moved immediately into the line on the right of VI Corps. The next night, with the crisis past, 2,100 paratroops of Colonel James Gavin's 505th PIR also parachuted into the beachhead and reinforced the two battalions of the 504th. A clear sign of the crisis passing was when, on the afternoon of 14 September, the final unit of 45th Division, the 180th Infantry Regiment, landed, Clark was able to place it in reserve rather than in the line.Molony, p. 313. The 325th Glider Infantry Regiment, reinforced by the 3rd Battalion, 504th PIR, landed by sea on 15 September. A night drop of 600 paratroops of the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion to disrupt German movements behind the lines in the vicinity of Avellino was widely dispersed and failed,Molony, p. 322. incurring significant casualties. In the X Corps sector the lead elements of Major General George Erskine's British 7th Armoured Division began to land, along with the 23rd Armoured Brigade. With strong naval gunfire support from the Royal Navy and well-served by Fifth Army's artillery, the reinforced and reorganized infantry units defeated all German attempts on 14 September to find a weak spot in the lines. German losses, particularly in tanks, were severe. On 14 September and the following night Tedder ordered every available aircraft to support the Fifth Army, including the strategic bomber force. Over 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped during the daylight hours.Molony, p. 314. Hampshire Regiment manning a 3-inch mortar at Salerno, 15 September 1943. On 15 September both the 16th Panzer and 29th Panzergrenadier Divisions went on the defensive, marking the end to the thrust towards Paestum.Molony, p. 316. Further north the Schmalz group of the Hermann G√∂ering Division achieved surprise, attacking the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade (comprising three battalions, the 2nd, 1/4th and 5th, of the Hampshire Regiment), of the British 46th Division, on the high ground east of Salerno. The armoured column following up was intercepted and driven back, leaving the German infantry exposed.Molony, pp. 316-317/ The Allied bomber effort continued on 15 September, although slightly less intensively than the previous day, as did the naval bombardment. The arrival of the British battleships and , with guns, off the beaches provided the Allied troops with a morale boost, although Valiant was not required to shoot and Warspites 29 rounds were awe-inspiring but a minor contribution to the 2,592 naval rounds fired that day.Molony, 318. On 15 September, Kesselring reported to the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht that the Allied air and naval superiority had forced LXXVI Panzer Corps onto the defensive, and that a decisive success would depend on the attack by XIV Panzer Corps. If this failed, the 10th Army must break off the battle to avoid being 'mangled'.Molony, p. 319. On 16 September, the Schmalz group renewed its efforts on the X Corps front but with no more success, although No. 2 Commando suffered casualties, including 31-year-old Captain Henry Wellesley, the then-Duke of Wellington, who was killed. The Allied air forces and navies continued to batter enemy targets, although during an air attack by Dornier Do 217 K-2 bombers armed with Fritz X radio-controlled glide bombs, Warspite was hit and disabled, which required her to be towed to Malta for repair. Eighth Army ordered to apply pressure On 9 September, Montgomery's formations had been strung out along the coastal roads in the 'toe' of Italy. The build-up across the Straits of Messina had proved slow and he was therefore short of transport. On 9 September, he decided to halt his formations in order to reorganise before pushing on but General Alexander replied on 10 September that \\"It is of the utmost importance that you maintain pressure upon the Germans so that they cannot remove forces from your front and concentrate them against Avalanche\\". This message was further reinforced on 12 September by a personal visit from Alexander's Chief of Staff, Brigadier A. A. Richardson.Molony, p. 244. Montgomery had no choice, and while reorganising the main body of his troops, sent light forces up the coast which reached Castrovillari and Belvedere on 12 September, still some from the Salerno battlefield. On 14 September, he was in a position to start a more general advance, and by 16 September the British 5th Infantry Division had reached Sapri, beyond Belvedere, where forward patrols made contact with patrols from VI Corps' 36th Division.Molony, p. 246. German withdrawal On 16 September, von Vietinghoff reported to Kesselring that the Allied air and naval superiority were decisive and that he had not the power to neutralize it. 10th Army had succeeded in preventing troops being cut off, and continuing the battle would just invite heavy losses. The approach of the Eighth Army was also posing a threat. He recommended breaking off the battle, pivoting on Salerno to form a defensive line, preparatory to a withdrawal on 18/19 September. Kesselring's agreement reached von Vietinghoff early on 17 September.Molony, p. 324. Salerno mutiny The Salerno battle was also the site of the Salerno Mutiny instigated by about 500 men of the British X Corps, which had by this time suffered over 6,000 casualties, who, on 16 September, refused assignment to new units as battle casualty replacements. They had previously understood that they would be returning to their own units from which they had been separated during the fighting in the North African Campaign, mainly because they had been wounded. Eventually the corps commander, Lieutenant-General Richard McCreery, persuaded about half of the men to follow their orders. The remainder were court-martialled. Three NCOs who led the mutiny were sentenced to death but the sentence was not carried out and they were eventually allowed to rejoin units. Further Allied advances Allied advance to the Volturno river. With the Salerno beachhead secure, the Fifth Army began its attack northwest towards Naples on 19 September. The day afterwards, Major General Ernest J. Dawley, the U.S. VI Corps commander, was relieved of his command by Clark and replaced by Major General John P. Lucas. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, after suffering serious casualties near Altavilla, was shifted to British X Corps, joining the U.S. Army Rangers and the British 23rd Armoured Brigade on the Sorrento Peninsula to flank the German defenses at Nocera Inferiore, Sant'Antonio Abate, and Angri, which the British 46th Infantry Division attacked. The British 7th Armoured Division, passing through the 46th Division, was assigned the task of taking Naples, while the newly landed U.S. 3rd Infantry Division took Acerno on 22 September and Avellino on 28 September. The Eighth Army made good progress from the \\"toe\\" in spite of German demolitions and linked with the British 1st Airborne Division at Taranto. Its left linked up with the Fifth Army's right on 16 September. The Eighth Army now concentrated its forces east of the Apennine Mountains and pushed north along the Adriatic coast through Bari. On 27 September, the Eighth Army captured the large airfield complex near Foggia, a major Allied objective. At the same time British X Corps made good progress; they pushed through the mountain passes of Monti Lattari and captured a vital bridge over the Sarno River at Scafati. They then surrounded Mount Vesuvius and prepared to advance on Naples. German troops occupying that city provoked a rebellion by the population, which started on 27 September. With the swift advance by X Corps and Naples in rebellion the Germans were forced to evacuate. On 1 October, \\"A\\" Squadron of the 1st King's Dragoon Guards entered the city, the first Allied unit to do so. The entire Fifth Army, now consisting of five American and three British divisions, reached the line of the Volturno River on 6 October. This provided a natural defensive barrier, securing Naples, the Campanian plain and the vital airfields on it from German counterattack. Meanwhile, on the Adriatic Coast, the Eighth Army advanced to a line from Campobasso to Larino and Termoli on the Biferno river. Aftermath Daimler scout car of the 1st King's Dragoon Guards at the town hall in Naples, 1 October 1943. The 10th Army had come close to defeating the Salerno beachhead. The stubborn initial resistance by 16th Panzer Division's battlegroups and the Germans' ability to reinforce them by land more quickly than the Allies could land follow-up forces by sea or air had almost tipped the battle. The Fifth Army planners had concentrated the main weight of its forces in X Corps on its left wing, in line with its major objective of advancing on Naples. This had left its right wing too thinly manned to defend X Corps' right flank and left a particular weakness at the corps boundary.Molony, p. 328. In the end, the Germans, aware of the limited time available to deal with the Salerno landings because of the inevitable arrival in due course of the Eighth Army, were obliged to make hurried and uncoordinated attempts to force a quick decision and had failed to break through Allied lines and exploit the gains in the face of total Allied air superiority and artillery and naval gunfire support. The Allies had been fortunate that at this time Adolf Hitler had sided with the view of his Army Group commander in Northern Italy, Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, and decided that defending Italy south of Rome was not a strategic priority. As a result, Kesselring had been forbidden to call upon reserves from the northern Army Group. The success of the 10th Army in inflicting heavy casualties, and Kesselring's strategic arguments, led Hitler to agree that the Allies should be kept away from German borders and prevented from gaining the oil resources of the Balkans. On 6 November,Orgill, p. 5. Hitler withdrew Rommel to oversee the build-up of defenses in northern France and gave Kesselring command of the whole of Italy with a remit to keep Rome in German hands for as long as possible.Mavrogordato, p. 321 By early October 1943, the whole of southern Italy was in Allied hands, and the Allied armies stood facing the Volturno Line, the first of a series of prepared defensive lines running across Italy from which the Germans chose to fight delaying actions, giving ground slowly and buying time to complete their preparation of the Winter Line, their strongest defensive line south of Rome. The next stage of the Italian Campaign became for the Allied armies a grinding and attritional slog against skillful, determined and well-prepared defenses in terrain and weather conditions which favoured defense and hampered the Allied advantages in mechanised equipment and air superiority. It took until mid-January 1944 to fight through the Volturno, Barbara and Bernhardt lines to reach the Gustav Line, the backbone of the Winter Line defenses, setting the scene for the four battles of Monte Cassino which took place between January and May 1944. Clark's award Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, the U.S. Fifth Army commander, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest U.S. award for valor in combat, for his front-line leadership during this crisis. He was frequently seen in the most forward positions encouraging the troops. However, in the opinion of historian Carlo D'Este, Clark \\"mistakenly believed he had saved the Allied invasion by his leadership, when in fact it was precisely his inexperience that precipitated most of the problems the invasion force faced.\\"D'Este, p. 63.

Its female counterpart is a succubus. Salacious tales of incubi and succubi have been told for many centuries in traditional societies. Some traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with an incubus or succubus may result in the deterioration of health, mental state, or even death.Stephens, Walter (2002), Demon Lovers, p. 23, The University of Chicago Press, Etymological, ancient and religious descriptions The word incubus is derived from Late Latin incubo \\"a nightmare induced by such a demon\\" from incubare \\"to lie upon\\". One of the earliest mentions of an incubus comes from Mesopotamia on the Sumerian King List, c. 2400 BC, where the hero Gilgamesh's father is listed as Lilu.Raphael Patai, p. 221, The Hebrew Goddess: Third Enlarged Edition, It is said that Lilu disturbs and seduces women in their sleep, while Lilitu, a female demon, appears to men in their erotic dreams.Siegmund Hurwitz, Lilith: The First Eve Two other corresponding demons appear as well: Ardat lili, who visits men by night and begets ghostly children from them, and Irdu lili, who is known as a male counterpart to Ardat lili and visits women by night and begets from them. These demons were originally storm demons, but they eventually became regarded as night demons because of mistaken etymology.Raphael Patai, The Hebrew Goddess, Third Enlarged Edition, p. 221‚Äì222, Incubi were thought to be demons who had sexual relations with women, sometimes producing a child by the woman. Succubi, by contrast, were demons thought to have intercourse with men. Debate about these demons began early in the Christian tradition. St. Augustine touched on the topic in De Civitate Dei (\\"The City of God\\"); there were too many alleged attacks by incubi to deny them. He stated \\"There is also a very general rumor. Many have verified it by their own experience and trustworthy persons have corroborated the experience others told, that sylvans and fauns, commonly called incubi, have often made wicked assaults upon women.\\"Augustine (410), The City of God 15.23,'The City of God' Questions about the reproductive capabilities of the demons continued. Eight hundred years later, Thomas Aquinas argued against the possibility of children being conceived by intercourse with demons: \\"Still, if some are occasionally begotten from demons, it is not from the seed of such demons, nor from their assumed bodies, but from the seed of men, taken for the purpose; as when the demon assumes first the form of a woman, and afterwards of a man; just so they take the seed of other things for other generating purposes\\".Aquinus, Thomas (1265‚Äì1274), \\"Summa Theologica\\", \\"Summa Theological, as Augustine says (De Trin. ii), so that the person born is not the child of a demon but of a man.\\" Such a thoroughly human child‚Äìlike every human‚Äìwould have a God-created soul and would live by the power of God, the only one who can give life.Aquinas, Thomas, \\"Summa Theological\\", FP_Q51_A1.html About three hundred years later, King James, in his dissertation titled D√¶monologie, suggested that a devil would carry out two methods of impregnating women: the first, to steal the sperm out of a dead man and deliver it into a woman. If a demon could extract the semen quickly, the transportation of the substance could not be instantly transported to a female host, causing it to go cold. This explains his view that Succubae and Incubi were the same demonic entity only to be described differently based on the sexes being conversed with. Being abused in such a way caused women at nunneries to be burned if they were found pregnant. The second method was the idea that a dead body could be possessed by a devil, causing it to rise and have sexual relations with others. This is similar to depictions of revenants or vampires and a spirit taking deceased corpse to cause some mischief. It became generally accepted that incubi and succubi were the same demon, able to switch between male and female forms.Carus, Paul (1900), The History of The Devil and The Idea of Evil From The Earliest Times to The Present Day, \\"The Devil's Prime\\", at sacred-texts.com A succubus would be able to sleep with a man and collect his sperm, and then transform into an incubus and use that seed on women. Even though sperm and egg came from humans originally, the spirits' offspring were often thought of as supernatural.Lewis, James R., Oliver, Evelyn Dorothy, Sisung Kelle S. (Editor) (1996), Angels A to Z, Entry: Incubi and Succubi, pp. 218, 219, Visible Ink Press, Some sources indicate that it may be identified by its unnaturally large or cold penis.Russel, Jeffrey Burton (1972), Witchcraft in The Middle Ages, pp. 239, 235 Cornell University Press, Ithaca and London, Though many tales claim that the incubus is bisexual,Russell, Jeffrey Burton (1972), Witchcraft in The Middle Ages, p. 145, Cornell University Press, Ithaca and London, others indicate that it is strictly heterosexual and finds attacking a male victim either unpleasant or detrimental.Stephens, Walter (2002), Demon Lovers, pp. 54, 55, 332, 333, The University of Chicago Press, Incubi are sometimes said to be able to conceive children. The half-human offspring of such a union is sometimes referred to as a cambion. An incubus may pursue sexual relations with a woman in order to father a child, as in the legend of Merlin.Merlin's father was said to be an incubus in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae and many later tales. See Lacy, Norris J. (1991). \\"Merlin\\". In Norris J. Lacy, The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, p. 322. (New York: Garland, 1991). . According to the Malleus Maleficarum, exorcism is one of the five ways to overcome the attacks of incubi, the others being Sacramental Confession, the Sign of the Cross (or recital of the Angelic Salutation), moving the afflicted to another location, and by excommunication of the attacking entity, \\"which is perhaps the same as exorcism\\".Kramer, Heinrich and Sprenger, James (1486), Summers, Montague (translator ‚Äì 1928), The Malleus Maleficarum, Part 2, Chapter 1, \\"The Remedies prescribed by the Holy Church against Incubus and Succubus Devils\\", at sacred-texts.com On the other hand, the Franciscan friar Ludovico Maria Sinistrari stated that incubi \\"do not obey exorcists, have no dread of exorcisms, show no reverence for holy things, at the approach of which they are not in the least overawed\\". Regional variations There are a number of variations on the incubus theme around the world. The alp of Teutonic or German folklore is one of the better known. In Zanzibar, Popo Bawa primarily attacks men and generally behind closed doors. \\"The Trauco\\", according to the traditional mythology of the Chilo√© Province of Chile, is a hideous deformed dwarf who lulls nubile young women and seduces them. The Trauco is said to be responsible for unwanted pregnancies, especially in unmarried women. Perhaps another variation of this conception is the \\"Tint√≠n\\" in Ecuador, a dwarf who is fond of abundant haired women and seduces them at night by playing the guitar outside their windows ‚Äî a myth that researchers believe was created during the Colonial period of time to explain pregnancies in women who never left their houses without a chaperone. In Hungary, a lid√©rc can be a Satanic lover that flies at night and appears as a fiery light (an ignis fatuus or will o' the wisp) or, in its more benign form as a featherless chicken.Mack, Dinah, Mack, Carol K. (1999), A Field Guide to Demons, Fairies, Fallen Angels and Other Subversive Spirits, p. 209, Henry Holt and Company, LLC, In Brazil and the rainforests of the Amazon basin, the Amazon river dolphin (or boto) is believed to be a combination of siren and incubus that shape-shifts into a very charming and handsome man who seduces young women and takes them into the river.\\"Whales and Dolphins\\" at ancientspiral.com It is said to be responsible for disappearances and unwanted pregnancies.Boto at library.thinkquest.org According to legend, a boto always wears a hat to disguise the breathing hole at the top of its head while in human form, metamorphosing back into a dolphin during the day.\\"The Dolphin Legend\\" at sumauma.net The Southern African incubus demon is the Tokolosh. Chaste women place their beds upon bricks to deter the rather short fellows from attaining their sleeping forms. They also share the hole in the head detail and water dwelling habits of the boto. In Swedish folklore, there is the mara or mare, a spirit or goblin that rides on the chests of humans while they sleep, giving them bad dreams (or \\"nightmares\\").Bjorvand and Lindeman (2007:719‚Äì720). Belief in the mare goes back to the Norse Ynglinga saga from the 13th century,Ynglinga saga, stanza 13, in H√∏dneb√∏ and Mager√∏y (1979:12). but the belief is probably even older. The mare was likely inspired by sleep paralysis. In Assam, a north-eastern province of India it is mostly known as \\"pori\\" (Assamese: ‡¶™‡ß∞‡ßÄ, meaning \\"angel\\"). According to the mythology, Pori comes to a man at night in his dreams and seduces him. Gradually the victim's health deteriorates and in some cases develops suicidal tendencies. In Turkish culture, incubus is known as Karabasan. It is an evil being that descends upon some sleepers at night. These beings are thought to be spirits or jinns. It can be seen or heard in the nightmare and a heavy weight is felt on the chest. Yet, people cannot wake up from that state. Some of the causes are sleeping without adequately covering the body (especially women) and eating in bed. Scientific explanations Victims may have been experiencing waking dreams or sleep paralysis. The phenomenon of sleep paralysis is well- established. During the fourth phase of sleep (also known as REM sleep), motor centers in the brain are inhibited, producing paralysis. The reason for this is ultimately unknown but the most common explanation is that this prevents one from acting out one's dreams. Malfunctions of this process can either result in somnambulism (sleepwalking) or, conversely, sleep paralysis‚Äîwhere one remains partially or wholly paralysed for a short time after waking. Additional to sleep paralysis is hypnagogia. In a near-dream state, it is common to experience auditory and visual hallucinations. Mostly these are forgotten upon fully waking or soon afterwards, in the same manner as dreams. However, most people remember the phenomenon of hearing music or seeing things in near-sleep states at some point in their lives. Typical examples include a feeling of being crushed or suffocated, electric \\"tingles\\" or \\"vibrations\\", imagined speech and other noises, the imagined presence of a visible or invisible entity, and sometimes intense emotions of fear or euphoria and orgasmic feelings. These often appear quite real and vivid; especially auditory hallucinations of music which can be quite loud, indistinguishable from music being played in the same room. Humanoid and animal figures, often shadowy or blurry, are often present in hypnagogic hallucinations, more so than other hallucinogenic states. This may be a relic of an ancient instinct to detect predatory animals. The combination of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucination could easily cause someone to believe that a \\"demon was holding them down\\". Nocturnal arousal etc. could be explained away by creatures causing otherwise guilt-producing behavior. Add to this the common phenomena of nocturnal arousal and nocturnal emission, and all the elements required to believe in an incubus are present. On the other hand, some victims of incubi may have been the victims of real sexual assault. Some authors speculate that rapists may have attributed the rapes of sleeping women to demons in order to escape punishment. Robert Masello asserts that a friend or relative is at the top of the list in such cases and would be kept secret by the intervention of \\"spirits\\".Masello, Robert (2004), Fallen Angels and Spirits of The Dark, p. 66, The Berkley Publishing Group, 200 Madison Ave. New York, NY 10016, See also * Batibat * Christian demonology * Classification of demons * Demonology * Fiery serpents * Gancanagh * Krampus * List of fictional demons * List of theological demons * Night terror * Sexuality in Christian demonology Notes Category:Christian mythology Category:Demons Category:Demons in Christianity Category:Supernatural legends Category:Sleep in mythology and folklore Category:Succubi Category:Devils ","title":"Incubus"},{"id":"439245","text":"The A3W reactor is a naval reactor used by the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships.

He is best known for his appearances with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in the 2000s and Ring of Honor (ROH) in the 2010s. He is also known for teaming up with Shelton Benjamin and Kurt Angle in a tag team called \\"The World's Greatest Tag Team\\" Haas was an amateur wrestler in high school, and attended Seton Hall University on a wrestling scholarship, before becoming a stockbroker. He became a professional wrestler in 1996, and teamed regularly with his brother, Russ, with the two winning numerous championships on the independent circuit, including the CZW World Tag Team Championship and the JAPW Tag Team Championship. After signing contracts with WWE, The Haas Brothers were assigned to WWE's developmental territories, where they won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions. After Russ' death in 2001 due to a heart attack, Haas began wrestling in singles competition, winning the HWA Heavyweight Championship once. Haas formed a team with Shelton Benjamin and the two debuted on SmackDown in December 2002. They won the WWE Tag Team Championship twice, and dubbed themselves The World's Greatest Tag Team before they split in 2004. Haas won the WWE Tag Team Championship once more with Rico, and gained Miss Jackie, whom he later married, as a valet. Haas then transferred into singles competition before being released from WWE in 2005. After a short stint in Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) and other independent promotions, Haas was re- signed to WWE in April 2006. He formed a short-lived team with Viscera, before reforming the World's Greatest Tag Team with Benjamin. After Benjamin transferred to the ECW brand, Haas began wrestling with a comical luchador persona, before developing a character where he imitated other wrestlers and WWE Hall of Famers. In addition, Haas won the last ever match on WWE Heat when the show ended on May 30, 2008. Haas was released from WWE in February 2010. He soon returned to the independent circuit, including returning to JAPW and appearing for Ring of Honor. In September 2010, he won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship. On April 1, 2011, Haas and Benjamin won the ROH World Tag Team Championship and held it until December 2011. Haas announced his retirement from professional wrestling in March 2013, but returned to competition in August that same year. Aside from wrestling, Haas and his wife Jackie ran a nutritional store, Custom Muscle Nutrition and Smoothie Shop, in Frisco, Texas, which they opened in October 2008 but has since closed. Professional wrestling career=Independent circuit (1996‚Äì2000) After debuting in 1996 as a professional wrestler, Haas regularly teamed with his brother Russ for numerous independent promotions. On July 22, 1998, The Haas Brothers won the Jersey All Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship by defeating The Skin Head Express. They lost it to The Nation of Immigration just over a month later on August 25. They won the championship for the second time on May 21, 1999, by defeating The Big Unit (Rick Silver and Dave Desire), and held the championship until February 25, 2000 when they were defeated by Da Hit Squad. During 2000 they also held the Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship and the ECWA Tag Team Championship in the East Coast Wrestling Association promotion, which they won by defeating The Backseat Boyz (Trent Acid and Johnny Kashmere). The Haas brothers began competing for Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) in November 1999, losing to The King Pinz at The War Begins on November 20, 1999. They competed regularly for CZW throughout early 2000, and won the CZW World Tag Team Championship on February 12 at Climbing The Ladder by defeating The Kashmerino Brothers and The Thrill Kill Kult in a three-way match. On July 10, they lost the championship to The Backseat Boyz at Caged To The End, when Johnny Kashmere defeated Russ in a singles match and was awarded the championship. World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (2000‚Äì2005) After a World Wrestling Federation (WWF) tryout match at Madison Square Garden on August 7, 2000, they signed a developmental contract with WWF. The two worked their way through the tag ranks in the WWF's developmental territories, Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW) and the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). The brothers won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship three times during early 2001, defeating The Dupps the first time and The Island Boyz and Joey Matthews and Christian York in a three-way match on both the second and third occasions. Russ died from a heart attack due to a pre-existing heart condition, on December 15, 2001 at age 27. The brothers fought in house shows and dark matches in the WWF up until Russ died.

He was later stripped of the title on January 29 due to a scripted contract loophole. After World Wrestling Entertainment (renamed from the WWF) ended its affiliation with the HWA, Haas was moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) where he competed until December 2002.

They quickly won the WWE Tag Team Championship on February 6, 2003, by defeating Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero). They held the championship for three months, including a successful title defense at WrestleMania XIX against Los Guerreros and the team of Chris Benoit and Rhyno, before losing the championship to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri in a ladder match on May 18 at Judgment Day. On the June 12 episode of SmackDown!, Angle fired Haas and Benjamin after they blamed him for losing the Tag Team Championship and began to question his leadership.

In this \\"alter-ego\\", Haas would sometimes perform luchador-esque maneuvers in a comical fashion (such as attempting a diving splash, but instead landing on his feet and hitting a standing splash).

Benjamin and Gable turned heel the next week when they cut a promo while demoralizing the referee and the audience, and accusing SmackDown general manager Daniel Bryan of being biased. Bryan would grant them a rematch at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view in a 2 out of 3 falls match, which they lost. At WrestleMania 34 on April 8, Benjamin competed alongside Gable in the Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, but neither won. On April 16, Gable would be traded to Raw during the 2018 WWE Superstar Shake- up, thus disbanding the team. = Sporadic appearances (2018‚Äì2020) = On the April 17 episode of SmackDown, after seemingly wishing Gable good luck on his move to the Raw brand on Twitter, Benjamin would claim his account \\"got hacked\\" and began to demoralize Gable, before issuing a challenge to anyone in the locker room.

Benjamin was announced as one of sixteen competitors in the King of the Ring. On the August 27 episode of SmackDown Live, he was defeated by former tag team partner Chad Gable in the tournament's first round. That match would be his first match on WWE television since the match with Rollins in March, and almost a year since his last singles match on SmackDown. As part of the 2019 draft, Benjamin was drafted to Raw. Benjamin participated in the Royal Rumble match and entered at #10 at the namesake pay-per-view but was eliminated by the WWE Champion Brock Lesnar. =The Hurt Business (2020‚Äìpresent)= On the July 20 episode of Raw, Benjamin joined MVP and Bobby Lashley's stable The Hurt Business as they helped him capture the 24/7 Championship from R-Truth.

He was a planter and owner of the Snowden plantation that he inherited from his father. He served the local militia for about ten years, making Captain of the local militia in 1794. He also served during the Revolutionary War. Randolph, known as \\"Uncle Randolph\\" when he visited Monticello, was considered as a candidate for the father of Sally Hemings's children following DNA studies that found that the Hemings children descended from the Jefferson line. The theory that Randolph Jefferson fathered Hemings children is discounted by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation given that records do not show that Randolph often visited Monticello. He often socialized with the slaves during his visits. His son, Isham Randolph Jefferson, who lived at Monticello during his childhood is another alternate candidate for Hemings children's paternity. Thomas Jefferson, though, was found by The Monticello Jefferson-Hemings Report (2000) to be the likely father of Sally Hemings's children. Other scholars contend otherwise and find Randolph an attractive candidate.  Early life  Born at Shadwell, the Jefferson family plantation in Albemarle County, Virginia, his parents were Peter Jefferson, who died when Randolph was two years old, and Jane Randolph Jefferson. He was a twin to Anna Scott Jefferson and the only male sibling of Thomas Jefferson's to survive infancy. The twins were Thomas' youngest siblings, about 13 years younger than him. After Peter Jefferson's death, and while Randolph was a child, his affairs were managed by John Harvie, the executor of Peter Jefferson's estate. After he died, his brother Thomas managed his affairs, such as his education and property, until he came of age in 1776. He assisted in management of his younger brother's affairs after 1776. Wren Building, College of William & Mary. With a construction history dating back to 1695, it is part of the college's ancient campus. In 1764 and 1765, Randolph Jefferson studied with Ben Snead at the residence of his uncle Charles Lewis, Jr. and aunt Mary Randolph Lewis at Buck Island, which was a 960 acre tract located near Monticello and the Rivanna River in Albemarle County. He lived again at Shadwell with his mother in 1769, when he was taught by Patrick Morton. In 1770, the main house at Shadwell was destroyed in a fire, and his mother, Jane Randolph Jefferson, had a house built there as a replacement. He left Shadwell for Williamsburg when he was 16 to reside and study at the College of William & Mary from October 1771 until September 1772. He attended The Grammar School at the College of William & Mary and was tutored in higher subjects by Thomas Gwatkin, who taught Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at the College. Additionally, he took violin lessons from Frances Alberti, as did his brother.  Description  Thomas Jefferson described Randolph posthumously in a deposition that was taken as Randolph's sons contested the will that favored their stepmother, Mitchie Pryor Jefferson. Thomas was considerate and affectionate toward Randolph; they addressed each other as \\"Dear Brother,\\" and exchanged visits and services with each other. Letters document that Thomas lent Randolph the harness for a gig, had his watch repaired, gave him a dog, sent him vegetable seeds, and gave him a spinning jenny. At Monticello, he was called \\"Uncle Randolph\\". A former Monticello enslaved man, Isaac Jefferson, recalled in 1847 that Randolph \\"used to come out among black people, play the fiddle and dance half the night...\\" Historian Dumas Malone states that Randolph did not share his older brother's eloquence. His letters to Thomas show a disregard of grammar and the use of colloquialisms such as \\"tech\\" instead of \\"touch.\\" His \\"rustic sense of humor\\" may have caused people to underestimate his intelligence, yet he lacked his brother's intellectual curiosity. Military service In 1776, Randolph Jefferson served in Captain Wingfield's Company of the Albemarle militia. He served with William Fossett and Joseph Nielson who had worked at Monticello and had live-in relationships with members of the Hemings family. [Original source: The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, vol. 1, 1760‚Äì1776, ed. Julian P. Boyd. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1950, pp. 664‚Äì668.] He was a member of the local militia in 1779. Banastre Tarleton's Movements historical marker in Adams Grove, Virginia During the Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783), he served under General Thomas Nelson with the Virginia Light Dragoons, including the fight against Banastre Tarleton and his troops in Central Virginia and what became an aborted attempt to aid George Washington. In the fight against Tarleton, he offered use of his pasture for cavalry horses, had slaves from Snowden move items from military stores at Scotts Ferry which Tarleton has sought to attain, and provided provisions for the Virginia troops. He continued to serve until the end of the Siege of Yorktown victory (October 19, 1781). Along with his brother, Jefferson signed an Oath of Allegiance to the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1777, He, his brother, and Charles Lewis also signed the Albemarle County Oath of Allegiance to the Commonwealth on April 21, 1779. It was also called the Albemarle Declaration of Independence. Jefferson earned his title, Captain, in 1794 while serving in the Buckingham County Militia. Plantation owner View from hillside of Old Scott's Ferry, Scottsville, Virginia, showing train approaching railroad bridge, 1911, Library of Congress In 1776, Randolph inherited the Snowden plantation in Buckingham County, Virginia with 2,291‚Öî acres called \\"Fluvanna lands\\" located near the Hardware River and Scottsville, from his father, Peter Jefferson's estate. Peter Jefferson built the original house. More specifically, the plantation was located along the James River, about twenty miles south of Monticello and across from Scott's Ferry and on the south side of Horseshoe Bend. His life at Snowden was relatively simple compared to life at Monticello; however, he was an affluent planter and dependent on enslaved labor. He had 2,000 acres, 30 slaves, 6 horses, and 42 cattle in 1782. Months after Randolph's death, the dwelling house at Snowden burned to the ground. Marriage and family On July 30, 1781, Jefferson married his first cousin, Anne Lewis, the daughter of Colonel Charles Lewis of Buck Island and Mary Randolph, the sister of Jane Randolph Jefferson. Isham Randolph of Dungeness was the grandfather of both Randolph Jefferson and Anne Jefferson Lewis. They had six children: Thomas, Robert Lewis, Peter Field; Isham Randolph; James Lilburne and Anna Scott. Anna Scott Jefferson, nicknamed Nancy, married Hastings Mark. Randolph was a widower for about ten years when his wife died about 1799. He periodically suffered from ill health beginning in 1807, which precluded his ability to travel at times. Randolph remarried about 1809 to Mitchie Ballow Pryor of Buckingham County, who did not get along with her stepsons and convinced Randolph to favor her in a rewrite of his will that was dated May 28, 1808. Mitchie, whose father was David Pryor, was in her early twenties, perhaps not yet age 21, when she married Randolph, who was in his mid-50s. She created disruption within the Jefferson family, including communicating her concerns about Randolph's management of the Snowden estate with her brother-in-law, Thomas Jefferson. She was also prone to heavy spending, responsible for large bills with local merchants. She conceived a son named John before Randolph died at Snowden on August 17, 1815. Randolph suffered an illness in the Spring of 1815, but told his brother in June of that year that he was feeling fine and was involved in the wheat harvest. Randolph's sons and Thomas Jefferson tried to break Randolph's last will, which favored Mitchie. Mitchie and John then moved to Tennessee, where John died unmarried at age 29. Randolph's will called for his property to be sold and the funds divided up among his sons and his slaves were to stay with the family. Suggested paternity of Sally Hemings's children First paragraph of James T. Callender's newspaper editorial, titled \\"The President Again,\\" which first exposed the purported relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, one of Jefferson's teenaged slaves. September 1802. The Jefferson‚ÄìHemings controversy concerns the question of whether U.S. President Thomas Jefferson was the father of the children of Sally Hemings, a mixed-race slave. Alternate theories suggest that Randolph Jefferson, or his nephew, Peter Carr, fathered the Hemings children. Carr, though, was ruled out in genetic testing ‚Äî but there was a match to the Jefferson male line. The DNA study, published in Nature on November 5, 1998 titled Jefferson Fathered Slave's Last Child, led to speculation about whether Randolph was the Jefferson who fathered the Hemings children.Alexander Boulton, \\"The Monticello Mystery-Case Continued\\" , reviews of The Jefferson-Hemings Myth: An American Travesty; A President in the Family: Thomas Jefferson, Sally Hemings and Thomas Woodson; and Free Some Day: African American Families at Monticello; in William & Mary Quarterly, Third Series, Vol. 58, No. 4, October 2001. Quote: Past defenses of Jefferson having proven inadequate, the TJHS advocates have pieced together an alternative case that preserves the conclusions of earlier champions but introduces new \\"evidence\\" to support them. Randolph Jefferson, for example, had never seriously been considered as a possible partner of Sally Hemings until the late 20th century, when DNA evidence indicated that a member of the Jefferson family was unquestionably the father of Eston. The Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, formed in 1999, commissioned its own independent scholars' report that was completed in 2001. While the report suggested that Randolph Jefferson, or one of his sons, could have fathered Hemings's children,\\"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\\", Monticello Website, accessed 22 June 2011 it is more likely that Thomas Jefferson was the father.

This initiative grew from the need to facilitate communication and exchange between members of the international sculpture community. It was also rooted in Cold War tensions, which lent a particular urgency to the need for cross-cultural dialogue on a person-to-person basis. The first international sculpture symposium took place in an abandoned stone quarry in Sankt Margarethen im Burgenland. Sculptors from around the world joined together to produce a permanent public artwork from local stone, a dynamic which would provide the model for many symposia to follow. Since then international sculpture symposia have been held in numerous towns and cities around the world, including Lindabrunn, Austria and Hagi, Japan (a town known for its pottery) and in Scotland (Scottish Sculpture Workshop, Lumsden and other locations). The first international sculpture symposia in the United States (and the first on a college campus) was in 1965 on the California State University, Long Beach campus in Long Beach, California. The first International Sculpture Symposium (Vermont International Sculpture Symposium) in the United States was held in Proctor, Vermont in 1968 under the joint sponsorship of Vermont Marble Company, National Endowment for the Arts, and Vermont Council on the Arts. Participating sculptors were from the United States, Austria, Japan, Germany, and Yugoslavia. The first Sculpture Symposium in Australia was held at Wondabyne near Gosford in New South Wales in 1986. It was followed by the Barossa International Sculpture Symposium in Mengler Hill near Tanunda in the Barossa in South Australia in 1988. Nine sculptures in Marble and Granite were carved by sculptors from France, the United States, Japan and Australia. The site is now the Barossa Sculpture Park. As part of the program in 2001, the Republic of South Africa War Memorial Reconciliation by sculptor Strijdom van der Merwe was created for the sculpture park at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan, South Korea. The Scottish Sculpture Workshop organised a series of international symposia through the 1980s and 1990s, mostly focused on stone carving. These attracted artists from across Europe, North America and Japan. Some were linked to the Scottish Sculpture Open exhibition. 1997 International Granite Symposium 1995 International Granite Symposium.

Accessed 2008-08-10). Due to its buoyancy, it is also often used as a water toy or flotation device, and in some countries, including the UK, is called a lilo (\\"Li-lo\\" being a specific trademark) or a Readybed. For sleeping Early air mattress by the German engineer Konrad Kyeser (ca. 1405) An air mattress, also known as an airbed or a blow-up bed, is an inflatable mattress made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or textile-reinforced urethane plastic or rubber. The deflated mattress can be compacted and carried or stored in a small form. They are inflated either by blowing into a valve, with a manual or electric pump. Some are automatically inflated when a valve is opened, up to a certain pressure with additional inflation manually or by pump. Air mattresses are used for camping, temporary or full-time home use, and may be optimized to combine several uses (e.g., camping and guest use) while others are single purpose. Air mattresses may have customized shapes, for example, wheel cutouts for use in the cargo area of a pickup trucks or SUV. Sleeping pads are lightweight, reduced-size and reduced-thickness air mattresses intended for camping and backpacking, and may feature a layer of foam insulation under the air chambers. Higher quality air chambers use vulcanized rubber, covered in canvas or of polyurethane with a cloth shell or tick(ing). Permanent air beds will look almost like conventional beds with the exception of having a hose (one air chamber) or hoses (two air chambers) coming out of the head of the bed. These hoses will be connected to an air inflation device, with two outlet valves, that will have a remote control(s) so that each person can adjust the firmness of his or her side to his/her own exact needs. The firmness can be adjusted up or down, with the simple push of a button, on the remote(s). A USA government safety agency has warned against letting infants sleep on air mattresses, because they can be too soft and suffocate smaller children (especially those below the age of 8 months) within folds or while entrapped between the mattress and the bed base.Deadly Danger: CPSC Urges parents To Not Place Infants on Air Mattresses (from the Consumer Product Safety Commission government website, United States. Accessed 2008-08-11). Additionally there have been several recent governmental studies and regulations enacted due to the poisonous nature of the phthalate plasticizers contained within most PVC vinyl air beds and other soft vinyl products. The European Union has made similar efforts to prevent the use of vinyl materials in toys and bedding.europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/consumer_safety/l32033_en.htm. Air beds Larger, more elaborate air mattresses (known as \\"air beds\\" in British English speaking locations) have come on the market in recent years that are intended for guest use or as permanent beds in the bedroom. Bed sizes for temporary air beds range from twin to king size, but few guest bed manufacturers offer king size as most guest air beds are sold outside the United States where king-size mattresses are not standard. Most permanent air beds use easy-to-find conventional sheets and bedding. California King (or Western King) sheets and bedding may be more difficult to find as this size was originally conceived for the waterbed industry. Raised guest or temporary beds are typically raised off the ground to keep users away from the floor and offer a more traditional mattress experience. Though 'raised' air beds are off the ground, they are not designed for full-time use, as the base of the bed is an air chamber and not a solid foundation. Health benefits Air mattresses can also improve the quality of life (and potentially provide some measure of relief) for people who suffer with back pain. Having the ability to adjust the firmness of a mattress to accommodate different body shapes, sizes, and weights, can be a factor in the healing process. Air mattresses are sometimes used to protect bedridden people from pressure sores, which can create life-threatening ulcers. Additionally, air mattresses manufactured without the use of materials that may release VOCs or other toxic compounds from the manufacturing process (which can exacerbate allergies in children or other sensitive individuals) are available.\\"Indoor Chemicals Linked to Respiratory and Allergic Effects in Children\\", California EPA, 2008.\\"Indoor Residential Chemical Emissions as Risk Factors for Respiratory and Allergic Effects in Children: a Review\\" , Indoor Air Journal, vol. 17, pp. 259‚Äì277, 2007. An air mattress in the shape of a mobile phone. For recreation= As a water toy  The term air mattress may also refer to a certain inflatable swimming pool or beach toy, which has an air-sac \\"pillow\\" and several (usually four or five) tubes running its length. Also called a \\"lilo\\" (UK, AUS, NZ), \\"pool air mat\\", \\"air mat\\", \\"pool lounge\\", or \\"float(ing) mat(tress)\\", it is used to recline on the water surface. The Li-Lo trademark for a rubberised material products was registered in UK on 19 Apr 1944 and in the USA on 25 Sep 1947 by P. B. Cow and Co Ltd. An inflatable air mattress for recreational use was advertised as one of the Li-Lo brand of products at the British Industries Fair in London 1949. Although it bears some resemblance to an air mattress, it is typically not built as strongly and may not reliably stay inflated all night long, making it impractical for use as a bed.  Industry  Permanent use adjustable-firmness \\"airbeds\\" became popular particularly after market leader Select Comfort began a major marketing campaign around 2001. The original airbed was manufactured by Comfortaire in 1981, which was later purchased by Select Comfort, in January 2013 for $15.5m. Select Comfort announced on March 30, 2017 that they were ceasing all third party retail sales, of the Comfortaire Line of products, essentially shutting down the Comfortaire Brand. Other manufacturers include Boyd Specialty, InnoMax, and American National. Less expensive airbeds used for camping or guests include the Aerobed, sold by Jarden subsidiary The Coleman Company.

Gullied landscape in Somalia. A gully is a landform created by running water, eroding sharply into soil, typically on a hillside. Gullies resemble large ditches or small valleys, but are metres to tens of metres in depth and width. When the gully formation is in process, the water flow rate can be substantial, causing a significant deep cutting action into soil. Etymology The earliest known usage of the term is from 1657. It originates from the French word goulet, a diminutive form of goule which means throat. It is possible that the term is connected to the name of a type of knife used at the time, a gully-knife.  Formation and consequences  Gully erosion is the process by which gullies are formed. Hillsides are more prone to gully erosion when they are cleared of vegetation, through deforestation, over-grazing or other means. The eroded soil is easily carried by the flowing water after being dislodged from the ground, normally when rainfall falls during short, intense storms such as during thunderstorms. A gully may grow in length by means of headward (i.e. upstream) erosion at a knick point. This erosion can result from interflow as well as surface runoff. Gullies reduce the productivity of farmland where they incise into the land, and produce sediment that may clog downstream waterbodies. Because of this, much effort is invested into the study of gullies within the scope of geomorphology, in the prevention of gully erosion, and in restoration of gullied landscapes. The total soil loss from gully formation and subsequent downstream river sedimentation can be sizeable.  Artificial gullies  Gullies can be formed or enlarged by a number of human activities. Artificial gullies are formed during hydraulic mining when jets or streams of water are projected onto soft alluvial deposits to extract gold or tin ore. The remains of such mining methods are very visible landform features in old goldfields such as in California and northern Spain. The badlands at Las Medulas for example, were created during the Roman period by hushing or hydraulic mining of the gold- rich alluvium with water supplied by numerous aqueducts tapping nearby rivers. Each aqueduct produced large gullies below by erosion of the soft deposits. The effluvium was carefully washed with smaller streams of water to extract the nuggets and gold dust. On Mars Gullies are widespread at mid- to high latitudes on the surface of Mars, and are some of the youngest features observed on that planet, probably forming within the last few 100,000 years. There, they are one of the best lines of evidence for the presence of liquid water on Mars in the recent geological past, probably resulting from the slight melting of snowpacks on the surfaceChristensen, PR (2003). \\"Formation of recent martian gullies through melting of extensive water-rich snow deposits.\\".

Its primary purpose is to provide evidence about a suspicious or questionable document using scientific processes and methods. Evidence might include alterations, the chain of possession, damage to the document, forgery, origin, authenticity, or other questions that come up when a document is challenged in court. Overviews Many QD examinations involve a comparison of the questioned document, or components of the document, to a set of known standards. The most common type of examination involves handwriting wherein the examiner tries to address concerns about potential authorship. A document examiner is often asked to determine if a questioned item originated from the same source as the known item(s), then present their opinion on the matter in court as an expert witness. Other common tasks include determining what has happened to a document, determining when a document was produced, or deciphering information on the document that has been obscured, obliterated, or erased. The discipline is known by many names including 'forensic document examination', 'document examination', 'diplomatics', 'handwriting examination', or sometimes 'handwriting analysis', although the latter term is not often used as it may be confused with graphology. Likewise a forensic document examiner (FDE) is not to be confused with a graphologist, and vice versa. Many FDEs receive extensive training in all of the aspects of the discipline. As a result, they are competent to address a wide variety of questions about document evidence. However, this \\"broad specialization\\" approach has not been universally adopted. In some locales, a clear distinction is made between the terms 'forensic document examiner' and a 'forensic handwriting expert/examiner'. In such cases, the former term refers to examiners who focus on non-handwriting examination types while the latter refers to those trained exclusively to do handwriting examinations. Even in places where the more general meaning is common, such as North America or Australia, there are many individuals who have specialized training only in relatively limited areas. As the terminology varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it is important to clarify the meaning of the title used by any individual professing to be a \\"forensic document examiner\\". Scope of document examination A forensic document examiner is intimately linked to the legal system as a forensic scientist. Forensic science is the application of science to address issues under consideration in the legal system. FDEs examine items (documents) that form part of a case that may or may not come before a court of law. Common criminal charges involved in a document examination case fall into the \\"white-collar crime\\" category. These include identity theft, forgery, counterfeiting, fraud, or uttering a forged document. Questioned documents are often important in other contexts simply because documents are used in so many contexts and for so many purposes. For example, a person may commit murder and forge a suicide note. This is an example where a document is produced directly as a fundamental part of a crime. More often a questioned document is simply the by-product of normal day-to-day business or personal activities. The American Society for Testing and Materials, International (ASTM) publishes standards for many methods and procedures used by FDEs. E30.02 was the ASTM subcommittee for Questioned Documents. These guides were under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee E30 on Forensic Sciences and the direct responsibility of Subcommittee E30.02 on Questioned Documents. The ASTM Questioned Document Section has been disbanded. All of the Standards are now available through SWGDOC (The Scientific Working Group for Document Examiners). The Standard Guide for Scope of Work of Forensic Document Examiners indicates there are four components to the work of a forensic document examiner. It states that an examiner \\"makes scientific examinations, comparisons, and analyses of documents to: # establish genuineness or nongenuineness, or to expose forgery, or to reveal alterations, additions or deletions; # identify or eliminate persons as the source of handwriting; # identify or eliminate the source of typewriting or other impression, marks, or relative evidence; and # write reports or give testimony, when needed, to aid the users of the examiner's services in understanding the examiner's findings.\\" Some FDEs limit their work to the examination and comparison of handwriting; most inspect and examine the whole document in accordance with this ASTM standard. Types of document examined Documents feature prominently in all manner of business and personal affairs. Almost any type of document may become disputed in an investigation or litigation. For example, a questioned document may be a sheet of paper bearing handwriting or mechanically-produced text such as a ransom note, a forged cheque, or a business contract. It may be material not normally thought of as a 'document'. FDEs define the word \\"document\\" in a very broad sense as being any material bearing marks, signs, or symbols intended to convey a message or meaning to someone. This encompasses traditional paper documents but also includes things like graffiti on a wall, stamp impressions on meat products, or covert markings hidden in a written letter, among others.

Candidacy A person who desires to enter a career of forensic document examination must possess certain traits and abilities. The ASTM Standard E2388-05ASTM International: These guides are under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee E30 on Forensic Sciences and the direct responsibility of Subcommittee E30.02 on Questioned Documents. Copies of ASTM Standards can be obtained directly from ASTM International. (Standard Guide for Minimum Training Requirements for Forensic Document Examiners) lists several requirements for the \\"Trainee Candidate\\". First and foremost, \\"an earned baccalaureate degree or equivalent from an accredited college or university\\" is required as it gives the aspirant a scientific background with which to approach the work in an objective manner, as well as bestowing necessary biological, physical, and chemical knowledge sometimes called upon in the work. Second, excellent eyesight is required to see fine details that are otherwise inconspicuous. To this end, the aspirant must successfully complete: * a form discrimination test to ensure that the aspirant is able to tell apart two similar-appearing yet different items, * a color perception test, and * near and distant visual acuity tests \\"with best corrected vision within six months prior to commencement of training.\\" Beyond the above, additional desirable skills include knowledge of paper, ink, printing processes, or handwriting. Training There are three possible methods of instruction for an aspiring document examiner: # Self-education is the way the pioneers of the field began, as there was no other method of instruction. # Apprenticeship has become the widespread way many examiners are now taught. This is the method that is recommended by ASTM in Standard E2388-05. To conform with the ASTM standard such training \\"shall be the equivalent of a minimum of 24 months full-time training under the supervision of a principal trainer\\" and \\"the training program shall be successfully completed in a period not to exceed four years\\". The training program must also include an extensive list of specific syllabus topics outlined in ASTM Standard E2388-05. # College and university programs are very limited. This is due, in part, to the relatively limited demand for forensic document examiners. It also relates to the need for extensive practical experience, particularly with respect to handwriting examination. It is difficult to include this degree of practical experience in a normal academic program. There are some distance learning courses available as well. These are taught through a virtual reality classroom and may include an apprenticeship program, a correspondence course, or both. A trainee must learn how to present evidence before the court in clear, forceful testimony. Fledgling examiners in the later stages of training can get a glimpse into the legal process as well as a better sense of this aspect of their work through participation in a mock trial or by attending court hearings to observe the testimony of qualified examiners. These are guidelines and not requirements. Examination=Examination types Examinations and comparisons conducted by document examiners can be diverse and may involve any of the following: *Handwriting (cursive / printing) and signatures *Typewriters, photocopiers, laser printers, ink-jet printers, fax machines *Chequewriters, rubber stamps, price markers, label makers *Printing processes *Ink, pencil, paper *Alterations, additions, erasures, obliterations *Indentation detection and/or decipherment *Sequence determination *Physical matching Principle of identification The concept of 'identification' as it is applied in the forensic sciences is open to discussion and debate.In biometrics, this concept is generally referred to as either 'verification' or 'authentication' while the term 'identification' is used to assign an individual to a particular class or group. Nonetheless, the traditional approach in the discipline of forensic document examination is best expressed as follows: > \\"When any two items possess a combination of independent discriminating > elements (characteristics) that are similar and/or correspond in their > relationships to one another, of such number and significance as to preclude > the possibility of their occurrence by pure coincidence, and there are no > inexplicable disparities, it may be concluded that they are the same in > nature or are related to a common source (the principle of identification).\\" The evaluation of such characteristics is now predominantly subjective though efforts to meaningfully quantify this type of information are ongoing. Subjective evaluation does not mean that the results of properly conducted comparisons will be unreliable or inaccurate. To the contrary, scientific testing has shown that professional document examiners (as a group) out- perform lay-people when comparing handwriting or signatures to assess authorship.Kam et al, A Decade of Writer Identification Proficiency Tests for Forensic Document Examiners, ASQDE, 2003. However, this type of 'subjective' analysis depends greatly upon the competency of an individual examiner. It follows that # an examiner should follow appropriate case examination protocols carefully and evaluate all possible propositions, # an examiner should be properly trained and their training should include adequate testing of their abilities, # the formal case examination procedure should incorporate some form of secondary review (ideally, independent in nature) and # every examiner should make every effort to demonstrate and maintain their competency through professional certification and ongoing proficiency testing. Handwriting examinations The examination of handwriting to assess potential authorship proceeds from the above principle of identification by applying it to a comparison of samples of handwritten material. Generally known as ACE-V, there are three stages in the process of examination.Huber & Headrick 1999, pg. 34. In brief, they are: # Analysis: The questioned and the known items are analyzed and broken down to directly perceptible characteristics. # Comparison: The characteristics of the questioned item are then compared against the known standard. # Evaluation: Similarities and differences in the compared properties are evaluated to determine ~~and this determines~~ which ones are valuable for an assessment of the evidence ~~conclusion~~. This depends on the uniqueness and frequency of occurrence in the items. # Optionally, the procedure may involve a fourth step consisting of verification/validation or peer review. ASTM has published a standard guide for the examination of handwriting titled \\"E2290-07a: Examination of Handwritten Items\\". Some of the guides listed under \\"Other Examinations\\" apply to forensic handwriting comparisons (e.g., E444 or E1658). An alternative guide for the examination of handwriting and signatures has been developed by the Forensic Expertise Profiling Laboratory (School of Human Biosciences, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia). Other examinations Aside from E2290 mentioned above, many standard guides pertaining to the examination of questioned documents have been published by ASTM International. They include the following: :*E444-06 Scope of Work Relating to Forensic Document Examiners :*E2195-02 Terminology: Examination of Questioned Documents :*E1658-08 Terminology: Expressing Conclusions of Forensic Document Examiners :*E1422-05 Test Methods for Forensic Writing Ink Comparison :*E1789-04 Writing Ink Identification :*E2285-03 Examination of Mechanical Checkwriter Impressions :*E2286-03 Examination of Dry Seal Impressions :*E2287-03 Examination of Fracture Patterns and Paper Fibre Impressions on Single-Strike Film Ribbons and Typed Text :*E2288-03 Physical Match of Paper Cuts, Tears, and Perforations in Forensic Document Examinations :*E2289-08 Examination of Rubber Stamp Impressions :*E2291-03 Indentation Examinations :*E2325-05 Non- destructive Examination of Paper :*E2331-04 Examination of Altered Documents :*E2388-05 Minimum Training Requirements for Forensic Document Examiners :*E2389-05 Examination of Documents Produced with Liquid Ink Jet Technology :*E2390-06 Examination of Documents Produced with Toner Technology :*E2494-08 Standard Guide for Examination of Typewritten Items Not all laboratories or examiners use or follow ASTM guidelines.

Planning The attack was made by Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey's British XIII Corps, which had under command the 1st Canadian Infantry Division (Major- General Guy Simonds) and the British 5th Infantry Division (Major-General Gerard C. Bucknall). XIII Corps was part of the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery. XIII Corps crossed the Straits of Messina from Sicily to Reggio di Calabria, covered by a heavy artillery barrage from Sicily and air cover from the Desert Air Force operating from Sicilian airfields. The intent was to tie down German forces in the area and gain an Allied foothold at the 'toe' of Italy.Molony, pp. 223, 231‚Äì6, 238. Montgomery had objected to Baytown as ineffective, preferring to prioritise Operation Avalanche, but followed orders and prepared to carry it out anyway. However, when essential landing craft and naval resources were diverted to Avalanche he complained again.Montgomery, pp. 190‚Äì2. The German commander, Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, and his staff did not believe the Calabria landing was the main Allied attack, which they expected at Salerno, or possibly north of Naples, or even near Rome. He therefore ordered General der Panzertruppe Traugott Herr's LXXVI Panzer Corps, part of the German 10th Army under Generaloberst Heinrich von Vietinghoff to pull back from engagement with the Eighth Army and delay them by the demolition of bridges and other infrastructure. A single German regiment was left to defend 17 miles of coast.Molony, pp. 23‚Äì42. half-track and 6-pounder anti-tank gun coming ashore from landing craft at Reggio, Italy, 3 September 1943. Execution Montgomery's objections were proved correct: German troops refused battle and the Eighth Army tied down none of them. The main obstacle to the Allied advance was the terrain and German demolitions.Anon, Lewisham Gunners, p. 40.Montgomery, p. 194. Opposition to the landings was very light, because the few German troops in the area rapidly withdrew northward. Italian troops on the coast, belonging to the coastal divisions, were poorly equipped, demoralized by the political situation and the massive Allied bombardment; they offered no resistance to the landing. An exception was the 184th Airborne Division Nembo, which provided more determined resistance on the Aspromonte massif, but was eventually overcome on 8 September 1943 Aftermath Operation Baytown was followed by Operation Slapstick, with the British 1st Airborne Division (Major-General George Hopkinson), and Operation Avalanche, the main landings at Salerno by elements of Lieutenant General Mark Clark's U.S. Fifth Army. Both operations took place on 9 September, following the Italian surrender the day before. The surrender had been agreed on 3 September, but was not publicly announced until 8 September, and had no direct effect on Baytown.Montgomery, pp. 194‚Äì5.

History On August 16, 1990, the Kick Drugs out of America Foundation (dba Kickstart Kids) was formed by martial artist, actor and philanthropist, Chuck Norris. He wanted to provide a martial arts program that came at no cost to the students, a program that would teach kids all the valiant traits the martial arts has to offer. In 1992, with the help of former President George H.W. Bush, the program was officially implemented in four schools in the Houston area: Burbank, Central, Hamilton, and Hogg. Today, the program operates in over 59 schools throughout Texas. The program is taught in mostly middle/junior high schools and some high schools. They currently serve more than 9,500 of today's youth, making a positive impact in their lives by teaching character through karate. In 2003, the foundation was renamed to Kickstart Kids (it still maintains its official name as Kick Drugs Out of America Foundation, but now it has added a \\"dba\\" ‚Äì doing business as ‚Äì Kickstart Kids).

He previously served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was the first and only Hindu to become an MP in Canada, and at the time of his death was the longest continuously-serving Conservative MP. He ran in the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, but was defeated in the first round of voting.  Early life and career  Obhrai was born on July 5, 1950 in Oldeani, Tanganyika, now Tanzania, to a Hindu family. His father died when Obhrai was six, so he was raised by his mother, who worked at a bank. Obhrai went to primary school in Moshi, a town near Mount Kilimanjaro, and went to high school in Arusha before transferring to the prestigious Daly College in Indore, India. He moved to the United Kingdom and trained as an air traffic controller. Disillusioned by discrimination he faced in Britain, he returned to Tanzania to work. In 1976, Obhrai was on duty at a nearby Tanzanian airport when the Entebbe raid took place in neighbouring Uganda. Obhrai immigrated to Canada in 1977 with his wife Neena, whom he had married in 1971, and his daughter Priti. He originally wanted to immigrate to Montreal, but decided to avoid Quebec and go to Calgary instead because of the recent election of Ren√© L√©vesque's secessionist Parti Qu√©b√©cois. Obhrai retrained as an accountant in Calgary and got a job with the municipal government. With his wife, he established a dry cleaning business that expanded to three stores. In the 1990s Obhrai became more involved in Calgary community life, serving as the president of the India-Canada Association of Calgary, the Monterey Park Community Association, and the Hindu Society of Calgary. He also was the vice- president responsible for Alberta in the National Indo-Canadian Council.  Municipal and provincial politics  In 1993, Obhrai lost a race for an alderman position on Calgary City Council. He launched a failed bid for the Progressive Conservative nomination for a provincial byelection in Calgary- McCall in 1995, and for Calgary-Montrose in 1996.  Federal politics  Obhrai's successful bid for the Reform Party of Canada nomination in the 1997 federal election was initially obstructed by the local riding association, prompting officials from the office of the party leader, Preston Manning, to intervene. He won the nomination and the riding, and was re-elected when the Reform Party became the Canadian Alliance in 2000. In 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2015 he was elected as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. He was also one of four Alliance MPs who agreed to sit with the Progressive Conservative caucus after the December 9, 2003 creation of the merged Conservative Party. The Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance parliamentary caucuses were not officially merged until a few weeks later. As an opposition member he served as the Opposition critic for International Cooperation, Multiculturalism, International Trade and of CIDA. In February 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Obhrai as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In March 2008, he was given the additional responsibility of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Cooperation, a role he held until November 2008; he would hold the role again from November 2010 to January 2011. Obhrai with Manmohan Singh in Toronto on June 28, 2010 During the 2011 Canadian federal election, Obhrai chose not to appear in an all-candidates debate in his riding, citing that his time was better spent talking with constituents. He also said that he \\"does not wish to debate a Liberal from Toronto,\\" a reference to Calgary East Liberal candidate Josipa Petrunic, who despite her employment by the University of Toronto, was born and raised in Calgary, which was also where she conducted her research. As a result of Gurbax Singh Malhi's defeat in the 2011 election, Obhrai became the longest serving member of parliament who was of South Asian and/or African ancestry. Obhrai penned a letter to the editor to the Calgary Herald and to his supporters saying that: \\"In my birth country, Tanzania, I would henceforth be referred to by the respectful title of Mzee. In South Asia, I would receive the title of Pradhaan. This means I have now reached the ranks of respected elders.\\" On September 19, 2013, Obhrai's role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs was augmented when his role was expanded to include responsibility for international human rights. He was appointed to the Queen's Privy Council for Canada by Governor General of Canada David Johnston on the advice of Stephen Harper. In September 2014, Obhrai received the Pride of India Award from the Indo-American Friends Group of Washington DC and the Indo-American Business Chamber in a dinner ceremony held on Capitol Hill for his contributions towards strengthening Canada's political, social and cultural relations with India and for his role in increasing Indian diaspora participation in pluralistic political activity. Obhrai was the longest-serving Conservative MP in Canada's 42nd Parliament. Obhrai served as the International Development Critic in the Shadow Cabinet of Rona Ambrose, before resigning from the Shadow Cabinet to seek the Conservative Party leadership. Conservative leadership campaign Obhrai ran in the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. The focus of his campaign was promoting Conservative outreach to immigrant communities and opposing proposals by fellow leadership candidate Kellie Leitch to screen immigrants for Canadian values. Having received 0.41% of the vote on the first ballot, Obhrai was eliminated after the first round. Post-leadership run Obhrai did not return to the Shadow Cabinet under new Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer. In December 2017, it was reported that Obhrai was being challenged for the Conservative nomination in Calgary Forest Lawn for the 2019 election by former Calgary-East MLA Moe Amery. Death Obhrai died of liver cancer on August 2, 2019 in Calgary. He had been diagnosed with the disease just a few weeks earlier. He was the longest-serving Conservative member of Parliament. A memorial service was held in Calgary several weeks after Obhrai's death. Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer were among those who spoke at the service.

Construction and modifications She was built by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson Ltd. Her keel was laid down in 23 March 1944 and she was launched on 6 May 1947 by Violet Attlee, wife of the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee.Hobbs 1996, p. 32. On 18 October 1949, she was under tow by tugs , Hendon and George V from Jarrow to Rosyth when Albion collided with from the Longstone Lighthouse. Maystone sank, Albion received a hole in her stern and started to sink. The three tugs attempted to beach her near St Abbs Head but were hampered when Hector became disabled when a tow rope wrapped around her propellor. The tug was sent from Rosyth to assist and the destroyer arrived and took Hector on tow until her crew managed to clear the propellor. Albion was successfully berthed at Rosyth with of water in her engine room. She was scheduled for completion in 1951 but not fully completed until May 1954. During the night of 19‚Äì20 June 1954, helicopters from Albion assisted in the search for survivors of a Swissair aircraft that had ditched in the English Channel off Folkestone, Kent. After an initial work up with her air group, in September she joined the Mediterranean Fleet and in October became the flagship of Flag Officer Aircraft Carriers. Operational history In 1956, after refitting at Portsmouth, Albion returned once again to the Mediterranean Sea for operations relating to the Suez Crisis, where her air group struck key Egyptian airfields, and covered the paratroopers landings. In July 1958, Albion had a sample of what she would one day become, when she embarked 42 Commando Royal Marines, with all its vehicles and additional equipment to the Middle East. Final fixed-wing complement as embarked in 1959‚Äì60: *806 sqn. 8 Sea Hawk FGA6 Fighter-Attack *894 sqn. 12 Sea Venom FAW21 Night/All Weather Fighter *849 sqn. D flt. 4 Skyraider AEW1 Airborne Early Warning *815 sqn. 8 Whirlwind HAS7 Helicopter Anti-Submarine Warfare *Ships Flight 1 Dragonfly HR5 Helicopter Search and Rescue The next two years saw her visit the Far East, Australia, New Zealand and the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans, before she returned to Portsmouth to pay off. She was considered as a replacement for the Australian carrier but was rejected and in January 1961 conversion begun for her to become a commando carrier. She recommissioned in 1962, training with 845 and 846 helicopter squadrons as well as 40 Commando Royal Marines before she joined the Far East Fleet. On 26 November 1962 she collided with a tug in Aden harbour, killing two of the tug's crew. She was a vital asset in supporting operations ashore in Borneo during the Indonesian Confrontation. In 1967 she was part of the RN task force that covered the withdrawal from Aden, and in 1971 was part of another withdrawal of British forces, this time in Singapore and the disbandment of the Far East Fleet. A Douglas Skyraider AEW.1 of the Royal Navy's No. 849 Squadron taking off from HMS Albion She sailed from Portsmouth in March 1971 for the Far East, under the command of Captain James Jungius, RN. She paid a brief visit to Ascension Island before visiting Durban in April 1971. She was in Bombay from 3 to 6 May 1971 and, after a passage of nearly seven weeks the ship embarked 40 Commando Royal Marines off Changi for an exercise (set as a counter-terrorist operation in Brunei). A ceremonial entry into Singapore followed with 848 Naval Air Squadron providing a flypast as the air squadron disembarked to . A month alongside in Singapore followed, for an assisted maintenance period (AMP). Having embarked the Australian Army Band, the ship sailed Singapore at the end of June for Japan, carrying out a full-power trial and encountering typhoons on passage. Albion was in Kobe from 1 to 8 July 1971 and then returned to Singapore. A night assault exercise followed in the Marang area, in company with a number of other warships and auxiliaries. After a rough passage the ship arrived in Fremantle on 9 August 1971 for an eight-day visit, shifting from tropical uniform (\\"whites\\") to blue uniform (\\"blues\\") for the Australian winter. She returned to Singapore on 23 August and had another month alongside. Sailing Singapore on 20 September, she spent two days at the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay and arrived Hong Kong on 30 September, where she was alongside the British naval base, , until 11 October. Back in Singapore on 15 October, her last two weeks at the Singapore Naval Base were spent storing, embarking 40 Commando Royal Marines and 848 Naval Air Squadron as part of the British withdrawal from the Far East. A farewell parade of all British armed forces represented in Singapore was held at 1730 on 29 October 1971 at the base in Sembawang, the salute being taken by Air Chief Marshal Sir Brian Burnett. The ship sailed the next day and, on 31 October 1971, the ship was one of twenty in a steampast - and flypast - that marked the handover of the naval base to the ANZUK forces. Albion then headed west. First call was Gan and then on to Mombasa from 14‚Äì22 November, where the ship underwent a week's self-maintenance period (SMP) in Kilindini harbour. She then sailed to Masirah Island and, as part of the \\"Gulf Covering Force\\", assisted with the withdrawal of British forces form the Persian Gulf. On 10 December she was detached, at full speed, to the Bay of Bengal to aid United Kingdom citizens remaining in East Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistan War but was diverted to Gan, where she arrived on 15 December. From Gan, 40 Commando Royal Marines were flown home to the United Kingdom. For the ship, it was Christmas in the Indian Ocean and New Year in Cape Town, from where she sailed on 5 January 1972. Back in home waters, she disembarked 848 Naval Air Squadron on 20 January and entered Portsmouth on 24 January 1972. After maintenance and leave, the ship sailed from Portsmouth on 11 April 1972, embarking 848 Naval Air Squadron, for the Mediterranean. After a visit to Gibraltar, the ship was lying off Cyprus from 20 to 29 April, supporting Royal Marines in an exercise. Then followed a large NATO exercise, \\"Dawn Patrol\\", which included visits to Kavala, Greece, and Souda Bay, Crete. Returning west for home, with a brief stop at Gibraltar, the ship paid an official visit to Brest from 23 to 30 May 1972, flying the flag of the Commander-in-Chief Fleet, Admiral Sir Edward Ashmore. The ship returned to Portsmouth on the last day of May and, in the first week of June, Captain William Staveley RN assumed command. June 1972 saw the ship carrying out demonstrations at sea for officers from the Royal College of Defence Studies and, on 14 June, she headed north for Rosyth, where the ship received a visit from the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Having embarked 45 Command Royal Marines and 848 Naval Air Squadron in the Firth of Forth, she sailed north for exercises in waters around the Orkney Islands. She was in Rotterdam from 28 June to 4 July 1972 and, on 8 July 848 Naval Air Squadron disembarked Albion for the last time, before the ship spent Clyde Week in Greenock. Her last United Kingdom port visit was to Dover, marking the ship's adoption by the Confederation of Cinque Ports. On 18 July, she held a Families' Day in Portsmouth before going alongside in the naval base for leave and maintenance. In September 1972 Albion took part in Exercise \\"Strong Express\\", then the largest NATO exercise ever staged, in Norwegian waters around Harstad. Her final deployment was to Canada, and she sailed from Portsmouth on 10 October 1972, embarking 42 Commando Royal Marines and 845 Naval Air Squadron the next day. She arrived in Saint John, New Brunswick, on 19 October and landed 42 Commando for exercises ashore with Canadian forces and, two days later, Halifax, Nova Scotia, for a nine-day visit hosted by HMCS Stadacona. She began her passage along the Saint Lawrence Seaway on 31 October, arriving in Montreal two days later. With 150 sea cadets embarked, she sailed from Montreal at 0830 on 7 November and arrived in Quebec at 2030 the same day. Sailing 10 November, she called at Saint John on 13 November in order to recover 42 Commando, finally departing Canadian waters on 15 November and heading East across the North Atlantic. At 0800 on 22 November, Albion anchored in Plymouth Sound and disembarked 42 Commando, 845 Naval Air Squadron and Kangaw Flight RM. Sailing from Plymouth the next day, she entered Portsmouth Harbour at 1430 on 24 November 1972, flying her paying-off pennant, with a fly-past by 845 Naval Air Squadron. The usual activities then began before disposal of the ship: de-ammunitioning, returning equipment, the last ship's company dance (ashore), the wardroom paying-off ball and, daily, an exodus of members of the ship's company. Fate In 1973, Albion was sold for conversion to a heavy lift vessel for North Sea oil exploration. The plan collapsed and she was instead broken up for scrap at Faslane Naval Base.

Hanger is a former member of the Conservative Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, having represented the riding of Calgary Northeast from 1993 until his retirement in 2008. He was elected as a member of the Reform Party of Canada (1993‚Äì2000) and the Canadian Alliance (2000‚Äì2003) before the present- day Conservatives were re-formed. Born in Three Hills, Alberta, Hanger is a former officer of the Calgary Police Service. Early political career Hanger came to the House of Commons when he won the largest plurality of votes in Calgary Northeast in the 1993 Canadian federal election. He was seen as one of the more radical members of the Reform Party, with these views culminating in March 1996 when he announced that he supported corporal punishment and had booked a trip to Singapore to investigate its use of caning in deterring crime. After public outcry and criticism from within the party, the trip was cancelled. Hanger was the Official Opposition critic for Citizenship and Immigration (2001‚Äì2004), with special responsibility for Foreign Credentials (2004). He was a former Chief Official Opposition critic for National Defence (1997‚Äì2001) and Opposition critic for the Solicitor General (1995‚Äì1997). He was vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration in the 38th Parliament, and vice chair of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs in the 36th Parliament. He served as a member of various other Parliamentary committees during his career as an MP. In the summer of 2001, Hanger was the first Alliance MP to be suspended from caucus for criticizing the leadership of Stockwell Day. However, he did not become a member of the Democratic Representative Caucus, as he accepted the September 10, 2001 reinstatement offer that was made to all the dissident MPs. On March 31, 2004, he was the only Conservative MP in the House of Commons to join with 18 Bloc Qu√©b√©cois MPs to vote against the referral of the Older Adult Justice Act to the Standing Committee on Justice. The move was in contrast to the support the bill garnered from virtually all members of his own party, as well as the governing Liberals and the New Democratic Party.

Biography Born in Philadelphia to Irish immigrant parents, Cahill moved to South Jersey with his family in 1919. He attended Camden Catholic High School in Camden, New Jersey, and graduated in 1929. Afterwards, Cahill graduated St. Joseph's College (now Saint Joseph's University) at Philadelphia in 1933. He returned to Camden to study at the Rutgers School of Law - Camden, receiving his law degree in 1937. In 1937 and 1938, Cahill was a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1939 he was admitted to the bar and began his political career.

Accessed March 10, 2011. \\"The couple have eight children and live in Collingswood.\\" Cahill was the city prosecutor of Camden, New Jersey in 1944 and 1945, was the first assistant prosecutor of Camden County from 1948‚Äì51 and was a special deputy attorney general of the State of New Jersey in 1951. Cahill was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly from 1951-53. Cahill was elected to the Eighty-sixth and to the five succeeding Congresses. During his tenure in the US House, Cahill voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.. He served in the until resigning to assume his seat as governor, serving from January 3, 1959 to January 19, 1970. Throughout his tenure in Congress and as governor, Cahill was widely viewed as a moderate Republican. Tenure as governor In 1969, Cahill ran for Governor of New Jersey, facing off against Democrat Robert B. Meyner, who had previously held the office from 1954 to 1962. Cahill defeated Meyner and became New Jersey's first Republican governor in 16 years. Cahill served as governor from January 20, 1970 to January 15, 1974, and assumed office with a Republican-controlled legislature to support him. Among his accomplishments as governor were new automobile emission standards, an increase in the sales tax from 3 to 5 percent, the introduction of the state lottery, and the passage of no-fault auto insurance. He also played a role in bringing the New York Giants from Yankee Stadium to a new field in the Hackensack Meadowlands. On Thanksgiving Day 1971, two months after the Attica State prison riots in upstate New York, a similar rebellion rose at Rahway State Prison. The revolt was quieted without violence, and Cahill's role in ending the conflict was widely commended. Cahill also appointed a commission that recommended the creation of a state income tax, which proved to be controversial with voters. The proposal was defeated in July 1972, but a state income tax was finally instituted four years later, after Cahill left office. In spite of his many successes and accomplishments as governor, Cahill's term was derailed by scandal. In 1972, Secretary of State Paul J. Sherwin was convicted for fixing a $600,000 state highway contract with a contractor who returned the favor with $10,000 to Cahill's associates. Then, in April 1973, former New Jersey Republican State Committee chairman Nelson G. Gross and State Treasurer Joseph McCrane, who had been finance chairman for Cahill's 1969 campaign, were both charged with illegally making campaign donations to the governor as tax deductions. Both men were convicted the following year. Although investigators were unable to implicate Cahill in either affair, his reputation suffered as a result of these setbacks. Cahill ran for re-election in 1973. Damaged by the scandals in his administration, he was defeated in the Republican primary election by the more conservative Congressman Charles Sandman, who went on to lose the general election to Democrat Brendan Byrne. During his final months as governor, Cahill named his predecessor, Democrat Richard J. Hughes, as chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.Schwaneberg, Robert. \\"A critical choice for Corzine: Naming chief justice - Poritz's mandatory retirement creates several scenarios for powerful post\\", The Star-Ledger, December 29, 2005; accessed August 6, 2007. \\"In October 1973, Chief Justice Pierre Garven, a Republican, died after less than two months in the post. Then-Gov. William T. Cahill was a lame duck, having been dumped by the Republican Party in the primary. Democrats won both the governor's office and control of the Senate in the November election. Cahill nominated his Democratic predecessor, Richard J. Hughes, who had been a judge before becoming governor.\\" After his term as governor, Cahill was a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University from 1974-78. Death Cahill died at his daughter's house in Haddonfield, New Jersey on July 1, 1996 of peripheral artery disease. He was interred at Calvary Cemetery in Cherry Hill Township, New Jersey. The William T. Cahill Center for Experiential Learning and Career Services at Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey was dedicated in his honor on September 10, 1997.

Built by BAE Systems Marine in Barrow-in-Furness, Albion was launched in March 2001 by the Princess Royal. Her sister ship, , was launched in November 2001, also from Barrow. Affiliated to the city of Chester and based in Plymouth, she is the ninth ship to carry the name (after Albion, an ancient name of Great Britain), stretching back to the 74-gun 1763 warship, and last carried by an aircraft carrier decommissioned in 1973 after 19 years service. Designed as an amphibious warfare ship, Albion carries troops, normally Royal Marines, and vehicles up to the size of the Challenger 2 main battle tank. She can deploy these forces using four Landing Craft Utility (LCUs) and four Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel (LCVPs). A flight deck supports helicopter operations. Albions future came under review as part of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. She was the fleet flagship from December 2010 until October 2011, and then again from March 2018. Operational history Ordered for the Royal Navy on 18 July 1996, Albion was constructed by BAE Systems Marine at its shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The first steel was cut on 17 November 1997, and the ships keel was laid down on 23 May 1998. The vessel was launched on 9 March 2001. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 19 June 2003 by her sponsor Anne, Princess Royal. Albion is the nameship of the , which also includes . The ship also carries a permanently embarked Royal Marines landing craft unit, 6 Assault Squadron, Royal Marines. Along with sister ship Bulwark, Albion forms a key part of the Royal Navy's amphibious warfare capability. The ship can carry up to 256 soldiers in normal conditions, ordinarily Royal Marines. Albion can also carry their various associated armoured vehicles, up to the size of the Challenger 2 main battle aka heavy tank. Vehicles can be deployed through an internal dock, using the ship's complement of four Landing Craft Utility (LCUs), while troops can be deployed from davits using four Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel (LCVPs). Also equipped with a flight deck, the ship can operate two helicopters, with a third parked. CH-47s can sling-load RM BvS 10 Viking light tracked, amphibious armoured vehicles and deliver them ashore if the sea states are too severe for them to swim selves ashore. 2003‚Äì2011 In 2003, Albion was granted the Freedom of the City of Chester and also had a prominent role in the Queen's Colour Parade for the Royal Navy in Plymouth Sound; the third time a Fleet Colour has been given in the Royal Navy's history. In early 2004 the ship deployed on a multinational exercise for the first time, taking part in Exercise Joint Winter 04 off Norway, during which she completed her cold weather sea trials and was declared fully operational. Her next deployment was the Aurora exercises on the eastern seaboard of the United States. On 11 November 2004, the ship was sent to Ivory Coast to support Operation Phillis. Albion underwent a refit in early 2006, which included the installation of a new command, control, and communications suite. Albion attended the HMNB Devonport Navy Days, 26‚Äì28 August 2006. Also in attendance was her sister ship, Bulwark, recently returned from the Lebanon evacuation. Ocean was unable to attend due to three sailors contracting tuberculosis; she was moved to HMNB Portsmouth. During the Vela Deployment to West Africa, Albion acted as the Amphibious Task Group flagship. The deployment lasted from 11 September to 22 November 2006. Approximately 3,000 British personnel and 11 ships of the Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary were involved. This deployment saw, for the first time, an Albion-class vessel taking part in amphibious operations with a auxiliary landing ship dock, . In late July and early August 2007, Albion was anchored off Sunderland during the city's air show. In late 2008, Albion undertook her first refit, to upgrade various electronic and defence systems. During this docking period the Commanding Officer, Captain Wayne Keble, assumed command of Albions sister ship, Bulwark. In April 2010, during the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallaj√∂kull eruption, Albion was sent to Santander, Spain as part of Operation Cunningham to bring back soldiers from the third battalion The Rifles battlegroup, Royal Air Force personnel and stranded British citizens. In May 2010, Albion together with and other Royal Navy, French and US vessels, joined the multi-national AURIGA Task Group for amphibious exercises at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Royal Marines assault craft exiting the stern of HMS Albion during amphibious operations off North Carolina in 2010. In late 2010, despite having been in commission for only seven years, the ship's future was uncertain, with either Albion or her sister ship Bulwark due to be put into extended readiness as a result of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. In December 2010, Albion was announced as the next Royal Navy flagship and flagship of the UK Responsive Force Task Group, following the early decommissioning of the aircraft carrier , which occurred in March 2011, also as a result of the 2010 review. In March 2011, Albion took part in Exercise Green Alligator with HQ of 3 Commando Brigade, the Joint Helicopter Command, the Royal Netherlands Marines Corps and 539 Assault Squadron RM. She was the main ship of the deployed Royal Navy Response Force Task Group. In May 2011, the Task Group took part in Exercise Cypriot Lion. In June 2011, the ship had been redeployed along with the Response Force Task Group to the Gulf of Sidra off Libya to provide assistance to the ongoing NATO-led operation there. She subsequently continued on to the Indian Ocean, passing through the Suez Canal on 15 June, to assist with anti-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa. On 20 September 2011, Albion docked at Liverpool Pier Head to celebrate her 10th Anniversary with a six-day stay. She was open to the public on the following Saturday and Sunday (24 & 25 September 2011). This was her second visit to Liverpool, having previously visited in March 2010. Extended Readiness 2011‚Äì2017 In late 2011 Albion entered a state of \\"extended readiness\\" (joining the UK's equivalent to a Reserve Fleet), after Bulwark completed a major refit. In order to cut the running costs of the Royal Navy, the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review concluded that one of the Royal Navy's two landing platform docks, Albion and Bulwark, should be placed into extended readiness while the other is held at high readiness for operations. Both vessels will alternate between extended readiness and high readiness throughout their service lives. It was confirmed that Albion would be the first of the two vessels placed at extended readiness, for a cost of ¬£2.5 million as Bulwark had recently finished a major refit. Running costs while in extended readiness were estimated to be ¬£300,000 per annum in order to keep the vessel available for reactivation at short notice if needed. In December 2014, Albion was moved into dry dock at Plymouth to allow her hull to be inspected and cleaned prior to the major work being undertaken to reactivate the ship. The major refit, plus the associated work up period, will take approximately 2.5 years, with Albion initially slated to assume the role of Fleet Flagship in April 2017. The running costs of one of the Albion-class vessels at high readiness ranged from ¬£17.7 million ‚Äì ¬£38.6 million per annum from 2007‚Äì2011. Albions refit included the fitting of Phalanx CIWS in place of the Goalkeeper CIWS, a Type 997 radar and a new command system. 2017‚Äìpresent Ship's staff moved back onboard Albion at the end of January 2017, formally taking responsibility for the ship from Babcock with the aim of taking Albion to sea for the first time in six years in summer 2017. On 6 February 2018, Albion deployed for the first time since her refit to relieve Duncan as flagship of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2. According to the Ministry of Defence, the planned out-of-service date for Bulwark is 2033. However, in October 2017, the BBC's Newsnight reported that the Ministry of Defence was considering decommissioning Albion and Bulwark, as part of a package of cost-cutting measures intended to mitigate the expense of the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers. This action was reversed by then Secretary of State for Defence Gavin Williamson in September 2018. In April 2018, Albion was dispatched to the Asia-Pacific to assist in enforcing sanctions against North Korea.

She may be best known as the author of Roller Skates, which won the 1937 Newbery Medal. She received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award in 1965 for her lifetime achievement in children's literature. Life Ruth Sawyer, the youngest of five children, was the only daughter of Francis Milton and Ethalinda Smith Sawyer. Sawyer was born on August 5, 1880, in Boston, Massachusetts. While she was still a baby they moved to New York City, where she attended private school. The product of a wealthy family, Sawyer had an Irish nanny named Joanna, who inspired her love and appreciation of storytelling. Upon the death of her father, a New York City importer, the family moved to their summer cottage in Maine. There they lived off the land, an experience that Sawyer later described in her novel, The Year of Jubilo. Eventually the family returned to New York and Sawyer attended the Garland Kindergarten Training School for two years.DLB, p. 295. In 1900, Sawyer left Garland and traveled to Cuba. There she taught storytelling to teachers who were opening kindergartens for children orphaned during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. After returning to the United States, her work in Cuba helped her obtain a scholarship to Columbia University where she studied storytelling and folk lore. She received her BS in education from Columbia in 1904. She then went to work for the New York school system, telling stories to people born overseas. In 1910 she started the first storytelling program for children for the New York Public Library. Sawyer also wrote articles for The New York Sun, which twice sent her to Ireland to study. While overseas on those and other trips she collected folk tales and continued learning the art of storytelling, eventually becoming well known for her folk tale collections and storytelling prowess. Her life experiences frequently gave Sawyer ideas for her books, and she spent her life collecting and telling folk tales and stories. At least one biographer pointed out the parallel between Sawyer and the Brothers Grimm. In 1911 Sawyer married ophthalmologist Albert C. Durand. They lived in Ithaca, New York, and had two children, Margaret (Peggy) and David. Peggy, a children's librarian, married Robert McCloskey, who later became a famous children's author and illustrator, best known for writing Make Way for Ducklings. Ruth Sawyer, 1921 Ruth Sawyer, 1921 Sawyer worked for the Cornell University Extension Services from 1923 to 1933, traveling through rural New York telling stories and lecturing about books. In 1931 Sawyer was 51. Though Spain was already torn by factions of the upcoming Civil War, Sawyer spent that year traveling around the country collecting folk tales. While there she met a young boy who would become the model for her book Tono Antonio. From 1935 to 1945 Sawyer visited the West Virginia Federal Reformatory for Women every month, telling stories. There she met a Hungarian woman who told her about Christmas in her country. This became the basis for Sawyer's The Christmas Anna Angel.DLB, p. 297. After Sawyer's husband retired in 1946 they moved to Maine, where they lived until resettling in Boston in 1956. In 1965 she received the seventh annual Regina Medal from the Catholic Library Association for \\"continued, distinguished contribution to children's literature without regard to the nature of the contribution.\\" That year she also became the third recipient of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award from the professional children's librarians, which recognizes a living author or illustrator whose books, published in the United States, have made \\"a substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children\\". At the time it was awarded every five years.DLB, p. 298. Sawyer never stopped writing, traveling or telling stories. At age 81 she went to Austria to research the legend of the Dwarf King named Laurin. Ruth Sawyer, \\"the great lady of American storytelling\\", died June 3, 1970, in Lexington, Massachusetts. Her papers are held at St. Catherine University in St. Paul. Writing career Sawyer's first book was an adult novel, The Primrose Ring. It appeared in 1915 and was made into a silent film in 1917, starring Mae Murray and an uncredited Loretta Young in her film debut as a fairy. The next year Sawyer published her first book for children, This Way to Christmas. The story is about a young boy --based on her son, David--whose parents go on a trip and leave him in the care of an Irish couple, Joanna and Barney. In each chapter David listens to a new Christmas story or folk tale. Sawyer published one book every year or two for the next twenty years. Her best known book, Roller Skates, was published by Viking Press in 1936. A fictional autobiography, Roller Skates tells of one year in the life of ten-year-old Lucinda Wyman, who was named for one of Sawyer's grandmothers. Lucinda's parents are traveling to Europe and leave her with the Misses Peters in New York City. Permitted almost unlimited freedom, Lucinda roller skates through the city, meeting people of all ages and nationalities. Roller Skates is considered ahead of its time because of Lucinda's freedom and the difficult issues that she must navigate throughout the book, such as the death of two of her friends.DLB, p. 296. She won the 1937 Newbery Medal from the professional librarians, recognizing it as the previous year's \\"most distinguished contribution to American children's literature\\". The Year of Jubilo is a sequel to Roller Skates. Published in 1940, it takes Lucinda and her family to Maine after the death of her father. Again Sawyer fictionalized her own life. The next year saw two books published by Sawyer. The Least One, a children's story illustrated by Leo Politi, and The Long Christmas. The latter is a collection of thirteen Christmas legends, rhymes and carols from around the world. Sawyer's next books appeared in 1944. The Way of the Storyteller is divided into two parts. The first contains directions for those who want to learn storytelling techniques, with practical suggestions for performance, memorization, and improving skills. The second section has eleven stories especially suitable for telling aloud. The Way of the Storyteller was used as a textbook for teachers, librarians and storytellers for many years, appearing in a revised version in 1962.DLB, p. 294. The second Sawyer book published in 1944 was The Christmas Anna Angel. Based on the stories she heard from a woman in the West Virginia Federal Reformatory, it tells about a young girl growing up in Hungary during World War II. The deprivation of war means there's very little for the family to celebrate with, but the heroine of the story is convinced an angel will provide a miracle in time for Christmas. Illustrated by Hungarian-born Kate Seredy, the book was a runner-up for the Caldecott Medal. By this time Sawyer's fiction writing was exclusively for children. She published several more children's books in the late 1940s and 1950s, including Maggie Rose, Her Birthday Christmas. Set in Maine, this story of a young girl's dream for a real Christmas birthday party is illustrated by Maurice Sendak. For Journey Cake, Ho! Sawyer collaborated with her son-in-law Robert McCloskey. Sawyer wrote the story, a fresh take on the theme of run-away food. McCloskey provided the illustrations and he was a runner-up for the 1954 Caldecott. Sawyer's final children's novel was Daddles, The Story of a Plain Hound-Dog. In Daddles, the narrator remembers three summers she and her brother spent in their cottage in Maine. The first two summers they share their adventures with a hunting dog named Daddles. The third summer they come back to find their companion has died. Storytelling Sawyer has been called \\"a story teller with consummate gifts ‚Äì whose tales both oral and written should be characterized as living folk-art\\".Chevalier, Tracy (editor), Twentieth-Century Children's Writers, St. James Press, 1989, p. 854. Children's literature expert May Hill Arbuthnot called her \\" a fine storyteller with an unerring sense of words, mood, and the music of narration\\". She went on to say \\"There is no one else who can relate Irish stories as she does\\".Arbuthnot, May Hill (1964). Children and Books. Scott, Foresman. Page 392.

It contains the northern right whale dolphin (Lissodelphis borealis) and the southern right whale dolphin (Lissodelphis peronii). These cetaceans are predominantly black, white beneath, and some of the few without a dorsal fin or ridge. They are smaller members of the delphinid family, oceanic dolphins, and very slender. Despite scientists being long acquainted with the species (the Northern species was identified by Titian Peale in 1848 and the Southern by Bernard Germain de la C√©p√®de in 1804), little is known about them in terms of life history and behaviour. Physical description Size comparison with a human (northern species) Both species have slender bodies, small, pointed flippers and a small fluke. Conspicuously, neither species has a dorsal fin. The northern right whale dolphin is the only dolphin in the Pacific with this property. Similarly, the Southern is the only finless dolphin in the southern hemisphere. The two species can be readily distinguished (apart from the geographical separation in their ranges) by the extent of the whiteness on the body. Both have white bellies; however, the area of white coloration on the Southern species covers much more of the body ‚Äî including the flanks, flippers, beak and forehead. Northern males are about long at sexual maturity. Females are . Both sexes become mature at about 10 years. New-born right whale dolphins are about half the length of their parents. The southern species is typically larger (up to ) and heavier (up to compared with the Northern's maximum of ). The dolphins live for about 40 years. Distribution The northern right whale dolphin is widely distributed in the temperate North Pacific in a band running from Kamchatka and mainland Japan in the west to British Columbia down to the Baja California Peninsula in the east. It is not known with certainty if they follow a migratory pattern. However, individuals have been observed close to the Californian shore following their main food source, squid, in winter and spring. Such sightings have not been recorded in summer. Otherwise these dolphins are pelagic. No global population estimates exist. There are an estimated 14,000 individuals close to the North American shoreline. The southern right whale dolphin has a circumpolar distribution running from about 40¬∞ to 55¬∞. They are sighted in the Tasman Sea in particular. Behaviour Right whale dolphins lack dorsal fins. Shown is the northern species, so the only white parts are the bellies, hidden from this angle. Both species are highly gregarious. They move in pods of several hundred individuals and sometimes congregate in groups of 3000. The groups may also contain dusky dolphins and pilot whales (in the south) and Pacific white- sided dolphins (in the north). These dolphins are some of the fastest swimmers (in excess of 40 km/h). They can by turns become very boisterous and breach and tail-slap or become very quiet and almost undetectable at sea. At high speed they can leap up to 7 metres across the ocean's surface in a graceful bouncing motion. The species will generally avoid boats, but bow-riding has been recorded on occasion. A single and rare stranding has been recorded for the northern species. On 9 June 2018, a 5.5-foot female was found deceased on Manzanita Beach on the coast of Oregon. There has been one recorded instance of 77 southern right whale dolphins stranding on Chatham Island. Conservation The southern species is under pressure from Peruvian whaling operations. The northern species has never been commercially targeted. However, tens of thousands of the northern species were killed in the 1980s due to their becoming caught in oceanic drift gillnets introduced at that time. Gillnets were banned by the United Nations in 1993. Conservation campaigners work vigorously to try to ensure these bans are retained. Attempts to keep right whale dolphins in aquaria have all ended in failure and death. In all cases but one, they have died within three weeks.

It is one of two species of right whale dolphins. Description This dolphin has a streamlined body with a sloping forehead, being more slender than other delphinids, and lacks any fin or ridge on the smoothly curving back.The body is mostly black with a white ventral marking extending forward as a narrow band from the caudal peduncle to the throat region, where this patch widens. In females, this white band is wider in the genital area than in males. In southern right whale dolphins (Lissodelphis peronii), the white patch extends higher on the posterior flanks and head. Newborns, which are initially dark grey or brown, sometimes even cream, attain adult colouring at the age of around one year. The beak of northern right whale dolphins is short and well defined, characterised by a straight mouthline. The flippers are small, curved, narrow and pointed. The tail flukes are triangular and, like the flippers, pointed. Adults are 2‚Äì3 meters (6.5‚Äì10 feet) long and weigh between 60‚Äì100 kg (130‚Äì220 lb). Females (2.3‚Äì2.6 m) are generally smaller than males (around 3 m). Otherwise the sexes appear similar. Northern right whale dolphins have 37 to 54 thin and sharp teeth per row, which are not externally visible. Northern right whale dolphins are typically found in groups with average numbers of 110 (eastern North Pacific) to 200 (western North Pacific) individuals, but large groups, containing as many as 3000 individuals, have been reported. They most often associate with Pacific white-sided dolphins, but have also been observed with pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), Dall‚Äôs porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), Risso‚Äôs dolphin (Grampus griseus), Baird‚Äôs beaked whale (Berardius bairdii), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) and others. Data on growth and reproduction of right whale dolphins is limited. Examination of northern right whale dolphins caught in driftnets allowed the estimation of the average age of sexual maturity: In males it was estimated to be 9.9 and 10.1 years; in females 9.7 and 10.4 years. Average length at sexual maturity was estimated at 215.1 cm and 214.7 cm in males and 201.1 cm and 199.8 cm in females. The mass of mature testis was between 117.4 g to 1300 g. Gestation period was 12.1 to 12.3 years and calving seemed to peak during summer (July/ August). The minimum calving interval was 2 years. An asymptotic length of 265 cm and 210 cm was reached in males and females, respectively. Geographic range and distribution Northern right whale dolphins are found in cold to temperate waters, 8¬∞C to 24¬∞C (46¬∞F to 75¬∞F), of the North Pacific Ocean. They typically inhabit offshore, oceanic regions between 34¬∞N to 55¬∞N and 145¬∞W to 118¬∞E. However, L. borealis has been reported as far south as 29¬∞ N, off Baja California (Mexico), during times of anomalously cold water temperatures. Off the US west coast, northern right whale dolphins have been seen primarily in shelf and slope waters. Migration patterns of northern right whale dolphins are not well understood, but aerial surveys off the US coast suggest seasonal changes in density that may reflect seasonal movements. Overall, distributions appear to shift northward in summer and southward in winter. However, contradicting patterns have also been observed. Northern right whale dolphins are encountered fairly often by responsible whale watching companies operating off Monterey. Behavior Northern right whale dolphins are fast swimmers. Their average swimming speed is around 26 km/h (16 mph) but they can reach speeds of up to 30-40 km/h (19-25 mph). When travelling fast, a group looks as though they are bouncing along on the water, as they make low, graceful leaps together, sometimes travelling as far as 7 m in one leap. They can dive up to 200 m (660 ft) deep in search of squid and fish, especially lanternfish. Additionally, L. borealis also feeds on other prey items, such as Pacific hake, saury and mesopelagic fish. Although northern right whale dolphins rarely approach boats, they sometimes engage in bow-riding behaviour. Furthermore, they are occasionally spotted doing acrobatics, such as breaching, belly-flopping, side slapping, and lobtailing. Unlike most delphinidae, L. borealis vocalise without the use of whistles. Visual and audio surveys have confirmed that vocalisation primarily consists of clicks and burst pulses. L. borealis have repetitive burst-pattern pulses that can be categorised and associated to different subgroups of L. borealis. These vocalisations may be used in the communication between individuals, in a similar way to signature whistles in other delphinid species. The evolutionary loss of whistling in L. borealis may have resulted from a number of factors, such as predator avoidance, school size or school species composition. Taxonomy The species Lissodelphis borealis was first described by Titian Peale in 1848. The genus Lissodelphis is placed within the Delphinidae, the oceanic dolphin family of cetaceans. The epithet of the genus was derived from Greek lisso, smooth, and delphis; the specific epithet, borealis, indicates the northern distribution. Together with the second species of Lissodelphis, Lissodelphis peronii, they are called right whale dolphins because similar to the right whales (Eubalaena) these dolphins also lack a dorsal fin. Based on the analysis of complete cytochrome b sequences, LeDuc et al. (1999) suggested placing the northern right whale dolphins (together with Lagenorhynchus spp. and Cephalorhynchus spp.) into the subfamily Lissodelphinae. However, the evolutionary relationships of Delphinidae, especially within and among the Lissodelphinae, have not been resolved unambiguously, yet. This is because the family Delphinidae contains a high number of different species, which radiate fairly rapidly. Genetically, no statistically significant differences have been found between northern right whale dolphins from the US coast and other regions within the North Pacific. Population status It is estimated that a total of around 68,000 northern right whale dolphins inhabit the Pacific Ocean. Of those, around 26,000 (the geometric mean of their abundance estimates in US waters from 2008-2014) are placed into the California/ Oregon/ Washington stock for management purposes. Their minimum population estimate is around 18,600. Their abundances and distributions along the US coast do not only vary seasonally but also interanually, making the identification of population trends difficult. Threats In the 19th century, whalers occasionally took northern right whale dolphins. In the mid-20th century, the largest threat for L. borealis were drift nets used for large-scale squid fishing. The bycatches of L. borealis during these activities, which were mainly led by Japan, Taiwan and Korea, amounted to up to 24,000 per year in the 1980s. This is thought to have reduced the stock in this area by one- to three-quarters. It is thought that in contrast to coastal areas, the offshore habitat of the northern right whale dolphin is generally less susceptible to human pollution. However, only very few studies have actually investigated the effect of pollution on L. borealis. A study estimating polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in cetaceans of the North Pacific, measured PCBs in one individual of northern right whale dolphins and found high levels of PCBs in its system. Natural predators of Lissodelphis borealis are unknown, but may include the killer whale (Orcinus orca) and large sharks. Stranding events are uncommon in this species. Since northern right whale dolphins rely on sound for communication, feeding and orientation, anthropogenic underwater noise pollution, such as vessel or military noise production, disturbs them. Conservation status Although the current population trend is unknown, the conservation status according to the IUCN Redlist is Least Concern. Regulation of international trade between members of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 1973 (CITES)- and between non-members and Convention members- has been established by listing the Northern Right Whale Dolphin under Appendix II of the Convention. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has not yet regulated the taking of these odontocetes. In Canada, the 1982 Cetacean Protection Regulations of the Fisheries Act of Canada prohibit hunting of L. borealis and other related species. The exception to this rule are aboriginal peoples, who are allowed to take whales for subsistence purposes. In the United States, all cetaceans are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as well as through the Packwood ‚Äì Magnuson Amendment of the Fisheries and Conservation Act, and the Pelly Amendment of the Fisherman‚Äôs Protective Act. One of the most effective conservation measures for L. borealis was the U.N. ban on the high- seas driftnet fisheries. The California/Oregon driftnet fishery has been required by law to use pingers (devices that deliver an acoustic warning into the water column) to help reduce the bycatch of other cetaceans, but bycatch reduction for L. borealis was not found to be statistically significant, perhaps due to low sample sizes. Resources More information about the northern right whale dolphins of the east Pacific can be found at the websites of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) or WDC (whale and dolphin conservation). Furthermore, these youtube videos show the surface behaviour of a superpod of northern right whale dolphins and the typical sounds that they produce.

It is one of two species of right whale dolphin (genus Lissodelphis). This genus is characterized by the lack of a dorsal fin. The other species, the northern right whale dolphin (Lissodelphis borealis), is found in deep oceans of the Northern Hemisphere and has a different pigmentation pattern than the southern right whale dolphin. Taxonomy The species was first published by Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de in 1804. The southern right whale dolphins together with the northern right whale dolphins are the only members of the genus Lissodelphis, which name is derived from the Greek, with lisso meaning smooth, and delphis meaning dolphin. Recent classifications have placed Lissodelphis within the Delphinidae, the oceanic dolphin family of cetaceans. The specific epithet peronii commemorates Fran√ßois P√©ron, a French naturalist who saw the species near Tasmania during an expedition in 1802. Although some doubts remain on the validity of these two species, most authors currently retain them as separate species. Both species in the genus are referred to by the name \\"right whale dolphin\\", a name derived from the right whales (Eubalaena) which also lack a dorsal fin. Other common names for the southern right whale dolphin include: whitebellied right whale dolphin, southern right whale porpoise, mealy-mouthed porpoise, tunina (=tonina) sin aleta (Spanish), delfin (=delphin) liso austral (Spanish), minami semi-iruka (Japanese), dauphin de Peron (French), yuzhnyi kitovidnyi delfin (Russian), S√ºdlicher Glattdelfin (German), and zuidelijke gladde dolfijn (Dutch). Description Southern right whale dolphins can be easily distinguished from other cetacean species within their range as they are the only dolphins without dorsal fins in the Southern Hemisphere. They have streamlined and graceful bodies, a single blowhole and a short and defined beak, possessing between 39 and 50 teeth per row. A sharp dividing line separates the black dorsal part from the white ventral part of the body, running from the tail stock forward, dipping down to the flipper insertion and sweeping back up, below the eyes, to cross the melon between the blowhole and snout crease. Younger individuals can be grey/brownish dorsally but develop adult coloration within the first year. The flippers of the southern right whale dolphins are small, recurved, predominantly white and located about one-quarter of the way back from the snout tip. Their flukes are small, have a white underside and dark grey upper side, with a notch in the middle and concave trailing edges. Variability in the size of these black and white areas exists. More extensive anomalous pigmentation has been observed, with records of pure all-white individuals, as well as melanistic (all-black) individuals. In 1998, a potential hybrid of a southern right whale dolphin and a dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) was observed and subsequently described in 2002. This animal showed intermediate morphological features between the two species. Newborn calves measure around in length and weigh around , while adults range between and weight between on average. The maximum weight for southern right whale dolphins is 116 kg, with maximum lengths reaching in males and in females but few specimens have been examined and it is expected they grow larger. On average, males tend to grow slightly larger than females. Little is known of this species‚Äô reproductive biology. Research suggests that males reach sexual maturity at lengths between and females between . Population status There are no current global abundance and mortality estimates of the species although it is considered a fairly common and abundant species along its range, particularly in Chile. The very low sighting rate is most likely caused by a lack of sampling effort and due to the difficulties of sighting the animals in their offshore habitat. Distribution Southern right whale dolphins have a circumpolar distribution across the Southern Hemisphere, generally occurring in cool temperate to Sub- Antarctic waters between 30¬∞S and 65¬∞S. The precise boundary of their range has not been estimated or closely studied but the southern limit of the species appears to be bounded by the Antarctic Convergence while the northern limit seems bounded by the Tropical Convergence although rare sightings beyond these limits have been recorded. Most sightings of the southern right whale dolphins occur in offshore and deep waters, with temperatures ranging between 1 and 20 ¬∞C. In regions where deep waters approach the coast and in upwelling areas, they have occasionally been observed near shore. South America The species is known to be abundant along the western coasts of South America, ranging from Cape Horn (55¬∞58‚ÄôS) to Arica (18¬∞28‚ÄôS), with the northernmost record at 12¬∞30‚ÄôS near Pucusana (Peru). Although the southern right whale dolphin is considered abundant, only few confirmed records of the species in the Eastern South Pacific exist. Preliminary boat surveys and stranding and fishery records suggest that southern right whale dolphins may be one of the most common species of cetacean in northern Chile. The range extends until offshore north of 40¬∞S and off the southern coast of Chile and it has been suggested that at least a part of this Chilean population migrates northbound in the austral winter and spring, when the coastal component of the cold Humboldt Current and cool coastal upwelling are strongest. An extension of the range to the North, associated to cold-water currents and food availability, has also been observed in Brazil, where a stranded individual was found in 1995 in an area where the warm Brazil Current meets the cold Malvinas Current. In 2018, two groups were sighted in the western area of the Magellan Strait in Chile. It was unclear through which route and why they entered the Magellan Strait but these were the first sightings of live southern right whales dolphins in this shallow area. A few reports of solitary stranded specimens in exterior channels south of 40¬∞S and the Beagle Channel have also shown their occurrence inside shallow channel systems. It has been hypothesized they may enter these channels accidentally or because of poor health. In the past, a high number of stranded southern right whale dolphins were reported on beaches of north-central chile, most of which were discarded animals by-caught In fishing nets. An increase in strandings is possibly due to the developing swordfish gillnet fishery off northern Chile. The waters of the Patagonian continental shelf of Argentina harbor a high diversity of cetaceans, including southern right whale dolphins. They are known to occur in cold waters off Santa Cruz Province, the Falkland Islands, as well as off Tierra del Fuego. Sightings in coastal areas are rare but exist in Mar de Plata and in Golfo Nuevo, where three southern right whale dolphins were observed once during the summer of 1992. Africa In Southern Africa, the range is associated with cold currents up the western and southern coasts, ranging northwards as far as about 23¬∞S due to the cold counter clockwise Benguela Current. The species has been found to occur year-round in a localized area on the southwestern coast of Namibia, in L√ºderitz, linked to the strong L√ºderitz upwelling cell area and high productivity waters. These animals may occasionally extend their range into South African waters although more sampling effort is needed to support this. Just one confirmed sighting of the species exists from the South African coast, just south of the Orange River. Southern right whale dolphins have also been observed in waters around Marion Island. Australia The species has been observed in Australian waters since 1802, although only few actual records exist since then. They are found off southern continental Australia including sightings south and southwestward of Tasmania, in the Great Australian Bight and off south-western Australia. One pair was sighted on the 20th of October 1910 at 42¬∞51S, 153¬∞56E, approximately 460 km to the east of Australia, in the Tasman Sea. No localised areas where the species occurs year-round are known from the coast of Australia, although more survey effort could result in the identification of these areas, similar to the one off the west coast of Namibia. Few stranded individuals have been documented in Australian waters. In December 2019, a dolphin washed up on a beach at Port Fairy, Victoria, with the deceased animal being assessed by state authorities, researchers and local Australian aboriginal elders. Another dolphin washed up in January 2020 and was photographed, but the dead animal washed back off the beach. The dual strandings were described as ‚Äòvery unusual‚Äô by authorities. New Zealand One of the earliest records of this species in New Zealand waters was during the Terra Nova Expedition, when a pair was sighted approximately 145 km west-south-west of Nugget Point Lighthouse, South Island at 47¬∞04'S, 171¬∞33'E. Southern right whale dolphins have been observed at sea to the southeast of New Zealand and are largely found between the Subtropical Convergence and the subantarctic waters to the south of it, between surface temperatures of 9¬∞-17 ¬∞C. The first recorded photographs of the species globally, were from a stranding of three individuals in New Zealand in 1952, which were apparently rescued. Since then there have been a number of strandings around the country, including seven events between 1970-1981 and a mass stranding of 75 individuals occurred at the Chatham In 1988. More recently a stranding of a single animal occurred at Mahia beach, North Island in April 2020 which was euthanised by the Department of Conservation. The northernmost record of a stranding in New Zealand was of a ~200 cm long male at Whananaki (35¬∞ 31‚ÄôS, 174¬∞ 28‚Äô), Northland, in November 1979. Southern right whale dolphins are occasionally observed off the coast of Kaikoura, on the eastern coast of South Island, typically in groups of 50-200, although larger groups of >500 are also encountered. In 1967, research showed that the species could also be found off-shore from the Chatham, Bounty and Antipodes Islands (approximately 43-57¬∞S, 168-158¬∞E) between January and March. Behavior=Social Southern right whale dolphins porpoising. One melanistic individual can be observed in this group (on the foreground in the middle) Southern right whale dolphins are generally gregarious and have been documented in aggregations of more than 1000 individuals although small groups of one to 10 have also been reported. Mean group size estimates differ and range between 52 and 368 off northern Chile, however, they typically live in groups of 100-200 individuals. Pods of just a few animals have also been observed, often associated with other cetacean species. Mixed groups with Dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) appear common in the southern Atlantic and have occasionally been reported in New-Zealand, off Southwest Africa and along the coast of southern Chile. They have been observed to intermix freely with pilot whales (Globicephala spp.) and in Chile, associations with common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) have been reported. Along their range they have also occasionally been sighted with hourglass dolphins (Lagenorhynchus Cruciger), common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus). Four basic herd configuration types have been reported and conform to the types described for the northern right whale dolphin: (1) Densely packed schools, without identifiable subgroups; (2) herds of scattered subgroups of various sizes; (3) V-shaped herds; and (4) herds in ‚Äò‚Äôchorus line‚Äô‚Äô formation. Their movement is very graceful and they often move by leaping out of the water continuously. When they swim slowly, they expose only a small area of the head and back while surfacing to breath. When traveling at higher speeds they have been observed to either (1) swim just below the surface, surfacing briefly to breath and then submerge or (2) swim rapidly at the surface, performing low- angle leaps covering much surface distance. Breaching, belly-flopping, side- slapping, and lob-tailing (slapping the flukes on the water surface) have been witnessed. Some groups will avoid boats, whereas others approach and possibly bow-ride. Few direct speed measurements at sea exist but swimming speed has been reported to be . Foraging Southern right whale dolphins prey on an undetermined range of fish, but it has been suggested they prey primarily on mesopelagic fish and squid, and may dive to depths in excess of in search of food. However, little is known of their particular habits, and it is unknown whether they generally search for their food at these greater depths or near the surface. Based on stomach contents, epipelagic coastal food habits, mesopelagic or a combination of both were suggested for southern right whale dolphins. Geographical variability in prey species has been observed by comparing stomach contents of animals from central Chile and New Zealand. The species itself is presumably occasionally predated upon by larger sharks and killer whales (Orcinus orca) however, other predators might exist. In 1983, an intact dolphin measuring was found in the stomach of a Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) taken off central Chile, and in 1990, a foetus was discovered inside a sleeper shark (Somniosus cf. pacificus). Threats Overall, clear evidence of the impact of potential threats on the species are sparse. Southern right whale dolphins were taken by whaling operations of the 19th century, primarily for their meat. In the past they have been infrequently caught off the coasts of Peru and Chile, where their meat and blubber were used as food and crab bait. High levels of bycaught animals have been recorded in the swordfish (Xiphias gladius) driftnet fishery in northern Chile, which started in the early 1980s, and to a lesser extent, the species has also been incidentally caught in driftnets along the coast of Peru. Large numbers of southern right whale dolphins are sometimes taken by gillnetting and longline fishing in oceans off the southern coast of Australia. Off the west coast of southern Africa, no evidence exists of bycatch in gillnet fisheries, but there may be competition for forage resources with pelagic trawl fisheries due to the pelagic distribution of the species and their squid based diet. The direct and indirect impacts of global climate change on the southern right whale dolphin are largely unknown, but could have a cascading effect on the movement and feeding ecology. Seismic activity, for oil and gas, might also be a minor threat. No reported attempts to capture live southern right whale dolphins exist. Conservation status As of 2018, the Global IUCN Red List classifies the southern right whale dolphin as Least Concern (LC), due to their apparent wide distribution in pelagic waters of the sub- Antarctic and the lack of evidence of severe threats to the populations. However, the species remains extremely data-poor throughout its range so the assessment should be considered provisional until more knowledge is obtained. The 2016 Regional Red List of Mammals of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland also classified the species as Least Concern while in Australia and Chile, based on the limited current knowledge on the species, southern right whale dolphins are classified as Data Deficient by the Action Plan for Australian Mammals and the Chilean Species National List respectively. Under the New Zealand Threat Classification System this species is listed locally as Data Deficient. Southern right whale dolphins are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the species is subject to International Whaling Commission (IWC) regulations. In South-Africa, the species is protected by the Marine Living Resources Act (No. 18 of 1998). They are included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU). Within the Australian Whale Sanctuary, all cetaceans, including the southern right whale dolphins are protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act). The Sanctuary includes all Commonwealth waters from the three nautical mile state waters limit out to the boundary of the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone (out to 200 nautical miles and further in some places). The species is also protected within the Indian Ocean Sanctuary and Southern Ocean Sanctuary. Although the species is included in legislation, no specific conservation measures have been identified for this species as throughout its range, there is still a clear deficiency of data to build these measures upon.

WMI is Microsoft's implementation of the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) and Common Information Model (CIM) standards from the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). WMI allows scripting languages (such as VBScript or Windows PowerShell) to manage Microsoft Windows personal computers and servers, both locally and remotely. WMI comes preinstalled in Windows 2000 and in newer Microsoft OSes. It is available as a download for Windows NT, Windows 95 and Windows 98. Microsoft also provides a command-line interface to WMI called Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC).Description of WMIC Purpose of WMI The purpose of WMI is to define a proprietary set of environment-independent specifications which allow management information to be shared between management applications. WMI prescribes enterprise management standards and related technologies for Windows that work with existing management standards, such as Desktop Management Interface (DMI) and SNMP. WMI complements these other standards by providing a uniform model. This model represents the managed environment through which management data from any source can be accessed in a common way. Development process Because WMI abstracts the manageable entities with CIM and a collection of providers, the development of a provider implies several steps. The major steps can be summarized as follows: # Create the manageable entity model ## Define a model ## Implement the model # Create the WMI provider ## Determine the provider type to implement ## Determine the hosting model of the provider ## Create the provider template with the ATL wizard ## Implement the code logic in the provider ## Register the provider with WMI and the system # Test the provider # Create consumer sample code. Importance of WMI providers Since the release of the first WMI implementation during the Windows NT 4.0 SP4 era (as an out-of-band download), Microsoft has consistently added WMI providers to Windows: * Under Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft had roughly 15 WMI providers available once WMI was installed * When Windows 2000 was released, there were 29 WMI providers as part of the operating system installation * With the release of Windows Server 2003, Microsoft included in the platform more than 80 WMI providers * Windows Vista includes 13 new WMI providers, taking the number close to around 100 in all * Windows Server 2008 includes more providers, including providers for IIS 7, PowerShell and virtualization * Windows 10 includes 47 providers for the Mobile Device Management (MDM) service. Many customers have interpreted the growth in numbers of providers as a sign that WMI has become at Microsoft the \\"ubiquitous\\" management layer of Windows, even if Microsoft has never made this commitment explicit. Because of a constant increasing exposure of management data through WMI in Windows, people in the IT systems management field started to develop scripts and automation procedures based on WMI. Beyond the scripting needs, most leading management-software packages, such as MOM, SCCM, ADS, HP OpenView for Windows (HPOV), BMC Software or CA, Inc. are WMI-enabled and capable of consuming and providing WMI information through various User Interfaces. This enables administrators and operators not capable of scripting or programming on top of WMI to enjoy the benefits of WMI without even learning about it. However, if they want to, because WMI is scriptable, it gives them the opportunity to consume WMI information from scripts or from any WMI-aware enterprise- management software. Features For someone willing to develop one or many WMI providers, WMI offers many features out of the box. Here are the most important advantages: # Automation interfaces: Because WMI comes with a set of automation interfaces ready to use, all management features supported by a WMI provider and its set of classes get the scripting support for free out-of-the box. Beyond the WMI class design and the provider development, the Microsoft development and test teams are not required to create, validate or test a scripting model as it is already available from WMI. # .NET Management interfaces: Because the System.Management namespace relies on the existing COM/DCOM plumbing, the created WMI provider and its set of WMI classes becomes automatically available to all .NET applications independently of the language used (e.g. C#, VB.NET). Beyond the WMI class design and the provider development, like for scripting, the Microsoft development and test teams are not required to create, validate and test new assemblies to support a new namespace in the .NET Framework as this support is already available from WMI for free. # C/C++ COM/DCOM programming interfaces: Like most components in Windows, COM/DCOM programmers can leverage the features of the provider they develop at the COM/DCOM interfaces level. Like in previous environments (scripting and .NET Framework), a COM/DCOM consumer just needs to interact with the standard set of WMI COM interfaces to leverage the WMI provider capabilities and its set of supported WMI classes. To make all management information available from the native APIs, the WMI provider developer just needs to interact with a set of pre-defined WMI COM interfaces. This will make the management information available at the WMI COM level automatically. Moreover, the scripting COM interface object model is very similar to the COM/DCOM interface object model, which makes it easy for developers to be familiar with the scripting experience. # Remoting capabilities over DCOM and SOAP: More than simply offering local COM capabilities, as management is all about remoting, WMI offers the DCOM transport. In addition, SOAP transport will be available in Windows Server 2003 R2 through the WS-Management initiative led by Microsoft, Intel, Sun Microsystems and Dell. This initiative allows running any scripts remotely or to consume WMI data through a specific set of interfaces handling SOAP requests/responses. The advantage for the WMI provider developer is that when he exposes all his features through WMI, Windows Remote Management/WS-Management can in turn consume that information as well (embedded objects in WMI instances are not supported in Windows Server 2003 R2. It is however a target for Vista). All the layering to WS-Management and the mapping of the CIM data model to SOAP comes for free out of the WMI/WS-Management solution. In the event DCOM must be used, implementing DCOM requires the presence of a proxy DLL deployed on each client machine. As WMI is available in the Windows operating system since Windows 2000, these issues are eliminated. # Support for Queries: WMI offers support for WQL queries out of the box. This means that if a provider is not designed to support queries, WMI supports it by using an enumeration technique out of the provider. # Eventing capabilities: WMI offers the capability to notify a subscriber for any event it is interested in. WMI uses the WMI Query Language (WQL) to submit WQL event queries and defines the type of events to be returned. The eventing mechanism, with all related callbacks, is part of the WMI COM/DCOM and automation interfaces. Anyone writing a WMI provider can have the benefit of this functionality at no cost for his customers. It will be up to the consumer to decide how it wants to consume the management information exposed by the WMI provider and its related set of WMI classes. # Code template generator: To speed up the process of writing a WMI provider including all COM/DCOM interfaces and related definitions, the WMI team developed the WMI ATL Wizard to generate the code template implementing a provider. The code generated is based on the WMI class model initially designed by the developer. The WMI provider developer will be able to interface the pre-defined COM/DCOM interfaces for the WMI provider with its set of native APIs retrieving the management information to expose. The exercise consists in filling the ‚Äúgaps‚Äù in the provider code to create the desired interfacing logic. # Predictability: Predictability is an important concern for IT professionals because it defines the capability of someone having an experience with a set of interfaces managing a Windows component to apply this knowledge right away, intuitively, to any other manageable Windows component without having relearn everything from ground up. Predictability for a customer is a real gain as it increases the Return of Investment (ROI). A person facing such a situation simply expects things to work the same way based on his previous experience. The constant increase of COM programming/scriptable interfaces has a huge impact on the predictability, as this makes it difficult for customers to automate, manage Windows and leverage their existing knowledge. WMI with CIM address this problem by always exposing the same programming object model (COM/DCOM, Automation, .NET) whatever the manageable entity is. # Protect existing customer investments: Protecting customers and partners investment motivates customers to invest in technologies. As Microsoft did invest a lot these past years in writing WMI providers, customers and partners invested in tools leveraging the WMI capabilities of Windows. Therefore, they naturally continue to exploit these capabilities instead of having to use a new set of specific interfaces for each Windows manageable component. A specific set of interfaces means having a specific set of agents or in-house developed software based on a new model or set of interfaces especially dedicated to a component or technology. By leveraging the capabilities of WMI today, customers and partners can leverage the work investment made in the past while minimizing their costs in developments, learning curves and new discoveries. This will also have a great impact on the stability and reliability of their infrastructure as they continue to leverage an existing implementation with an improved technology. # Provide a logical and unified administration model: As briefly described before in the introduction, this model is based on an industry standard called CIM defined by the DMTF (http://www.dmtf.org). The CIM class-based schema is defined by a consortium of constructors and software developers that meets the requirements of the industry. This implies that not only Microsoft leverages the WMI capabilities, but also any other third party constructors or developers write their own code to fit into the model. For instance, Intel is doing this for some of their network driver adapters and software. HP is leveraging existing WMI providers and implementing their own WMI providers in their HP Open View Enterprise Management software. IBM consumes WMI from the Tivoli management suite, MOM and SMS are also consuming and providing WMI information. Lastly, Windows XP SP2 leverages WMI to get information status from anti-virus software and firewalls. WMI tools Some WMI tools can also be useful during the design and development phases. These tools are: * The MOF compiler (MOFComp.exe): The Managed Object Format (MOF) compiler parses a file containing Managed Object Format statements and adds the classes and class instances defined in the file to the CIM repository. The MOF format is a specific syntax to define CIM class representation in an ASCII file (e.g. MIB are to SNMP what MOF files are to CIM). MOFComp.exe is included in every WMI installation. Every definition existing in the CIM repository is initially defined in an MOF file. MOF files are located in %SystemRoot%\\\\System32\\\\WBEM. During the WMI setup, they are loaded in the CIM repository. * The WMI Administrative Tools: The WMI Administrative Tools are made of four tools: WMI CIM Studio, WMI Object Browser, WMI Event Registration and WMI Event Viewer. The most important tool for a WMI provider developer is WMI CIM Studio as it helps in the initial WMI class creation in the CIM repository. It uses a web interface to display information and relies on a collection of ActiveX components installed on the system when it runs for the first time. WMI CIM Studio provides the ability to: ** Connect to a chosen system and browse the CIM repository in any namespace available. ** Search for classes by their name, by their descriptions or by property names. ** Review the properties, methods and associations related to a given class. ** See the instances available for a given class of the examined system. ** Perform Queries in the WQL language. ** Generate an MOF file based on selected classes. ** Compile an MOF file to load it in the CIM repository. * WinMgmt.exe: WinMgmt.exe is not a tool; it is the executable that implements the WMI Core service. Under the Windows NT family of operating systems, WMI runs as a service. On computers running Windows 98, Windows 95 or Windows Me, WMI runs as an application. Under the Windows NT family of operating systems, it is also possible to run this executable as an application, in which case, the executable runs in the current user context. For this, the WMI service must be stopped first. The executable supports some switches that can be useful when starting WMI as a service or as an application. WMI provider developers who may want to debug their providers essentially need to run the WMI service as an application. * WBEMTest.exe: WBEMTest.exe is a WMI tester tool, which is delivered with WMI. This tool allows an administrator or a developer to perform most of the tasks from a graphical interface that WMI provides at the API level. Although available under all Windows NT-based operating systems, this tool is not officially supported by Microsoft. WBEMTest provides the ability to: ** Enumerate, open, create and delete classes. ** Enumerate, open, create and delete instances of classes. ** Select a namespace. ** Perform data and event queries. ** Execute methods associated to classes or instances. ** Execute every WMI operation asynchronously, synchronously or semi-asynchronously. * The WMI command line tool (WMIC): WMIC is a command-line tool designed to ease WMI information retrieval about a system by using some simple keywords (aliases). WMIC.exe is only available under Windows XP Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. By typing ‚ÄúWMIC /?‚Äù from the command-line, a complete list of the switches and reserved keywords is available. ** There is a Linux port of WMI command line tool, written in Python, based on Samba4 called 'wmi- client' * WBEMDump.exe: WBEMDump is a tool delivered with the Platform SDK. This command line tool comes with its own Visual C++ project. The tool can show the CIM repository classes, instances, or both. It is possible to retrieve the same information as that retrieved with WMIC. WBEMDump.exe requires more specific knowledge about WMI, as it doesn't abstract WMI as WMIC. However, it runs under Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. It is also possible to execute methods exposed by classes or instances. Even if it is not a standard WMI tool delivered with the system installation, this tool can be quite useful for exploring the CIM repository and WMI features. * WMIDiag.vbs: The WMI Diagnosis Tool is a VBScript downloadable from Microsoft here and is a tool for testing and validating WMI on Windows 2000 and greater. The download includes pretty thorough documentation and the tool supports numerous switches. When run, it will generate up to four text files which: list the steps taken (the LOG file), an overview of the results (REPORT file), a statistics file (in comma separated values format), and optionally a file listing of the providers registered on the machine (PROVIDERS, also in comma separated values format). The report file that is generated includes a list of the issues identified and potential ways to fix them. * WMI Explorer: The WMI Explorer Tool is a freely available and opensource program downloadable here and is a tool for enumerating and querying WMI providers in a graphical user interface. Wireless networking example In the .NET framework, the ManagementClass class represents a Common Information Model (CIM) management class. A WMI class can be a Win32_LogicalDisk in the case of a disk drive, or a Win32_Process, such as a running program like Notepad.exe. This example shows how \\"MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier\\" WMI class is used to find the SSID of the Wi-Fi network that the system is currently connected to in the language C#: ManagementClass mc = new ManagementClass(\\"root\\\\WMI\\", \\"MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier\\", null); ManagementObjectCollection moc = mc.GetInstances(); foreach (ManagementObject mo in moc) { string wlanCard = (string)mo[\\"InstanceName\\"]; bool active; if (!bool.TryParse((string)mo[\\"Active\\"], out active)) { active = false; } byte[] ssid = (byte[])mo[\\"Ndis80211SsId\\"]; } The \\"MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier\\" WMI class is only supported on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. WMI driver extensions The WMI extensions to WDM provide kernel-level instrumentation such as publishing information, configuring device settings, supplying event notification from device drivers and allowing administrators to set data security through a WMI provider known as the WDM provider. The extensions are part of the WDM architecture; however, they have broad utility and can be used with other types of drivers as well (such as SCSI and NDIS). The WMI Driver Extensions service monitors all drivers and event trace providers that are configured to publish WMI or event trace information. Instrumented hardware data is provided by way of drivers instrumented for WMI extensions for WDM. WMI extensions for WDM provide a set of Windows device driver interfaces for instrumenting data within the driver models native to Windows, so OEMs and IHVs can easily extend the instrumented data set and add value to a hardware/software solution. The WMI Driver Extensions, however, are not supported by Windows Vista and later operating systems.

She was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1889 and remained there until 1893 when she returned home. The ship was assigned to the Coast Guard Squadron for the next decade before she was placed in reserve in 1903. Australia was sold for scrap in 1905. Design and description Australia had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a draught of . Designed to displace , all of the Orlando-class ships proved to be overweight and displaced approximately . The ship was powered by a pair of three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which were designed to produce a total of and a maximum speed of using steam provided by four boilers with forced draught. During her sea trials, Australia reached . The ship carried a maximum of of coal which was designed to give her a range of at a speed of . The ship's complement was 484 officers and enlisted men.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 65 Australias main armament consisted of two breech-loading (BL) Mk V guns, one gun fore and aft of the superstructure on pivot mounts. Her secondary armament was ten BL guns, five on each broadside. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by six quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and ten QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, most of which were mounted on the main deck in broadside positions. The ship was also armed with six 18-inch (457 mm) torpedo tubes: four on the broadside above water and one each in the bow and stern below water. The ship was protected by a waterline compound armour belt thick. It covered the middle of the ship and was high. Because the ship was overweight, the top of the armour belt was below the waterline when she was fully loaded.Friedman, p. 146 The ends of the armour belt were closed off by transverse bulkheads . The lower deck was thick over the full length of the hull. The conning tower was protected by of armour. Construction and service Australia, named for the Australian continent,Silverstone, p. 216 was laid down on 21 April 1885 by Robert Napier and Sons at their shipyard in Govan, Glasgow. The ship was launched on 25 November 1886, and completed on 11 December 1888.Friedman, p. 342 Shortly after commissioning, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and remained there until 1893 when she participated in the Columbian Review held in New York City that year to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the New World. Upon her return home, Australia became the coast guard ship for Southampton Water for the next decade.Friedman, p. 141 Captain Charles Henry Adair was briefly in command from November 1899 to January 1900. Captain George Neville was appointed in command on 20 January 1900, and in September the following year she visited Germany and Denmark, when she escorted the royal yacht carrying King Edward VII from Hamburg to Elsinore. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. Captain Charles Home Cochran was appointed in command on 24 November 1902, but the ship was placed in reserve at Chatham Dockyard in early 1903, before being sold for scrap on 4 April 1905.
