Principal officers included John Chadwick as President, George Wrightson as Treasurer, and Julius H. Kroehl as Chief Engineer. Other shareholders included William Henry Tiffany, Charles D. Poston and William M.B. Hartley. The company was a venture to harvest pearls and pearl shells in the Pacific Ocean. The first site chosen was Panama, in particular the Pearl Islands. After Kroehl recovered sufficiently from malaria he contracted while serving the Union Navy during the Vicksburg Campaign, he began designing and building a vessel at Ariel Patterson's Shipyard near the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Also being built nearby was the Intelligent Whale under the direction of Scovel S. Merriam. There were many companies active in submarine salvage at this time. The vessel Kroehl built was later known as Sub Marine Explorer. It operated as a diving bell, but was autonomous as a submarine propeller. It held its fourth test dive on May 31, 1866, receiving notice in many newspapers. In August 1866, the Company held a meeting to raise funds by selling stock. At this time, Mark Brumagim became president of the company. But the submarine was not dispatched to Panama until December 1866. Whether this was due to insufficient funds, the political situation in Panama, or technical problems with the vessel is unknown at this time. After arriving at Aspinwall, the vessel was transported via railroad to the city of Panama. It was reassembled, tested, and then shipped to the island of St. Elmo (San Telmo). During a test run around the island, the submarine while skimming the bottom at 30 feet, went over a submarine cliff going down to 75 feet. However, the relative lightness was no problem, and the crew managed to make it back to the surface unscathed. Harvesting continued through the summer, resulting in thousands of pounds of pearl shells and many pearls. As the crew was staying in Panama to return the season's harvest, Kroehl had a fatal recurrence of malaria. He died on 9 September 1867. With no funds to continue harvesting, and without Kroehl's leadership, the crew returned to the New York. The Company continued to retell the story of the success of the harvest in 1868, and later in 1870. But one newspaper account in 1868 noted that the submarine lay derelict for a year and that Kroehl was dead (Philadelphia Inquirer, p. 2, 24 August 1868). In 1869, the company resumed its work, with Henry A. Dingee in charge of the operation. In September of that year, the company reported a harvest of pearls and pearl shells. But many workers became ill and died while working the submarine, probably from the effects of decompression sickness. There was interest to harvest pearls in Baja California using the Sub Marine Explorer, and that the \\"Engineer\\" was scouting a position. However, the Company recorded no further accomplishments. On April 2, 1924, the Company was involuntarily dissolved. There are two other companies that operated at different times with the same name, but have no relation with this company. One was a British company which was active around the 1820s and undertook a commercial expedition to New South Wales, Australia. The other was a Japanese company active during the second half of the 20th Century.

The Hagmann Valve is a rotary valve for trombone that was developed by Ren√© Hagmann in the early 1990s. His intention was to address some of the problems with the popular Thayer Valve, in particular the maintenance issues caused by its relatively complex design. A standard rotary valve turns the air flow as much as 90 degrees when it is engaged. This does not substantially affect the sound of instruments like the French Horn which already have many turns in the air flow, but part of the characteristic sound of the trombone comes from its long, straight air flow. The angles on a Hagmann valve are dramatically less (60 to 66 degrees) which makes it much easier for the player to maintain proper tone with the valve engaged. While the Hagmann Valve does not achieve as low an angle as the Thayer Valve (which can be as low as 20 degrees), it is much easier to maintain and the tone differences are nearly inaudible. Many leading trombone manufacturers now offer Hagmann valves as an option, especially on their professional ranges.

Many names have alternative spellings, because the Huaorani language contains phonemes that were unknown to those who first studied the language. The Huaorani did not have a writing system until after outside contact, which led to a lack of spelling standardization. Surnames are sometimes used to indicate one's father, but they do not appear to be commonly used in Huaorani culture. Many dates are unknown because the Huaorani did not mark time for many years. Most dates are estimated by approximate ages during certain events, and a generation gap of about 20 years. Dates that have been verified are linked. Men * Awa√±etae (c. 1915‚Äìc. 1955) was Gabo and Ompodae's father. He was killed by Dabo while sleeping in his hammock. * Caento (Tyaento; c. 1915‚Äìc. 1947) was Dayuma's father. He was mortally speared in the knee by Moipa, crippling him at first. His death led to Dayuma's flight from her home. * Dabo (born ca. 1935) is the killer of Awa√±etae. He also tried to kill Awa√±etae's son, Gabo, with a machete. Later in life, Dabo gave up his life of killing, making the observation that the tribe would have killed each other off had they not stopped spearing each other. His wife's name was Weba. * Dyuwi Tani (Dyuwe, Yowi Ta√±i; born c. 1935) was one of the six men from the attack at Palm Beach, and is one of the three surviving participants. A few months after the massacre, he and Nimonga also speared Nenkiwi. He had been promised to Gimade to marry, and his animosity was directed against Nenkiwi who had taken Gimade instead. Dyuwi later became a Christian and an elder in the Huaorani church. He and Kimo baptized Kathy and Steve Saint in 1970. He has a reputation as a quiet person. * Enkedi (c. 1915‚Äìc. 1950) was the father of Mincaye. He participated in an attack on the village of Arajuno and killed several Quichua Indians. When the Arajunos fought back, those who attacked with Enkedi fled, but he stayed to fight them and was killed.. * Itaeca (Itaeka born c. 1925) is Moipa's brother. He speared Kimo's mother and Moipa. * Gabo (c. 1935‚Äìc. 1955) was Ompodae's brother. He was attacked and mortally wounded by Dabo. After receiving a severe cut on his face, he died soon afterwards.. * Gikita Wawae (Giketa, Guikita; c. 1915‚ÄìFebruary 13, 1997.) was the leader of the attack at Palm Beach. He later became a Christian as well as an elder in the Huaorani church. During Operation Auca when Nate Saint was making gift drops from his airplane, Gikita was the first to offer a gift in return. He stole Paa's parrot and put him in the basket for the missionaries. * Kimo Yeti (born c. 1935) was one of the six men from the attack at Palm Beach, and is one of the three surviving participants. Kimo took Dawa as his wife after participating in a spearing raid which killed most of her immediate family. They were not able to have children, but he never took another wife. In 1956, he was part of the spearing raid at Palm Beach where he is believed to have killed Pete Fleming, the last of the missionaries to be killed. Later he became one of the first Huaroni converts to Christianity (after Dayuma and his wife Dawa). He built a home for the missionaries, despite resistance from within the tribe. He later became an elder in the Huaorani church. Kimo, along with Dyuwi, baptized Kathy and Steve Saint in the Curaray River. Rachel Saint once took him and Komi to Berlin, Germany for a Billy Graham evangelistic conference where he shared his testimony in front of an international audience. * Komi (born c. 1935) is Dayuma's husband. Rachel Saint once took him and Kimo to Berlin, Germany for a Billy Graham evangelistic conference where he shared his testimony in front of an international audience. Their testimonies were reported to be so moving to the audience, that one pastor ran onto the stage to meet them. * Mincaye Enquedi (Mincayi, Minkayi, or Minkayani, Huao for \\"Wasp\\"; born c. 1935 - 28 April 2020) was one of the six men from the attack at Palm Beach, of which there are three surviving participants. He later became a Christian as well as an elder in the Huaorani church. He has become one of the most outspoken of the Huaorani due to his many appearances in the United States alongside Steve Saint. The 2006 film End of the Spear focuses mainly on his life. Mincaye is also the name of Mincaye's grandson, who is sometimes called \\"Mincaye, Jr.\\" The name was also given to Jaime Saint as a tribal name. * Moipa (c. 1925‚Äìc. 1955) was known as one of the fiercest and strongest Huao warriors. He once attacked Arajuno and speared six Shell Oil Company employees. He also speared Kimo's mother, but she survived. He also terrorized Dayuma's family, severely wounding her father, Caento. Moipa was eventually killed by his brother, Itaeca, in retaliation. * Nampa (c. 1935‚Äì1956 or 1957) was Dayuma's younger brother and was one of the six men from the attack at Palm Beach. His other sister, Gimade, was the love interest of Nenkiwi, and Nampa was so much against the idea of them marrying he was ready to spear Nenkiwi. Nampa died after the attack at Palm Beach, and the time of death as well as the cause of death have been the subject of a small controversy. During the attack, he was injured in the head by a bullet fired from one of the missionaries' pistols. Some claimed that Nampa died shortly afterwards from complications related to the injury,. while others have reported that he lived on for well over a year and died during a hunting expedition. * Nenkiwi (Kemi, Naenkiwi, Nankiwi, Nengkewi, or Nenquihui, nicknamed \\"George\\"; c. 1935-56) was one of the three visitors to Palm Beach two days before the massacre. He was following Gimade whom he wanted to marry. His first wife had been speared and he himself had drowned his second wife. At the time he already had two wives, as well as a reputation as a trouble maker. This led the tribe to be much against the idea of him marrying Gimade as well. During the visit at Palm Beach, Nenkiwi ate hamburgers and spoke with the missionaries. Nate Saint took him for two rides in the airplane. During the second ride, Saint buzzed Nenkiwi's village as he called to his friends below, almost falling out of the plane at one point. Later Nenkiwi lied to the other Huaorani and told them that the missionaries were hostile and had threatened him. This was the excuse that led to the massacre at Palm Beach, even though Mincaye said later that they knew Nenkiwi was lying. Later that same year, Nenkiwi was speared by Dyuwi and Nimonga. As was Huao custom, his children were to be buried with him. His daughter was strangled to death and placed in the grave next to him, but his son, Tementa, who was a baby at the time, was saved by his mother, Epa. * Nimonga (Nimungka; c. 1935‚Äì1990) was one of the six men from the attack at Palm Beach. He is believed to have speared both Jim Elliot and Roger Youderian during the attack. Later, he and Dyuwi speared Nenkiwi. * Paa (born ca. 1950) is an elder in the Huao church. When he was a child, he was the owner of the tame parrot that was given to the missionaries during the gift drops. Paa was upset about giving up the bird, but he had no choice in the matter. * Tementa Nenquihui (Tamaenta, Teminta, Temente, Tementa Nenquiwi Huamoni; born c. 1956) is the son of Nenkiwi and Epa. He became a Christian and a tribal leader. He and Mincaye together baptized Anna McCully, the granddaughter of Ed McCully, in the Curaray River. He was trained to fly a powered parachute as part of Steve Saint's efforts to help the Huaorani become more self-dependent. His wife's name is Nemontae. * To√±ae (Tona c. 1947‚Äì1970) was the first Huaorani martyr. He was living with the upriver Huaorani tribe where the missionaries first came, although he was originally from the downriver tribe. The downriver and upriver tribes were historical enemies, and To√±ae had been captured as a child during an upriver raid on the downriver tribe. After becoming a Christian, he wanted to return to his family to evangelize them as well. At first they were happy that he had returned home, but when they realized that he had given up spearing, they turned on him and killed him. The village of Tonampade is named after him. Women * Aepi (born c. 1940) fled the village with Dayuma. * Akawo (c. 1915‚Äì1975) was Dayuma and Nampa's mother. She was one of the four women from the attack at Palm Beach. * Alicia Cawiya (given name Hueiya) is the Vice-President of the National Waorani Federation (NAWE) and one of the founders of the Asociaci√≥n de Mujeres Waorani del Ecuador (Ecuador Waorani Women Association). * Bibanca (born c. 1940) was Mincaye's younger sister. She was killed by an anaconda while sitting in a canoe. * Dawa (born c. 1935) is Kimo's wife. She was present at Palm Beach during the massacre, but she did not participate in the attack. Instead she hid in the jungle on the far side of the river. She said that the whole time she wanted the others to stop the killing, but was unable to stop them. During the skirmish, her wrist was injured from a stray bullet from one of the missionaries' weapons. Dawa believed the shot was meant as a warning and not intended for her, since it appeared none of the missionaries had seen where she was hiding. After the attack, she went up into the missionaries' tree house. Later, Dawa became the second member of the tribe to become a Christian (after Dayuma). She also became close with Steve Saint, who calls her \\"Grandmother Dawa\\". * Dayuma (Dayumae; born c. 1930-2014) fled her tribe as a young girl with Aepi and Omi. She lived with Quechua Indians and American missionaries. Dayuma was helpful in teaching the Huaorani language to the missionaries. Dayuma was the first known Huaorani to convert to Christianity. She eventually moved back to live with her people along with Rachel Saint and Elisabeth Elliot. * Epa (born ca. 1935) was Nenkiwi's oldest living wife. According to custom, she killed her daughter Gamae to be buried with Nenkiwi. Her son Tementa, a baby at the time, would have had the same fate, but Epa took him and ran away, saving his life. * Gamae (c. 1950‚Äì1956) was Nenkiwi and Epa's daughter. According to custom, she was killed and buried with her father when he died. * Gimade (Gimari, nicknamed \\"Delilah\\"; born c. 1938) was Nampa and Dayuma's sister. She visited Palm Beach along with Nenkiwi and Gimare two days before the massacre. She had come to the beach because she wanted to see Dayuma, whom she assumed would be with the missionaries. She was being pursued romantically by Nenkiwi. She later died in childbirth. * Mankamo (Mankuma, Huao for \\"Blackbird\\") is Gikita's widow. She and Mintaka were the ones who initiated contact with the outside world, after they left their tribe in search of Dayuma. * Mintaka (Huao for \\"Blue Macaw\\";. born c. 1915) was Gikita's sister. She was the older woman who visited Palm Beach along with Nenkiwi and Gimade two days before the massacre. She had come acting as a chaperone for Nenkiwi and Gimade. However, when they left, Mintaka stayed behind with the missionaries well into the night. Two days later she returned to Palm Beach and was one of the four women from the attack. In November 1958, Mintaka and Mankamo left their tribe and met Elisabeth Elliot in Arajuno. She stayed there for almost a year, then returned to the tribe. When she came back, she invited Elisabeth and Rachel to come and live with them. * Mi√±imo (Minyimo; died 1956) was one of the four women from the attack at Palm Beach. * Nemo (Nimo, Nimu, Huao for \\"Star\\"; c. 1935‚Äìc. 1945) was one of Dayuma's sisters and was killed by hostile Huao warriors with a machete. Earlier in her life, she was very sick with a fever, and after drinking from a certain creek, the water seemed to heal her. Later, when Steve Saint returned to help the Huaorani build a community center in the jungle, they happened to build it at the same place where Nemo's creek was. They called the new community Nemompode, \\"Star Creek\\", after Nemo. Both Rachel and Stephenie Saint were also given the name Nemo as a tribal name. * Omi (Umi; born c. 1940) was Dayuma's cousin. She fled the village with her. * Ompodae (born c. 1935) was Mincaye's wife. She was originally a member of the downriver clan who were the historical enemies of Mincaye's clan. Most of her family was killed during a spearing raid led by Dyuwi, Mincaye, Dabo, and Nenkiwi. Although she was taken to be Mincaye's wife by force, they developed a strong relationship. Like Mincaye, she has also traveled to the United States. Other Names * Waengongi (Wangongi) - Name of the creator god. The ancient Huaorani taught that Waengongi had created the world, and while he still provided for them, he no longer communicated with them.

They may include contests and exhibitions, booths selling tattoo-related items and even booths rented for use by tattoo artists who work during the convention. Collectors may attend conventions specifically to obtain a tattoo from a particular visiting artist. Other events may include professional events such as workshops and meetings as well as social events. Contests, usually restricted to registered participants, usually feature a variety of categories: black-and-gray, tribal, oriental, backpiece, women, men, and so on.

It also serves as a hub for its network websites: TrekToday, a news site updated nearly daily; The Trek BBS, which describes itself as the largest Star Trek community on the Internet;The Trek Nation Accessed on August 22, 2007 and Jammer's Reviews, a Star Trek review site.  TrekNation =History TrekNation was established on June 27, 1999 by Christian H√∂hne Sparborth as a network site for Sparborth's sites TrekToday and TrekBBS after he left another network, the TrekZone Network, over disagreements with TrekZone's founder. Other websites included in TrekNation were Jamahl Epsicokhan's review site Star Trek: Hypertext and the now defunct Warp Eleven. In addition to serving as a network site, TrekNation conducted a number of interviews with past and present Star Trek cast, crew, and contributors; published articles and columns on the Trek franchise; and posted reviews of Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise. The site also maintained both an episode guide for the various Star Trek series and a now defunct section dedicated to the Wildstorm Star Trek comics. After the cancellation of Enterprise, the articles and interviews began to slow down. As of 2009, TrekNation's main updates are \\"Retro Reviews\\" of the original Star Trek and The Next Generation. TrekNation and its networked sites have been affiliated with the UGO Network since TrekNation's founding. TrekNation Episode Guide TrekNation still maintains an episode guide for all Trek series (including The Animated Series). Although information on the episodes themselves are not as detailed as that at Memory Alpha, all episode pages for Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise contain links to both TrekNation's review of the episode and reviews on other websites. Links are not provided to the Retro Reviews of Star Trek and The Next Generation. Most episodes from all six series also include a parody written by FiveMinute.net.  Trek BBS =History The Trek BBS, founded in early 1999,https://www.trekbbs.com/members/trektoday.3/ is the largest and most active section of TrekNation, with over 20,000 registered users. Sparborth, the site's founder, was the first head administrator. In June 1999, TrekBBS became part of TrekNation, and was updated with a new layout, known to many posters as \\"Big Blue\\". The site also became affiliated with UGO at this time. In December 2002, Sparborth decided to step down as head administrator, and turned the job over to the administrator Lisa, who had been the de facto head for several months. In September 2004, Lisa resigned as well, and Bonnie Malmat, known on the BBS as T'Bonz, replaced her as head administrator, a position she still holds. In 2005, Malmat was interviewed by the Los Angeles Times on her views of fandom in light of and about TrekBBS's stand on the contentious issues surrounding TrekUnited's \\"Save Enterprise\\" campaign. In 2007, the Los Angeles Times again interviewed Malmat for her opinion of fan reaction toward plans for a new Star Trek film by J. J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof. Forums The board includes dedicated forums for all aspects of the Star Trek franchise, including each television series, the movies, novels, games, and fan creations such as fan fiction. Additionally, there are a number of forums for discussion of topics other than Star Trek. These include forums for other science fiction shows such as Doctor Who, as well as forums on less specific topics, including general media, politics, and miscellaneous discussion. The board also has an active social community, which has led to the creation of several spin-off boards. Notable Members Several Star Trek professionals frequent TrekBBS. They include actress Chase Masterson, frequent illustrator Rick Sternbach, graphic designers Michael Okuda and Andrew Probert and Enterprise producers and writers David Goodman and Mike Sussman. Additionally, many professionals affiliated with Pocket Books post about Star Trek novels, including former editors Margaret Clark, Marco Palmieri and John Ordover. Authors such as Christopher L. Bennett, Margaret Wander Bonanno, Greg Cox, Keith R.A. DeCandido, David R. George III, David Mack, Andy Mangels, Michael A. Martin, Terri Osborne (who is also currently a moderator on the board), Geoffrey Thorne, David A. McIntee and Dayton Ward also make regular posts at TrekBBS. Because of these visits, several authors have included TrekBBS in their acknowledgements, particularly in Articles of the FederationDeCandido, K.(2005): 399. Articles of the Federation. New York: Pocket Books. and The Art of the Impossible,DeCandido, K.(2003). 353: The Art of the Impossible. New York: Pocket Books. both by Keith R.A. DeCandido, and Ex MachinaBennett, C.(2005): viii. Ex Machina. New York: Pocket Books. by Christopher L. Bennett. Additionally, Margaret Wander Bonanno credits TrekBBS and several of its posters (including two former moderators) for reviving her Star Trek writing career on the dedication page of Catalyst of Sorrows.Bonanno, M.W.(2003): dedication. Catalyst of Sorrows. New York: Pocket Books.  TrekToday  TrekToday is TrekNation's news site. It went live on February 5, 1999, and has had near-daily updates since then. In addition to posting news about Star Trek, Trek Today posts TrekNation's Retro Reviews and Site Columns, highlighting past Trek news and highly active threads on TrekBBS. The current news editors are Sparborth and Bonnie Malmat. Michelle Erica Green writes the episode reviews. In early 2001, TrekToday was the first site to post information about the characters for the then-upcoming Enterprise. Sparborth was later interviewed in 2002 about the possible end of the Star Trek franchise.  Jammer's Reviews  Jammer's Reviews, formerly known as Star Trek: Hypertext, is the only TrekNation site not founded by Sparborth. Instead, the site was founded in 1995 by Jamahl Epsicokhan, known on TrekBBS and his site as Jammer. Jammer's site originally focused on reviews of Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Andromeda. Star Trek: Hypertext was part of TrekZone before migrating to TrekNation upon the latter's founding in 1999. In 2000, Jammer was invited by Voyager producer Joe Menosky to pitch a story, although nothing came of it. Also, from September to December 2000, Jammer's Voyager and Andromeda reviews were syndicated by Space.com. This ended in January 2001, when Space.com closed their science-fiction section. On TrekBBS, Jammer is one of the moderators of the Deep Space Nine forum, a position he has held since the forum's creation. On his website, he has begun reviewing the new Battlestar Galactica and The Next Generation. Spin-offs Sparborth owns two other websites which are similar to TrekNation. The first is CSI Files, launched in 2003. It publishes news on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and its spinoff shows. It also includes a TrekBBS-like forum, TalkCSI. The second site was Get Desperate!, a site for Desperate Housewives news. This site launched in 2005, but is now defunct. Sparborth owned a third site for Andromeda, Slipstream Web, but this site is now defunct. Sparborth also had a German language Star Trek BBS.

During the Canadian off-season, he played and coached in the U.S.-based German American Soccer League. In 1971, he became a player and head coach for the New York Cosmos. In addition to coaching the Cosmos, he has coached the U.S. national team and at the collegiate and high school levels. Bradley also earned one cap with the U.S. national team in 1973. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame.  Player = England  Bradley grew up in Sunderland, England where he turned professional with the local Sunderland club at age sixteen. However, his career nearly ended just as it was beginning. During a training session, he shattered his right kneecap kicking a ball and it took over two years before he was fit to play again. In 1950, English conscription laws forced Bradley to choose between working in the government coal mines or entering the military when he turned nineteen. Bradley chose to work in the coal mines at Easington Colliery. In addition to working in the mine, Bradley continued to play soccer. While he began his career as a forward with Sunderland, the injury slowed Bradley and he moved into defense. Bradley signed with Bradford Park Avenue in 1955 then in 1957, he moved to Carlisle United where he eventually played 130 games, scoring 3 goals.  Canada  Bradley spent five seasons in Canada playing in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League. In 1962, he helped Toronto Roma win the league title. After three seasons with Roma, he then moved to Toronto City for the 1965 season. In 1966, he played for Toronto Inter Roma.  United States  GASL = While playing in the summer in Canada in 1963 and 1964, Bradley would then move south during the fall and winter to play and coach the New York Ukrainians of the German American Soccer League (GASL) and won the 1964-1965 US Open Cup. In 1965, he moved to the New York Americans, a GASL team, which competed in the International Soccer League. = NPSL = In 1967, two new national soccer leagues, the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) and the United Soccer Association (USA) formed in the United States. Bradley signed with the New York Generals of the NPSL. The two leagues merged at the end of the season to form the North American Soccer League (NASL). = NASL = Bradley remained with the Generals as they entered the NASL, serving as both player and assistant coach during the 1968 season. The Generals folded at the end of the season and Bradley moved to the Baltimore Bays for the 1969 NASL season. The Bays folded at the end of the 1969 season and Bradley was not associated with any NASL team for the 1970 season. He returned to the NASL in 1971 when the expansion New York Cosmos signed Bradley as both its first coach and first player. He both played and coached the Cosmos through the end of the 1975 season when he was fired after a 10‚Äì12 season and replaced by Ken Furphy. Having only played in one game in 1975, Bradley retired from playing professionally. = National team = Bradley earned one cap with the U.S. national team in a 2‚Äì0 loss to Israel on 15 November 1973. At the time, he was serving as the national team coach and ironically, he did not gain his U.S. citizenship until 1974.  Coach = GASL  Bradley gained his start in coaching with the New York Ukrainians of the German-American Soccer League in 1963. He later served as an assistant coach with the New York Generals of the North American Soccer League in 1968.  School  When the Generals folded, Bradley coached the boys soccer team of Manhattan's St. Bernard's School.. His team went undefeated until the final game, which it lost, (1 - 0), to arch-rival, St. David's School.  NASL  In 1971, the New York Cosmos hired Bradley as the team's first coach. While he took the Cosmos to the 1972 NASL championship, he had two losing seasons in 1974 and 1975 and was fired at the end of the season and replaced by Ken Furphy. In 1976, the Cosmos fired Furphy after the team began the season 8-6 briefly. Bradley lasted until 7 July 1977 when the team moved him to the front office as Vice President of Player personnel during the season and replaced him as coach with Eddie Firmani. The Cosmos won the Soccer Bowl in 1977 (2-1 over the Seattle Sounders). In 1978, the Washington Diplomats hired Bradley as head coach. While the Washington Diplomats folded in 1980, they were replaced that by a new franchise with the same name which played in the American Soccer League. The new team retained Bradley as coach, but fired him during the preseason and replaced him with Ken Furphy.  National team  In October 1973, the United States Soccer Federation replaced Eugene Chyzowych as national team coach when he suggested the federation should hire a full-time coach. USSF called Bradley, who was on vacation, and asked him to coach the team. Bradley coached the U.S. to six straight losses and was dropped as head coach at the end of the year.  College  In 1985, George Mason University hired Bradley as its men's soccer team head coach. He coached the Patriots for sixteen years until retiring on 4 December 2000. During those sixteen seasons, Bradley compiled a 183-113-35 record. In May 2006, Bradley was inducted into the George Mason Hall of Fame.  Soccer administration  In addition to playing and coaching the New York Cosmos, Bradley also served as the team's vice president from 1971 to 1977 when he left the team to join the Washington Diplomats. While coaching the Dips, he also served as the team's vice president.  Television broadcaster  Bradley worked as a color analyst alongside Bob Carpenter on NASL games in 1983. He was also featured as a television commentator on Home Team Sports during local broadcasts of MLS' DC United games. In 1996, the National Soccer Hall of Fame inducted Bradley. The next year, the Eastern New York Youth Soccer Hall of Fame also selected Bradley for induction.https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013609/http://www.enysoccer.com/News/163115.html  Death  He spent his last years out of the public eye, suffering from Alzheimer's disease and spending his last month in a full-care facility in Manassas, Virginia. Upon hearing of his declining health, one of D.C. United's supporter groups, Screaming Eagles, created a banner in Bradley's honor for display at the next home game. He died a few days later.

Ten Mile Point, as seen from the beach on Cadboro Bay One such cove, called \\"Smuggler's Cove\\", was used during the prohibition years as a boat landing and launch for rum-runners traveling back and forth to the United States. Another cove is called \\"Telegraph Cove\\" and was the location of a dynamite factory which operated in the late 19th century. In the early part of the 20th century, Ten Mile Point became a summer retreat with many cabins on its shores. It gradually developed into the present upscale residential neighbourhood. Ten Mile Point maintains a rural, bucolic feel as a result of lot municipal zoning implemented specifically for this area by the District of Saanich. The area has only two street lamps.

The film was produced by Stellar Megamedia, Debo Films Ltd. and Kingwood Ltd. Shanghai Dreams was the winner of the Jury Prize at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. Synopsis The film is set in the early 1980s and follows a Shanghai family who had gone to work in a factory in Guizhou as part of the 'Third Front', intended as an industrial base if China were invaded. The father, obsessed with returning to Shanghai for a better life for his family, attempts to prevent a romance between his daughter and a local worker. The film is partly autobiographical in nature, as Wang's family was also sent to Guizhou as a child. Background Shanghai Dreams represents the first time a director has approached the subject of the \\"Third Line of Defense\\" and its consequences. This is in no small part due to the director, Wang Xiaoshuai's own upbringing. Like the Wu family, the Wang family was also originally from Shanghai and who moved to Guiyang due to the need to create an industrial third line of defense. This third line of defense was set away from cities and the seacoast, in order to protect China's industrial capability in case of a war against the Soviet Union. With the opening up of China in the 1980s, however, many of these urban exiles were given the opportunity to return home to the cities, even as their families had already laid down roots in their new homes. Wang has stated that he set the story in the 1980s in that it represented an era of transition, wherein the Cultural Revolution had ended, but much of the old ways were still ingrained in society. Plot The main character Qinghong is a 19-year-old student living with her overly repressive father, mother and younger brother in a typical small apartment. Her 'boyfriend' Honggen, a working local boy who plays only a minor role in the film and develops an obsession with Qihong to her father's contempt. Confiding in her best friend Xiao Zhen, Qinghong strives for love and independence. Qinghong's father Wu Zemin is a stubborn and aggressive man, who has never forgiven his wife for persuading him to move to rural Guiyang. He regularly meets with other 'Third Line' volunteers to discuss strategies for returning to Shanghai. He becomes increasingly strict with Qinghong, often following her home from school to ensure a restricted social life. He forbids her from seeing her 'boyfriend' Honggen, discourages her from spending time with Xiao Zhen and after discovering that she has sneaked out to an underground dance party confines her to the house. Xiao Zhen has meanwhile fallen for the local boy Lu Jun, the son of another 'Third Line' volunteer couple. Lu gets a local girl pregnant and is forced by his angry father to marry her. Soon after the wedding, though, he runs away with Xiao Zhen, causing panic in the local community. Honggen stalks Qinghong and she promises to meet him secretly one evening. She slips out of the house while her father hosts a meeting with other ‚ÄúThird Line‚Äù friends to discuss a plan to flee to Shanghai without official permission. When Qinghong tells Honggen that they cannot be together because her family will soon leave, the nervous Honggen loses control of himself and rapes her. Qinghong totters home, muddied and bleeding. Her father initially tries to retaliate by beating up Honggen at work, but subsequently alerts the police and has Honggen arrested. Traumatised, Qinghong attempts suicide. She is recovering when a sad and chastened Xiao Zhen returns to Guiyang. Very early one morning, as dawn is breaking, the Wu family boards a van for the drive to Shanghai. They are delayed in the streets of Guiyang by the crowds gathering to watch a round of public executions. Called out on loudspeaker are the names of those to be executed, with the last name called Honggen. Release in China Shanghai Dreams marks the first time Wang was given a wide degree of freedom by the Film Bureau in comparison to his previous films, notably Beijing Bicycle, which suffered from censorship woes. Wang has noted that authorities approached him after realizing that foreign blockbusters were slowly taking over the Chinese market. Wang was then asked to send in a 1000 word summary of the film, after which they asked to see the entire script; both requests were honored and neither was \\"softened\\" in Wang's words, as a means to test the openness of the \\"new\\" bureau. Wang noted that the film does not represent a \\"typical\\" Chinese film; as stated in an interview, Wang states: Nevertheless, the film was released in China theaters shortly after its premiere at Cannes. Awards The film premiered in the 2005 Cannes Film Festival as an official selection in competition for the Palme d'Or, and received the Jury Prize.

Background In 1533, Suleiman the Magnificent ordered Hayreddin Barbarossa, whom he had summoned from Algiers, to build a large war fleet in the arsenal of Constantinople.Crowley, p.56 Altogether 70 galleys were built during the winter of 1533‚Äì1534, manned by slave oarsmen, including 2,000 Jewish ones.Crowley, p.57 With this fleet, Barbarossa conducted aggressive raids along the coast of Italy, until he conquered Tunis on 16 August 1534, ousting the local ruler, theretofore subservient to the Spanish, Muley Hasan.Crowley, p.58Also known as Muleassen in Italy, and Abu-Abd-Allah-Mohammed-el-Hasan in Tunis. Il Palazzo di Fabrizio Colonna a Mezzocannone, article by Bartolommeo Capasso in Napoli nobilissima: rivista di topografia ed arte napoletana, Volumes 1‚Äì3, page 100-104. Barbarossa thus established a strong naval base in Tunis, which could be used for raids in the region, and on nearby Malta. Charles V, one of the most powerful men in Europe at the time, assembled a large army of some 30,000 soldiers, 74 galleys shipped in from Antwerp),Crowley, p.59 and 300 sailing ships, including the carrack Santa Anna and the Portuguese galleon S√£o Jo√£o Baptista, also known as Botafogo (the most powerful ship in the world at the time, with 366 bronze cannons) to drive the Ottomans from the region.Crowley, p.60 The expense involved for Charles V was considerable, and at 1,000,000 ducats was on par with the cost of Charles' campaign against Suleiman on the Danube.Crowley, p.62 Unexpectedly, the funding of the conquest of Tunis came from the galleons sailing in from the New World, in the form of a 2 million gold ducats treasure extracted by Francisco Pizarro in exchange for his releasing of the Inca king Atahualpa (whom he nevertheless executed on 29 August 1533). Despite a request by Charles V, Francis I denied French support to the expedition, explaining that he was under a 3-year truce with Barbarossa following the 1533 Ottoman embassy to France.Garnier, p. 94‚Äì95 Francis I was also under negotiations with Suleiman the Magnificent for a combined attack on Charles V, following the 1534 Ottoman embassy to France. Francis I only agreed to Pope Paul III's request that no fight between Christians occur during the time of the expedition.  Battle  On 1 June 1535, protected by a Genoese fleet, Charles V destroyed Barbarossa's fleet and, after a costly yet successful siege at La Goletta, captured Tunis. In the action, the Portuguese galleon Botafogo distinguished itself by breaking the chains protecting the harbour's entrance with its spur ram, thereafter opening fire on La Goletta. In the ruins, the Spanish found cannonballs with the French Fleur-de-lys mark, evidence of the contacts stemming from the Franco-Ottoman alliance. The resulting massacre of the city left an estimated 30,000 dead.A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East, Vol. II, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010), 506. Barbarossa managed to flee to Algiers with a troop of several thousand Turks. Muley Hasan was restored to his throne. The stench of the corpses was such that Charles V soon left Tunis and moved his camp to Rad√®s. The siege demonstrated the power projection of the Habsburg dynasties at the time; Charles V had under his control much of southern Italy, Sicily, Spain, the Americas, Austria, the Netherlands, and lands in Germany. Furthermore, he was Holy Roman Emperor and had de jure control over much of Germany as well. Ottoman defeat in Tunis motivated the Ottoman Empire to enter into a formal alliance with France against the Habsburg Empire. Ambassador Jean de La For√™t was sent to Constantinople, and for the first time was able to become permanent ambassador at the Ottoman court and to negotiate treaties.History of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey Ezel Kural Shaw p.97 Charles V celebrated a neo-classical triumph \\"over the infidel\\" at Rome on April 5, 1536 in commemoration of his victory at Tunis. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luys Peres Varga, fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defences between 1546 and 1550.  Aftermath  Barbarossa managed to escape to the harbour of B√¥ne, where a fleet was waiting for him. From there, he sailed to accomplish the Sack of Mahon, where he took 6,000 slaves and brought them to Algiers.E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam 1913‚Äì1936 by M. Th. Houtsma p.872 The Ottomans recaptured the city in 1574. However the Ottoman governors of Tunis were semi- autonomous Beys who acted as privateers against Christian shipping. Consequently, raiding in the Mediterranean continued until the French subjugated the region as a protectorate three centuries later in 1830 with an invasion leading to the creation of French Algeria, and the establishment of a protectorate over Tunisia in 1881.

E.) Gostelow (18 December 1866 ‚Äì 1944) was an Australian painter of flowers, birds and butterflies. Early life Gostelow was born in Sydney to Edward Gostelow and his second wife, Martha Taylor. His father had emigrated from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England to Sydney in 1848 at the age of six. In 1883, Gostelow entered the Education Department of New South Wales as a probationary pupil teacher. In 1887 he won a scholarship, one of only 15 candidates selected statewide. He was awarded the coveted scholarship to the Teachers' Training College and later was awarded the Blue Ribbon and took charge of the First Class Schools. After his apprenticeship in the city he took charge of country schools and over the next 20 years he spent his time in Nundle on the Great Dividing Range near Tamworth and in Condobolin, Warren, Harden, Cootamundra and Broken Hill, where he became headmaster of South Public School. Roaming the state of New South Wales he soon acquired a keen interest in all forms of nature study and, while imparting his love of bird life to his classes with coloured chalk on the blackboard, discovered his natural gift as an artist. Without formal training, Gostelow embarked on a project to paint as many wild flowers and birds as he could. In 1890, Gostelow married Ada Mary Finney with whom he had three sons and a daughter. His youngest son, Clifford, shared his father's passion for nature study and on his father's death he inherited the collection of native flora paintings. Acacia decurrens (Black wattle), Acacia oxycedrus 1922 In 1920 while Gostelow was in Broken Hill, the Barrier Field Naturalists Club held a wildflower show in the technical college. One of its purposes was to promote the study and protection of the area's wildflowers. The display included 150 botanical paintings by Gostelow. They were considered the highlight of the show. On retiring he reworked many of his earlier paintings to improve them as he considered them inaccurate. Gostelow also set out and achieved the huge task of painting all the known and recorded species of birds in Australia. The flame robin Petroica phoenicea 1931 His skill and integrity were well known and respected to the extent that the Australian Museum, amongst other institutions, loaned him stuffed birds from which he worked. His completed collection of 730 mostly life size paintings, illustrating the male and the female of each species with the flora native to their habitat also contained the Museum's registration number and explanatory notes. National Library Collection The complete collection of over 800 flora and fauna paintings is now held in the Pictures Collection, National Library of Australia, Canberra. The bird paintings were bequeathed to the Library on Gostelow's death. Clifford Gostelow donated his inherited collection of flora paintings to the Library in 1969. The collection is represented in For the Love of Nature: E.E. Gostelow's Birds and Flowers (2010). Many of Gostelow's images have been digitised by the National Library. A number of his bird pictures have also been included in two National Library poetry publications. Twelve Gostelow paintings are used to illustrate a revised version of Judith Wright's Birds (2003). Death E. E. Gostelow died in 1944 in the Sydney suburb of Burwood before he could complete his next project of painting all of Australia's butterflies.

Born to an impoverished petite noble family in the province of Imereti, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire), he was educated at the military schools of Kiev and Moscow (1880-1882). Returning to Georgia, he joined the Russian army. While serving in Batumi, he was close to the local intelligentsia and engaged in cultural activities. Deemed to be a non-reliable officer, he was forced to resign as a non-reliable officer during the Russian Revolution of 1905. During World War I, he was remobilized in the army and served on the Ottoman front. Following the 1917 February Revolution, he was demobilized and, sick and tired, returned to his native village. Kldiashvili‚Äôs best works belong to the first half of his life. He is said to have forgotten his Georgian while studying in Ukraine and to have had to relearn it. Nevertheless, he is regarded as an exemplary prose stylist with superb humor and gentler social satire. Since the 1880s, his translations and original works were regularly published in Georgian press. The first major novel, Solomon Morbeladze (·É°·Éù·Éö·Éù·Éõ·Éù·Éú ·Éõ·Éù·É†·Éë·Éî·Éö·Éê·É´·Éî) appeared in 1894, followed by Samanishvili's Step-Mother (·É°·Éê·Éõ·Éê·Éú·Éò·É®·Éï·Éò·Éö·Éò·É° ·Éì·Éî·Éì·Éò·Éú·Éê·É™·Éï·Éê·Éö·Éò, 1897), The Misfortunes of Kamushadze (·É•·Éê·Éõ·É£·É®·Éê·É´·Éò·É° ·Éí·Éê·É≠·Éò·É†·Éï·Éî·Éë·Éê, 1900), Rostom Mashvelidze (·É†·Éù·É°·É¢·Éù·Éõ ·Éõ·Éê·Éú·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éò·É´·Éî, 1910), and Bakula's Pigs (·Éë·Éê·Éô·É£·Éö·Éê·É° ·É¶·Éù·É†·Éî·Éë·Éò, 1920). His plays, especially Irine‚Äôs Happiness (·Éò·É†·Éò·Éú·Éî·É° ·Éë·Éî·Éì·Éú·Éò·Éî·É†·Éî·Éë·Éê, 1897) and The Misfortunes of Darispan (·Éì·Éê·É†·Éò·É°·Éû·Éê·Éú·Éò·É° ·Éí·Éê·É°·Éê·É≠·Éò·É†·Éò, 1903) resemble the French comedies of the 1840s only set in an Imeretian village at the turn of the 20th century. They are typically tragicomic impregnated with what the author himself referred to as \\"tears mixed with a smile\\". In the 1920s, Kldiashvili returned to writing and produced his memoirs On the Road of My Life (·É©·Éî·Éõ·Éò ·É™·ÉÆ·Éù·Éï·É†·Éî·Éë·Éò·É° ·Éí·Éñ·Éê·Éñ·Éî, 1925), as well as two new novellas published between 1924 and 1926.

He was one of the last members of the Franco-Flemish school, in the closing days of the Renaissance period in music history, and was a prolific composer; however most of his music was lost in the destruction by fire of the library of John IV during the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. Life He was born in Arras, in present-day France, around 1561. Presumably he received his early training there or nearby, and his talent was sufficient for him to be brought in 1572 to Spain to sing in the choir of Philip II in Madrid. Boys were often recruited from the Low Countries to become singers in the imperial chapel; the numerous cathedral schools in the towns of northern France and the Netherlands provided a rich environment from which the Habsburgs could cherry-pick the best musicians. Rogier became assistant director of the capilla flamenca in 1584, chaplain by 1586, and director of music at the court of Philip in 1586 on the death of the previous director, George de La H√®le. Sometime before 1595 he also became a priest.Wagner/Kirk, Grove online Rogier accumulated honors as well, in the form of benefices and prebends; he also received a rich pension from the Bishop of L√©on. He died in 1596 in Madrid, asking in his will that his assistant and fellow northerner, G√©ry de Ghersem, see to the publication of five of his masses. By the time he published them, the dedicatee Philip II had himself died, so he dedicated them to Philip III instead. Ghersem also added one of his own masses to the collection ‚Äì the only one of his numerous works to survive to the present day complete. Music and influence More of Rogier's music remains than that of his compatriot G√©ry de Ghersem. While most was destroyed in 1755 when the enormous library of John IV burned during the Lisbon earthquake, some had successfully been disseminated through publication or manuscript transmission; some of his work appears in manuscript in places as distant as Mexico (some manuscript psalm settings survive in the archives of Puebla Cathedral). Rogier wrote both sacred and secular music, but as expected for a composer active in the royal chapel of a deeply religious monarch during the Counter-Reformation, the majority of it is sacred. Two instrumental pieces, possibly arrangements of vocal works, have survived as well. Of the 243 compositions listed in John IV's library catalogue (compiled in Lisbon in 1649), 36 motets, 7 masses, 4 chansons, 4 psalm verse settings, and two presumably instrumental compositions (since they are textless, and appear in collections for instrumental performance) have survived. His published masses are for from four to six voices; one in manuscript exists in two versions, with one for eight and the other for twelve independent voice parts. Stylistically they recall music written fifty years before, particularly the elaborate polyphonic style of Nicolas Gombert, another member of the Habsburg chapel. Rogier's motets are also in the Franco-Flemish style of mid-century. His secular music, on the other hand, shows some progressive features that anticipate the Spanish music of the early 17th century, for example with their frequent use of syncopation. Rogier was long a highly regarded composer, as shown by a laudatory reference in a poem, Laurel de Apolo by Lope de Vega, written in 1630 ‚Äì more than three decades after his death. His music was published in places as distant as Madrid, Antwerp, and Naples. NotesReferences  *Allan W. Atlas, Renaissance Music: Music in Western Europe, 1400‚Äì1600. New York, W.W.

These designs include the straight-pull bolt-action M1893 and M1894 rifles, and Mexico's first self- loading rifle, the M1908 - the first of the designs to see combat use. Straight-pull bolt-action rifles Mondrag√≥n began working on his initial rifle design in 1891. During his stay in Belgium, he filed a patent application for which he had received a grant on March 23, 1892 (No. 98,947). Mondrag√≥n was granted a further Patent on April 20, 1892 from the French Patent Office (No. 221,035). He also filed for a Patent for his design with the United States Patent Office on February 8th, 1893, which was granted on March 24, 1896 (No. 557,079). The rifle, referred to as model M1893, was of a straight-pull, bolt action design, chambered in the 6.5x48mm cartridge (also developed by Mondrag√≥n), with a fixed magazine which held an 8-round en-bloc clip.Hughes, James B. (1968). Mexican Military Arms: The Cartridge Period 1866-1967. Houston: Deep River Armory. pp. 19. The rifle operated with three settings: \\"A\\" (safe), \\"L\\" (normal operation), and \\"R\\" (rapid). The \\"automatic\\" fire setting allowed the rifle to fire a cartridge each time the bolt was manually cycled to closed position, in similar fashion to Winchester M1897 pump action shotgun. The rifle could be equipped with a knife bayonet, measuring and , or a blade-type bayonet of length. At the time of the rifle's design, Mexico did not have any manufacturers capable of producing them to the required tolerances. Mondrag√≥n, with the backing of Diaz, subsequently entrusted the Swiss Industrial Company (Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft) of Neuhausen, Switzerland with the production of the rifles. SIG received the first order for 50 rifles in 1893, and a second order for 200 rifles followed in 1894. The rifles from the second order were chambered in the 5.2 √ó 68mm round developed by Swiss colonel Eduard Rubin, and were referred to as the model M1894 (to differentiate them from the versions chambered in the 6.5mm cartridge). Self-loading rifle Mondrag√≥n continued his work, and on August 8, 1904 he filed a patent application (No. 219,989) for his new design for a self-loading rifle. The Patent (No. 853,715) was granted on May 14, 1907. The design was adopted by the Mexican Army in 1908 as the Fusil Porfirio D√≠az Sistema Mondrag√≥n Modelo 1908. The same year, the Mexican government contracted with SIG for the production of 4,000 M1908 rifles, chambered in the 7√ó57mm Mauser Mexican service cartridge. Due to the Mexican Revolution, by 1910 only 400 rifles had been delivered by SIG. The rifle's inability to cope with the poor quality of ammunition available at the time, along with the high unit cost of SFr160 per rifle, led to the cancellation of the order by the Mexican government. The Mondrag√≥n Modelo 1908 was a gas-operated rifle with a rotating bolt using a cylinder and piston arrangement, a design considered unusual at the time. The bolt was locked by lugs in helical grooves in the receiver. A switch, located on the charging handle, would disengage the bolt from the gas system, allowing the firearm to effectively operate as a straight-pull bolt-action rifle. The Mondrag√≥n Modelo 1908 rifles were fitted with a bipod. In addition to the knife bayonet introduced with the previous rifles, Mondrag√≥n designed a spade bayonet for use with the Modelo 1908, Hughes, James B. (1968) Mexican Military Arms: The Cartridge Period 1866‚Äì1967. Houston: Deep River Armory. p. 52 for which he filed a patent application (No. 631,283) on June 6, 1911. Use during World War I In 1914 the German Empire bought the remainder of the M1908 model rifles produced by SIG (as many as 4000 units, depending on the total SIG production for their Mexican contract). The Germans tried to modify the rifles to chamber the 7.9√ó57mm S-Patrone, the service cartridge of Germany until the end of World War II), but their attempts were unsuccessful. The rifles were tested by the German Army, but they proved highly susceptible to fouling caused by mud and dirt in the trenches, a common problem even with less complex designs such as the Canadian Ross Mk III straight-pull bolt-action rifle.Fitzsimons, Bernard (1978). Illustrated Encyclopedia of Weapons and Warfare, Volume 20. London: Phoebus Publishing Company. p. 2223. The Imperial German Flying Corps (Luftstreitkr√§fte) decided to adopt the rifle, where operating conditions lessened the chances of the action being fouled by mud, and issued two rifles to each aircraft's crew. The M1903 proved to be a significant improvement over the bolt-action Gewehr 98 rifles and Parabellum-Pistole pistols usually issued entirely to naval avation to crews. The M1908 rifle was re-designated as the Fl.-S.-K. 15 (Flieger-Selbstladekarabiner, Modell 1915 - Aviator's Selfloading Carbine, Model 1915) and was issued with 30-round drum magazines. The drum magazine issued with the Fl.-S.-K. 15 was that designed and patented by Friedrich Blum,Walter, John (2003). Military Rifles of Two World Wars. London: Greenhill Books. p. 69. with a later 32-round version of the drum magazine (Trommelmagazin 08) that had been designed for the 1913 Parabellum-Pistole (LP 08). The corps used the Mondrag√≥n rifle until a sufficient number of machine guns equipped with a synchronization gear became available, after which the M1908 was phased out of service and given to the navy. Very few of the Mondrag√≥n rifles survived the war, although almost all of the rifles were still in use by the Imperial German Navy when the First World War ended. The usage of the Mondrag√≥n in the German Imperial Navy would involve destroyer crews and Seabattlions Pioneers being entirely issued Mondrag√≥n and pistol carbinesWalter, John (2006). The Rifle Story: An Illustrated History from 1756 to the Present Day. London: Greenhill Books. p. 192. In Switzerland, the Mondrag√≥n self-loading rifle was modified to use the 7.5√ó55mm Swiss cartridge, came equipped with a 12-round magazine and a H√ºlsenfangkorb (a device to collect the ejected cartridges). The Mondrag√≥n rifle was also briefly installed in the World War I era two-seater aircraft, the H√§feli DH and the Bl√©riot, however it was soon replaced by other fully automatic weapons.  Additional notes A few of the Mondrag√≥n rifles may have been used by Mexican soldiers during an ambush on Pancho Villa.http://media.liveauctiongroup.net/i/14389/14554592_3.jpg?v=8CF99F84CB579B0 Although some sources claim that the Mexican Army had used the rifle since 1911,Hatcher, Julian S. (1957). Hatcher's Notebook, 2nd Edition. Harrisburg: Telegraph Press. p. 157. two pictures from Cr√≥nica Ilustrada Revoluci√≥n Mexicana, Volume 1 on pages 100 and 159 and an article from Guns magazine suggest that the rifle was in service as early as 1910.

It was originally dubbed the 'Joy Covered Bridge', as the bridge connected Cleveland with the nearby community of Joy. The bridge was restored by the Blount County Commission in 1979. After the 385-foot Nectar Covered Bridge (also located in Blount County) burned down in 1993, the Swann Covered Bridge became the longest covered bridge existing in Alabama. It is one of 3 historic covered bridges remaining in Blount County. After a routine inspection, the Swann Covered Bridge was closed in 2009 due to unsafe conditions along with nearby Easley Covered Bridge. The Horton Mill Covered Bridge was already closed as a result of vandalism which occurred in 2007. Restoration of all three bridges began in late 2011. Money for these projects primarily came from the federal National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation Program as well as transportation enhancement funds. The $469,110 construction contract was awarded to Bob Smith Construction of Trussville, Alabama. The Swann Covered Bridge would be the first of the three to be restored. Wooden structural pieces were repaired or replaced as needed and new tin roofs were put on all three bridges in order to keep the weather off vital supporting timbers. Total restoration costs for the covered bridges was approximately $540,000. The difference was covered by county expenditures. Following necessary repairs and upgrades, the Swann Covered Bridge was reopened to motor vehicle traffic on October 22, 2012.

Facilities The main building (with ambulatory entrance) is named Stephen Roman Wing. The hospital has a helipad located on the southside of the hospital facing Paxton Street and located west of the south parking lot. The helipad allows patients to be transferred to other hospitals for more advance care not available at the Port Perry site or patients arriving to Port Perry other than regular ambulances.

The Last Glacial Maximum and sea-level minimum occurred c. 21,000 years before present (BP). Antarctic ice cores show gradual warming beginning 3000 years later. At about 14,700 BP, there was a large pulse of meltwater, identified as Meltwater pulse 1A,The output of Meltwater pulse 1A has been calculated at 1,000,000 L/s. probably from either the Antarctic ice sheet or the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Meltwater pulse 1A produced a marine transgression that raised global sea level about 20 meters in two to five centuries and is thought to have influenced the start of the B√∏lling/Aller√∏d interstadial, the major break with glacial cold in the Northern Hemisphere. Meltwater pulse 1A was followed in Antarctica and the Southern Hemisphere by a renewed cooling, the Antarctic Cold Reversal, in c. 14,500 BP,. which lasted for two millennia -- an instance of warming causing cooling.For a similar warming/cooling instance, see 8.2 kiloyear event. The ACR brought an average cooling of perhaps 3 ¬∞C.

It is approved and recognized by the National Education Ministry, based on act 759 from May 6 of 1971. The university's main campus is located in El Poblado, Medell√≠n. It has additional campuses in Bogot√°, Pereira and Llanogrande Rionegro (Antioquia). It is considered one of the top tier universities in Colombia by QS Rankings and MIDE.Top 10 Universities in ColombiaTop universities History Universidad EAFIT was founded in 1960 by a group of entrepreneurs in Medell√≠n. Its main goal was to educate professionals who would address new challenges in management, finance, and technology. EAFIT started as a \\"School of Management and Finance.\\" Two-year technological programs were offered when its Institute of Technology division was created. The institution organized itself as a university in 1975, when it started offering five-year programs in engineering. Professor Javier Toro Mart√≠nez was the first rector with a group of 59 students in the school of Business Administration. The Textile Technology, Industrial Programming and Mechanic faculties were opened in 1962. In 1996 EAFIT opened its first branch outside of Medell√≠n in Llanogrande, Rionegro, offering degrees in Business Administration, Civil Engineering, and Systems Engineering. Biblioteca Luis Echavarr√≠a Villegas: EAFIT library. The School of Social Sciences and Humanities was opened in 1997, adding new disciplines to an educational center that had been primarily dedicated to Economics. The subsequent creation of the School of Music increased the number of programs in the Arts and Sciences. The Product Design Engineering and Law faculties were then created in 1999. This was followed by the creation of the Mathematics Engineering undergraduate program in 2002, the first of its kind in Colombia. Three new departments were added in 2004: Engineering Physics, Social Communication and Political Science. That same year the administration made the decision to rename the campus as \\"Park University\\" (Universidad Parque), adding ecological grounds that include a large lake, woods, and an unpaved parking area. Dr. Juan Luis Mej√≠a's goal was to integrate the university with the urban background of the city, while at the same time improving and protecting its natural environment. The project was awarded the Premio L√°piz de Acero (Steel Pen Award) from the Proyecto Dise√±o magazine of Medell√≠n in the \\"Public Spaces\\" category. Recently added disciplines include majors in Psychology and Marketing, both established in 2011. Future offerings include programs in Biology and Sound Engineering.  High Quality of Institutional Accreditation  Since the process of accreditation started in Colombia in 2003, only 15 Colombian universities have earned a high quality accreditation. EAFIT was given its first institutional accreditation for a period of six years in 2003. In March, 2010, that accreditation was renewed for eight years. All of its undergraduate programs are accredited as \\"high quality.\\" Five of EAFIT's graduate programs earned a high quality accreditation.

The area was located east of Creighton University from Douglas Street six blocks north to Cass Street and from the Missouri River west to Sixteenth Street, centered around the area currently containing Pioneer Courage Park. It was the location of several notorious brothels, with more than 100 establishments employing 1,600 sex workers.Bristow, D. (1997) A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tales of 19th Century Omaha. Caxton Press. Particularly popular during a depression which struck Omaha in the 1890s, the Burnt District was a predecessor of Tom Dennison's Sporting District.Peattie, E.W. (2005) p. 75. Omaha's Burnt District was a particular area of downtown where most of the city's brothels were located. The most notorious of the brothels was called \\"the Cribs\\", and consisted of rows of shacks with alleyways filled with young girls. Contemporary estimates placed the number of sex workers at over 1,600 women. A man named M. F. Martin owned several of the properties in the Burnt District. The brothels did not work in secret; there were actually large windows through which observers could peer into the acts going on therein. A businessman owned this district with large returns on his investment. Bribes were regularly given to local city leaders, policemen, and judges. The existence of prostitution on this scale was justified by the Christian community as a necessary evil; it was thought the district would help protect \\"good\\" women from sexual assault like a sewer that drains moral impurity from the Christian world. The impact of these areas contributed to heavy corruption, terrible abuse of women and children, abortions, suicides, and 30% of the men in the city of Omaha had a sexually transmitted disease. These areas existed for over 20 years before they were successfully shut down. An Episcopalian minister from Rochester, New York was popular throughout Omaha for his missionary work within the Burnt District. Reverend Dr. Ramsey founded a chapel for prostitutes, ensuring the regular attendance of former prostitutes on a weekly basis.Crapsey, A.S. (2003) Last of the Heretics. Kessinger Publishing. p. 170.

The southern terminus is at PA 435 and at an interchange with Interstate 380 (I-380) near Gouldsboro. The northern terminus is at U.S. Route 6 (US 6) in Palmyra Township. PA 507 runs southwest- northeast as a two-lane undivided through forests in the upper reaches of the Pocono Mountains, with the northern section nearly parallel to Lake Wallenpaupack. The route passes through Gouldsboro before it crosses PA 196 in Angels. In Newfoundland, PA 507 and PA 191 run concurrent for about and intersect the north end of PA 447. After splitting from PA 191, the route has an interchange with I-84 and a junction with the northern terminus of PA 390 before ending at US 6. PA 507 was designated between US 611 (now PA 435) west of Gouldsboro and US 6 in Tafton in 1928. The route was fully paved by the 1930s and has remained on the same alignment since. Route description PA 507 begins at PA 435 and I-380 in Coolbaugh Township, Monroe County, heading northeast on a two-lane undivided road. From the terminus, Coolbaugh Road continues southwest. A short distance later, the road enters Lehigh Township in Wayne County and becomes Main Street, running through dense forests with some homes to the north of Gouldsboro State Park. PA 507 curves to the east and heads through wooded areas of homes, entering the community of Gouldsboro, where it crosses a Delaware‚ÄìLackawanna Railroad line. The road continues north-northeast through dense forests with some private residential developments. The route heads into Dreher Township and becomes Millcreek Road, coming to an intersection with PA 196 in Angels. PA 507 continues northeast through more forests with some housing developments, curving east and coming to an intersection with PA 191. Here, the route turns north to form a concurrency with PA 191, heading north on Main Street through wooded areas with some fields and homes to the west of Wallenpaupack Creek. The road curves to the north-northeast and intersects the northern terminus of PA 447 in Newfoundland. The two routes pass through rural residential and commercial development before PA 191 splits to the northwest and PA 507 heads northeast as Lake Wallenpaupack Road. PA 507 approaching the intersection with PA 196 in Dreher Township PA 507 crosses the Wallenpaupack Creek into Greene Township, Pike County, running through woodland with some development and turning to the north-northwest. The road heads to the north and comes to an interchange with I-84. Following this interchange, the route runs through forests, turning to the northeast. PA 507 continues into Palmyra Township and heads through forested areas of private residential developments on the southeast shore of Lake Wallenpaupack. The road winds northeast along the lakeshore, passing through Paupack and coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 390 near Tafton. Past this, PA 507 continues north through wooded residential development to the east of the lake, reaching its northern terminus at an intersection with US 6. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the present-day corridor of PA 507 was designated as part of Legislative Route 168 between the border of Lackawanna and Wayne counties and Gouldsboro and as Legislative Route 254 between Gouldsboro and Tafton. PA 507 was designated in 1928 to run from US 611 (now PA 435) west of Gouldsboro northeast to US 6 in Tafton. At this time, the route was paved between US 611 and PA 90 (now PA 191) near Newfoundland and for a short stretch to the north of Newfoundland. By 1930, PA 507 was paved between PA 90 north of Newfoundland and PA 790 in Greentown along with a small section near Lake Wallenpaupack. The entire length of the route was paved during the 1930s. In 1969, an interchange with I-81E (now I-380) was built with US 611 near the southern terminus of PA 507, at which point US 611 headed south along the freeway. An interchange between I-84 and PA 507 was completed in 1968 and opened to traffic in the 1970s.

It is notable for being one of the first video games licensed by Major League Baseball, although it was not endorsed by the Major League Baseball Players Association. Without the backing of the Players Association, the game could not name the actual players, although it was able to use their numbers, thus accurately portraying the contemporary teams and their rosters. In doing so, it became the first baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System to carry official Major League Baseball licensing and lineups. Major League Baseball was developed by Atlus and published by LJN. It featured many facets of realistic gameplay and a focus on managerial details, which stressed the importance of choosing a well-balanced team. Despite its graphical limitations, it was considered a three-dimensional game at the time and was featured in the first issue of Nintendo Power as compared the system's other baseball games of the era. Development Lineup selection screen. In 1988 Atlus signed on to develop an \\"official\\" Major League Baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, which would be a first for that particular console. American company LJN agreed to be the publisher and David Rolfe was brought on board as the game's programmer. Rolfe had previously worked with Activision and Intellivision. Gameplay Officially licensed by Major League Baseball, the game features all twenty-six teams that existed in 1987. Additionally, the lineups and the player numbers are accurate to the team rosters that year. Since the game did not have the endorsement of the Major League Baseball Players Association at the time, the team members are only listed by number, not name. In addition to their numbers the players are represented by their statistics, abilities, throwing arm, and even placement in the batting order. 1988's Major League Baseball was therefore the first NES game to be officially endorsed by Major League Baseball and to feature accurate contemporary lineups, albeit without the actual player names attached to their numbers. A Toronto Blue Jays player prepares to bunt. Managerial decisions are a focus and game players are allowed to select their own lineups, although the game lacks Sabermetrics statistics due to the limitations of the era. Instead, the \\"manager\\" must make their decisions based on data such as player's average and home run totals. They also have the ability to change and decide who will be a pinch-hitter and who will be a substitute pitcher. One is even allowed to pick out a designated hitter. The game prohibits one from putting out more team members in a certain part of the field than would normally be allowed, which makes deciding which player will be used where a part of the experience. There are three modes that can be played with teams from either the American League or the National League: regular season games, All-star games or the World Series (interleague). The World Series rounds, however, are only one match each, which is not accurate to the real World Series. Due to the licensing, the teams even appear complete in their official uniforms and colours and also have all the options that a real baseball player would have, including bunting, pitching out, base stealing and throwing errors. Gameplay limitations In Major League Baseball, the pitcher is unable to move around the pitcher's mound and many are also able to perform the feat of pitches. The ball's physics have been called into question, with the ball stopping on a dime after three or less bounces. The game's camera system does not function properly and, when a ball is hit, the outfield camera follows the ball looking upwards, making it impossible for the game player to see where their fielders are. The ball can also be thrown and get stuck in the well between the stands and the field on an overthrow of a baseman and cause inside the park home runs, which would not happen within a real game (in that case a ground rule double and/or error would be scored instead). Another bug allows players to go into the stands past the wall with the ball if they enter at certain points in foul territory. Each baseman is also controlled individually, allowing for user error in certain situations where a running baseman will be called out if the baseman ahead of them remains at their last base if the player fails to advance them. There are also gameplay issues when the player takes their turn to bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box. Technology=Graphics grand slam does not display any alternate screen from a home run. The graphics themselves were considered to be three- dimensional given the constraints of the technology at the time. All the players are Caucasian and each one's batting stance is exactly the same. The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with the team members represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where the players are on base. Although the official colors are intact, the actual symbols on their uniforms are absent. The crowd is represented by a series of colored dots, while the dugouts are represented by plain white parallelograms. Music and sound effects There are a limited number of effects and, aside from brief ballpark jingles, there is no real background music present during the game. For example, the charge fanfare is played at random points and the introductory screen begins with a different baseball tune while the player is loading up and selecting his team, along with a home run fanfare. Generic sound effects include the bat cracking upon contact with the ball, the sound of the ball flying through the air during a pitch, bouncing and throwing effects, and a stream of crowd noises. Reception Major League Baseball was featured in the first issue of Nintendo Power and compared to R.B.I. Baseball and Bases Loaded, although the magazine did not pass any judgment on which game was superior. Allgame rated it three stars out of five. The Los Angeles Times noted the game was a leading seller.

Then in the 2012‚Äì13 season, Carmichael had his first action against Walsall on 29 September 2012, coming on as a substitute for Josh McQuoid in the 59th minutes, which Bournemouth lost 2‚Äì1. Carmichael made the starting XI for the first time on 2 October 2012 in a 3‚Äì1 away defeat by Crawley Town. He went on to make three appearance for the club. Despite this limited number, Carmichael said he was satisfied to be involved in the first team action. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, with his first team hopes increasingly limited following the club's promotion to Championship, he spent much of the season in the club's reserve before joining Gosport Borough on a month-long loan in February. Carmichael made his first start for the club against Havant & Waterlooville and helped the club go through to the FA Trophy final. After the match, Stephen Purches praised his performance, as well as his strength of character. As a result, his loan spell was extended for another month., Carmichael, despite starting, was unable to help Gosport Borough in the 4-0 FA Trophy loss against Cambridge United. After his loan spell at Gosport Borough came to an end, Carmichael continued to remain on the sideline at Bournemouth before joining Welling United on a month loan. Carmichael made 4 appearances for Welling before returning to his parent club. Despite a failed loan move to Havant & Waterlooville, Carmichael signed a 12-month contract extension weeks later. To open the 2015‚Äì2016 season, he joined National League side Torquay United on a one-month youth loan. He made his Torquay United debut two days later, playing 90 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 win over Macclesfield Town, and scored his first Torquay United goal in the next game against Wrexham With seven appearances in August, hopes of Carmichael's loan at Torquay United was extended until January. After making fourteen appearances, Carmichael returned to his parent at the end of December, but did not play any official football for the rest of the campaign. At the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season, it was confirmed on the club's website that Carmichael was among six players to be released by the club. Carmichael signed for Weymouth on 30 June 2017 International career Though he was born in Poole, England, Carmichael was eligible to play for Scotland. This came after he was called up by Scotland U16 in 2009. Four years later, Carmichael was called up by Scotland U19. Personal life Carmichael attended Poole Grammar School with his classmate, Harry Cornick and supported Bournemouth when he was young.

These inscribed stone blocks are now in the Sulaymaniyah Museum; the field only contains the stones that were used in the construction of the tower.

In desperation, financier Richard Gresham (Edward Arnold), who is planning to issue $50 million in Taronian bonds, hires unemployed lookalike actress Nancy Lane (Sidney again) to impersonate the princess, and offers her a large bonus if she changes the mind of the chief opponent of the financial transaction, newspaper publisher Porter Madison III (Cary Grant).

Meyer Levin of Esquire remarking that the director was \\"no man for comedy\\", and Cy Caldwell of New Outlook calling it a \\"jolly and amusing romantic comedy\\" in which Grant, Edward Arnold, Vince Barnett and others \\"render good support\\". Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times wrote, \\"This amiable light affair has a generous share of imaginative turns, and it is further endowed with a highly competent supporting cast.\\" Grant biographer Geoffrey Wansell notes that Grant was \\"required to do little more than spend most of his time wearing white tie and tails.\\" He states that some of the more scathing reviews of the film \\"infuriated\\" Grant and that he subsequently demanded to choose his own roles.

The story was included in Malamud's first collection of short stories, The Magic Barrel, published in 1958. Plot summary Kessler used to be an egg candler, and is living alone in a cheap apartment located on the top floor of a decrepit tenement building on the East Side of New York City. He‚Äôd had a family but he outgrew them. Thirty years have passed and Kessler had made no attempt to see them. In turn, his family hadn‚Äôt seen him, yet it didn‚Äôt bother him much. Kessler lived in the apartment for ten years, but he remained relatively unknown to the building's occupants. It was the tenement janitor, Ignace, who knew Kessler best. He had been up to the apartment on occasion to play two-handed pinochle with Kessler, but grew tired of losing and stopped going up to see him. Ignace uses his free time to complain to his wife about the condition of Kessler's apartment and spreads rumors about Kessler to the other tenants. One day Ignace and Kessler have a mundane quarrel and after a horrid exchange of words, Ignace runs and complains to his wife. He takes his complaints further by telling the story to Gruber, the tenement landlord. Gruber knew his janitor was exaggerating, but tells Ignace to give Kessler notice. That same night, he visits Kessler to give him notice to leave. Ignace is forced to speak through the door, noting that no one wants Kessler around. Nonetheless, on December 1, Ignace finds Kessler's rent in his mailbox. After Gruber sees it, he becomes furious and forces way into Kessler's apartment. Gruber, agitated with Kessler, threatens to call in the city marshal to remove him. When Kessler tries to reason and plead with the landlord, Gruber vehemently belittles Kessler, comparing his flat to a toilet. Kessler pleads his innocence, citing he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt do nothing‚Äù and he ‚Äúwill stay here.‚Äù However, his words fall on deaf ears and Gruber insists that he will toss Kessler out on the street after the fifteenth of December. On December 15, Ignace finds the twelve-fifty Gruber had given Kessler in his mailbox. After Ignace phones Gruber, Gruber exclaims that he will get a dispossess. He instructs Ignace write a note stating that Kessler's money was refused and asks him to slide it under the door. The following day Kessler received a copy of his eviction notice asking that he appear in court in order to plead his case against the requested eviction. The notice scares him because he had never been to court in his life, and the fear keeps him from showing up on the ordered day. On the same afternoon he is physically removed from the premises. Kessler sat outside, and people stared at him as he stared at nothing. The Italian woman, upon seeing him, shrieks uncontrollably. This action startles the neighbors and when they discover Kessler sitting outside, they gather and take Kessler and his belongings back to his apartment while Ignace stands aside screaming various obscenities. The Italian woman later sends food to Kessler. Ignace tells Gruber of the incident and Gruber later enters Kessler's apartment finding him sitting on the bed. Gruber asks why Kessler is still there in the apartment. Kessler stays quiet, and Gruber explains to Kessler that if he stays his situation will worsen. Kessler questions Gruber's motivation to evict him from the premises‚Ä¶ :\\"What did I do to you?\\" He bitterly wept. \\"Who throws out of his house a man that he lived there ten years and pays every month on time his rent? What did I do, tell me? Who hurts a man without a reason? Are you a Hitler or a Jew?\\" He was hitting his chest with his fist.\\" Gruber listens but explains his position, revealing that his building is falling apart and his bills are high. If tenants don‚Äôt take care of their place then they must go. Acting on the information he has received from Ignace, Gruber tells Kessler he doesn‚Äôt take care of his place and he fights with the janitor. It is for these reasons that Kessler must go. Gruber decides to speak with Kessler once more to offer a more civilized solution. He would offer to put Kessler into a public home. When he enters the apartment he discovers Kessler sitting on the bedroom floor. For the first time, Gruber manages to speak to Kessler in calm, pleasant tone and explains his proposal but Kessler wasn‚Äôt listening. Kessler sat quietly examining his past life, and is filled with miserable regret. Gruber, frightened at Kessler's state of emotions, starts to reconsider his position and thinks he ought to allow the old man to stay. But then he sees Kessler engaged in the act of mourning and senses something is wrong. His first impulse is to run out of the apartment, however, he envisions himself tumbling five flights to his death and groans at the vision of himself lying lifeless at the bottom. Gruber realizes he is still in the room with Kessler, listening to him pray. He assumes maybe Kessler has received bad news or someone has died, but suddenly senses that perhaps the ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù in question might actually be him. Characters Kessler ‚Äì He is an old man living alone. He had abandoned his family and does not interact well with others. The Hoffmans ‚Äì a sullen, childless German couple living on one side of Kessler who never bother to say hello or exchange a pleasant greeting with him. The wizened Italian woman and her three sons ‚Äì An Italian family living on the opposite side of Kessler who, just like the Hoffmans, don't say hello or exchange pleasantries. Ignace ‚Äì The janitor. This name is symbolic to the story as it a derivative form of the Latin ignis (fire). Gruber ‚Äì The landlord. The last name Gruber is a nickname from the inflected form of Yiddish dialect grub or coarser grubber jung, meaning ‚Äòrude, impolite.‚Äô Themes The theme of bleakness is highly prevalent in many of Malamud's works. Malamud describes the Hoffmans as a sullen, childless German couple, emphasizing they don't smile much. Malamud uses words which don't evoke pleasant thoughts. Kessler's flat, for instance is described as resembling a ‚Äúfilthy flat with its junky furniture.‚Äù Gruber even tells Kessler his apartment ‚Äúlooks like a junk shop and smells like a toilet.‚Äù Kessler isn‚Äôt characterized in the most pleasant manner either. He is referred to as a ‚Äúdirty old man‚Äù and ‚Äúdirty old bum‚Äù and later described as a ‚Äúcorpse adjusting his coffin lid‚Äù when he opens the door to his apartment. The narrator also reveals that Kessler's ‚Äúeyes were reddened, his cheeks sunken, and his wisp of beard moved agitatedly.‚Äù Other items are described with negative adjectives like ‚Äúsoiled,‚Äù ‚Äúoily,‚Äù or ‚Äúyellowed,‚Äù presenting a dull picture for the reader. Thus a reader doesn‚Äôt perceive anything pleasant or warm in this story. A highly valued theme in this short story is responsibility. According to professor Irving Halperin, responsibility is \\"the moral imperative for a person to respond responsibly to humanity in another.\\" Malamud had employed this theme in other works, but it is found most prominently in \\"The Mourners.\\" Halperin notes \\"Kessler's question, \\"Are you a Hitler or a Jew?\\", underscores the story's theme\\" of personal responsibility p. 464\\\\. Gruber had a choice to continuing acting as the rude tormentor or accept the responsibility of aiding his tenant. However, he fails to answer the question and therefore becomes blind in the name of responsibility. Consequently, the words may have entered into Gruber's consciousness because he does later choose to listen Kessler and does ponder the responsibility of getting Kessler into a public home. The act of responsibility also overcomes the sons of the Italian woman as well as other neighbors who once shunned Kessler. The sight of Kessler sitting outside in the snow was so harrowing that they feel compelled to carry him and his belonging back inside to his apartment. The narrator allows readers a glimpse into Kessler's thoughts near the end of the story, as he reflects on his past life. Heavily saddened, Kessler recognizes that he shirked his responsibility of staying with his family no matter his fate. This theme of responsibility reaches its peak at the end of the story as both Kessler and Gruber have fully recognized their faults and find that the only ones responsible are themselves.

Prince Leopold, son of Queen Victoria, showing his left hand pinky rings worn in a typical stacked fashion, circa 1878. A pinky ring is a ring worn on the little finger of either hand, which is also called the \\"fifth finger\\". Professional rings A variety of pinky rings are awarded to graduating engineering students in North America, generally intended to serve as a reminder of the significance and impact of their chosen profession. In Canada, these include the Iron Ring, made of either crudely worked iron or stainless steel and worn on the dominant hand, presented to engineering students during the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer, and the silver, but otherwise similar Earth Ring, associated with the geologists and geophysicists of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta. In the United States, the Engineer's Ring, awarded by the Order of the Engineer, is similar to the Canadian Iron Ring. Human ecology and home economics graduates also receive a pinky ring symbolizing their profession. The Human Ecology Ring was first instigated by a group of young graduates at Macdonald College, Quebec, in 1968. Indications of affiliation or conveying messages At times, pinky rings have been worn with the intent to convey a message or indicate affiliation. During the Victorian era, both single men and women uninterested in pursuing marriage could wear a ring on the little finger of their left hand. Especially in the United States, pinky rings also developed an association with criminal activity. Grifters were thought to wear such rings, sometimes to provide their associates with a source of funding for their funeral expenses in case of their death, as were made men in the American Mafia. Movies such as Little Caesar and The Godfather contributed to the association of this style of jewellery with organized crime. Fashion The more modern use of the pinky ring has weakened its traditional historic symbolism. In the early 20th century, these rings were popular in Parisian fashion, especially among the youth. In the United States, such rings have become a \\"fundamental of American style\\", in some way due to its symbolic past. Signet and wedding rings FDR as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, 1913. Note, since he is recently married, he has his wedding band stacked beneath his father's Roosevelt Family signet ring. He would wear this stacked British-style configuration to the end of his life. Pliny the Elder noted, according to the 1938 Loeb Classical Library translation by Harris Rackham, \\"Some people put all their rings on their little finger only, while others wear only one ring even on that finger, and use it to seal up their signet ring, which is kept stored away as a rarity not deserving the insult of common use, and is brought out from its cabinet as from a sanctuary; thus even wearing a single ring on the little finger may advertise the possession of a costlier piece of apparatus put away in store.\\" Some British men wear a signet ring on the little finger of the left hand, which is considered to be the correct place for it. In common with many American families, in homage to the British tradition, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wore a signet ring handed down to him by his father James, and which was inherited by FDR's son James Roosevelt. All three generations wore the signet on top of their wedding bands, on their left pinkies. FDR's pinky signet was noted and admired by Sir Winston Churchill (who wore his own gold signet on a different finger). Wedding bands (always a gift from wife to husband) were usually worn by Western men in the Victorian age on the left hand pinky finger, although few British men wore wedding rings until World War II. Because of masculine limitations, men were encouraged to wear a second ring if they desired, but it was to be worn on top of the wedding band so as to keep both rings confined to one finger. It appears the custom for men to wear their two rings on the left pinky was purely British and German; in America, men either followed the British tradition or wore no ring at all until much later. Use in the British Royal Family The use of the left-hand pinky finger as the wedding ring and royal signet or initial ring of the British Royal Family is an ironclad tradition dating back to the sons of Queen Victoria, who favored pinky rings in imitation of their mother as well as following German custom. Queen Victoria's son Prince Leopold wore many rings on his left pinky, as did all of the sons of King George V. King Edward VII did not assign any special significance to his left pinky as later generations did, and his son George V wore no rings at all. The best example of such a ring was the one worn by King George VI. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, consort to Queen Elizabeth II, wore his father's signet ring until sometime in the 1970s, when he ceased to wear any signet. Prince Charles wears the official signet of the Prince of Wales, which ring is nearly 175 years old and was last worn by the former King Edward VIII (styled as the Duke of Windsor following his abdication) when he was still Prince of Wales. Prince Charles, as well as the other men in the family, wear their signets on top of their wedding bands.

It was established from the Ho Chi Minh City Technology College, founded on 24 September 1997 by Decision number 198/Qƒê-TTg signed by the prime minister of Vietnam. In March 2005, the prime minister signed Decision 52/2005/Qƒê-TTg to rename and recognized the upgrading of this college; the name of the university was officially changed. The university provides undergraduate and graduate education and have cooperative education agreements with Troy University from the United States. Formation and development of Saigon Technology University (STU) Saigon University of Technology started as Ho Chi Minh City Engineering College (SEC). SEC was set up pursuant to the Decree No. 198/QD-Ttg on 24 September 1997. SEC was the first national college specializing in training disciplines of engineering and technology fields. In April 2004, basing on the training capacity and achievements, the government issued the Decision No 57/2004/QD-Ttg to grant the college to University status, called Ho Chi Minh City Engineering University (SEU). In March 2005, the university was renamed Saigon Technology University (STU) according to the Decision No 52/2005/QD-Ttg. Due to the high assessment of STU lecturers and infrastructure, the Ministry of Education and Training allowed the university to start the in-service training system, besides the regular one (based o¬¨n the Decision No 3410/QD-BGD&DT;) and begin a university-level course program (according to the Decision No 7373/QD- BGD&DT;, now called successive system into university). Bachelor‚Äôs degrees and diplomas in Engineering at STU are included in the national degree system and are valid nationwide. At present, STU has the function of training from technical junior level to tertiary one, and implementing applied research in Mechatronics, Telecommunications, Informatics Technology, Industrial Electricity, Automatic Control, Food Technology, Civil Engineering and Business Administration. Training process The first college students started their formal studies on 29 December 1997. The school opening ceremony was two months later. The number of the first course students was 800 and the second was 900. Because of local socio-economic development and increased capacity of the school since the beginning of the third course (1999‚Äì2000), about 1300-1400 new students are annually recruited. From the academic year of 2004‚Äì2005, of the 1400 new students, 50% studied at the university level and 50% at the college level. Since the academic year 2004‚Äì2005, the student population has been increasing gradually and there are over 3000 students in school year 2008- 2009. This raises the student total to about 9,3000. In early 2006, the university-level completion program started the first course. With good memories of the original university, confidence in the qualifications and dedication of the STU lecturers, over 1000 college engineers, graduating at the junior college level from STU, and 350 degree holders from other colleges eagerly attended the first university-level completion course. After the third semester of ‚Äúcompletion‚Äù, they will have a university bachelor's degree. STU has become a comprehensive and flexible training University with its training systems: professional secondary system, traditional university and college system, non-traditional system and university-level completion program. Mission Saigon Technology University started on Ho Chi Minh City Engineering College (SEC). SEC was set up with the function of multi-disciplinary training and fields at the levels of junior education, tertiary education, and higher education; providing high quality of human resources having vocation for technology; being good at virtue, education level, foreign languages, and professional knowledge. These could meet the higher and higher socioeconomic needs in developing trends of our country, society, and learners.

Life Lisa Ullmann was born in Berlin in 1907. She was intending to be a painter but at the suggestion of her father she studied Central European Modern Dance at the Laban School in Berlin which was run by Hertha Feist. There she joined the movement choir and heard Rudolf Laban talk, graduating in 1929.  Work  Ullmann taught in Nuremberg and at the Essen Folkwang School, where she worked for Kurt Jooss. She left Nazi Germany in 1933 and went to Dartington, England with Jooss and his company, on the invitation of Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst. In 1935, influenced by Laban‚Äôs inclusive concept of ‚ÄòDance for All‚Äô, she established the first movement Choir in the country in Plymouth under the auspices of the Workers' Educational Association. She taught at Dartington Hall until 1940, lectured regularly and choreographed extensively. Rudolf Laban also left for Britain, and for twenty years (1938‚Äì58) Ullmann was his long-term partner and the main collaborator in his dance work. Ullmann was cofounder of the Laban Art of Movement Guild in 1945, now known as The Laban Guild for Movement and Dance. In 1946 she also cofounded the Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, which became the centre for educational dance in England, training generations of modern dance teachers. In 1953, backed by the Ministry of Education, she became Principal of the new Art of Movement Studio in Addlestone, Surrey.  Modern Educational Dance  In 1941 at a landmark Symposium attended by Her Majesty‚Äôs Inspectorate, Laban and Ullmann presented a lecture-demonstration illustrating the concepts of dance education and its potential as a subject in the State Education System. The Board of Education set down a directive that one class per week of ‚ÄòModern Educational Dance‚Äô was to become a requirement of the curriculum. This was the pivotal moment that established the place of dance education in schools for the future. The curriculum was based on Laban's space harmonies and his theories of the exploration of expressive movement through effort patterns. It was a phenomenological approach to learning: on praxis ‚Äì the interweaving of theory and practice, on the challenge of creative action to develop confidence and problem-solving abilities, and the belief that dance is a powerful medium which enhances the lives of children. She was also responsible for translating, revising and annotating several books written by Laban and for cataloguing the Laban Archives. She was still teaching up until the year of her death, imparting her expert knowledge of Laban's theories in courses run by LInC (Laban International Courses). The Lisa Ullmann Travelling Scholarship Fund (Registered Charity No: 297684) was set up in 1987. The Fund has a unique policy to award travel scholarships to individual dance and movement practitioners wishing to pursue Continuing Professional Development Courses at destinations across the world. Over the past three decades, the Fund has awarded over 500 scholarships.

He was known as a champion of avant-garde art and music and is associated with composer John Cage and the Fluxus art movement. He preferred that his name be spelled ellsworth snyder, using all lower-case letters.  Snyder as pianist and music scholar  Snyder's interest in the avant-garde art movement developed out his formal training in classical music. A native of Springfield, Ohio, Snyder attended The Cincinnati Conservatory of Music (now the College-Conservatory of Music of the University of Cincinnati) where he studied with noted pianist Robert Goldsand and the Austro-Hungarian pianist and composer Jen≈ë Tak√°cs while earning both his bachelor's and master's degrees. He also took several classes in Cincinnati with the American musicologist and composer Charles Hamm, who subsequently wrote several piano pieces for Snyder. In 1960 Snyder accepted a position as music instructor at Newcomb College of Tulane University in New Orleans where he began an experimental new music series titled \\"You've never heard anything like it\\". The programs ranged from the twelve-tone compositions of Schoenberg to Fluxus happenings. One of these happenings in 1960 consisted of a performer crushing a light bulb into a frying pan. Snyder developed a reputation for bringing to his avant-garde performances the same seriousness and sensitivity to tone, timing and clarity that he did to traditional classical music. It was his interest in contemporary music that led to a decisive meeting with John Cage in 1960. The two men became lifelong friends and professional colleagues. In 1964 Snyder moved to Madison, Wisconsin where he wrote the first doctoral dissertation ever written on John Cage, for the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Snyder included compositions by Cage in the standard repertoire of music that he performed both in the United States and internationally including the album of new music that he recorded for Advance Records in 1974 and a recital that he gave at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall in 1977. He also published two interviews with John Cage, one in 1985 and the other in 1990. In 1990 John Cage composed a piece for piano for Snyder called One5, for ellsworth, which Snyder premiered on an all-Cage program in Madison in 1991. Cage was in attendance for the performance, one year before his own death at age 80. In addition to his career as a concert pianist, Ellsworth Snyder taught at Milton College in Wisconsin until it closed in 1982. His unconventional new music lectures of the late 1960s drew large crowds. He wrote extensively about the Fluxus movement and gave courses in piano pedagogy. In 1971 he took the position of music director at the Frank Lloyd Wright designed First Unitarian Society of Madison, Wisconsin where he created a concert series that embraced both experimental and traditional music.  Snyder as visual artist  In 1978 at Cage's prompting Snyder began painting. He developed a distinctive style as an abstractionist that was spare and yet employed the use of expressive gestures. John Cage included Snyder's work in the exhibition Rolywholyover at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA. Additionally, Snyder's art work has been exhibited in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Mito Museum in Tokyo, the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas, the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Elvehjem Museum of Art (now Chazen) in Madison, WI. His work is represented by Rosenthal Fine Art,Rosenthal Fine Art Jennfer Norbeck Fine Art,Jennifer Norback Fine Art in Chicago, Illinois, and Shiloh Gallery.Shiloh Gallery  Snyder's death and archive  Snyder died on August 11, 2005 in Madison, WI from complications of pulmonary fibrosis. His archive, housed in the special collections of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Memorial Library includes his recordings, writings, interviews, and many examples of his artwork.

Career  In Vancouver, Canada, the young Khan met Mushtari Begum, a Ghazal singer, Sheikh Mohyudean, a harmonium / Qawaali singer, and Ustad Rukhsar Ali, a Tabla player. He subsequently began his tutelage under the guidance of these musicians and would later combine his musical disciplines. Khan mastered the ability to sing Ghazal and play the Tabla simultaneously which garnered him respect and attention in the Indian classical music world. Khan's repertoire also include the Tarannum Ang Gayaki while playing the Tabla, which is a very difficult talent, and has made this aspect his trademark style. Khan has been crowned as the chief architect in this rare style of performance, and his contribution has been etched into the world of Indian classical music when he was crowned \\"Ustad\\" or Maestro in 2016 by Pt Salil Bhatt during the 5th Annual Mushtari Begum Festival of Indian Classical Music and Dance in New Westminster, BC, Canada. Khan's early career met with limited success after the recording and international tour of his first album \\"Cassius Khan-The Young Tabla/Ghazal Wizard.\\" Khan states because of his young age he was taken advantage of by his management and was misled on the rights to his albums or financial gains. He would continue on to college and university and had thoughts of pursuing a career in Law or Psychology however due to tough circumstances in his life Khan decided to stick to music. He started by touring the folk festival scene in North America, South Pacific, Europe and South America soloing and collaborating with artists of various genres from around the world as both a Tabla player and vocalist. In his young career and to date, Khan has performed in over 25 countries. After performing as a sideman in bands for years, in 2001, Khan composed the \\"Asia Music\\" for the IAAF World Championships in Athletics under the guidance of composer Jan Randall. The piece he composed gained him international recognition as a soloist and composer. The same year, he was ranked top in the charts of radio stations across Europe and was labelled as ‚ÄúTop 25 World Artists to look out for‚Äù by BBC Radio 2. In 2005, Khan was the only Canadian musician of Indian heritage invited to perform Ghazal and a Tabla solo recital at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa as part of Alberta Scene Festival. Khan was then invited by the Salmon Arm Roots and Blues Festival to present his first classical Ghazal and Tabla recital concert in a Canadian Folk festival in 2006. Khan was also among few selected out of 8,000 applicants to showcase Ghazal/Tabla at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas in 2008. That same year Ellen Mcilwaine and Cassius Khan were invited to perform for Junofest as they were shortlisted for the 2008 Juno Awards for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year and were invited to perform at the Juno Awards in Calgary alongside Ellen McIlwaine. The following year Khan was a featured artist for the Canadian Music Week. Khan's recordings were also selected for the Japan Trade Mission in 2009. Khan is also the first Canadian who performed at the prestigious Sa Ma Pa Music Festival at Kamani Auditorium in New Delhi India on 23 November 2013. Since then, Khan has performed in festivals around the world. Khan was signed by the Yarlowe Artist Group in 2008 but unfortunately in later 2009, Khan fired his management on the grounds of theft, fraud and career jeopardisation. Khan hired Reboot Management in 2016 and terminated their service four months later due to incompetence. Khan's Ghazal album \\"Mushtari, a live concert\\" released in 2011, was nominated for 'World Album of the Year' by the Western Canadian Music Awards (WCMA) and was a tribute to his guru and teacher, the late Mushtari Begum, with a selection of choice classical Ghazals and a tabla solo recital. This was the first ever album recorded in the world with Ghazal and tabla simultaneously by one artist. He also released a tabla solo single titled \\"Sparks of Energy\\" in 2011. Both of these albums feature Khan's wife, Amika Kushwaha as the brilliant Harmonium soloist. Other selected collaborations include the ground breaking collaboration \\"Dark Clouds\\" (2006) with Jazz pianist Stu Goldberg ( the lead keyboardist to John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra) a prized collaboration with Slide Guitar legend Ellen McIlwaine to record \\"Mystic Bridge\\" which is a ground breaking Blues/Indian music album which was shortlisted for the Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year in 2008 , \\"I Feel Love Again\\" (2002) with Mediterranean Guitarist Pavlo, \\"Mani Licks\\" (2002) with Heavy Metal/Shredder Guitarist Dan Mani,\\"A Demon's Dream\\" (2002) with Acoustic/Electric Guitar wizard Dave Martone, and \\"The Alchemists\\" (2002) with Dave Martone, and \\"Angel of Sevilla\\" (1990) with the late Spanish Guitarist D'Arcy Greaves. Khan has also collaborated with the inventor of the Mohan Veena, Grammy Award artist Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Ustad Aashish Khan Sarode player of the Maihar Gharana, Satvik Veena exponent Pandit Salil Bhatt, Kathak Danceuse/Harmonium soloist Amika Kushwaha, amongst other greats of Indian classical music and Ghazal singers. Khan has also worked in television and is featured in a commercial for Nanak Foods as a tabla player who finds musical inspiration after being served the halwa sweet dish by his wife, Amika Kushwaha. Khan was bestowed the 'Salute to Excellence Award' by the City of Edmonton for his immense contributions and honour he had brought in Indian classical music as well as the ‚ÄúBernie Legg Artist of the Year\\" by the City of New Westminster Chamber of Commerce in 2019, he has lent his hands and voice to almost all genres of music, from Pop to Rock, to Electronica to Country, to World and Heavy Metal, to Blues and Roots. Khan is also the very first Canadian Indian classical musician to perform fusion collaborations with musicians from all genres of music since 1990 and has been recognised as \\"Canada's Multifaceted Musician.\\" Khan also performed for the United Nations, WIPO and the Permanent Mission of India in Geneva Switzerland for Namaste Geneva, an initiative created by the Indian Ambassador to the UN, His Excellency Rajiv Chander in 2017/2018. Khan has publicly stated that the Canadian music scene, especially some folk festivals, have limited room and interest for practitioners of Traditional music and that the term \\"World Music\\" is a colonial term to degrade music outside the Western genres. In the hopes that Indian Classical musicians and dancers have a proper platform for public performance in Canada, he along with his wife, Amika Kushwaha, founded the Mushtari Begum Festival of Indian Classical Music and Dance, debuting on 25 August 2012 at the Massey Theatre in New Westminster, BC, Canada. Khan has stated that public support for this festival is still very low, and hopes to grow the festival in the years to come. Already, however, the Mushtari Begum Festival has become recognised as Canada's most elite festival of Indian Classical Music. A respected critic, Khan has sat on many panels as a judge and has also adjudicated for the Shastri Indo Canadian Scholarship fund. He is also an honorary Cultural Ambassador to the City of New Westminster. He hosted \\"The Cassius Khan Show- Connecting Classical Music to Your Hearts\\" on a radio station for a year. Khan is also endorsed by Sangeet Natak Akademi award recipients, the tabla makers Ustad Qasim Khan Niyazi and Sons in Laxminagar, New Delhi, India as their official spokesperson and is also endorsed by Aman Kalyan‚Äôs Lehra Studio apps based in Sydney, Australia.

Khan takes a major interest in politics, art and sports. In his youth he played ice and ball hockey for years as a goaltender and appeared in four A.B.H.L All Star Games as the starting goaltender, and was once admired for his immense leg strength, cat like reflexes, and an unbeatable glove hand. Khan was a member of the Kinsmen Track and Field Club in Edmonton, AB where he participated in 100-meter sprint meets in Canada. His fastest time was 10.85 seconds. Khan refused to perform in Israel in 2009 in solidarity with how Palestinians were treated. He has been publicly critical on his intense dislike to the term World Music and is disappointment on the fact that the Canadian Music scene needs to open its doors to music of non-Western disciplines. He was also critical about the 2005 Albertascene Festival which stirred up a lot of controversy, in which he bluntly told the media about his disappointment on money mismanagement on the festival's behalf as the artists who performed there were misled about receiving music contracts, wages, accommodation and food. He worked undercover for the Edmonton Journal to expose racism in some local nightclubs, which also stirred a lot of controversy at the time. Khan is an avid Mercedes Benz diesel enthusiast, and has owned a number of the 300D models. His trademark Mercedes are a 1973 W114 220D and a 1992 W124 300D 2.5 Turbo.

Khan has donated a portion of his earnings to orphanages around the world and was the very first human being on earth to donate $10,000.00 of his concert earnings to the victims of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami. Cassius's music has been illegally used by Vancouver rapper and composer Chin Injeti, who released an entire album, \\"D'Tach\\" by stealing Khan's tabla, voice and compositions without his permission. Many have said that if it wasn't for Khan's stolen contributions for this album, Chin Injeti would have never received the Grammy Award. Cassius received the honorary title of \\"Ustad\\" or Maestro for his unique ability to play the tabla and sing ghazal. Khan has stated that hard work and sacrifice has brought him to where he is now regardless of facing racism is Canada's mainstream music scene. Khan lives in New Westminster, British Columbia.

When Doc is on his way to retrieve it and wipe out the memory of those early days, his caravan, which was trailed by a rival gang, is attacked and he is mortally wounded. Just before he dies, he gives a map of the gold cache to Jeff Kincaid, a younger rider he entrusts with the plan of finding the gold and restoring it to its rightful owners. In doing this, Jeff encounters the heavies, and Mistletoe and Crawfish supply the comedy relief.

He intended to distribute the film to the hundreds of movie houses across the South that catered exclusively to black audiences, as the strict racial segregation in effect in the South at the time forbade blacks and whites from being in the same theater at the same time. However, with the help of Gene Autry, another well-known screen cowboy, Jeffrey made a deal with Dallas-based Sack Amusements for national distribution.Berry, S. Torriano. The 50 Most Influential Black Films (2001), page 45 The film was so successful that Sack Amusements executive Richard C. Kahn approached Jeffrey about continuing the saga of the black cowboy. Since rights to the original character of Jeff Kincaid were tied up with the original producer, Jed Buell, Kahn and Jeffrey created the character of Bob Blake and introduced his trusty horse Stardusk. The first film produced through this new partnership was Two-Gun Man from Harlem (1938). A 1940 newspaper credited the film with holding the largest box-office profits of any all-African-American film.

The route is unique for its five state crossings between Georgia and North Carolina along the southern slopes of Kinley Mountain. Route description SR 246 begins at the intersection of US 23/US 441/SR 15, in Dillard, Georgia. As it enters North Carolina for the first time, the road widens to improve staying in the curves, with the north-east side becoming two lanes. During the third incursion in Georgia, there is an overlook with a clear view toward the west of the town of Dillard. The overlook is above Estatoah Falls but can not be seen. The falls are on private property and cannot be accessed. They can be seen only at a distance from Hwy 246 heading from Dillard to Sky Valley. By the final border crossing the highway will merge back into two-lanes. Continuing north in North Carolina, several roads near the border connect back into Georgia to the mountain resort area of Sky Valley. Passing through the community of Scaly Mountain, the highway ends at US 64/NC 28, in Highlands. In Georgia, the route is designated east-west, while in North Carolina it is north-south. While the highway is maintained by Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) until the final border crossing, north of the southern end of Wood Valley Road, the highway is still recognized as NC 106 (Dillard Road) within North Carolina and same for SR 246 (Highlands Road/Larry McClure Highway) in Georgia. History NC 106 was established in 1940 as new primary routing from the Georgia state line to Highlands. It has changed little since inception. Originally, from 1921-1940, NC 106 traversed from NC 28, in Cashiers, to NC 10, in Sylva. In 1931, it was extended south to the South Carolina state line. In 1940, it was renumbered to NC 107 to sync with South Carolina. Previously there were five sets of welcome signs announcing the crossings of the state line.

The 1889 Point Sur Lighthouse is on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Point Sur was a notorious hazard to navigation, and the site of many shipwrecks. In 1875, the USS Ventura ran onto rocks just north of Point Sur. Though the Venturas captain was drunk, the absence of a light contributed to the tragedy. The sinking of the Ventura became the impetus for building a lightstation in the remote area.Point Sur State Historic Park  Construction Point Sur Lighthouse opened on August 1, 1889. The station was very remote and was necessarily self-sufficient, as most supplies had to be brought in by ship. Lighthouse employees and their families had their own vegetable gardens. Children stayed with local ranchers during the week to attend school, returning home on weekends, or stayed with distant relatives. In 1927, a schoolteacher was assigned to the lightstation to teach the six children who resided there. When Highway One through Big Sur was completed in 1927, children could attend school at a school house on Highway 1. In the 1940s, children from the lightstation were assimilated into Big Sur's larger school. The Lighthouse Service was absorbed into the Coast Guard in 1939, and Point Sur Lighthouse became the property of the Coast Guard. The lightstation was automated in the late 1960s, and in 1974 ceased to have a light keeper. The coast off Point Sur Lighthouse was the location of the sinking of the United States Navy airship in 1935. Point Sur State Historic Park was established in 1986.  Naval Facility Point Sur added  In 2000, the nearby Naval Facility Point Sur, except for one building retained by the U.S. Navy, was transferred to the California State Park system. It became part of the Point Sur State Historic Park. The state park is currently using some of the facility's housing. The facility is not open to the public. On February 3, 2017, the California Historical Resources Commission nominated Naval Facility Point Sur for the National Register of Historic Places. It was chosen in part because Point Sur NAVFAC is one of the last remaining Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) facilities, and the only one remaining on the West Coast.  Tourism  The park contains California's only complete turn-of-the-20th- century lighthouse open to the public. (The nearby Point Pinos Lighthouse is also open to the public, but is significantly older.) Walking tours are held year-round on Saturdays, Sundays and Wednesdays, and also on Thursdays during July and August. Tours are first-come, first-served; visitors are advised to arrive a half-hour before the tour.  Marine Protected Areas  Point Sur State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area are marine protected areas offshore from Point Sur Lighthouse. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

He was born in Bailieboro, Ontario, on July 26, 1875, to John William and Margaret (n√©e Fair) Lucas, both of Irish descent. He attended public schooling in the Bailieboro area as well as the Ontario Agricultural College. On 9 January 1903, Lucas married Charlotte \\"Lottie\\" Perrin, of Bailieboro. With her he had three children. His religion was listed as Anglican. Lucas was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1921 Canadian federal election as a United Farmers of Alberta candidate. He defeated two other candidates including former Alberta MLA James Bismark Holden in a landslide where he captured 81 per cent of the vote to win his first term in office. His electoral district was abolished due to redistribution and he ran for re-election in the new Camrose riding in the 1925 Canadian federal election. He defended his incumbency less than a year later when the minority government of Arthur Meighen fell. Lucas won a third term in the 1926 Canadian federal election defeating Liberal candidate Donald McIvor. McIvor and Lucas would face each other again in the 1930 Canadian federal election he would be re-elected increasing his margin of victory over McIvor.

He served as a goalkeeper coach with the U.S. women national team. High School and College Dougherty grew up in San Jose, California and Cupertino, California. He began playing youth soccer in the Police Athletic League. After playing recreational-level soccer, he was recruited to play for his local club by coach Ken Campbell, South Valley United, where he remained from age 9-19, traveling around the nation and Canada for tournaments. Dougherty was competing year-round by the time he reached high school. He attended Santa Teresa High School and Monta Vista High School where he joined the boys' soccer team. Dougherty made the varsity team as a freshman, and helped his team to a conference title. After starting four years in high school and repeatedly reaching the state playoffs, he was offered a scholarship to Fresno State University by then-assistant coach John Bluem. He red-shirted his freshman year, then started four consecutive years. His first year playing on the men's soccer team, in 1986, he led the Bulldogs to win the Pacific Coast Athletic Association championship and to the NCAA Final Four. That year, they set a record for the most wins for Fresno State with 18 and Dougherty set the record for fewest goals allowed (10). Dougherty was team captain his junior and senior seasons, in 1988 and 1989, and led the team to win back to back Big West Conference Championships. He was also named Player of the Week for October 11, 1988. In 1989, the team set records for fewest losses, (3) most penalty kicks made, (7) and longest unbeaten streak, with 17 wins and a 14-0-3 record. During his college career, he was a four- year letterman, named a four time all-Far West selection, selected to the Second Team, All-Big West in 1987, and First Team 1988 and 1989. He ended his college career, in 1989, with 0.76 goals against average. Dougherty still holds the Big West Conference record for career shutouts, with thirty-eight between 1986-1989. Dougherty continued to attend classes, after being signed to play professionally, finally graduating in 1991 with a Bachelor of Science in Finance from Fresno State. Professional career After exhausting his NCAA eligibility in 1989, Dougherty signed with the expansion San Francisco Bay Blackhawks, which were in the Western Soccer League (WSL). Between 1989 and 1991, the Blackhawks played in three championships in a row. The team came in second in the WSL championship game in 1989. Then, in 1990, the WSL merged with the American Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). The Blackhawks again went to the championship game, but came up short a second time. In 1991, Dougherty led the league with a .81 goals against average per game as the Blackhawks won the title. Dougherty made two saves during the shootout and was named the championship MVP and a first team All Star. He was ranked 1st among APSL goalkeepers with 7 shut outs and 0.58 goals against average, and was 3-1 in penalty kicks. Even so, he finished second in voting for league MVP. The last of those championships, the 1991 APSL title, qualified the Blackhawks for a place in the 1992 CONCACAF Champions' Cup. As the Blackhawks were the United States' top professional club, in 1992 they traveled to Mexico City to face Club Am√©rica in a home-and- away series at the most fearsome venue in North American soccer: Estadio Azteca. With questionable refereeing that caused the Blackhawks to believe that there was a conspiracy to keep them out of the final, they were narrowly defeated. In 1993, the team owner moved the Blackhawks from the APSL to the USISL and renamed the team the San Jose Hawks. The Hawks took their division with a 14-2 record, making the Sizzlin‚Äô Six tournament before folding at the end of the season. In 1994, Dougherty joined the North Bay Breakers as a player/coach. In 1995, Dougherty was with the Hawaii Tsunami (USISL) as both a player and assistant coach. The Tsunami went 18-2, leading the USISL in both goals scored and goals against. Hawaii was also a perfect 10-0 at home. The Tsunami also won the Northwest Division championship and a berth in the Sizzlin' Nine championships. In February 1996, Dougherty expected to be selected in the first round of the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft by coach Laurie Calloway of the San Jose Clash, eighth overall. Calloway had coached Dougherty previously, when he played for the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks. Instead, the Tampa Bay Mutiny selected Dougherty seventh overall. Dougherty was the first goalkeeper to be drafted. He went 17-11 with a 1.68 goals against average, the fourth best in the league, and had three shutouts. He was named to the 1996 all-star team and he led the Mutiny to the league's best record (20-12). In the playoffs, he went 2-1 against the Columbus Crew, before losing the first game to D.C. United in the conference finals. He did not play in the second game, and the Mutiny were defeated by D.C. The next year, in 1997, Dougherty went 15-9 with a 1.89 goals against average and three shutouts. He racked up enough victories (17) to place Tampa second in the east, only to be knocked out in the first round of the playoffs by the Crew. After two very successful seasons with the Mutiny in 1996 and 1997, in which Dougherty posted two six-game winning streaks and compiled the most victories in MLS' brief history, he was inexplicably placed on waivers when the Mutiny acquired Swedish World Cup hero Thomas Ravelli. Dougherty was acquired by the Columbus Crew following the 1997 season in the waiver draft. Soon after, the Crew were allocated national team goalkeeper Juergen Sommer. Despite Sommer claiming the starter's role, Dougherty played when he was at the World Cup. Noted as \\"one of the most astounding goalkeeping displays in the history of the Crew,\\" Dougherty made several stunning first-half saves in a home game against San Jose. In 1999, Sommer suffered a severe knee injury. As a result, for the inaugural season at Columbus Crew stadium, Dougherty was starting goalkeeper. That year, Dougherty became the first goalkeeper in league history to record 50 wins, with a 4-2 win over the MetroStars on August 18, 1999 at Giants Stadium. He led the Crew in minutes played, playing 90 minutes in all but one of 31 appearances, and still had the lowest goals against average in the Eastern Conference, along with a career high of 18 wins. The team set a record for fewest goals allowed in a season with just 39 goals allowed, and five shutouts. He was recognized for his play during the 1999 season as the Crew's Most Valuable Player, and BIC Defender of the Year, and also received the Huntington Bank \\"Man of the Year\\" award from the team for his community service. Dougherty entered the 2000 season as MLS' all-time wins leader with 54 career victories, and third among all MLS keepers in career saves with 495. He led the Crew to second place in the Eastern Conference, with a 0.67 goals against average. He finished the regular season fifth in the league. He was second in wins (18), second in minutes (2745), fourth in saves (106), fourth in the infamous catches/punches (104), fifth in shutouts (6) and sixth in saves-to-goals ratio (3.03). In 2000, he started 25 matches, posting a 10-12-3 record with three shutouts against New York/ New Jersey, Kansas City, and Miami. His season high was 11 saves in a 4-2 win against Miami on May 27, 2000, including 7 saves in the second half. By 2001, Dougherty had 121 career appearances, 119 starts, and was still leading the league with 64 career victories. He was second in the league with 500 career saves, and had 16 career shutouts. He played only two games in 2001 after suffering a knee injury. He retired from playing at the end of the season. Coaching In 1991, Dougherty coached the Fresno State University's Women's Soccer Team. In 1992, he coached the Mission College's Men's Soccer Team. From 1993-1994, he was an assistant coach for Sonoma State University's Men's Soccer Team and the goalkeeper coach for both the men's and women's teams. In 1994, he was a player/coach for the North Bay Breakers. In 1995, was a player/coach for the Hawaii Tsunami, and he also coached the Santa Rosa Junior College Women's Soccer Team to the state championship where they lost to Mt. San Antonio. Dougherty took a hiatus from coaching while he played professionally until 2002, when Bowling Green State University hired Dougherty as an assistant soccer coach. He then moved to the Colorado Rapids where he was an assistant coach and goalkeeper coach until 2005. He was also the director of the Colorado Rush's youth academy during that time, and coached the girls' U-12 team to a Colorado State Cup championship in 2004 and did the same with U-18 girls in 2005. The Colorado Rush club won state championships in the 2002, 2003 and 2004 seasons. Dougherty then became the goalkeeper coach with the U.S. women‚Äôs national team. After taking a few years off from coaching, Dougherty coached his son and 9 other boys during the fall 2008 soccer season. The Colorado Rush \\"Crush\\" U-10 recorded 9 wins and lost only once, eventually winning the Gold A1 bracket. Dougherty currently coaches privately in Miami. Honors F.I.U.

Plot summary The story picks up the saga of Elric as he and Moonglum of Elwher barely escape with their lives from Nadsokor, the city of Beggars and find themselves in the cursed forest of Troos. Elric is able to collect various sorcerous herbs that grow only there, and they meet the young and beautiful Lady Zarozinia of Kaarlak, sole survivor of a massacre by the physically and mentally twisted Orgians. They agree to escort her to safety, but are further attacked by Orgians and escape. Leaving their treasure behind. The trio, now protected by Elric's magic, bluff their way into the citadel of the Orgians, in the guise of messengers of the Gods, but King Gutheran and his son Prince Hurd see through their lie and imprison the travellers. Elric is chained at the entrance to the barrow, beneath which live the Hill-Folk, the undead ancestors of the Orgians. About to be eaten alive by the gibbering ghouls, he prays to Arioch the Demon God who sends a lightning-bolt to shatter his chains, allowing his escape.

The Hill-Folk, led by their Hill-King, arise and invade the Great Hall to massacre the Orgians. Gutheran, who fears the arrival of the Hill-King more than anything, dies of a seizure.

Military service=Background As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement, the tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828. However, Sauk leader Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty, claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted, nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands. Angered by the loss of his birthplace, between 1830-31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River into Illinois, but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British, he again moved his so-called \\"British Band\\" of around 1,000 warriors and non-combatants into Illinois.Lewis, James. \\"The Black Hawk War of 1832 ,\\" Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project, Northern Illinois University.

Life Albert Jones was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1920 and was educated at Timaru Boys' High School. At the beginning of the Second World War he joined the army, but in 1942 he was classified unfit for overseas service. He worked as a miller in a rolled oats mill, as a grocery shop owner and in a car assembly factory. He died in Nelson, New Zealand, in 2013.  Astronomy =Achievements In 1963 he became the sixth astronomer in history to make 100,000 observations of variable stars and by 2004 he became the first to make more than 500,000 observations. His visual brightness estimates were very precise: most observers can distinguish variations of one tenth of a magnitude, but Jones' measurements were reported to show a standard deviation of about one twentieth of a magnitude. In 1946 he discovered the comet C/1946 P1 (Jones) and in 2000 he co-discovered, together with Japanese astronomer Syogo Utsunomiya the comet C/2000 W1 (Utsunomiya-Jones), becoming the oldest comet discoverer. In 1987 he co-discovered the supernova SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which was the brightest naked-eye supernova explosion since 1604. Honours and awards Jones' work was widely acknowledged. In 1968, he received the Merlin Silver Medal and Prize of the British Astronomical Association for his work in establishing accurate magnitudes of comets. In the 1987 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to astronomy. The following year, asteroid 3152 Jones was named after him. He won the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific for his variable star and comet observations in 1998. The comet C/2000 W1 discovery brought him the Edgar Wilson Award, administered by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, in 2001.

He is best known along with Jang In-hwan for his role in the 1908 assassination of Durham Stevens, a former American diplomat in Japan who was later appointed as an advisor to the Joseon Dynasty government. Jeon was a member of the Dongnip Hyeophoe, a Korean American association in the Bay Area. In March 1908, infuriated by Stevens' remarks claiming that common people in Korea welcomed the increasing Japanese influence in their country, the Dongnip Hyeophoe held a joint meeting with the Daedong Bogukhoe, another local association of Koreans of which Jang was a member. In a 1974 interview, Yang Ju-eun, a fellow attendee of that meeting, remembered that Jeon had a reputation in the community as a man of action, in contrast to Jang, whom he described as a \\"quiet and shy Christian gentleman\\". On March 23, 1908, Jeon and Jang approached Stevens at the Port of San Francisco as he prepared to embark on a ship bound for Washington, D.C. Jeon attempted to fire his revolver at Stevens but his gun, which was wrapped in a handkerchief, would not fire. Jeon then rushed at Stevens and used his weapon as a club to hit Stevens in the face. Jeon then ran off and was pursued by Stevens. Jang then fired at Stevens, the first bullet hit Jeon and two others struck Stevens in the back. The crowd which had gathered urged that they be lynched on the spot; Jang was arrested and held without bail on a charge of murder, while Jeon was sent to the hospital for treatment. Some accounts, notably Yang's, state that Jeon only had a toy gun. After the death of Stevens in hospital, Jeon provided a written statement in Korean detailing his reasons for the attack on Stevens, in which he asserted that Stevens had betrayed the trust of Koreans who \\"looked to him, as an American, for justice\\" and expressed his willingness to die in order to express his anger at Stevens' alleged falsehoods about the Korean peoples' condition under Japanese rule. The statement was translated and first printed by the San Francisco Call. There was insufficient evidence to prove that Jeon and Jang had conspired with each other; Jeon was still charged with attempted assassination, but eventually acquitted. Jeon was posthumously awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation by South Korea's Ministry of Patriots' and Veterans' Affairs in 1962.

There are three products in the line, the EVA700, the HD EVA8000 and the current EVA9150 Digital Entertainer Elite. All support high definition video, the EVA700 via component output up to 1080i and the EVA8000/EVA9000 up to 1080p with both component and HDMI connectors. All models support audio, video, image and streaming audio and video formats and can be networked via wired and wireless Ethernet. The EVA700 is Intel Viiv certified.  Description  Common features of both EVA models include being able to access digital media files on a network attached home computer running Windows XP, stream audio and video from the PC, stream Internet radio (streaming MP3). USB storage devices such as iPods, thumb drives, and some digital cameras with USB interfaces can be attached directly to the units for playback of media on those USB devices. As the Digital Entertainer products are Intel Viiv compliant, setup and media access with an Intel Viiv PC is more automated than without such a PC. However, an Intel Viiv PC is not required in order to operate an EVA unit. The systems come with a remote control with which to manipulate the on-screen display on your television along with a large selection of suitable connecting cables. Inputs/Outputs: At a minimum, EVAs have RCA connectors for composite video output, as well as for component video output, S-Video output, a digital S/PDIF audio output, stereo RCA audio outputs, at least 1 USB 2.0 port and 1 8P8C 10/100 Ethernet port.  History: MP101 and MP115  NETGEAR started off in the media streamer arena with the MP101, an audio-only small form factor media streamer. It had a four-line fluorescent display with line stereo RCA and 3.5\\" headphone outputs. Connectivity provided by built-in Ethernet and 802.11b wireless with WEP support. Controlled by a remote control, it had no external buttons at all, not even a power button. The unit could play MP3 and WMA files, along with PLS and M3U playlists. Rhapsody streaming radio was built in, and the unit could also play any MP3 streams through playlists. The MP115 was a technology trial, and only 600 were made. It used the same small form-factor as the MP101 but without the display. This unit was probably what could be considered the beginnings of the Digital Entertainer line as it supported XviD and MPEG1 and MPEG2 playback and had composite, S-Video and SCART output for connection to a TV, along with line stereo RCA. Audio was still supported along the same lines as the MP101. Again, no external buttons and all control from the remote. Dual-antenna 802.11g wireless was on board with wired Ethernet port.  EVA700 Digital Entertainer  Features: * Dual 2 dBi antenna wireless reception * Hardware-based Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) 40/64-bit & 128-bit encryption * WPA-PSK (WPA-Personal) and WPA2-PSK (WPA2-Persona) * 802.11g standard compliant (connects to 802.11b or 802.11g networks) * Intel NMPR 2.0 * UPnP AV * MP3s up to 320 kbit/s or variable bit rate (VBR) * WMA8 and WMA9 files up to 192kbit/s or variable bit rate(VBR) * WMV up to 1080p (down-converted) * Internet Radio (streaming MP3) * Video Formats: MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4, AVI, WMV, Xvid * Audio Formats: MP3, WAV, WMA, M3U, AAC * Photo Formats: JPEG, BMP, PNG, TIFF, GIF * Playlist Formats: M3U, PLS * RCA connector for composite * RCA connector for component (high definition up to 1080i) * S-video port * SCART connector for regions that require it * Stereo RCA audio ports * Digital coaxial S/PDIF audio port * Ethernet port * USB 2.0 port  EVA8000 Digital Entertainer HD  Apart from adding high definition video support over HDMI, the EVA8000 also adds a number of other features over the EVA700. Starting with HD support, it plays Windows Media Video (WMV) 9, and MPEG-4 formats up to 1080p. As it supports Windows Media DRM (WMDRM10), it can play protected downloaded content from online services like Yahoo Music. If the PC has a TV tuner card, then the EVA8000 can be used as a pseudo-DVR, although it does not store any content on its own. By using 2 or more EVA8000s, music can be synchronized throughout a home (party mode) and there is also a \\"follow me\\" feature that lets you pick up where you left off on a program on another unit. The EVA8000 also comes with the ability to allow you to view and control your PC applications on your TV. Noticeable is the difference in the user interface between the 2 units. Additional features over the EVA700: *HDMI A/V connector *Additional USB 2.0 port *DLNA *SMB Networking *FLAC audio support *Matroska (MKV) x264 video support *DVD ISO / VIDEO_TS folder playback support *Playlist formats: WPL, ASX, WAX, WVX, RMP *Full HD (1080p) output  EVA9150 Digital Entertainer Elite  This unit is essentially an updated EVA8000. No big new file format support is added or needed, but the main addition is an internal 500GB hard disk allowing for playback of content without the need for a computer, NAS or attached USB hard drive. At least one of these is required for the EVA700 and EVA8000 to play back content other than live over the internet. The internal hard drive also buffers streaming content if desired. Other additions include an ultra-low power standby mode, updated chassis, onboard dual-band (i.e.: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) WiFi-N (a.k.a. 802.11n) wireless network with internal antenna, and a hard power switch.

It was laid out as a trunk route with gentle curves and gradients and spacious track layouts. The two companies each needed approach railways at both ends of the line to connect their respective systems, and these were built as part of a single project. The joint line opened in 1905 and gave the GCR a better route than previously for its London Extension from Nottingham and Leicester. When the GWR completed its \\"Bicester Cut-off\\", combined with the Joint Line itself the GWR had a much shorter and better route for its Birmingham and Birkenhead traffic. Most of the GCR's London Extension was closed in 1966 but the Joint Line, the GCR approach through Wembley and the GWR Bicester Cut-off are still in use as a secondary main line from London to Birmingham, in intensive use by Chiltern Railways. Before the Joint Line Overview of the Great Western and Great Central Joint LineBy the final decade of the nineteenth century, the Great Western Railway had consolidated its network, and according to one point of view, had failed to develop its business further. It had acquired the epithet \\"the Great Way Round\\", as many of its principal main lines took a circuitous route to the destination. This was true of the West of England and South Wales routes, and the line from London to Birmingham and Chester took a roundabout alignment by way of Didcot and Oxford.Stanley C Jenkins, The Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, The Oakwood Press, Usk, 1978 An alternative route from London to Oxford had been opened, by way of Maidenhead, High Wycombe,The place was known to the railway as Wycombe prior to 1864. Princes Risborough and Thame, but this had been engineered as a rural branch line and was incapable of providing trunk route facilities. The GWR obtained Parliamentary powers in 1897 for the Wycombe and Acton line: this was to provide a much more direct route to High Wycombe and on to Thame; but this was nevertheless designed as a rural branch rather than a future trunk railway route. At the same time the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had set about transforming itself from a northern industrial concern into a trunk line, and it planned to reach London. Sir Edward Watkin was the chairman of the MS&LR; and also of the Metropolitan Railway, serving areas north and west of London, and he planned to join these lines. The MS&LR; obtained Parliamentary powers for the line, from the southern end of its network at Annesley (near Mansfield) to Quainton Road, in 1893.Alfred W Arthurton, Opening of the New Route to the North and North-West, in the Railway Magazine, April 1906 In addition, there was a two-mile section of independent route at the London end, from Canfield Place (near the present- day Finchley Road station) to a new terminus at Marylebone station, and south of Neasden the Metropolitan Railway provided a pair of tracks exclusively for the MS&LR; trains. The line opened in 1899; but the intermediate 40 miles from Quainton Road was over the Metropolitan Railway, already a busy railway in its own right. Unfortunately Watkin's health failed and he resigned on 19 May 1894. His successors as the prime movers were William Pollitt (MS&LR;) and John Bell (Metropolitan) and their personal relationship was not cordial. From that time relations between the MS&LR; and the Metropolitan Railway cooled, and became hostile and obstructive. Excessive charges and an unrealistic proposal for working mineral traffic from Baker Street to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway started the downward trajectory of the relationship.George Dow, Great Central: volume II, Locomotive Publishing Company Ltd, London, 1962 The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway changed its name to the Great Central Railway from 1 August 1897.Robert Robotham, Great Central Railway's London Extension, Ian Allan Publishing, Shepperton, 1990, The Metropolitan Railway had reached Aylesbury in 1892 and had taken over the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway in 1891, thereby gaining a route between Aylesbury and Verney Junction via Quainton Road. However the Great Western Railway had sponsored the Wycombe Railway, which had been the first railway in Aylesbury: its branch from Princes Risborough reached there in 1863. In 1898 the GCR wished to send coal trains to London over the GWR Aylesbury to Princes Risborough line, and on 30 July 1898 the first such train approached Aylesbury. This was one day earlier than the agreed start date. John Bell, the General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway and William Pollitt was General Manager of the MS&LR.; Bell personally went to Quainton Road and took charge, blocking the onward journey of the train. In fact he even refused to allow the engine to draw forward to run round its train; propelling a long mineral train back wrong line was out of the question, and a major disruption occurred. The mineral traffic started the following day.Dennis F Edwards and Ron Pigram, The Final Link, Midas Books, Tunbridge Wells, 1982, He had earlier refused to allow these trains to run the relatively short distance from Quainton Road to Aylesbury until the GCR London Extension was open throughout its length. This obstruction for the sake of one day was the clearest indication that the Metropolitan Railway was not going to be a co-operative partner to the GCR. This was compounded by Bell's absolute refusal to allow mineral traffic to be worked to the GWR at Aylesbury, not to destinations south of London over its own system. Princes Risborough in 1961As the Great Central took stock of the Metropolitan Railway's attitude, it also re-assessed the practicality of operating a trunk main line with heavy mineral traffic as well as express passenger trains over the tracks of the Metropolitan Railway from Aylesbury southwards. As well as the congestion of a suburban passenger operation, the curvature and gradients of the Metropolitan line were unfavourable, and the GCR began to consider alternatives. Saunderton looking south to the separate alignmentsThe Great Central Railway and the Great Western Railway had already collaborated successfully in the Banbury area and the GCR started to think of running some of its London traffic over the GWR via Oxford, or alternatively over the GWR Aylesbury branch to Princes Risborough and High Wycombe. The idea was discussed between the two companies, and a bold scheme for a new railway was developed, agreement being reached in September 1898. This would be constructed and operated by a joint committee representing the GWR and GCR, and some existing GWR route and powers for a proposed route would be taken over. A parliamentary Bill was submitted and on 1 August 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Railways Joint Committee was incorporated by Act of Parliament, with the necessary powers of construction and operation.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II: 1863 - 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931 Although the rupture between the Great Central and the Metropolitan Railway was of the most violent nature, wiser counsel later prevailed: the GCR needed at the least to work over the Metropolitan line until the construction of the new route, and preferably permanently as an alternative. The Metropolitan Railway faced losing a substantial income from running powers charges, and it had already expended considerable sums on widening its line for the GCR. When tempers cooled, a co-operative relationship later resumed.Alan A Jackson, London's Metropolitan Railway, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1986, Moreover, in 1901 the two personal adversaries each retired; Sam Fay became General Manager of the Great Central and Colonel J J Mellor took over at Baker Street.George Dow, Great Central: volume III, Ian Allan, London, 1965 The Joint Line: planning System map of the Great Western and Great Central Joint Line core sectionThe scope of the Joint Line was ambitious, and it was coupled with connecting railways for the GWR and GCR separately. The southern end of the Joint Line proper would be at Northolt Junction. The GWR would build the 7-mile section of the Wycombe and Acton line from Old Oak Common West Junction on the Paddington to Reading main line, near Acton, to Northolt Junction. The GCR would build a line miles long from Neasden Junction on its planned new route from Marylebone (at this point independent of the Metropolitan Railway, so permitting free access to the London terminus.) It was authorised by Parliament in 1898. The GCR line from Neasden to Northolt was let to a contractor in the value of ¬£168,000 but a serious overrun in costs resulted in this section costing over ¬£300,000. System map of the London end connections of the Great Western and Great Central Joint LineFrom Northolt Junction the Joint Line would take over the relevant part of the powers of the (unbuilt) Wycombe and Acton line, and then take over the part of the GWR line (former Wycombe Railway) from there to Princes Risborough, taking the opportunity to improve the alignment for main line running and double the track. The contract for the line from Northolt to High Wycombe was valued at ¬£580,000. System map of the northern connections to the Great Western and Great Central Joint LineFrom Princes Risborough northwards there would be a new route to Grendon Underwood, on the GCR new \\"London Extension\\" route; this junction was a few miles north of Quainton Road, so that reliance on the Metropolitan Railway would be avoided. The GWR had originally intended to use the Thame route to reach Oxford from Princes Risborough by upgrading the former Wycombe Railway route. This was however considered a roundabout route and the GWR now decided to build a mile direct link from further north on the GCR part of the new line to Banbury. A junction was to be made at Ashendon, between Princes Risborough and Grendon Underwood, and this GWR section of line would join the Oxford to Banbury line at a new junction at Aynho, not far south of Banbury. Under this revision, the actual joint section of the new construction was from Northolt Junction to Ashendon Junction, a distance of 34 miles, but the scheme involved a total of miles of new double track: the last major new railway construction in Great Britain until the Channel Tunnel Rail Link of 2003. Between Saunderton and Princes Risborough, the Wycombe Railway single line descended steeply and had a tight curve, and the new down line was to be deviated from it somewhat to ease the gradient to a maximum of 1 in 87 and to ease the curve. The abandoned formation of the original Wycombe Railway may still be detected.https://www.flickr.com/photos/rpmarks/3651417684/in/set-72157622711559785/ Former Wycombe Railway formation at Saunderton Even 1 in 87 was considered to be too steep an uphill gradient for heavily-laden freight trains heading for London, so the new up line was planned to take a slightly different alignment with a deep cutting and a short tunnel, enabling a maximum rising gradient of 1 in 167. In addition a new short line was to be built by the GWR between Ealing on the Reading main line and Greenford on the Northolt line. Construction and opening The single track from High Wycombe to Princes Risborough was taken over on 1 August 1899. Construction of the Joint Line and its approach routes was started in 1901, under the management of the Great Western Railway. R C Sikes was the resident engineer. The easternmost part of the GWR line forming a circuit from Old Oak Common through Park Royal and then curving to West Ealing, was opened on 15 June 1903, enabling a passenger service to Park Royal for the Royal Agricultural Show there. The line was closed again west of Park Royal from 10 August because of concerns about the stability of embankments after exceptionally heavy rainfall. The line opened again on 1 May 1904, and in October 1904 the short extension from Greenford East Junction to Greenford station was opened. The following year, on 20 November 1905 the whole line between Greenford and Grendon Underwood was opened for goods trains. At the same time the Neasden to Northolt GCR section was opened. On 1 March 1906 the latter section was opened for passenger trains in the form of railmotors. The first miles from Neasden were quadruple track; the remainder was double line. There were stations at Wembley Hill (on the four track section) and at Sudbury & Harrow Road railway station and at South Harrow; at the latter two places passenger loops were provided for the platforms, with the through lines in the centre. The GCR opened a short section from Neasden to South Harrow (later renamed Sudbury Hill (Harrow) from 1 March 1906. The Chalfont Viaduct was constructed 1902‚Äì1906 to cross the River Misbourne near Gerrards Cross. Passenger opening of the entire Joint Line took place on 2 April 1906; on that date stations were opened (or re- opened) at Ruislip & Ickenham, Denham, Gerrard's Cross, Beaconsfield, High Wycombe, Saunderton, Princes Risborough and Haddenham. All of the stations were laid out in lavish style, with the buildings in typical GWR designs. Greenford, Denham, Gerrard's Cross and Beaconsfield had passenger loops for the platforms. The Ashendon Junction to Grendon Underwood section, being Great Central territory, was designed in that company's style, which included the signalbox at Ashendon Junction. Intermediate stations on the section were Wotton and Akeman Street; these were also lavish structures. Goods facilities on the line were relatively limited, except at High Wycombe, in recognition of the fact that local goods traffic was unlikely to develop vigorously. The early train service was dominated by GWR trains from Paddington to Oxford and Aylesbury and GCR long distance expresses and local stopping trains. The Bicester cut-off Quainton Road station; now a heritage railway centreAn essential part of the GWR intentions was the mile connection between Ashendon Junction and Aynho Junction, referred to as the Bicester Cut-off. Powers were obtained for the construction in 1905. The topography of the area was unfavourable to railway routing and a tunnel (Ardley Tunnel) of 1147 yards and two large viaducts were required. Grade-separated junctions were provided at each end of the line, at Ashendon and Aynho Junctions. The Bicester Cut-off was opened for goods traffic on 4 April 1910 and to passengers on 1 July 1910. The new route as between London and Birmingham was miles shorter than the former route via Oxford, and a shortening of the fastest journey time of 20 minutes (from 140 to 120 minutes) was achieved; most of the through trains were immediately transferred to the new route. There were stations at Brill & Ludgershall, Blackthorn, Bicester and Ardley and a halt at Aynho Park. Brill, Bicester and Ardley stations had the four track layout with platform loop lines. Bicester was the only place with a substantial goods facility. Status of the Joint Line Jenkins makes clear the status of the Joint Line: > The G.W. & G. C. was never a \\"Joint Railway\\" in the sense that the M. & G. > N. Jt. or Somerset & Dorset lines were joint: it owned no engines or rolling > stock of its own, and was not a system in its own right (a railway from > Northolt to Ashendon would be completely useless without its vital links to > the parent companies.)Jenkins, page 14 The ownership of the completed construction was: * Old Oak Common West Junction to Northolt Junction: 7 miles; GWR Greenford to West Ealing: miles; GWR * Neasden Junction to Northolt Junction: miles; GCR; * Northolt Junction to Ashendon Junction: 34 miles; GWR and GCR jointly; * Ashendon Junction to Grendon Underwood Junction: miles; GCR; this had originally been intended to be part of the joint line, but was transferred from the Joint Committee to the GCR by Act of 1907; * Ashendon Junction to Aynho Junction: miles; GWR. The existing Aylesbury branch of the Wycombe Railway was taken into the control of the Joint Committee. It was 7 miles 18 chains in length. From 1907 Aylesbury station was under the joint control of two joint committees, the GW & GC Joint Committee and the Great Central and Metropolitan Railways Joint Committee.H C Casserley, Britain's Joint Lines, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1968, Suburban development Neasden Junction looking north; a football special from Wembley is leaving the route from NortholtAt the time of opening of the line, much of the route passed through undeveloped rural terrain. The companies anticipated the development of new suburban housing, as had happened on the Metropolitan Railway main line, although this proved slower to take place than was hoped. New stations were opened progressively to encourage business: Old Oak Lane Halt in 1906; Northolt Halt in 1907; Brentham Halt in 1911; Denham Golf Club Platform in 1912; Beaconsfield Golf Links Platform in 1915. Steam railmotors were used on the London end of the line from 1903, giving the potential for frequent low-cost local passenger train operation. In 1907 a branch line was opened by the GWR from Denham to Uxbridge; the work cost ¬£87,459. The trains ran from Gerrards Cross, starting on 24 April; goods traffic started on 11 May 1914. The line was originally intended to connect through to the Vine Street station, terminus of the earlier Uxbridge branch from West Drayton. Although some land for the connection was acquired, the through section was never built, and the branch remained a dead end; it as two miles in length and double track until 1922, when it as reduced to single line. In 1912 the GCR purchased a rail-car using petrol-electric traction. It was a small bogie vehicle equipped with a 90 hp six-cylinder petrol engine driving a 55 KW multi-polar dynamo. Maximum speed was 40 m.p.h. on the level. The rest of the car consisted of two passenger saloons accommodating between them 50 passengers on rattan covered reversible seats; hanging straps were also provided for standing passengers. A middle entrance gave access to both compartments. Fay told the press that ‚ÄòMy view is that we shall see oil electric cars running on the railways and supplanting ordinary steam engines to a very great extent.' On 28 March 1912 it ran a trial trip from Marylebone to South Harrow and back, when it attained 50 m.p.h. For a period it remained in the London area, sometimes hauling an ancient ex-MS&L; six-wheeled composite as a trailer, but it was unsuccessful and its last days were spent on the Great Central & North Stafford joint line in the mid-1930s.George Dow, volume III, pages 318 and 319; Edwards and Pigram say that at the first opening of the GCR Neasden to Northolt line, Sudbury Hill (Harrow). station \\"became a terminus for a short time of the first passenger services on the line (1 March to 2 April 1906). The service was worked by a revolutionary vehicle - a petrol-electric rail car powered by a 90hp engine. The rail car had a top speed of 40 mph and seated 50 passengers in four compartments.\\" This appears to be the same vehicle, but the date must be a mistake. World War I to nationalisation (1918 to 1948) After World War I the anticipated suburban development took effect more vigorously, and in due course Harefield and Ruislip Gardens stations were opened. On 15 February 1918 a serious slip became apparent behind the massive retaining wall west of Wembley Hill station. On 18 February all four tracks had to be closed while remedial work was undertaken; through trains were diverted to Paddington. In a few minutes a 200 yard section of the wall had moved bodily forward by more than twenty feet. Two temporary tracks were got open in seven days; the final cost of restoration was over ¬£84,000. On 18 July 1918 a serious slip took place at Wembley Hill, on the GCR approach line from Neasden. The location had originally been intended to run in tunnel, but a very deep cutting (70 feet) was substituted. The line was closed for two weeks while remedial work was carried out; GCR passenger services ran to Paddington during the closure. South Ruislip station and Northolt Junction in modern times; the former GW route is to the right and the GCR route is to the leftIn 1923 the main line railways were \\"grouped\\" into one or other of four new large railway companies; the Great Central Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway; the Great Western Railway was restructured with the addition of some South Wales concerns, but the new company retained the Great Western Railway name. For the time being the London \\"Underground\\" network was not treated in this way, but in 1933 the London Passenger Transport Board was formed, taking over the Metropolitan Railway and other London Underground lines. The LPTB in collaboration with the LNER and GWR examined ways in which the now-heavy suburban business in Middlesex might be handled, and a scheme was formulated which became part of the 1935 ‚Äì 1940 New Works Programme; the GWR would build new electrified tracks from North Acton, on the Ealing and Shepherds Bush line, running alongside the Joint Line as far as Denham. The authorising Act was secured in 1936 and by the outbreak of World War II the new track was ready as far as Greenford. Work was suspended during the war, and in fact the new track was lifted and used for emergency purposes elsewhere. After the war the scheme was resumed, but only as far as West Ruislip, opening throughout on 21 November 1948. Northolt station was transferred to LT control (the remainder being transferred to LT in 1967); at Greenford a new bay platform was provided between the LT platforms for the Ealing Broadway steam service, freeing up the through platforms at Greenford for trains towards High Wycombe. During the 1930s the majority of the through express services were operated by the GWR; the route formed its main line to Birmingham and Birkenhead. The GCR express operation was rather reduced, concentrating on the route via Amersham; the GCR operated most of the local suburban services. About 25 goods trains ran each way daily, broadly shared between the two companies. The GWR Denham to Uxbridge branch had never fulfilled its potential, and the passenger service was discontinued in 1939. During World War II the line experienced heavy goods traffic in common with many other routes; the well laid out line with long straight loops and other ample facilities served well in the emergency, and in contrast to many other routes, relatively little enhancement of the infrastructure was necessary to cope. In 1948 the main line railways of Great Britain were taken into public ownership, under British Railways. The route was allocated to the Western Region, but the Marylebone train services were operated by the Eastern Region, perpetuating an element of the \\"joint\\" status of the line. Under British Railways: from 1948 The allocation of the Marylebone services to the Eastern Region did not last long, and repeated changes of management structure took place. The trunk line status of the Great Central Railway London extension was viewed as an unnecessary duplication, and many of the best express passenger trains were transferred away from the route. The Master Cutler, a prime Sheffield express was moved to the Kings Cross route in 1958 (and later still to the Midland main line). On the other hand, the Western Region trains from Paddington to Birmingham and beyond continued, and the majority of the suburban trains on the route ran to Marylebone. The primacy of steam ceased when all the Marylebone local trains were operated by diesel multiple units from June 1962, and the Birmingham main line trains were progressively transferred to diesel haulage from the same time. In the 1960s the loss of business on the railways was exercising government, and the Beeching Report resulted in closure of the Great Central London Extension north of Quainton Road on 3 September 1966. The Denham to Uxbridge branch had also declined substantially as a goods line since 1939 and was closed completely in the 1960s. Looking south from Gerrards CrossThe former LNWR route from Euston to Birmingham and Crewe was developed at this time as the primary route on that axis. During the electrification and infrastructure improvement works, Birmingham express passenger traffic was concentrated on the Western Region route over the Joint Line. On inauguration of the enhanced Euston route, the Joint line ceased to have validity as a trunk line, and from 5 March 1967 through long distance services were removed from the line. The intermediate stations received a somewhat enhanced semi-fast service. In the Autumn of 1968 the line between Princes Risborough and Aynho Junction (26 miles) was singled, and in 1974 many through semi-fast trains were diverted away from the line, to run via Oxford. Closure of branches The Thame line, between Princes Risborough and Oxford, closed to passenger traffic on 7 January 1963. An oil terminal at Thame and a car factory at Morris Cowley kept the extremities of the route open for goods traffic for the time being. On 4 May 1969 the former Wycombe Railway line between High Wycombe and Bourne End was closed. Present day use The Chiltern Main Line now passes over the M25 motorway via the Chalfont Viaduct During a period of decline in the 1960s and afterwards, the remaining part of the Joint Line and the approach lines were from Banbury to Marylebone, and from Northolt Junction to Old Oak Common (as well as the Greenford to West Ealing line). The route is now described as the Chiltern Main Line. The use of the line was revitalised following privatisation of the train operations in Great Britain, and Chiltern Railways operated an increasingly improved secondary service between London (Marylebone) and Birmingham (Moor Street). This was attractive politically as providing competition to the dominant route from Euston via Rugby. The Chiltern operation continues at the present day (2020) with frequent passenger services between Birmingham and London, enhanced by the construction of a spur at Bicester (connecting to the west to east Oxford to Bletchley line) enabling Oxford to London services to run via Bicester.

It is about west of Pickering. It lies on the main road between Malton and Kirkbymoorside. In the old days Normanby had 14 alehouses and was a major stopping point due to its location halfway between Teesside and Humberside. These days Normanby has only one pub and a church. All the houses in Normanby are built along the busy main road. The bridge to the south of the village was built in the mid 18th century and is narrow, so in recent years it has been the scene of many accidents. The bridge takes traffic over the River Seven which runs to the east of the village on its way from Rosedale to the River Rye further south. St Andrew's Church, Normanby History The manor of Normanby is mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086. It was granted by the Crown to St. Mary's Abbey, York. At the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII granted the manor to William Romesden of Longley and Richard Vavasour of Ripon. It was later passed to the Meynell family of Hawnby until the estate was split up in the 1680s. St Andrew's Church is a Grade II* listed building; it dates back to the 12th century, with medieval pillars and nave arches surviving. The church was partly rebuilt and restored in the 1890s by Temple Moore. The church bells are 18th and 19th century, one cast by Thomas Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1795, the smaller bell by Warner & Sons in 1895.

The Concourse is located in Singapore's \\"Golden Mile\\", which refers to the strip of land between Nicoll Highway and Beach Road. It was planned by the Singapore Government as a high-rise spine fronting Kallang Basin. The area used to be occupied by squatters and small marine industries. The Concourse's site was acquired in competition in the Urban Redevelopment Authority's 8th Sales of Sites programme in 1979. The project, developed by Cheong Eak Chong's Hong Fok Corporation, commenced in 1981 as the Hong Fok Centre but construction stopped when Singapore's economy was hit by a recession in the mid-1980s. In 1987, the architectural firm Architects 61 and architect Paul Rudolph re-designed the complex. They retained what was already constructed, and revamped the remainder in order to accommodate new programmatic requirements. Built at a cost of S$248.1 million and to a height of 175 metres (574 ft) for its office tower, The Concourse was completed on 5 February 1994. Architecture The Concourse is a mixed-use development, comprising a 41-story office tower, a three-level retail podium and nine storeys of serviced apartments. The three distinct components, with their different usage, have separate entrances. These overlook the traditional low-rise shophouses and office blocks in the Beach Road area. Paul Rudolph designed The Concourse as a \\"Tropical Skyscraper\\". His use of solar shading, wide overhangs, and communal gardens and external balconies has some similarities with the ideas advanced by Ken Yeang for the bioclimatic skyscraper. The correlation between form and function arises out of Rudolph's grounding in modern architecture, for he was taught by Walter Gropius at Harvard University. Approaching the city from Singapore Changi Airport, The Concourse's tower stands out as a landmark because of its distinctive silhouette when viewed from across the Kallang Basin. The tower is octagonal in plan, as the number \\"8\\" for the octagon is associated with prosperity in Chinese culture, and is typical of Paul Rudolph's buildings. It is also supported by huge pilotis, a feature that is shared with The Colonnade in Singapore. The distinctive soaring effect of the tower is accentuated by these lofty columns on the first storey which also effectively elevate the building, but is mitigated by the faceted fa√ßade of the serviced apartments and retail podium. The Concourse's most prominent architectural feature is the aluminium curtain wall system incorporating inclined windows that form clusters of units. These interlocking clusters are stacked vertically, like dinner plates, one above the other, rotating around the building. A five-storey atrium lobby greets visitors to The Concourse, and 14 sky-atria within the tower form reception lobbies for multinational corporations and organisations. The serviced apartment units in the lower block vary in size, and facilities include a swimming pool, squash courts and a fitness centre. The apartments overlook Nicoll Highway and the Kallang River Basin. Shops are arranged around a three-storey sky-lit atrium in the retail podium. Due to its unique and unconventional building design, a scale model of The Concourse once went for an architectural exhibition tour around the world.

Average clutch sizes range from one (as in condors) to about seventeen (the grey partridge). Clutch size may vary latitudinally within a species. Some birds lay eggs even when the eggs have not been fertilized; it is not uncommon for pet owners to find their lone bird nesting on a clutch of infertile eggs, which are sometimes called wind-eggs. Colors Guillemot eggs The default color of vertebrate eggs is the white of the calcium carbonate from which the shells are made, but some birds, mainly passerines, produce colored eggs. The pigments biliverdin and its zinc chelate give a green or blue ground color, and protoporphyrin produces reds and browns as a ground color or as spotting. Non-passerines typically have white eggs, except in some ground-nesting groups, such as the Charadriiformes, sandgrouse and nightjars, where camouflage is necessary, and some parasitic cuckoos, which lay eggs that often closely match the passerine host's egg. To varying degrees of success, host passerine species have combined speckles, blotches and other egg markings with visual pattern-recognition abilities to help them reject cuckoos‚Äô counterfeit eggs. Most other passerines, in contrast, lay colored eggs, even if there is no need of cryptic colors. However, the photographic markings on passerine eggs have been suggested to reduce brittleness by acting as a solid state lubricant.Solomon, S.E. (1987). Egg shell pigmentation. In Egg Quality : Current Problems and Recent Advances (eds R.G. Wells & C.G. Belyarin). Butterworths, London, pp. 147‚Äì157. If insufficient calcium is available in the local soil, the egg shell may be thin, especially in a circle around the broad end. Protoporphyrin speckling compensates for this, and increases inversely to the amount of calcium in the soil. To understand the functional significance of eggshell spotting (or maculation) it is important to quantify this pigmentation For the same reason, later eggs in a clutch are more spotted than early ones, as the female's store of calcium is depleted. Birds which build in trees generally have blue or greenish eggs, either spotted or unspotted, while birds that build in bushes or near or on the ground are likely to lay speckled eggs. The color of individual eggs is also genetically influenced, and appears to be inherited through the mother only, suggesting the gene responsible for pigmentation is on the female-specific W chromosome (female birds are WZ, males are ZZ). Color was once thought to be applied to the shell immediately before laying, but this research shows coloration is an integral part of the development of the shell, with the same protein responsible for depositing calcium carbonate, or protoporphyrins when there is a lack of that mineral. In species such as the common guillemot, which nest in large groups, each female's eggs have very different markings, making it easier for females to identify their own eggs on the crowded cliff ledges on which they breed. Shell Bird eggshells are diverse. For example: *Cormorant eggs are rough and chalky *Tinamou eggs are shiny *Duck eggs are oily and waterproof *Cassowary eggs are heavily pitted Tiny pores in a bird eggshell allow the embryo to breathe. The domestic hen's egg has around 7500 pores. Shape The shape of eggs varies considerably across bird species, ranging from near-spherical (such as those of the little bee-eater) to highly pyriform or conical (such as those of the common murre) with the familiar shape of the chicken egg lying in between. Early scientific investigators of egg shape Gunther, F. C. (1792). Sammlung von Nestern und Eyern verschiedener Vogel. Nurnburg suggested that the oval shape of eggs was caused by the egg being forced through the oviduct by peristalsis. In this often-repeated Ryder, J. A. (1893). Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. 31, 203.Thompson, D'A. W. (1908). Nature, Lond., 78, m, 158.Thompson, D'A. W. (1942). On Growth and Form. Cambridge but incorrect theory of egg shape formation, the contraction and relaxation of the muscles which push the egg down the oviduct cause the spherical egg membrane to distort slightly into an ovoid shape, with the blunt end caudal (i.e. furthest down the oviduct and closest to the cloaca). The calcification of the egg in the shell gland/uterus then fixes it in this shape, and the egg is laid with the blunt end appearing first (for a diagram showing the different sections of the bird oviduct, see here). However, this theory has been refuted by studies of egg shell formation in a number of bird species using techniques such as X-ray photography Bradfield, J.R.G., 1951. Radiographic studies on the formation of the hen's egg shell. J. Exp. Biol., 28:125-140Romanoff, A.L. and A.J. Romanoff, 1949. The Avian Egg. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York which have demonstrated that egg shape is determined in the oviduct isthmus (before shell calcification) with the pointed end caudal (furthest down the oviduct). These observations cannot be explained by peristalsis. It has been proposed Bradfield, J.R.G., 1951. Radiographic studies on the formation of the hen's egg shell. J. Exp. Biol., 28:125-140 that the egg acquires its shape (with the pointed egg caudal) as it is forced through the narrow isthmus, but this assertion has not been thoroughly verified. Cliff-nesting birds often have highly conical eggs. They are less likely to roll off, tending instead to roll around in a tight circle; this trait is likely to have arisen due to evolution via natural selection. In contrast, many hole-nesting birds have nearly spherical eggs. The shape has biological significance. A pointed egg will tend to sit on its side, with the big end tipped upward. The big end contains the air sac and its shell is pierced by a higher density of pores than the more pointed end. Tipping the big end upwards improves oxygen flow to the large head, with the physiologically demanding eyes and brain, that develops in the big end while the tail develops at the more pointed end. In a 2017 publication in the journal Science, mathematical modeling of 50,000 bird eggs data showed that bird egg shape is a product of flight adaptations and not the outcome of nesting conditions or a bird's life history. Mary Caswell Stoddard, Ee Hou Yong, Derya Akkaynak, Catherine Sheard, Joseph A. Tobias and L. Mahadevan (2017) Avian egg shape: Form, function, and evolution, Science 356 (6344), 1249-1254. DOI: 10.1126/science.aaj1945 A strong correlation was found between egg shape and flight ability on broad taxonomic scales, such that birds engaging in high powered flights usually maximize egg size by having elliptical shaped eggs while maintaining a streamlined body plan. Selection acting during incubation, such as breeding site and incubation posture, are also thought to influence egg-shape variation across birds. File:Vanellus spinosus MHNT.pngClassic oval bird egg (Spur-winged lapwing) File:Senegal egg 10s06.JPGAlmost spherical bird egg (Senegal parrot) File:Uria aalge MHNT Rouzic.jpgLong, \\"elliptical\\" bird egg (Common murre) Size right Egg size tends to be proportional to the size of the adult bird, from the half gram egg of the bee hummingbird to the 1.5 kg egg of the ostrich. Kiwis have disproportionately large eggs, up to 20% of the female's body weight. This evolutionary trait results in kiwi chicks that can emerge from the nest days after hatching, ready to start foraging for food.  Number  The number of eggs laid in a single brood is referred to as the clutch. Clutch size is usually within a small range of variation. Some birds respond to the accidental loss of eggs by laying a replacement egg. Others will stop laying based on the apparent size of the clutch. According to whether they respond to addition, removal, or both addition and removal of eggs, birds are classified as determinate layers (number of eggs laid is predetermined and do not respond to change) or as indeterminate layers. In general birds, birds with small clutch size tended to be indeterminate. Predation thumb Many animals feed on eggs. For example, the principal predators of the black oystercatcher's eggs include raccoons, skunks, mink, river and sea otters, gulls, crows and foxes. The stoat (Mustela erminea) and long-tailed weasel (M. frenata) steal ducks' eggs. Snakes of the genera Dasypeltis and Elachistodon specialize in eating eggs. Humans have a long history of both eating wild bird eggs and raising birds for farmed eggs for consumption. Brood parasitism occurs in birds when one species lays its eggs in the nest of another. In some cases, the host's eggs are removed or eaten by the female, or expelled by her chick. Brood parasites include the cowbirds and many Old World cuckoos. Evolution Today, the hard shells of bird eggs are unique among animals. However, this trait evolved in the larger group to which birds belong: the dinosaurs. The bird egg is thus a special kind of dinosaur egg. Eggs of the modern type, with an inner mammillary, more outer prismatic and an outer crystalline layer, appear during the Jurassic and are associated with fossils of the Maniraptora.Carpenter, Kenneth. 1999.

When constructing the dress, the bodice and skirt are joined together by combining the skirt darts into one dart; this aligns the skirt darts with the bodice waist dart. The dress emphasizes the waist as its skirt portion is fitted. While the sheath dress can come in many patterns and lengths, it often is worn with short sleeves and reaches knee length. Ancient Egypt Egyptian - Female Tomb Figure - Walters 2215 Originating in the ancient world, the sheath dress is commonly seen in Egyptian art. Presented as slender and youthful, artistic renditions of the women in the garment are common prior to the New Kingdom. Although there were no archeological evidence of a sheath dress among the elite, women and deities are shown wearing said garment in tomb drawings. The garment was often presented with a seam under the breast and with beads. Ancient depictions of elite women showed the dress paired with the tripartite wig and vulture headdress. With archaeologists finding nearly twenty dresses of the ancient Egyptian world, there is no record of the dress ever existing in reality. Instead, scholars have hypothesized that the sheath dress as we know it were wrap dresses with straps, skirts, or a V neck dress. 19th century The Princess Sheath dress was popular between 1878 and 1880. It was associated with the Princess of Wales, later known as Queen Alexandra. The Princess sheath is constructed with the bodice and skirt cut in one with a gored skirt. The dress was worn without a bustle but with a small pad. To tighten the front of the dress, ribbons were attached in the back's interior. 1900s The Ladies' home journal (1948) (14578977850)During the early 1900s, Americans were still looking to Paris for the latest trends. American socialites traveled to Europe to view collections and receive custom outfits. Paul Poiret is credited as the first designer of the modern sheath dress. In doing so, he also created a rubber girdle as an alternative to the boned corset to wear under the dress. In great contrast to the emphasized curves of Victorian era and earlier dress, the sheath dress offered a sleek look that revealed the legs and lower torso with a slit. The style of the sheath dress reached the United States in 1908. That fall, the production of Bandanna Land, a musical, included the song \\"Sheath Gown in Darktown\\", which the chorus goes: Oh there's trouble down in Old Darktown, Since Bella came with that sheath gown, Imported walk and smile, and all that foreign style, And all the girls are badly hurt as they watch her flirt that see-more skirt. The sheath gown it's got Darktown, and will hold it for a while. 1950s By the 1950s, the sheath dress became the modern look for American women. In 1950, Christian Dior introduced the \\"Vertical Line\\". The line catered to a woman's body and her curves in comparison to previous years. From the line, Vogue called the sheath dress the \\"most important single day fashion\\". In 1956, a girdle sales manager remarked ‚ÄúThe sheath paid for my house in Westport.‚Äù Pattern companies sold sheath cuts up to size 22 ¬Ω and 41 inch bust size. The dress was referred to as ‚Äúthe slim look for five o‚Äôclock on‚Äù. For a casual look, the sheath dress was matched with a short sleeve print bolero. As a business attire, a box jacket when over the bolero as well as the dress. As the cut of the dress became easier to construct, textures were added to the dress such as beads. 1960s One of the most notable sheath dresses of all time is the black Givenchy dress of Audrey Hepburn. In 1961, Hepburn wore a Hubert de Givenchy black sheath dress in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. By this time, her dress became known as the little black dress. On May 19, 1962, Marilyn Monroe sang happy birthday to then president John F. Kennedy for his 45th birthday. At the event, Monroe wore a Jean Louis sheath dress that is described as \\"skin and beads\\". The dress was made nude toned, backless, and clad with crystals. Monroe was sewn into the dress for a tight fit. In 2016, the Jean Louis design sold for $4.8 million. 21st century In recent years, the sheath dress is worn as a cocktail dress. The pattern can also be seen worn on brides as sheath dresses are popular as wedding dresses; the style is recommended for slim brides who are either tall or petite. At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Michelle Obama wore a purple crepe sheath dress designed by Maria Pinto. This dress was made notable when Michelle gave her husband, Barack Obama a fist bump on stage.

It was a leading manufacturer of control systems technology primarily serving the transportation and telecommunication industries. In late 1998 it was bought for US$2 billion by a much smaller company, SPX Corporation. History General Signal Technology Corp. was a technology manufacturing company making control equipment and systems. It traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GSX. In 1986, General Signal acquired Drytek, Inc., a plasma dry-etch company founded in August 1980 by Arthur W. Zafiropoulo. From that time he served as Drytek's President and CEO under General Signal as well.2004 Annual Report, Ultratech, Inc. In July 1987 Zafiropoulo also became President of Kayex, a semiconductor equipment manufacturer unit of General Signal. In 1988, the company acquired Mirtone. In February 1989, Zafiropoulo was promoted to become President of General Signal's subsidiary Semiconductor Equipment Group International, yet another semiconductor equipment company. He held the dual position of President of both that company and of Kayex at that time. In September 1990, Zafiropoulo was promoted to President of General Signal's Ultratech Stepper Division. In March 1993 Zafiropoulo acquired certain assets and liabilities of the Ultratech Stepper Division of General Signal, and the new company became independent, as Ultratech Stepper, Inc. Zafiropoulo became the President, CEO and Chairman of the newly independent Ultratech Stepper. Later it was renamed Ultratech, Inc. In 1993 General Signal sold off Drytek, Inc. to Lam Research Corporation. General Signal became further streamlined in the mid 1990s through the divestment of Leeds & Northrup, which had formerly been part of the process controls sector. It also divested Dynapower/Stratopower, which had formerly been a part of the industrial technology sector.General Signal Corporation information, Business.com In 1997 General Signal reported US$1.95 billion in sales.SPX to buy General Signal, Electrical Wholesaling, Douglas Chandler, Sep. 1, 1998 Electrical controls accounted for nearly half of 1997 revenues, with process controls making up a third, and industrial technology, less than a fifth.

By 1997 the company had a presence on the internet at https://archive.is/20130123221732/http://www.generalsignal.com/ which now redirects to the SPX website. SPX buyout In 1995 SPX Corporation of Muskegon, Michigan had been a slow growth Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 company, primarily making tools for servicing automobile engine parts such as piston rings by vehicle dealers and service shops.Standard & Poor's Stock Guide, October 1995 A former General Electric executive, John Blystone, then took over SPX as CEO and SPX's share price then rose almost fourfold during his two-and-a-half year tenure since late 1995. By August 1998, with 1997 sales of just under US$1 billion, SPX moved to acquire General Signal Corp., a company twice its size, for US$45 per share in stock and cash, in a US$2 billion deal. With the acquisition SPX sought to enter the electrical and industrial controls business. The deal was completed in the fourth quarter of 1998. General Signal shareholders ended up with 60% ownership of the combined entity, which retained the SPX Corporation name and headquarters. Michael Lockhart, General Signal's President and CEO, left upon completion of the acquisition, along with General Signal's other senior officers. SPX expected to receive cost savings of US$55 million to US$60 million by 1999 in the first full year after the merger.

In October 2002 Kabila negotiated the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying eastern Congo. Two months later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a government of national unity. The transitional period came to end with the completion of the 2006 general election and the swearing in of Kabila as President on December 6, 2006. On December 17, 2002 the Congolese parties of the Inter Congolese Dialogue, namely: the national government, the MLC, the RCD, the RCD-ML, the RCD-N, the domestic political opposition, representatives of civil society and the Mai Mai, signed the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement. The Agreement obliges the parties to a plan to reunify the country, disarm and integrate the warring parties and hold elections. There have been numerous problems, resulting in continued instability in much of the country and a delay in the scheduled national elections from June 2005 to March 2006, later pushed back again to 30 July 2006.Fears over DR Congo campaigning, BBC News, 12 June 2006 This agreement marked the formal end of the Second Congo War. Three rebel groups supported by Uganda, the MLC, RCD-N and RCD-ML, signed a ceasefire, the Gbadolite Agreement, on December 31, 2002. This obliged them to immediately stop all fighting in the Isiro-Bafwasende-Beni-Watsa quadrangle and to accept United Nations military observers in the area. It also contained guarantees of the freedom of movement of the civilian population and humanitarian organizations from one area to another. This treaty was violated numerous times. 2003 A transitional government was set up in July 2003; Joseph Kabila remains as president and now has four vice presidents representing the former government, former rebel groups, and the political opposition. Despite the formal end of hostilities the conflict continued. During January and February 2003, MONUC observed numerous hostile troop movements, mainly between Uganda, Rwanda and their respective proxies. On May 1, 2003 Uganda withdrew its regular forces from Bunia and Ituri in-line with the Luanda Agreement. Fighting erupted between the Hema and Lendu ethnic groups between 7 May and 16 May in Bunia. On 30 June a transitional government composed of the various groups of the Inter Congolese Dialogue was formed. Over the course of September, a reinforced MONUC presence carried out the \\"Bunia, weapon-free zone\\" operation to demilitarize the province. They were partially successful, though a low-grade conflict continues to permeate the region. In September 2004 between 20,000 and 150,000 people fled unrest in the eastern Kivu province caused by an advance of government troops against breakaway national army soldiers. On October 1, 2004, the UN Security Council decided to deploy 5,900 more soldiers to the MONUC mission in Congo, although UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan had asked for some 12,000. In this period the International Rescue Committee reported that the conflict was killing 1,000 people a day, and called the international response \\"abysmal\\". Comparing the war with Iraq, it said that during 2004 Iraq received aid worth the equivalent of $138 per person, whilst the Congo received $3 per person. 2004 In late November 2004 Rwandan president Paul Kagame declared that Rwanda retained the option of sending troops into Congo to fight Hutu militants, in particular the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) that has not yet been disarmed as promised in the 2002 Pretoria Agreement. As of mid-December 2004 there were many reports that Rwandan forces had crossed the border. MONUC chief M'Hand Djalouzi, commenting on the reports, said on December 1, \\"Infiltration is nothing new but this is something else, it has the appearance of an invasion.\\" It remains unclear whether the Rwandan military is holding territory or carrying out temporary operations. The UN has promised to investigate. On December 16, the BBC reported that 20,000 civilians had fled fighting in the North Kivu town of Kanyaboyonga, 100 miles north of Goma. Antigovernment forces led by a Captain Kabakuli Kennedy, who has stated that he is fighting to defend the Banyamulenge, has routed loyalist government forces and holds the town and the surrounding mountains. The government sent a mediation team to investigate and accused Rwanda of supporting another insurgency. Rwanda has denied any involvement in the fighting. The International Crisis Group released a report on 17 December warning that the Rwandan intervention threatened to roll back the progress made in years of peace talks. They further noted that the two recent wars both began in similar circumstances to that existing presently in the Kivus and that another regional war was entirely possible if diplomatic efforts were not made. Later in 2004, Nkunda's forces began clashing with the DRC army in Sud-Kivu and by May 2004, occupied Bukavu where he was accused of committing war crimes.\\"Rebel troops capture Bukavu and threaten third Congo war\\" , The Independent, June 3, 2004 Nkunda claimed he was attempting to prevent genocide against Tutsis in the region,\\"DRC: Interview with rebel general Laurent Nkunda\\", IRIN, September 2, 2006 a claim rejected by MONUC,\\"DRC: UN preliminary report rules out genocide in Bukavu\\" , IRIN, January 17, 2004 and denied the claim that he was following orders from Rwanda. Following UN negotiations which secured the withdrawal of Nkunda's troops from Bukuvu back to the Masisi forests, part of his army split, and led by Colonel Jules Mutebusi left for Rwanda. About 150,000 Kinyarwanda-speaking people (Nkunda's own language) were reported to have fled from Sud-Kivu to Nord-Kivu in fear of reprisal attacks by DRC army.\\"DRC: Government troops seize rebel stronghold, general says\\" , IRIN, September 14, 2004 2005 On January 25, 2005 the UN reported that Uganda and Rwanda were continuing to arm insurgent groups in eastern Congo, in violation of a United Nations arms embargo in the region. Both nations denied any wrongdoing, and the UPDF spokesman suggested that MONUC was useless and should be disbanded. Meanwhile, a meeting of African leaders in Abuja agreed to send more peacekeepers to the Congo and tasked with disarming the mainly Hutu rebel forces in an attempt to stem the escalating tensions. In response, a spokesman of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda stated on 2 February that the FDLR would resist with force any attempt to disarm it. The same day US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice welcomed senior officials from the DRC, Uganda and Rwanda to Washington, DC for talks aimed at easing tensions in the region. Ituri (highlighted) is just north of Nord-Kivu On February 25, the resilience of the Ituri conflict was demonstrated when nine Bangladeshi MONUC peacekeepers were ambushed and killed by unidentified gunmen while patrolling an internally displaced persons camp in Kafe in Ituri Province. This was the largest single loss of peacekeeper life since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Floribert Ndjabu, the leader of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) militia operating in northeastern Ituri was arrested, while three other militia leaders were questioned. MONUC forces assaulted an FNI stronghold and killed fifty militia members, in what the Secretary-General referred to as \\"self-defense.\\" On March 31 the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) stated that it was giving up the armed struggle and returning to Rwanda to form a political party. This announcement followed talks mediated by Sant'Egidio in Rome with Congolese government representatives. If carried out by the various FDLR commanders, a return would remove one of the major sources of tensions in the region. The Rwandan government stated that any returnee who participated in the Rwandan genocide would face justice. In December 2005 UN and Congolese troops launched an operation in the Ituri district in order to restore peace and drive out the Ugandan-backed rebels. 2006 The constitution of the DRC was formally adopted on 19 February 2006 after it was approved in a popular referendum in December. A new national flag was adopted.Arnaud Zajtman, New DR Congo constitution adopted, BBC News, 19 February 2006 With UN assistance, on July 30, 2006 free first multi-party elections were held since independence in 1960. After this Joseph Kabila took 45% of the votes and his opponent Jean-Pierre Bemba took 20%. That was the origin of a fight between the two parts from August 20‚Äì22, 2006 in the streets of the capital, Kinshasa. Sixteen people died before policemen and UN mission MONUC took control of the city. A run-off election was held on 29 October 2006. On November 11, with 65% of the votes counted and Kabila holding the lead with 61% to Bemba's 39%, and with some of Bemba's supporters claiming election fraud, fighting again broke out in the streets of Kinshasa between soldiers supporting each candidate, killing two civilians. 2007 Tutsi- majority army brigades fought with the Hutu Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) throughout 2007. More than 165,000 people fled the fighting. The United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo and human rights activists accused the army of targeting civilian centers sympathetic to the FDLR. The Bravo Brigade allegedly murdered 15 civilians in Buramba village in March. General Gabriel Amisi temporarily halted operations against the FDLR in August, saying operations would resume when ethnically mixed brigades would replace the current Tutsi-majority forces.U.N. finds half-buried corpses at Congo army camp SignOnSandiego See also *Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo *Transitional National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ReferencesExternal links *International Center for Transitional Justice, Democratic Republic of the Congo *Global and Inclusive Agreement on Transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, signed in Pretoria, South Africa on 16 December 2002 *CIA World Factbook *Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments - DRC *MONUC website *United States Holocaust Memorial Museum - Ripples of Genocide: Journey through Eastern Congo, testimonials from foreign visitors from 2002 and 2003 Democratic Republic of the Congo ","title":"2000s in the Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"id":"12777721","text":"Aleksandar Mutavd≈æiƒá (Serbian Cyrillic: –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä M—É—Ça–≤—ü–∏—õ, born 3 January 1977 in Kraljevo) is a Serbian footballer who plays as a left midfielder.

In order to be able to take the test, one must be a permanent resident of Australia and one must have applied for Australian citizenship. It was introduced in 2007 to assess the applicants' adequate knowledge of Australia, the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship and basic knowledge of the English language. The format of the test was amended in 2009. History In December 2006, it was announced that applicants for Australian citizenship who are over 18 and under 60 years old will need to pass an Australian citizenship test. The objective of the test is to prove an applicant's grasp of English language and understanding of Australia's \\"values\\", history, traditional and national symbols. Citizenship applicants are required to study a booklet produced by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. On 2 January 2008, it was announced that the test would be reviewed when statistics showed that over 20% of those sitting the test failed on their first attempts. Article highlighting failure rates On 28 April 2008 the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, announced the appointment of an independent committee to conduct a review of the Australian citizenship test since its implementation on 1 October 2007. Independent committee to review citizenship test This review was commissioned to examine the operation of the citizenship test after six months experience and whether there were ways to improve its operation and effectiveness as the pathway for residents to become Australian citizens. On 22 November 2008, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Evans, released the Citizenship Test Review Report Moving Forward ‚Ä¶ Improving Pathways to Citizenship and the Government's response. New Citizenship test to focus on responsibilities and privileges The report and the government's response are located online. On 19 October 2009, changes to the citizenship test came into effect. Under the new rules, a mark of 75% (15 out of 20 questions correct) is required to pass. Australian Citizenship Practice Test Previously, a mark of 60% plus answering three mandatory questions correctly was required. Applicants will need to pass in order for a decision on their citizenship application to proceed, i.e. the application must be lodged before the test takes place. About the citizenship test Test format The computer-based test consists of 20 multiple choice questions drawn randomly from a pool of 200 confidential questions. The test is only available in English. Applicants have 45 minutes to complete the test. The material is drawn from the official guide \\"Our common bond\\" published by the Australian Government Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC). Scheduling a time to take the test can be done by the DIAC. Wait times vary widely, and applicants may need to wait a considerable amount of time. As of 17 February 2009, one would need to wait almost four months to secure an appointment in central Sydney and over three months in Parramatta. In less congested areas, wait times are considerably less, if any; in Adelaide, for instance, an applicant needs to make an appointment online or by paper application to Adelaide DIAC office anytime.Department of Immigration & Citizenship website detailing how to make an appointment Questions and answers Although the following are not necessarily correct answers, they are correct in the context of the test. * Which one of these is a responsibility for every Australian citizen?

Their paintings and extensive collection of regional artifacts formed the genesis of what would later become the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies. The Alpine Club of Canada dedicated the Peter and Catharine Whyte Hut on the Peyto Glacier after the couple. Peter in the Canadian Rockies Peter Whyte was born on January 22, 1905 in Banff, Alberta, Canada,Mayberry, p. 28. the son of Dave White, a dry goods merchant from Banff who once worked as a Canadian Pacific Railway section man at Sawback, near Banff.Mayberry, p. 27. Peter's mother, Annie Curren White, was the daughter of John Donaldson Curren, who worked as a coal scout and painter. Dave White developed friendships with some of the traveling Stoney Indians, whose ancient hunting trail ran near White's Sawback section house. Growing up in Banff, Peter enjoyed various outdoor activities and sports, including skiing, hiking, and horseback riding.Mayberry, pp. 29‚Äì30. He also showed an interest in art, and soon learned to paint from local artists. The rugged beauty of the mountains and the larch-filled valleys inspired him to sketch and paint the world around him. He eventually considered painting as a career. Belmore Browne, an outdoorsman and painter, and Nora Drummond-Davis, an illustrator, provided Peter with private lessons in painting and illustration.Mayberry, pp. 31‚Äì33. Peter learned landscape techniques from studying the work of Belmore Browne, Aldro T. Hibbard, Carl Rungius, and the Group of Seven painter J. E. H. MacDonald.Mayberry, pp. 34. MacDonald visited Lake O'Hara in 1924 and returned every year to paint. Peter accompanied MacDonald on many of his outings, painting alongside the famous artist. In 1925, Peter painted with Aldro T. Hibbard, who encouraged him to enroll at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It was here in 1925 that Peter Whyte first met Catharine Robb. Catharine in New England Catharine Robb was born on June 13, 1906 in Concord, Massachusetts, and raised in an affluent household.Mayberry, pp. 19‚Äì20. Her father, Russell Robb, studied engineering at MIT and quickly became senior vice-president and treasurer of a successful engineering firm. Her mother, Edith Morse Robb, ran a successful embroidery design company. During summer vacations in Seal Harbor, Maine, Catharine dated John D. Rockefeller III for a time.Mayberry, p. 22. In December 1924, Catharine made her social debut at Boston's Hotel Somerset, but New England's high society did not interest her. Inspired by her mother's artistic interests, Catharine began her art education at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1925.Mayberry, p. 37. Love and education In late 1925, Catharine Robb met a quiet, dark-haired Canadian named Peter Whyte, who she described in one journal entry as \\"a Scotch friend\\".Mayberry, pp. 36‚Äì37. Together, they pursued a fairly traditional course of study, which included anatomy, figure drawing, and portrait painting.Mayberry, p. 38. What began as a casual friendship between the two art students slowly grew into a more intimate relationship, as they discovered their shared views on religion, philosophy, and life.Mayberry, pp. 39‚Äì40. Between semesters, Peter returned to Banff to work for the Brewster Transport Company, writing long letters to Catharine. When Catharine's father died in February 1927, Peter provided comfort and support.Mayberry, p. 41. During this time, Peter openly declared his feelings for Catharine, and by the spring of 1928, Catharine reciprocated.Mayberry, p. 42. After graduating from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1929, Peter proposed to Catharine, and she accepted. During their long-distance engagement, Peter travelled to Japan, China, Hong Kong, Hawaii, and Italy, working on steamships to pay his way. He wrote long love letters to his fianc√©e during this period.Mayberry, pp. 48‚Äì49. Life in the Canadian Rockies On June 30, 1930, after Catharine completed her course of study, Peter and Catharine were married beneath an apple tree at the Robb estate before 300 guests.Mayberry, p. 52. They moved to Banff that August and lived with Peter's parents. In May 1931, they moved into a rustic log home and studio they built between Banff and the Bow River.Mayberry, p. 55. The couple spent significant time together hiking in the mountains and painting at Lake O'Hara, Lake Louise, Skoki Valley, Bow Lake, Mount Assiniboine, Yoho, Wenkchemna Pass, and the Banff area. They created striking landscape paintings of the mountains, lakes, glaciers, and larch trees.Mayberry, pp. 57‚Äì59. Since her formal training did not include landscape painting, Catharine studied and learned from her husband. Together, they often painted in the company of outstanding artists. Contemporaries Carl Rungius, Belmore Brown, and J. E. H. MacDonald provided a strong influence with their theories and use of color. Peter and Catharine committed themselves totally to their art, leading them at times to study remote mountain areas, unique landscapes, and the dramatic skies of Western Canada. Peter‚Äôs work often incorporated obscure mountain views with somber mystic hues of blues, browns, and greens. Catharine‚Äôs sketches often focused around rays of light and swirling clouds. Together, their life‚Äôs work produced a consistent and distinct sense of place. In the early 1930s, the young couple, along with Peter's older brother and other members of the Ski Club of the Canadian Rockies, constructed a lodge in the remote Skoki Valley region northeast of Lake Louise. In 1932, Peter and Catharine took over management of Skoki Ski Lodge. The following years were happy ones. The Whytes enjoyed the company of friends, the majesty of the landscape around them, and the outdoor world that offered them so much. Their home served as a gathering place for visiting artists and friends. In 1933, tragedy struck when one of their Skoki Lodge guests, MIT mathematician Dr. Raymond Paley, died in an avalanche on Fossil Mountain after wandering off alone, despite warnings by the Whytes. Although found innocent of any responsibility, Peter took the accident very hard. World travel To escape the painful memories of Skoki, Peter and Catharine traveled to Chicago, San Francisco, and then on to Hawaii, where they spent several months living in a beach-front bungalow on Hanalei Bay, Kauai. They fell in love with the Hawaiian climate, people, and culture. They painted numerous Hawaiian landscapes and several portraits of locals they met during their stay. In 1934, they set out from Hawaii on an extensive world tour that took them to Japan, China, Bali, Java, Sumatra, France, England, Germany, and the Swiss Alps. The young couple enjoyed painting and sketching side by side, capturing a beautiful Japanese landscape or the smiling faces of Bali children. When painting and sketching became difficult, Peter focused his energies on photography, recording the many places they visited. After eighteen months of travel, Peter and Catharine finally returned home to North America in the fall of 1934. Travel had always played an important role in their creative life together, providing both a sense of adventure and inspiration for their art. In 1938, they set out again on a trip to Switzerland, Norway, and Scotland. They returned from their travels early, however, due to the growing tensions in Europe. War years At the outbreak of World War II, Peter enlisted in the reserve army and reported for basic training duty with the Calgary Highlanders at Sarcee Camp. He worked as a photographer, taking ID pictures and other menial tasks. In April 1944, Peter entered a painting in an art contest, winning a $50 second prize for his effort. More important than the money, Peter Whyte was named an official war artist. The Group of Seven painter A. Y. Jackson was on the committee that appointed him to his new position. During the war years, Catharine became a member of the Red Cross and donated considerable time and money to supporting the soldiers. She sent many packages over to the soldiers in Europe. Catharine's brother left his high- paying job in Boston to enlist in the army. As a war artist, Peter was given considerably more autonomy, traveling from post to post, capturing the army life on canvas. While serving as a war artist, Peter created over 50 paintings to support the war effort. He was discharged on November 10, 1944. Later years Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Peter and Catharine traveled extensively and continued to paint and draw. They dedicated their lives primarily to painting the Canadian Rockies, and to collecting local art and historical material. They enjoyed entertaining their numerous friends, who regularly stopped over for tea, conversation, and laughter. Catharine's responsibilities managing their home took precedence over her painting. She did not create a major painting after 1939. She once wrote: \\"I have decided that life is a balancing of things. If you want one thing you have to give up another, you just can't have or do all you want, and it means trying to figure out which of the alternatives to choose. Peter and I have our life into the kind where we work as a team and we do practically everything together. We like it that way and feel we do better doing things together.\\" In 1952, Peter was diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes. Complicated by an ongoing bout with alcoholism, Peter struggled for the next six years, trying to paint everything he could while the eyes could still see. After a second cataract operation, Peter continued to produce large canvases of the Stoney peoples, many of which ended up in the Luxton Museum established by Norman Luxton. In 1958, Peter and Catharine formed a foundation (originally named Wa-Che-Yo-Cha-PaSanderson, p. 72.) to ensure the survival of their collection. This decision led to the amazing collection that would become one of the most important in North America. Following Peter‚Äôs death on December 3, 1966, Catharine began a new life on her own, focusing her energies on community, travel, and conservation. She also rediscovered her passion for skiing, which reintroduced her to a life of youthful enthusiasm. At the age of 63, she received her pilot's license from the Chinook Flying School. She became an important patron of the arts, providing significant financial support to the Banff Center. Catharine also gave significant funding to the I.D.E.A. project, Intercultural Development and Education through the Arts. She continued to support the Stoney people, both financially and through her support of their arts and crafts. In 1970, the Stoney people honored her by making her a blood sister and giving her the name Princess White Shield. In her later years, Catharine Whyte received many honors, including an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Calgary in 1969, Outstanding Citizen of the Year by the Banff Kiwanis Club in 1969, and the Award of Merit from the Historical Society of Alberta in 1978. That same year, she received Canada's highest civilian honor, the Order of Canada. Catharine Whyte died of cancer on March 7, 1979 in Banff, Alberta, Canada. She was 72 years old. Legacy In 1968, a museum was constructed with Peter and Catharine Whyte's collection forming the centerpiece. Catharine remained actively involved with the museum for the rest of her life. After Catharine‚Äôs death, the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies was named in their honor and expanded to include two heritage homes, including the Whyte home, and four log cabins. In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Whyte Museum, a large exhibition curated by Anne Ewen was unveiled in 2018 titled Artistry Revealed: Peter Whyte, Catharine Robb Whyte and Their Contemporaries. The exhibition was accompanied by a book. Today, the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies occupies a site by the Bow River, and is one of the most important museums dedicated to the art and culture of the Rocky Mountains. It serves as a beautiful legacy of two people who loved the Canadian Rockies and its people. The Skoki Ski Lodge was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1992.

In 1967, her song \\"Dukkemann\\" came in 14th place at Eurovision. She also participated in the 1968 Norwegian pre-selection, and would have gone on to represent Norway in 1968, but the song she performed (\\"Jag har aldri v√¶rt s√• glad i no'en som deg\\") was disqualified after accusations of plagiarising a popular Cliff Richard song called \\"Summer Holiday.\\" She also covered the winning song of that year, Spain's \\"La La La\\", in Norwegian. She represented Norway once more in 1969 with the song \\"Oj, oj, oj, s√• glad jeg skal bli\\" in 1969, which finished in last place. This song was recorded in three languages (Norwegian, Swedish, and French), and years later a \\"Grand Jubilee\\" version entitled \\"Oj Oj Oj, Grand Prix Jubilee\\", was released. Sparboe participated in the 1970 German selection for the Eurovision Song Contest after Norway, Finland, Portugal and Sweden refused to participate for that year. She sang \\"Pierre Der Clochard\\", and ended in fourth place. Sparboe also covered 1971's winning song \\"Un Banc, Un Arbre, Une Rue\\" in Norwegian, and also the 1970. winning song \\"All kinds of everything\\".

The galleries alone have over 70 highly ornate wooden sculptures of varying themes and size, all of which were originally painted in bright, vivid colors. A quarter gallery is an architectural feature of the stern of a sailing ship from around the 16th to the 19th century. Quarter galleries are a kind of balcony, typically placed on the sides of the sterncastle, the high, tower-like structure at the back of a ship that housed the officer's quarters. They functioned primarily as latrines for the ship's officers, and in inclement weather they also afforded those officers a view of the forward sails of the ship without having to go outside. On certain vessels and under certain conditions, the quarter galleries could serve as a firing platform for the ship's marines and sharpshooters during boarding actions. The galleries also provided a structure that was ideally suited for attaching decoration and often bore carved wooden sculptures, particularly in the 17th century. As small, wing-like extensions of the stern, the quarter galleries were difficult to secure to the hull and in rough weather were sometimes torn from it completely. Quarter galleries were only ever fitted on vessels of war. References *Laughton, L. G.

It is often called the \\"Strange Alliance\\" because it united the world's greatest capitalist state (the United States), the greatest Communist state (the Soviet Union) and the greatest colonial power (the United Kingdom). The Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942, signed by 26 nations, not only laid the groundwork for the future of the United Nations, but officially formed the Grand Alliance, committing the three nations to cooperation until the culmination of the war. Origins The Grand Alliance was one of convenience in the fight against the Axis powers. The British had reason to ask for one as Germany, Italy, and Imperial Japan threatened not only the colonies of the British Empire in North Africa and Asia, but also the British mainland. The United States felt that the Japanese and German expansion should be contained, but ruled out force until the attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. The Soviet Union, after the breaking of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact by the instigation of Operation Barbarossa in 1941, greatly despised the unchallenged Japanese expansion in the East, particularly considering their defeat in several previous wars with Japan. They also recognized, as the US and Britain had suggested, the advantages of a two-front war. In 1942 the three powers discussed becoming, with China, the Four Policemen of world peace. Before official confirmation of the alliance, there had been pre-emptive vision of a postwar world. With the Atlantic Charter, seeking to define a common Anglo-American vision of the postwar world, there was evidence to collaboration before the official forming of alliance. Similarly, US aid in the form of Lend-Lease provided a basis for the potential alliance to transpire. Tensions There were many tensions in the Grand Alliance among the \\"Big Three\\" leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin, although they were not enough to break the alliance during wartime. Division emerged over the length of time taken by the Western Allies to establish a second front in Europe. Stalin and the Soviets used the potential employment of the second front as an 'acid test' for their relations with the Anglo-American powers. The Soviets were forced to use as much manpower as possible in the fight against the Germans, whereas the United States had the luxury of flexing industrial power, but with the \\"minimum possible expenditure of American lives.\\" Roosevelt delayed until 1944 to enforce a second front in Europe; in the meantime he had endorsed the British proposal to invade North Africa, straining Anglo-American and Soviet relations. The essential ideological differences between the United States and the Soviet Union strained their relationship. Tensions between the two countries had existed for decades, with the Soviets remembering America's participation in the armed intervention against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War as well as its long refusal to recognize the Soviet Union's existence as a state. The original terms of the Lend-Lease loan were amended towards the Soviets, to be put in line with British terms. The United States would now expect interest with the repayment from the Soviets, following the initiation of the Operation Barbarossa, at the end of the war‚Äîthe United States were not looking to support any \\"postwar Soviet reconstruction efforts\\", which eventually manifested into the Molotov Plan. During the meetings from 1943‚Äì1945 there were disputes over the growing list of demands from the USSR. Tensions increased further when Roosevelt died and his successor Harry Truman rejected demands put forth by Stalin. Roosevelt understood that cultural differences could doom the alliance\\" and as opposed to the likes of Truman and W. Averell Harriman, Roosevelt wanted to play down these tensions. Roosevelt felt he \\"understood Stalin's psychology\\" which aided him in cooperating more successfully with the Soviet Union in comparison to Truman, stating \\"Stalin was too anxious to prove a point... he suffered from an inferiority complex.\\" See also * Tehran Conference (codename \\"Eureka\\") ‚Äì first meeting of The Big Three (28 November 1943 ‚Äì 1 December 1943) * Yalta Conference (codename \\"Argonaut\\") ‚Äì second meeting of The Big Three (4‚Äì11 February 1945) * Potsdam Conference (codename \\"Terminal\\") ‚Äì third and final meeting of The Big Three (Truman having taken over for Roosevelt, 17 July ‚Äì 2 August 1945) * List of Allied World War II conferences References * Winston Churchill.

Additionally, Baker points out the total lack of contemporary attestations for kings of the 16th Dynasty (except Bebiankh and Nebiryraw I) outside of a 200 km long stretch of the Nile valley comprising Thebes, from Hu in the north to Edfu in the south. That Neferhotep III ruled over little more than the Theban region is further strengthened by a stela of Neferhotep's successor Seankhenre Mentuhotepi where Mentuhotepi states \\"I am the king within Thebes, this is my city\\". Reign In his Theban stela, Neferhotep III emphasizes his role as provider of food for his people stating that \\"he who nourishes his city, saving it from famine\\".Ryholt, p.306 This, together with his royal name Sekhemre Sanhktawy, The might of Ra, who nourishes the Two Lands is a strong sign that Upper Egypt suffered from famines during the late 16th Dynasty. Another king of the period, Senusret IV, adopted a similar royal name. Neferhotep III got certainly embroiled in a defensive war against the Hyksos 15th Dynasty, which would ultimately overrun the 16th Dynasty state. Neferhotep praises himself on his stela as \\" He who raises his city, having been sunk through strife with foreigners\\". The stela is thought to contain the earliest known mention of the Khepresh crown. Neferhotep is said to be \\"Adorned with the Khepresh, the living image of Re, lord of terror\\".Ebba Kerrn Lilles√∏, Two Wooden Ur√¶i, The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 61, (1975), pp. 137-146 For reasons which remain difficult to understand, on the stela Neferhotep III is also referred to by the epithet Iykhernofret written inside a cartouche:Ryholt, p.155 <-M18-T28:r-nfr-t:Z2-> After his short reign, he was succeeded by a similarly short lived king Seankhenre Mentuhotepi.

It is in the civil parish of Melksham Without. The Bristol Avon passes to the east of the village where a stream from Sandridge joins it.  History  Beanacre is first mentioned in the 13th century. Earlier spellings of Bennecar or Benecar are shown on Andrews' and Dury's maps of 1773 and 1810. It is probably the oldest settlement in the parish of Melksham Without and was owned by Amesbury Abbey. It seems to have grown up clustered around the Old Manor, although none of the other houses now existing precede the 17th century. Since then, the village has expanded northwards.  Railway  In 1848 the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway company built their line close to the west side of Beanacre, to link the Swindon-Bath line (near Chippenham) with Westbury via Melksham and Trowbridge; the line was handed over to the Great Western Railway in 1850 and is still in use. From 1905 to 1955 there was a small station, Beanacre Halt, on the outskirts of the village on the road towards Whitley. The halt was designed to provide local services using steam railmotors. It opened for passenger services on 29 October 1905. The War Office bought six and a half acres just south of the halt in 1938 and built sidings to handle transfer of munitions to/from underground storage at Eastlays Quarry (between Gastard and Whitley).

Seiter is probably best known for his work as road manager, associate producer and touring percussionist with The Byrds and as road manager for The Flying Burrito Brothers with Gram Parsons in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Early life Seiter's musical interests developed at an early age while growing up in St Louis. With encouragement from his parents and two brothers who were playing trumpet and piano, Jimmi decided upon drums as his instrument of choice and he quickly developed a keen sense of rhythm and natural timing. His first exposure to live performance soon followed with school recitals on the Admiral cruise boats on the Mississippi in the early 1950s. As rock and roll music swept into Middle America, Seiter began absorbing many of his earliest influences from that era, which included the music of Bill Haley, Sam Cooke, Ricky Nelson and Elvis Presley. High School provided Seiter with exposure to many more like-minded musicians and he would spend much time hanging out at music rehearsals with his brother Joe's big band style dance band. Seiter's elder brother John Seiter achieved success as a drummer, recording with Spanky and Our Gang in 1967. During high school, Seiter was invited to join his first rock band with two high school friends that played electric bass guitar and guitar. With the addition of a horn player, the quartet began performing on the teen town dance circuit, later graduating to performances at special events and local clubs. The band later added a female vocalist, Pat Shannahan, and became known as Vince Arter and the High-5s. During this time that the band was introduced to young Ike Turner, already a big name in St. Louis. With his help the band were taught to play R&B; alongside members of Ike's backing band and were soon playing the breaks in between Ike Turners headline shows on the night club circuit, gaining valuable musical experience along the way. After high school graduation, Seiter spent a short time in the US Navy before embarking on a College course studying Architecture and Music. Subsequently, he moved to California to pursue a career in Architecture, securing a job in North Hollywood designing shopping centers. During his time in Los Angeles, Seiter met and befriended the singer Dobie Gray and soon became involved in the stage production for Gray's musical performances. While embarking on a tour of North California with Gray, Seiter was exposed to many more touring musicians and made valuable contacts, one of whom was currently working as a roadie with The Byrds who at this time were enjoying chart success with hits like \\"Mr Tambourine Man\\" and \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\". In time, Seiter was invited to assist on a North Californian tour with The Byrds, followed by a tour of Texas, and by that time, had put his architectural career on hold to concentrate on a new and challenging career as road and equipment manager for one of the most influential and exciting bands. 1970s After a brief stint working with The Flying Burrito Brothers with Gram Parsons in 1969, Seiter returned to working full-time with The Byrds as road manager at the behest of guitarist Clarence White. He was later to be christened \\"manager by proxy\\" by Byrds publicist Derek Taylor. Seiter is an uncredited percussionist on much of The Byrds mid to late era catalogue, and was encouraged to seek acknowledgment and credit for his performances by producer Terry Melcher. Both Melcher and White were also responsible for incorporating Seiter's performance on the drum kit into The Byrds' live shows. By 1973, the members of The Byrds had disagreements which had begun to unravel the members' relationships. Seiter decided to leave, much to the disappointment of key band members. Drummer Gene Parsons and bassist Skip Battin were fired soon afterward and eventually Clarence White left the band to Roger McGuinn who was attempting a reunion album featuring the original Byrds lineup, thus spelling the end of the road for the longest-standing lineup of the band. Seiter moved on to work with other major recording artists of the time such as Alice Cooper, Flo & Eddie, Rocky Burnette and David Cassidy, later expanding his career in studio design and construction management. He also worked on many studio recording projects with his long-time friend Terry Melcher, among others. Recent years With his experience and knowledge in the fields of show production, audio, video, lighting, event organization, architecture and construction Seiter has worked on many large-scale events and installations around the world including the L.A. Olympics ceremonies, six subsequent Olympics, over 10 worldwide theme parks and the construction of a city in Kazakhstan. Most recently, Seiter now lives and works in Macau, China due to his involvement in planning for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. In August 2012, Seiter published 'Volume 1' of a series of autobiographical recollections about his career working with The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers, entitled 'The Byrds - My Way (Volume 1)'. Subsequent volumes are expected to follow.

The company was founded in January 1994 as Beverages & More! in the San Francisco Bay Area, and re-branded as \\"BevMo!\\" in January 2001. By October 2009, the company had 100 stores in Arizona and California. As of September 2013, the number had expanded to 148 stores, including nine in Washington state. The company's growth has not been without conflict. Expansion into Nevada and Florida in the late 1990s was followed by BevMo! closing those stores for financial reasons. Residents of towns such as Santa Barbara have resisted the establishment of a BevMo! store, citing possible effects ranging from small business decline to increased traffic patterns. In 1995, BevMo! hired Wilfred Wong as cellar master. Wong, a native San Franciscan who is a veteran wine competition judge and wine writer, assesses wines for the retailer and gives them scores on a 100-point system. Wong keeps a blog on the company's website, and helped establish \\"Vineyard Partners\\", an in-house label composed of wines that are specially blended for the retailer. Overview BevMo! offers more than 3000 types of wines, 1500 types of spirits, and 1200 types of beers. Most BevMo! stores cater to the community by having weekly beer and wine tasting for a nominal charge, in line with state law, to any consumer of legal age. Because the vast majority of products within the stores are alcoholic, one must be either over the age of 21 or with an adult over the age of 25 in order to enter the store. The Arizona stores accept unexpired identification from all US states, military IDs, passports and Mexico and Canada IDs. History The corporation was founded by Steve Boone and Steve McLaren in January 1994, calling itself Beverages & More!, based in Concord, California. In the first year, the company opened six stores in the San Francisco Bay Area. A BevMo! retail store in Walnut Creek, California Veteran executive Bannus Hudson joined as CEO in 1997, coming from Procter & Gamble. Expansion into the states of Nevada and Florida led to Hudson and Executive Vice President David Richards closing those stores in 1998. Later, a company executive would say of this period, \\"we almost went broke. We tasted success and then expanded too quickly\\". After cutbacks, Bannus and Hudson determined that future expansion should be limited to Arizona and California, and that store size should be around , a more manageable size than the chain's biggest store. By 2000, the company was making $130 million in sales annually and was the second-largest alcoholic beverage retailer in the US. In January 1999, Glenn Sobel Management registered the website www.beveragesandmore.com, but Sobel was sued a year later by Beverages & More! for trademark infringement under ICANN jurisdiction. Beverages & More, Inc. aimed to show that their registered trademark \\"Beverages & More!\\" was being violated. Their testimony noted that the ampersand and the exclamation point in their trademark were not allowed in domain names, and that the www.beveragesandmore.com domain was the closest analog available to them. In court, Glenn Sobel did not deny that he was in the business of selling domain names, and that his company had never been known as \\"beveragesandmore\\". Sobel was admittedly not in the business of selling beverages. In March 2000, the domain was ordered to be immediately transferred from Sobel to Beverages & More! with no fine or penalty‚Äîa decision reached by Richard D. Faulkner, an ICANN judge in Dallas, Texas. The decision set a precedent that has since been quoted by complainants in cybersquatting cases to show that a domain name matching a trademark, one held by other than the trademark holder, \\"is evidence of bad faith registration and use\\". Earlier, consumers had been calling the chain \\"BevMo\\" as a nickname; as a result, the corporation registered the domain www.bevmo.com in August 2000. In January 2001, the company officially launched the new website and formally adopted the nickname as their brand. In February 2007, BevMo! was acquired by TowerBrook Capital Partners, L.P., a New York- and London-based private equity firm. With the acquisition, Bannus Hudson retired as CEO‚Äîto replace him, TowerBrook brought in Jim Simpson. In February 2009, Alan Johnson was made CEO and he named Charlotte Russe's Dan Carter as CFO and Bare Escentuals' Maria Devries as head of operations. Johnson, a native of Australia, was initially hired as a consultant by TowerBrook to assess BevMo! as an acquisition, and he \\"fell in love with the company\\"; by November he was reportedly driving a black BMW with a personalized license plate reading \\"I ‚ô• BEVMO\\" (\\"I [heart] BevMo\\"). In September 2009, Johnson reported annual sales of the 1,600-employee company to be \\"well over\\" $500 million‚Äîa record year. Johnson noted that the introduction of the custom blended and packaged \\"Vineyard Partners\\", BevMo!'s private wine label, was a \\"significant\\" fraction of sales. Johnson said that the company would be expanding into other states, and that the ideal store would be a location sited on a corner with of street frontage, dedicated parking, and upscale demographics. Johnson said that about 17 employees work at the average store. In October 2009, the company opened its 100th store, a 10,000-square-foot location in Torrance, California; the second BevMo! store in that city. Torrance Mayor Frank Scotto was pleased; he said the chain's first store in Torrance was \\"a huge success\\" and that the new one would create jobs and bring in more sales tax. At that time, 90 of the chain's stores were in California, with the remaining 10 in Arizona. Johnson told reporters, \\"it took us 15 years to open the first 100, and we'll open the next 100 in the next five or six years.\\" He said, \\"we know we can take our exact concept, like it is now, and do exactly what we're doing in at least 16 more states.\\" By September 2013, expansion had reached into a third state, Washington, with eight stores in the Seattle-Tacoma area, plus one in Vancouver and one in Bellingham, bringing the total number of stores to 148. Not all BevMo! expansion has been welcomed by city residents. In March 2010 in Santa Barbara, California, a group voiced opposition at a city board meeting, delaying approval of a BevMo! store. Concerns brought up at the meeting included complaints about the company's plans to cut down a tree in the parking lot, and about loading dock plans that would increase congestion in a narrow alley. The city's Architectural Board of Review member Paul Zink recommended against BevMo!'s plans to have pedestrians cross a parking lot to enter the store, saying that \\"there's a tie-in between what's inside and the street\\". Zink continued, \\"here in Santa Barbara, we like to window shop.\\" Area retailers noted that a new liquor store within range of nine smaller liquor stores and several supermarkets that sell liquor would decrease sales for longstanding area businesses. Sarkis Abdulhi, a liquor store owner, asked, \\"how can a politician say they support small business when they bring in giant chains? How many employees are they going to have, 13? What good does that do anybody when they put nine or 10 small shops out of business?\\" Area resident Trudy Fernandez said the opening of chain location \\"takes away from what people like me who have been in Santa Barbara 40 years came here for. This is a small town‚Äîwe don't want to be L.A.\\" The store, BevMo's 105th, saw brisk business upon opening. In-house scoring BevMo! employs Wilfred Wong, an expert taster and wine competition judge, who assigns bottles a wine rating based on his own version of Robert M. Parker, Jr.'s 50‚Äì100-point system. Wong, a veteran industry analyst and wine writer who has written regular columns for Vineyard & Winery Management magazine and Beverage Industry News, tastes some 8,000 bottles a year for BevMo!, and may taste 40 wines a day. A San Francisco native and resident who grew up working in his family's upscale grocery store in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, Wong was hired to work for BevMo! in 1995, when they had six stores. He told a New York Times reporter in 2006 that it can be tricky working as a wine critic inside a large retail chain that sells wine‚Äîthere can be conflicts between appropriate scoring for a wine and business plans for that wine. He reported that he has, upon occasion, been encouraged by company management to give a high score to a wine, especially one that did not receive a high rating from other reviewers, or one that was purchased by BevMo! at a good price. Wong said, \\"we have fights all the time.\\" Wong made assurances that he does not treat a wine to a good score based on company founders' wishes. Executive VP David Richards agrees: \\"If we were to impinge on Wilfred's credibility, it would be very bad for our brand.\\" Wong reports only to Richards, to keep him from being influenced by wine sellers or BevMo!'s own buyers. Richards said, \\"we have to give him independence within the organization.\\" Alder Yarrow, publisher of the wine blog Vinography.com, said of Wong, \\"he is not a shill ... He knows what he is talking about when it comes to wine.\\" Professor Emeritus Robert Smiley, Director of Wine Studies, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Davis, said about Wong's ratings: \\"I think this is a good innovation and he's helpful to the consumer. It brings more people to BevMo and it probably moves them up in price because typically, the higher-price wines get the better scores.\\" Smiley said that shoppers were too smart to be fooled: \\"If Wilfred and BevMo fix the ratings, people will catch on and go elsewhere.\\" In scoring, Wong uses a 100-point system that he developed before working for the large retailer. Wong reports that his system is aimed at the taste of the consumer rather than at that of the intellectual, unlike Parker's system which is more cerebral. One of the differences, said Wong, is that Parker may give a \\"fruitful\\" wine 88 points when Wong will give it 92, noting that it may be well-made for its varietal. He reports that he has only given two wines a score of 100, one a 1990 Montrachet from Domaine Ramonet-Prudhon and the other a late 1990s vintage from Opus One. His personal favorites to drink are French wines such as second- and third-growth Bordeaux reds, and California Pinot noir from the Russian River Valley. Other wines he likes include Chenin blanc from the Loire Valley, Pinot gris from Alsace, high-end Chardonnay from Australia and various biodynamic wines. Wong publishes his thoughts about wine regularly on \\"Wilfred's Blog\\", hosted on the company website; a forum that he uses to name his current favorites and to recommend wine and food pairings.

Yale '81) author, who has written pseudohistories about the settlement of North America. In his first book, The Island of Seven Cities: Where the Chinese Settled When They Discovered America, Chiasson explains his belief that Chinese voyagers settled in the Cape Dauphin area of Nova Scotia almost a century before the voyages of Christopher Columbus. He suggests that the indigenous Mi'kmaq culture was influenced by these people in the form of possible archaeological remains, customs, costumes, art and even written language. His theory has been rejected by mainstream historians. Provincial archaeologists and a geologist have said that some of Chiasson's physical evidence of a Chinese settlement‚Äîa road up the side of Cape Dauphin and the stone remains of a wall surrounding the site ‚Äîwere actually built in 1952 by a volunteer fire company fighting a forest fire and again in the 1990s by a gravel company attempting to dig gravel on the cape. Chiasson challenges these statements in his second book, Written in the Ruins: Cape Breton Island's Second Pre-Columbian Chinese Settlement. In December 2010, several years after the reports of the Nova Scotian archeologists, History Television aired a one-hour documentary entitled \\"Mysterious Ruins: Cape Breton\\". The documentary explored Chiasson's theory and included interviews with an archeologist and a geologist from the area who viewed the site that Chiasson posits was the location of a pre-Columbian Chinese community. Geologist Sandra Barr of Acadia University and archaeologist Steve Davis of St. Mary's University stated that they found no evidence of any human settlement on the site. Acadia University reported that \\"their explanations are mostly ignored in the film.\\" The documentary also included interviews with several Chinese architectural historians.

It is native to the east Atlantic Ocean (Portugal to Angola) and Mediterranean Sea. Habitat and behaviour Astropecten aranciacus lives very near the coast, and at low tide it buries itself in the sand, showing only the centre of its upper side which is swollen in the form of a cone. This cone acts like a sense organ. When it is touched, the cone contracts and the starfish buries itself on the sand again. Then at high tide, the starfish reappears on the surface of the substrate. It buries itself in the sand to shield parts of its body from the rays of the sun, especially the bottom surface which has no coloured pigment and is therefore particularly sensitive. Astropecten aranciacus lives on sandy, muddy or gravel bottoms at depths of . This species is active and easy to find in the late afternoon and during the night. Description This starfish has superomarginal plates equipped with 1 to 3 small spines and inferomarginal plates with long, pointed, strong, regularly arranged spines. The inferomarginal spines have reddish-orange colour at the base and yellowish or white colour towards the tip. It is rugged with normal size disc and pointed arms. The colour of the aboral side is given by a succession of paxillae (from the top they look like round points) with upper extremity red-orange in various combinations with paxillae with upper extremity grey or beige. The superomarginal plates are usually grey or beige homogeneous. This is the largest species of Astropecten in the Mediterranean Sea, with a maximum diameter of , although it usually measures about . It is a starfish with a lot of features and can be distinguished easily from the other species by colour and size. Sometimes it is confused with Astropecten irregularis. Feeding This sea star is a carnivore and feeds on molluscs, which it catches with its arms and then takes to the mouth. The prey is then trapped by the long, moving prickles around the mouth cavity.

Category:Villages in Norfolk ","title":"Beckett End"},{"id":"12778259","text":"Beckfoot is a hamlet in the civil parish of Holme St Cuthbert in Cumbria, England. It is located on the B5300 coast road, three miles south of Silloth- on-Solway and two miles north of the village of Mawbray. The county town of Carlisle is twenty-five miles away to the east. History and etymology The name \\"Beckfoot\\" is derived from the Old Norse bekkr-futr, meaning \\"the mouth of a stream\\". Beck is a local word in Cumbrian dialect for a stream. Such a beck empties into the Solway Firth at the southern end of the hamlet, and it is this watercourse which gives the settlement its name. There are two known recorded variant spellings: Beck and Beckfoote. The area around Beckfoot was fortified during Roman times, as a series of milefortlets were constructed to guard the coast beyond the western end of Hadrian's Wall. The remains of milefortlets 14 and 15 are located nearby. In 2010 a broken pottery vessel containing 308 Roman coins was discovered by a local archaeologist using a metal detector. During the 14th century, a castle was built at Wolsty, approximately one-and-a-half miles to the north, to guard the vulnerable Holmcultram Abbey at Abbeytown from raids across the Solway Firth. The castle had been demolished by the year 1700, and not much remains today, but an archaeological survey was carried out in July 2013. In the 16th century, shifting sands and severe storms on the Solway Firth saw many houses in the hamlet destroyed or severely damaged. Many people lost their homes, and it was this event which prompted the Lord and Steward of Holme Culterham to construct the town of New Mawbray, today known as Newtown, three-quarters of a mile inland from Beckfoot. Also during this era, Scots continued to raid this section of the Solway coast. A system called the \\"seawake\\" - a night watch along the coast - was created, and residents of coastal communities including Beckfoot would have participated in guarding against such raids. A Quaker meeting house was built in Beckfoot in the year 1745, exactly 100 years before the parish church at Holme St. Cuthbert was built. A mill and dam were built at the end of the eighteenth century to aid in local wool production, but the mill was not a financial success and closed a few years later. In 1925, Beckfoot had two council houses constructed - the only council houses in the whole parish. The hamlet today A barn belonging to one of the farms in the hamlet, looking inland across the Solway Plain toward Skiddaw. There are two attractions in the vicinity - Bank Mill Nursery and Visitor Centre, which includes a garden, nature reserve, play area, and restaurant, and the Gincase near Newtown, a farm park with a gift shop and tea room. A bus service runs between Silloth-on-Solway and Maryport and stops approximately once every two hours in either direction. Beckfoot is within the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and its sand dunes, together with those at Mawbray and Wolsty, form a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Wheeler played as a defender during his 157-game career for Footscray from 1974 to 1983. The following season he joined VFA club Williamstown as captain-coach. In five seasons with Williamstown, Wheeler played 94 games, and he led the club to a premiership in 1986 and to Grand Finals in 1985 and 1988. His presence, coupled with that of enthusiastic president Tony Hannebery, was considered critical to attracting big-name players like Barry Round and Tony Pastore to Williamstown, and to the revival of the club during the 1980s after an indifferent decade during the 1970s. He was appointed to the position of assistant coach to Mick Malthouse at Footscray in 1989. Malthouse left shortly after the season, and shortly before merger between and to form the Fitzroy Bulldogs was announced. Footscray supporters began to fight the merger in court, and on 8 October, Wheeler was appointed senior coach of Footscray for 1990, even though it was not certain there would be a team for him to coach. He was active in the campaign against the merger, which was ultimately defeated on 23 October when the supporters raised enough money and sponsorship to make the club viable. With twelve wins in 1990 he took Footscray close to a finals spot in his first year at the helm. In 1992 they finished second after the home-and-away season, only missing out on the minor premiership by percentage. They however failed to make the premiership decider after losing in the preliminary final to Geelong, but Wheeler was named as coach of the All-Australian Team. He was sacked in the early stages of the 1994 season following an 88-point loss to Geelong.

Installed or uninstalled jet engines can be run under actual load conditions. Testing A hush house is large enough to accommodate an entire manned or unmanned aircraft. Some facilities are also equipped to test additional capabilities such as weight and balance, night vision and low lighting, water intrusion, heat soaking, and wind evaluation. Jet engines can be run while installed in the aircraft, which must be restrained by holdback devices to resist the engine thrust. Uninstalled engines (without the aircraft) can be tested while held in place by thrust frames. The air intake and exhaust systems of indoor engine test cells and hush houses are designed to block the transmission of noise, while optimizing the engine air flows. The engine exhaust, after having been thoroughly mixed with cooling air, is generally discharged through a vertical stack. The gas path incorporates acoustic damping panels (often containing fibrous insulation protected from gas stream erosion by metal mesh) to reduce the sound energy of the gas stream and attenuate the noise transmitted to the surrounding outdoor area. Because the engine exhaust flow is \\"augmented\\" with a relatively large flow of cooling air induced by a Venturi effect into the exhaust silencing system, the exhaust muffler of an indoor test facility is generally referred to as an augmenter tube, although the term \\"detuner\\" is commonly used in the UK. Some outdoor run-up facilities used to test aircraft engines (installed or uninstalled) may also be outfitted with noise control structures, called Ground Run-Up Enclosures.

Between 2002-2007 the median price for an old communist-era apartment rose by a factor of 10 (x 1000%), from around ‚Ç¨10,000 to c. ‚Ç¨100,000. Today some apartments in central Bucharest have prices comparable with those of properties in Paris or London, and in virtually every small town the median housing price rivals that of similar towns in the European Union. The Romanian market is also atypical compared with other Central European countries. By contrast with Hungary, Poland or the Czech Republic subsequent to joining the European Union (where prices remained stationary), when Romania joined the EU in 2007, housing prices jumped by some 20%. Causes of the rise in property prices The following are the most-often cited factors that have contributed to this increase in prices: * The growth of the banking system, which made affordable mortgages possible (mortgages were almost impossible for Romanians to obtain before 2002); * Almost 2.5 million Romanians are working abroad (mainly in Italy and Spain), enabling them to save up for an apartment in Romania; * The growth of the economy (by approximately 6% annually since 2001), and the growth in average net monthly salary (from 100 euros in 2002 to 350 euros in August 2007); * The poor supply of properties coupled with high demand; between 1989-2005, almost no new apartments were built in Romania. Some suburban development took place, but poor infrastructure (utilities, roads, public transportation) kept it from increasing the supply enough to prevent prices from increasing. * The relatively low starting price, among the lowest in Europe in 2003, caused a spiraling frenzy of external buyers to flood the country, shortly followed by both honest and dishonest developers, builders, selling agents and intermediaries. The effect was to send demand almost vertical with simple one-bedroom apartments in 2007 costing 10 times their 2001 price, before falling by more than half or less by 2012 (Source White Mountain Property research). Criticisms It has been argued that some of the above-mentioned potential causes of Romania's rising property prices are not significant. * The population decreased by 10% between 1990 and 2012, which reduced the demand. Also, birthrate decreased significantly. * Although credit is part of every bank's product portfolio nowadays, few Romanians are actually creditworthy, and their average salary is too low to enable them to purchase a home; * The vast majority of the Romanians working abroad have low- income, low-grade jobs as construction workers, au pairs etc., and it would be difficult for most such workers to save enough to buy a property in Romania; * Demand is not as high, and is not increasing as fast, as the market optimists estimate: the population of the country keeps falling as Romanians continue to emigrate abroad en masse (since January 1, 2007 Romania has been a Member State of the EU, which has made it easier for Romanians to travel to France, Germany and the UK); * The decretei generation (the product of the 1970s baby boom resulting from the policies of the Nicolae Ceau≈üescu era) has now reached maturity, and many already own a home; * Future foreign workers arriving from poorer countries to meet demand in Romania's job market will be too poor to buy a house in Romania. Popular beliefs Besides the official technical and economic factors, ordinary people in Romania believe that the rise in property prices was also caused by: * The money-laundering requirements of the various politicians, corrupt business men etc.; however, some regulations adopted after 2004 make money-laundering very difficult; * Inflation due to the activities of real estate agents; before 2002, very few real estate agencies were operating in Romania, but in 2008 they were in the thousands ; since they are unregulated, and because there is also no code of ethics for real estate agents (in fact, anyone can claim to be one), many ordinary Romanians believe that the agents are artificially increasing the prices demanded by sellers.

It is in the civil parish of Wisborough Green. Bedham consists of a farm, a derelict Victorian school, and a scattering of houses set high on a wooded sandstone ridge of the western Weald, at 150 metres above sea level. To the west Flexham Park is an area of commercial woodland, with large areas of chestnut coppice, and south of this is a sandstone quarry at Bognor Common. To the northeast are large areas of semi-natural forest, left unmanaged as a nature reserve, called The Mens. South of The Mens is Hawkhurst Court,Hawkhurst Court on Geograph a country house used as a Canadian army HQ in the buildup to the Normandy Invasion during World War II, then as a private school, before becoming private housing in the 1980s. From the early 20th century Bedham became popular with artists of limited means who wanted to \\"escape from civilisation\\". Remote cottages could be bought for ¬£100. The composer Sir Edward Elgar lived nearby at Brinkwells for a time as a sub-tenant of the artist Rex Vicat Cole, and the studio where Elgar composed his Cello Concerto was moved up to the village and now stands as a separate house. Ford Madox Ford, author of The Good Soldier also lived in the village with Stella Bowen, an Australian artist twenty years his junior. Later residents included Miss Ethel West (d.1950) and her companion Miss Metherell who lived in Bedham Cottage - Miss Metherell using the pen name Rhoda Leigh wrote a fictional account of the hamlet, Past and Passing: Tales from Remote Sussex, which offended some local residents with its thinly veiled and exaggerated references to them.P Jerrome, Petworth. From 1660 to the present day. The Window Press p232 One of those offended was Mrs. Puttick who sold groceries, tobacco and sweets from the kitchen of her house opposite the lane to Warren Barn. Honour Thy Father - Recollections of Sussex Life over Two and a Half CenturiesHonour Thy Father, Lillian M. Hunt (2006) Goldsmith Publications recounts much Bedham history centred on Mants, the cottage where its author Lillian Hunt's grandfather lived. Pronunciation Bedham is traditionally pronounced with a heavy stress on the final syllable. History In 1460 Bedham was home to William Hibberden, one of the members of parliament for Midhurst. An agreement of 1769 between the owner of the manor, William Mitford of Pitshill at Tillington, and the tenants provided for the enclosure of common land to create woodland managed as coppice, although the areas involved are not specified. In 1981 the Royal Logistic Corps considered the area for practising helicopter insertions of freight due to the hilly wooded nature of the area. The area was however dropped at the 7th of 10 stages of evaluation of areas across the U.K. School The small schoolhouse was built by local landowners and the Church of England to provide elementary education for children from the hamlet and surrounding area. Built in the style of a chapel it doubled up as the church on Sundays. The single room was divided by a curtain for infants and senior classes. At the end of the school week the chairs were turned to face the east and ink pots removed from the desks. In the 1930s services would be held there once or twice a month by the Rector of Fittleworth, with one of the local ladies playing the harmonium. Notable residents The painter Rex Vicat Cole rented a house called Brinkwells to the east of the Fittleworth to Wisborough Green road from around 1905 and he sublet it to Sir Edward Elgar between 1917 and 1921, at a time when Elgar was convalescing. During these years Elgar enjoyed learning craft skills from the woodmen at Flexham Park and composed his last four great works - the Violin Sonata in E minor, Op. 82, the String Quartet in E minor, Op. 83, the Quintet in A minor for Piano and String Quartet, Op. 84, and the sublime Cello Concerto in E minor, Op. 85. These works were said to be inspired by the local woods and by a strange legend of a clump of trees said to be the remains of Spanish monks who had engaged in sacrilegious ceremonies in the park and been struck by lightning. A film, \\"Elgar's Tenth Muse\\", starring James Fox as Elgar and directed by Paul Yule was produced in 1996 depicting this period. Ford Madox Ford and his pregnant partner Stella Bowen moved to the 17th century Coopers Cottage, now called Cotford, in September 1920.The Correspondence of Ford Madox Ford and Stella Bowen By Ford Madox Ford, Stella Bowen, Sondra J. Stang, Karen Cochran Their daughter Esther Julia was born in November 1920. Letters between the couple show that they kept some ducks and were helped with the garden by a neighbour called Standing.

It currently operates under the name Sofitel Grand Sopot. History The hotel was originally built in 1924‚Äì1927 at a cost of 20 million Danzig gulden as the most refined hotel in Sopot - the Kasino Hotel. Between 19‚Äì26 September 1939, the hotel served as Adolf Hitler's headquarters from which he went twice to the outskirts of Warsaw to oversee the invasion of the city. Between 11‚Äì16 September 1966, the hotel hosted the 16th Pugwash Conference entitled Disarmament and World Security, Especially in Europe. On 13 December 1981, the hotel was the site of Operation \\"Mewa\\" (Seagull) carried out by the communist secret Security Service (SB) in which a group of Solidarity movement political dissidents was arrested including Lech Dymarski, Jacek Kuro≈Ñ, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Karol Modzelewski and Jan Rulewski. The Sofitel Grand Hotel is located at the seaside of the Gda≈Ñsk Bay, in the heart of the town and next to the beach. Sofitel Grand Hotel has been totally refurbished during the last years, the classical atmosphere from the earlier period is still present and the hotel is now both classical, and modern.

It evolved from what was for many years the only multinational corps in NATO, Allied Land Forces Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland (LANDJUT) (in its turn, a part of Allied Forces Northern Europe). From 1962 LANDJUT had been responsible for the defence of the Baltic Approaches from a headquarters at Rendsburg, Germany. It comprised the 6th Panzergrenadier Division and the Danish Jutland Division. History A tri- national working group was established following the July 1997 decision that Poland was to be admitted to NATO with the aim of establishing the corps as part of NATO‚Äôs Main Defence Forces. Its missions are three-fold: to participate in the collective defence of NATO territory, under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, to contribute to multinational crisis management including peace support operations, and to provide command and control for humanitarian, rescue, and disaster relief operations. In July 1997, Ministers of Defence of Denmark, Germany and Poland decided to establish a Danish- German-Polish Corps. This corps was to be named Multinational Corps Northeast with its headquarters located in Szczecin, Poland. The Headquarters Allied Land Forces Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland (LANDJUT) from Rendsburg in Germany was to form the nucleus of this new command. Ministers of Defence of Denmark, Germany and Poland signed the Corps Convention in 1998, when Poland was not a member of NATO yet, but the date of the country‚Äôs accession (12 March 1999) had already been set. On 18 September 1999, the three Framework Nations ‚Äì Denmark, Germany, Poland ‚Äì could hoist their flags in the Baltic Barracks, the seat of the Corps in Szczecin. The Corps has significantly developed decisively since that time. Though it is a NATO-affiliated formation, the Corps Convention is a trilateral agreement between the three nations. The positions of commander, deputy commander, and chief of staff rotate between the three nations. For common purposes of practice and training the corps was assigned to Joint Sub-Regional Command Northeast (JSRC NE), at Karup, Denmark. For Article 5 common defence purposes, the Corps was to have been assigned either to JSRC NE or the JSRC Centre at Heidelberg, Germany. Following the latest reorganisation, it might report if designated for operations in Central Europe to Allied Force Command Heidelberg. The 14th Panzergrenadier Division of the German Army used to be part of the Corps, but disbanded at the end of 2008. Due to its geographical location, the only NATO HQ East of the former Iron Curtain, Multinational Corps North East has a key function in the integration of new NATO member states. This is reflected in the structure of its personnel. Officers and NCO's from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia are serving at Multinational Corps North East. Since April 2004, the flags of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been fluttering at the Headquarters. In January 2005, Slovakia joined Multinational Corps Northeast, whereas the Czech Republic - in October 2005. The US flag was hoisted in November 2006 indicating the US membership in the Corps. In July 2008, first Romanian officers arrived to serve at the HQ. In August 2009, Slovenia entered the MNC NE family. In January 2012, Croatia officially became the twelfth nation of the Corps. In July 2013, the flag of Hungary was hoisted in Baltic Barracks. Sweden, a non-NATO member, sent its representative to the Baltic Barracks in autumn 2014. In 2015 Turkish, British, French and Dutch officers started their tours of duty in Szczecin. Canada, Iceland, Belgium, Norway and Greece joined the Corps in 2016. In 2005, during the Compact Eagle exercise, the headquarters achieved full operational capability. From January to August 2007 a considerable number of personnel from Multinational Corps Northeast were put at the disposal of ISAF's headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan. On 5 February 2015, a trilateral statement by the Corps Convention countries stated, in part, that * At the NATO Summit in September 2014 the Ministers of Defence from Germany, Poland and Denmark informed their colleagues and signed a statement that they had decided to raise the level of readiness of the Headquarters MNC NE from a Forces of Lower Readiness Headquarters to a High Readiness Force Headquarters and to enhance its capability to address future threats and challenges. * '..the level of readiness [of the corps will be raised] and fulfil a joint and regional role within the framework of NATO‚Äôs Readiness Action Plan, for both Assurance and Adaptation Measures in order to exercise command and control in the full range of Alliance missions in the north-eastern region (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland) of the Alliance with the emphasis on Article 5 operations including command and control over the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF). Additionally, MNC NE will execute command and control over the NATO Force Integration Units (NFIUs) in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.'BMVG statement, 5 February 2015 In June 2016, during the exercise Brilliant Capability 16 the Corps has become operationally capable to assume command of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, also referred to as the ‚Äúspearhead force‚Äù.  Mission in Afghanistan  The MNC NE staff was assigned to the ISAF mission and officially took over their duties for the first time on 4 February 2007. Nearly 160 officers and non-commissioned officers spent over 6 month in Kabul. The majority of the MNC NE staff filled the posts in a newly established composite ISAF Headquarters in Kabul, where they proved their excellent level of preparedness and dedication to work. From February to August 2010, the personnel of the Corps participated in the ISAF mission for the second time. The majority of approximately 130 officers and non- commissioned officers filled the posts at the ISAF Joint Command, a tactical level headquarters. Serving at different branches, they were gaining valuable mission experience and improving their skills. The third deployment with the participation of more than 120 soldiers from the Corps and partnering formations started in January 2014 and ended in January 2015. As soon as the ISAF mandate expired, the Resolute Support mission commenced in January 2015, based on the successes and commitments of the international community in Afghanistan.

The first part aired on Discovery Channel Canada and its High Definition channel on September 23, 2007 and the second part on September 30. It was produced in association with Galafilm Inc. William Shatner narrates the miniseries. A companion book of the same title, written by Dana Berry, was also published in September 2007. It was offered as a selection of the Science Fiction Book Club. Mars Rising, a companion 6-episode documentary mini-series, aired from October 7 to October 21, 2007, using sequences shot for Race to Mars.  Plot  The four-hour mini-series begins in the year 2026, with a test lander exploding on landing. Jumping to 2029, the narrator explains the mission, 'Project Olympus' and shows the four NTR spacecraft: Cargo lander Shirase, Mars Surface Habitat Atlantis, Mars lander Gagarin, and Crew Transfer Vehicle Terra Nova. In early 2030, the international crew of six astronauts from the United States, Russia, France, Canada and Japan board Terra Nova to begin their 582 day journey to Mars and back. They suffer numerous equipment failures along the way, eventually traced back to fraud on the part of a subcontractor. The international team is racing against China, who have already landed a robot on Mars. The astronauts successfully land on Mars, but astrobiologist Hiromi's arm is broken by a faulty landing gear. Later, the Chinese robot finds water, but it contains too much calcium chloride for it to contain life. Meanwhile, the crew's drilling equipment is irreparably damaged by a Martian dust devil. The crew sends an impassioned plea back to Earth, asking to allow them to cannibalize the Chinese robot lander, saying that the exploration of Mars should be for humankind and not be limited by politics. The crew's proposal is accepted, and they redouble their drilling efforts. After days of non-stop work, they finally strike water, but crew member Hiromi is killed when pressure builds in the well causing an explosion that knocks over a beam of the drilling platform and crushes his spacesuit. After they ascend to the main spacecraft for the journey home, the entire crew becomes gravely ill. They suspect infection by Martian microbes, but commander Rick Erwin refuses to open the seals on their Martian samples for fear of further contamination. It is discovered that carbon monoxide poisoning is the actual culprit, and they manage to deal with the problem. On final approach to Earth it is discovered that the Terra Nova's braking thrusters are malfunctioning making a safe return impossible unless repairs are carried out. After a dangerous spacewalk they repair the damage, but astronaut Antoine Hebert is nearly killed by electrocution. The mini-series ends as Olympus' crew module prepares to land and then cuts to a scene in the year 2095 to show a Mars base named for Robert H. Goddard, situated near Hiromi's grave site.

It is self-reported or can be recorded by a care-giver. The sleep diary, or sleep log, is a tool used by doctors and patients. It is a useful resource in the diagnosis and treatment of especially circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and in monitoring whether treatment of those and other sleep disorders is successful. Sleep diaries may be used in conjunction with actigraphy. In addition to being a useful tool for medical professionals in the diagnosis of sleep problems, a sleep diary can help make individuals more aware of the parameters affecting their sleep. This data alone can help people self- diagnose what helps them get a good sleep. Components The information contained in a sleep diary includes some or all of the following points: # The time the person had wanted or intended to wake up # The time the person woke up # Whether the person woke up spontaneously, by an alarm clock, or because of another (specified) disturbance # The time the person got out of bed # A few words about how the person felt during the day (mood, drowsiness, etc.), often on a scale from 1 to 5 and the major cause # The start and end times of any daytime naps and exercises # The name, dosage and time of any drugs used including medication, sleep aids, caffeine and alcohol # The time and type/ heaviness of evening meal # Activities the last hour before bedtime, such as meditation, watching TV, playing PC-games # Stress level before bedtime, often on a scale from 1 to 5 and the major cause # The time the person tried to fall asleep # The time the person thinks sleep onset occurred # Activity during aforementioned two moments (remaining eyes closed, meditating, ...) # The presumed cause, number, time, and length of any nighttime awakenings and activities during these moments # Quality of sleep # Level of comfort of any recalled good or bad dreams Data collection Sleep logs are often hand- drawn on graph paper, as a rule one week per page. Specialized software for creating sleep logs is also available; a spreadsheet or database software can also be used. Online services can also be used to track daily sleep patterns.  Sleep Diaries as an Assessment and Intervention Tool  Sleep diaries are a key component of the assessment and treatment of Insomnia II . They make it possible to quantify the severity of a sleep disorder, are a helpful addition for a correct diagnosis and guide the intervention by tracking the changes in sleep. They also make it possible to measure the treatment outcomes in a reliable fashion. Further, they can provide insight as to how well the patient is adhering to a prescribed sleep schedule. The advantages of sleep diaries over other measurements is their simple and inexpensive nature. They are easy to use, provide crucial information and can also be online based. The disadvantages of sleep diaries are that inaccurate or incomplete data is provided by the patient, scoring time used by the clinician and scoring errors on the clinician's side (only paper version).

An instrument (bronchoscope) is inserted into the airways, usually through the nose or mouth, or occasionally through a tracheostomy. This allows the practitioner to examine the patient's airways for abnormalities such as foreign bodies, bleeding, tumors, or inflammation. Specimens may be taken from inside the lungs. The construction of bronchoscopes ranges from rigid metal tubes with attached lighting devices to flexible optical fiber instruments with realtime video equipment. History The German laryngologist Gustav Killian is attributed with performing the first bronchoscopy in 1897.Panchabhai TS, Mehta AC. Historical perspectives of bronchoscopy. Connecting the dots. Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2015 May;12(5):631-41. doi:10.1513/AnnalsATS.201502-089PS. PubMed Killian used a rigid bronchoscope to remove a pork bone. The procedure was done in an awake patient using topical cocaine as a local anesthetic.Kollofrath O. Entfernung Eines Knochenstucks Aus Dem Rechten Bronchus Auf Naturlichem Wege Und Unter Anwendung Der Directen Laryngoskopie. Munch Med Wochenschr 1897;38:1038-1039. From this time until the 1970s, rigid bronchoscopes were used exclusively. Chevalier Jackson, refined the rigid bronchoscope in the 1920s, using this rigid tube to visually inspect the trachea and mainstem bronchi.https://archive.org/details/tracheobronchosc00jackuoft/page/n1 The British laryngologist Victor Negus, who worked with Jackson, improved the design of his endoscopes, including what came to be called the \\"Negus bronchoscope\\". Shigeto Ikeda invented the flexible bronchoscope in 1966.Ikeda S, Tobayashi K, Sunakura M, Hatakeyama T, Ono R. [Diagnosis using a fiberscope --the respiratory organs]. Naika. 1969 Aug;24(2):284-91. Japanese. PubMed . The flexible scope initially employed fiberoptic bundles requiring an external light source for illumination. These scopes had outside diameters of approximately 5 mm to 6 mm, with an ability to flex 180 degrees and to extend 120 degrees, allowing entry into lobar and segmental bronchi. More recently, fiberoptic scopes have been replaced by bronchoscopes with a charge coupled device (CCD) video chip located at their distal end.Kobayashi T, Koshiishi H, Kawate N, A. dela Cruz CM, Kato H. The Performance of Prototype Videobronchoscopes: The Pentax Eb-Tm1830 and Eb-Tm1530. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology 1994;1(2):160-167. Types=Rigid Rigid bronchoscopy. The rigid bronchoscope is a hollow metal tube used for inspecting the lower airway. It can be for either diagnostic or therapeutic reasons. Modern use is almost exclusively for therapeutic indications. Rigid bronchoscopy is used for retrieving foreign objects. Rigid bronchoscopy is useful for recovering inhaled foreign bodies because it allows for protection of the airway and controlling the foreign body during recovery. Massive hemoptysis, defined as loss of over 600 mL of blood in 24 hours, is a medical emergency and should be addressed with initiation of intravenous fluids and examination with rigid bronchoscopy. The larger lumen of the rigid bronchoscope (versus the narrow lumen of the flexible bronchoscope) allows for therapeutic approaches such as electrocautery to help control the bleeding. Flexible (fiberoptic) A flexible bronchoscope is longer and thinner than a rigid bronchoscope. It contains a fiberoptic system that transmits an image from the tip of the instrument to an eyepiece or video camera at the opposite end. Using Bowden cables connected to a lever at the hand piece, the tip of the instrument can be oriented, allowing the practitioner to navigate the instrument into individual lobar or segmental bronchi. Most flexible bronchoscopes also include a channel for suctioning or instrumentation, but these are significantly smaller than those in a rigid bronchoscope. Flexible bronchoscopy causes less discomfort for the patient than rigid bronchoscopy, and the procedure can be performed easily and safely under moderate sedation. It is the technique of choice nowadays for most bronchoscopic procedures. Indications=Diagnostic Diagram of a bronchoscopy being performed * To view abnormalities of the airway * To obtain tissue specimens of the inside the lungs by biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, or endobronchial brushing. * To evaluate a person who has bleeding in the lungs, possible lung cancer, a chronic cough, or sarcoidosis Therapeutic * To remove secretions, blood, or foreign objects lodged in the airway * Laser resection of tumors or benign tracheal and bronchial strictures * Stent insertion to palliate extrinsic compression of the tracheobronchial lumen from either malignant or benign disease processes * For percutaneous tracheostomy * Tracheal intubation of patients with difficult airways is often performed using a flexible bronchoscope Procedure Video of a bronchoscopy of the right bronchial treeBronchoscopy can be performed in a special room designated for such procedures, operating room, intensive care unit, or other location with resources for the management of airway emergencies. The patient will often be given antianxiety and antisecretory medications (to prevent oral secretions from obstructing the view), generally atropine, and sometimes an analgesic such as morphine. During the procedure, sedatives such as midazolam or propofol may be used. A local anesthetic is often given to anesthetize the mucous membranes of the pharynx, larynx, and trachea. The patient is monitored during the procedure with periodic blood pressure checks, continuous ECG monitoring of the heart, and pulse oximetry. A flexible bronchoscope is inserted with the patient in a sitting or supine position. Once the bronchoscope is inserted into the upper airway, the vocal cords are inspected. The instrument is advanced to the trachea and further down into the bronchial system and each area is inspected as the bronchoscope passes. If an abnormality is discovered, it may be sampled using a brush, a needle, or forceps. Specimen of lung tissue (transbronchial biopsy) may be sampled using a real-time x-ray (fluoroscopy) or an electromagnetic tracking system.Pall J. Reynisson et al. (2014). Navigated Bronchoscopy - A Technical Review. Interv Pulmonol. 21(3):242-264 Flexible bronchoscopy can also be performed on intubated patients, such as patients in intensive care. In this case, the instrument is inserted through an adapter connected to the tracheal tube. Rigid bronchoscopy is performed under general anesthesia. Rigid bronchoscopes are too large to allow parallel placement of other devices in the trachea; therefore the anesthesia apparatus is connected to the bronchoscope and the patient is ventilated through the bronchoscope. Recovery Although most patients tolerate bronchoscopy well, a brief period of observation is required after the procedure. Most complications occur early and are readily apparent at the time of the procedure. The patient is assessed for respiratory difficulty (stridor and dyspnea resulting from laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, or bronchospasm). Monitoring continues until the effects of sedative drugs wear off and gag reflex has returned. If the patient has had a transbronchial biopsy, doctors may take a chest x-ray to rule out any air leakage in the lungs (pneumothorax) after the procedure. The patient will be hospitalized if there occurs any bleeding, air leakage (pneumothorax), or respiratory distress. Complications and risks Besides the risks associated with the drugs used, there are also specific risks of the procedure. Although a rigid bronchoscope can scratch or tear airways or damage the vocal cords, the risk of bronchoscopy is limited. Complications from fiberoptic bronchoscopy remain extremely low. Common complications include excessive bleeding following biopsy. A lung biopsy also may cause leakage of air, called pneumothorax. Pneumothorax occurs in less than 1% of lung biopsy cases. Laryngospasm is a rare complication but may sometimes require tracheal intubation. Patients with tumors or significant bleeding may experience increased difficulty breathing after a bronchoscopic procedure, sometimes due to swelling of the mucous membranes of the airways.

The division's components provided tactical airlift support worldwide, and after 1965, trained Lockheed C-130 crews and maintenance personnel, primarily for deployment to the Pacific and participation in the Vietnam War. From July 1965 until June 1969, the air division's 840th Combat Support Group served as the host for all active duty Air Force units stationed at Lockbourne. History The unit was organized in October 1964 at Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio and assigned the 317th Troop Carrier Wing, which had moved to Lockbourne in June.Ravenstein, pp. 167‚Äì169 In November, the 463d Troop Carrier Wing at Langley Air Force Base was assigned as the division's second tactical wing. The 463d Wing was partially deployed to support the Gulf of Tonkin Incident when it was assigned to the division.Ravenstein, pp. 256‚Äì258 The division controlled its assigned troop carrier wings and provided staff and advisory services to ensure their operational capability to deploy worldwide, and focused on airborne operations. From April to September 1965 the 463d Wing deployed to support the Organization of American States intervention in the Dominican Civil War. In July 1965, Lockbourne transferred to Tactical Air Command from Strategic Air Command and the 840th Combat Support Group and 840th Tactical Hospital, were activated and assigned to the air division. In November 1965, the 463d Wing moved permanently from Langley to the Pacific. It temporarily left behind one of its squadrons, the 772d Troop Carrier Squadron, which was assigned directly to the division until rejoining the wing in January 1966., Meanwhile, the 317th Wing focused on providing Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft replacement training support for Pacific Air Forces. After the move of the 463d Wing, airlift units at Langley were organized into the 316th Troop Carrier Wing, which was assigned to the division.Ravenstein, pp. 165‚Äì167 The division's wings participated in worldwide tactical airlift operations, humanitarian missions, tactical exercises, and maneuvers. After 1965 the division's C-130 Hercules training included training for maintenance personnel and reserve personnel activated as a result of the Vietnam War. In June 1969, in preparation for the inactivation of the division, the 840th Combat Support Group was inactivated and host responsibility for Lockbourne was assumed by the 317th Wing. The 840th was inactivated in December 1969 and its wings were reassigned directly to Ninth Air Force.

Though apparently no graduate, he was a loyal son to his alma mater, and set a high value on learning. The subject created two bye- fellows.\\"The colleges and halls: Magdalene.\\" A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 3, the City and University of Cambridge. Ed.

Tradition ascribes to him the adornment of the college with the rich Renaissance west porch, and a deed dated show of 16 July 1587s that he had then built or rebuilt a portion of the edifice containing three stories of four rooms apiece, which were appropriated to the use of two fellows and six scholars, whose maintenance he secured by a rentcharge. He added another fellowship by his will; two more were founded by his wife in 1591, and a fellowship and two scholarships by his second daughter in 1625. Wray was admitted on 6 February 1544‚Äì45 as a student at Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the bar in Hilary term 1549‚Äì50, was reader in autumn 1562, treasurer in 1565‚Äì6, and again reader in Lent 1567 in anticipation of his call to the degree of serjeant-at-law, which took place in the ensuing Easter term. On 18 June of the same year he was made queen's Serjeant. His parliamentary career began by his return (30 September 1553) for Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, which constituency he continued to represent until the death of Queen Mary of England in 1558. From 1563 to 1567 he sat for Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire. Like most of the gentlemen of the north, he was probably catholic at heart, but he evidently steered a wary course, for in the religious census of justices of the peace, compiled by episcopal authority in 1564, he is entered as ' indifferent.' In the following year he was assigned by the court of king's bench as counsel for Bonner in the proceedings on the Praemunire. In the spring of 1569‚Äì70 he attended the assizes held at York, Carlisle, and Durham for the trial of the northern rebels, and was employed in receiving their submissions. Among them were his brother Thomas and his sister's son John Gower, both of whom were pardoned. Speaker of the House of Commons In the parliament of 1571 Wray, then member for Ludgershall, Wiltshire, was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons. In his address to the throne on presentation he expatiated with much learning and eloquence in praise of the royal supremacy in matters ecclesiastical, touched lightly but loyally on supply, and gratefully acknowledged the free course which her majesty allowed to the administration of justice. The speech introduced petitions for freedom from arrest, free access to and considerate audience by her majesty, and free speech. The first three were granted ; the last only elicited an intimation that the commons would do well to meddle with no affairs of state but such as might be referred to them by ministers. The revival, in defiance of this injunction, of the whole question of the reformation of religion and church government occasioned an early dissolution (29 May). An act (13 Eliz. c. 29) confirming the charters, liberties, and privileges of the University of Cambridge owed its passage largely to Wray's influence, for which the thanks of the senate were communicated to him by letter (5 June). Lord Chief Justice Wray was appointed on 14 May 1572 justice, and on 8 November 1574 chief justice, of the queen's bench. The only state trial in which as puisne he took part was that in Trinity term 1572 of John Hall and Francis Rolston for conspiracy to effect the release of Mary, Queen of Scots. As chief justice, in addition to his ordinary jurisdiction he exercised functions of a somewhat multifarious character. He was a member of the commission appointed on 23 April 1577 to adjudicate on the validity of the election of John Underhill (1545?‚Äì1592) to the rectorship of Lincoln College, Oxford; and as assistant to the House of Lords he advised on bills, received petitions, and on one occasion (14 September 1586) was placed on the commission for its adjournment. He was a strong judge, who well knew how to sustain the dignity of his office, and showed as much firmness in restraining by prohibition an excess of jurisdiction on the part of the ecclesiastical commission in 1581 as in enforcing the laws against the sectaries in that and subsequent years. It was not until towards the close of his life that he was himself added to the ecclesiastical commission (Christmas 1589). The principal state trials over which he presided were those of the puritan John Stubbs or Stubbe, the Jesuit Edmund Campion, and his harbourer, William, lord Vaux (son of Thomas Vaux, 2nd Baron Vaux of Harrowdon), and the conspirators against the life of the queen, John Somerville and William Parry (d. 1585) He also presided at the Star Chamber inquest, by which (23 June 1585) the suicide and treasons of the Earl of Northumberland were certified; and was a member of the commissions which attainted Northumberland's accomplice, William, grandson of Sir William Shelley, and passed sentence of death upon Anthony Babington and his associates (September 1586). He was present at Fotheringay Castle as assessor to the tribunal before which the Queen of Scots pleaded in vain for her life (14 October 1586), but appears to have taken no part in the proceedings. He presided, vice Sir Thomas Bromley (1530‚Äì1587), absent through illness, at the subsequent trial in the Star Chamber of the unfortunate secretary of state, William Davison, whose indiscreet zeal he blandly censured as bonum sed non-bene before pronouncing the ruthless sentence of the court (28 March 1587). The last state trials in which he took part were those of Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, on 18 April 1589, and of Sir John Perrot on 27 April 1592. At a conference with his colleagues in Michaelmas term 1590 he initiated the revision of the form of commissions of the peace, then full of corruptions and redundancies. Death and reputation Effigy on tomb He died on 7 May 1592, and was buried in the church of St Michael, Glentworth, Lincolnshire, where, by the aid of grants from the profits of the mint, he had built for himself a noble mansion, which was long the seat of his posterity, and of which a portion was afterwards incorporated in the modern Glentworth Hall. By his will he established a dole for the inmates of an almshouse which he had built on the estate. A sessions house at Spittal-in-the-Street was also built by him. Wray was lord of the manors Brodsworth and Cusworth, Yorkshire, and of Ashby, Fillingham, Grainsby, and Kennington, Lincolnshire. His monument, a splendid structure in alabaster and other marbles, is in the chancel of Glentworth church. Re Justus, nomine verus: so, in allusion to his motto and with an evident play upon his name, he is characterised by the inscription. Coke praises his 'profound and judicial knowledge, accompanied with a ready and singular capacity, grave and sensible elocution, and continual and admirable patience.' No less eulogistic, though less weighty, are the encomiums of David Lloyd (State Worthies) and Fuller (Worthies of England). Their general accuracy is unquestionable; and the execution of Campion and the iniquitous sentence on Davison show that in crown cases Wray was by no means too scrupulous. Publications Wray's judgments and charges are recorded in the reports of Dyer, Plowden, Coke, and Croke, Cobbett's State Trials, and Nicolas's Life of Davison. One of his speeches on a call of Serjeants in Michaelmas term 1578 has been preserved by Dugdale. His speech to the throne in 1571 may be read in Sir Simonds D'Ewes's Journals of all the Parliaments during the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, or in Cobbett's Parliamentary History. For his opinions, notes of cases, letters, and other miscellaneous remains, see Peck's Desiderata Curiosa.

It is in a sheltered valley near the coast two miles (3 km) north-east of Boscastle.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 190 Bude & Clovelly Literary allusions Very specifically there is a poem by Thomas Hardy, perhaps better known for his prose works. Beeny Cliff March 1870 - March 1913 O the opal and the sapphire of that wandering western sea And the woman riding high above with bright hair flapping free - The woman who I loved so, and who loyally loved me. The pale mews plained below us, and the waves seemed far away In a nether sky, engrossed in saying their ceaseless babbling say, As we laughed light- heartedly aloft on that clear-sunned March day. A little cloud then cloaked us, and there flew an irised rain. And the Atlantic dyed its levels with a dull misfeatured stain, And then the sun burst out again, and purples prinked the main. \\\\- Still in all its chasmal beauty bulks old Beeny to the sky, And shall she and I not go there once again now March is nigh, And the sweet things said in that March say anew there by and by? What if still in chasmal beauty looms that wild weird western shore, The woman now is - elsewhere - whom the ambling pony bore, And nor knows nor cares for Beeny, and will laugh there nevermore. Further, in \\"A Death-Day Recalled,\\" collected in Satires of Circumstance (1914), Thomas Hardy wrote: Beeny did not quiver, Juliot grew not gray, Thin Vallency's river Held its wonted way. Bos seemed not to utter Dimmest note of dirge, Targan mouth a mutterI.e. Pentargon To its creamy surge. Yet though these, unheeding, Listless, passed the hour Of her spirit's speeding, She had, in her flower, Sought and loved the places Much and often pined For their lonely faces When in towns confined. Why did not Vallency In his purl deplore One whose haunts were whence he Drew his limpid store? Why did Bos not thunder, Targan apprehend Body and Breath were sunder Of their former friend?

It is located on the river East Dart about south of Postbridge. The first mention of a settlement at this location is in a Duchy of Cornwall record from 1355 which gives the name of a farm here as Welford, a contraction of wielle (spring) and ford. However, in his High Dartmoor (1983), Eric Hemery proposed that the name comes from bal (mine) and ford, meaning the mine by the ford. The River East Dart at Bellever Until the period after World War II the hamlet consisted of Bellever Farm (owned by the Duchy of Cornwall) and its outbuildings, with a small number of cottages for the farm workers. The farm gained a reputation for the introduction of Galloway and Aberdeen Angus cattle onto Dartmoor. However, in 1931 the Forestry Commission bought the farm and began a large planting scheme here; several houses were built in the 1950s to house the forestry workers. The coniferous plantation known as Bellever Forest surrounds the hamlet on its north, west and south sides. In 1934 some of the barns of Bellever Farm were let to Youth Hostels Association (England & Wales) and now form the oldest, still functioning youth hostel in Devon. As of 2019 the hamlet is served by a daily bus service that runs between Yelverton, Princetown, Postbridge and Tavistock.

Stationery Office, 1956 (Page 525) Belowda Beacon Belowda Beacon was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1996. The description and reasons given by English Nature are as follows: This site shows superb development of minerals formed by late granitic fractionation and boron-fluorine metasomatism in a differentiate of the Belowda coarse megacrystic biotite granite boss. A short shallow adit driven westward as part of a larger stockwork tin mine exposes in its walls a topaz-tourmaline-quartz rock. The level is now collapsed, but exposes are still visible. Small overgrown dumps at the mouth of the adit also contains large pieces of the topaz and quartz with nests of finely developed tourmaline crystals. Topaz may form up to 80% of the rock. Rarely, small yellowish euhedral topaz crystals are present in cavities, the maximum size being 1 cm (the largest recorded in England) The occurrence is very unusual and considerable mineralogical interest. The downs around the beacon, as well as the downs around Tregonetha form the Tregonetha & Belowda Downs SSSI, noted for its biological interest and biodiversity.

It is part of the Welbeck Abbey Estate, on the edge of modern-day Sherwood Forest. The village is south-east of Hodthorpe, south-east of Whitwell and south-west of Worksop (where the population is listed). The village is the easternmost settlement in Derbyshire. The village has two parts, Belph Village and Penny Green. Belph Village consists of about 30 houses either side of a single lane. A number were originally farmhouses; all except Springfield Farm are now private homes. Penny Green consists of a row of 8 labourers' cottages built in the 1900s on the Whitwell Station Road, and a large stone cottage. The latter was once the Portland Arms (a pub). On the Creswell Crags Road are Brook Cottages, three stone-built 19th-century cottages. An area of the village known as the \\"Millash\\" was located where a stream flows from a natural fault. The ruins of two mills survive, the rest of the hamlet being buried under a spoil tip left by the now defunct Whitwell Colliery.

This breed is raised primarily for meat. History Once common all over Dorset, the breed was once one of the rarest in Britain and is still at risk. It nearly became extinct in the 1970s, but has now recovered through efforts of dedicated breeders and the help of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. It is now listed as \\"at risk\\", being a minority breed. As one of the very old tan-faced breeds native to heathlands, the Portland was a primary contributor to the Dorset breed. Fancy's Family Farm, a community farm on the Isle of Portland is home to the only flock of the Portland Sheep breed on the island. Characteristics The Portland is a small sheep, with a cream fleece and golden tan face and legs. Both sexes are horned: in the adult male the horns are heavy and form double spirals; in the female the horns are lighter and shorter, being a single crescent shape. The horns are cream-coloured, often having one or more thin black lines running along the horn lengthways. Lambs are born with a foxy-red coat which changes in the first few months to a creamy white. The face is generally free of wool, but some sheep have a top knot of short wool. A distinctive feature is that they tend to have paler patches around the eyes, referred to as 'spectacles'. Both sexes have a broad muzzle, which is usually as pale as the 'spectacles'. Ewes tend to have a dished face, rather than a roman nose. The nose is usually black. In adult sheep the front legs and the rear legs below the hocks are free of wool. The feet are mainly black. The meat has a more complex flavour than most commercial breeds, highly prized since the time of George III. They produce 2‚Äì3 kg. of 50's‚Äì60's down-quality wool with a staple length of 6‚Äì9 cm (2.5‚Äì3.5 in), which is suitable for hosiery and hand-knitting yarns. This breed will sometimes breed out of season, and was the first breed of sheep in Britain able to have lambs at any time of the year.

Red was also the colour used by Danish and English shipping, the English later adopting the St George's Cross. From the second half of the 13th century, the individual Hanseatic cities created various banners to distinguish themselves from other member cities. The red gonfalone remained in use in addition to these flags. The oldest Hanseatic flag is the plain red banner used by Hamburg. Hanseatic flags were mostly red-white and some featured symbols, such as crosses. Many cities that were members of the Hanseatic league continue to use red and white as their city colours today.

He initially enrolled at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette WCIU-TV KTLA Marilyn Milian Major League Baseball with a full athletic scholarship in track and field. He left the track team to form a singing group known as Fasho, which later changed its name to Fifth Element. After Fifth Element was dissolved, Bernard pursued a solo career. He sang at venues such as talent shows, weddings and funerals. With a five-octave vocal range, Bernard earned the nickname \\"Cupid\\" for an impressive performance of the Sam Cooke's 1960s hit single \\"Cupid\\". Chicago Music career The singer first received radio airplay in 2001 with his self-released first single, \\"Do Ya Thang\\". His second self-released album, 2005's The King of Down South R&B;, gained airplay throughout the region, from Florida to Texas. In January 2007, shortly before the release of his third album, Time For a Change, he was signed to Atlantic Records. His first single from that album, \\"Cupid Shuffle\\", peaked at No. 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 21 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Since then the song has gone double platinum and gets roughly 6,500 new downloads each week. His other singles include \\"Say Yes\\", \\"Happy Dance\\", \\"The Love Slide\\" and \\"Do My Ladies Run This Party\\". In 2008, Cupid broke the Guinness World Record for the largest line dance assembled with over 17,000 people in Atlanta at Ebony's Black Family Reunion Tour.

None of the four judges Adam Levine, Cee Lo Green, Christina Aguilera or Blake Shelton pressed their \\"I Want You\\" button, thus eliminating him from further competition. But Cee Lo Green recognized Cupid after he finished the song and asked him to perform another tune to prove that \\"he can sing\\".

Throughout the school's history of more than 400 years, the name was changed repeatedly. It's nowadays commonly called Stater Koll√©isch or De Koll√©isch, and is the nation's oldest school still in existence. History=Jesuit Origins On 15 May 1585, Pope Sixtus V signed a Papal bull granting the Jesuit Order the right to establish a school in Luxembourg.400 Joer Koll√©isch (√©ditions saint-paul, 2003) Vol. I : Du Coll√®ge des J√©suites au Coll√®ge Municipal 1603-1815 p.66 The school was eventually founded in 1603 by the Jesuit Order,400 Joer Koll√©isch (√©ditions saint-paul, 2003) Vol. I : Du Coll√®ge des J√©suites au Coll√®ge Municipal 1603-1815 p.83 and was located next to the Notre Dame Cathedral, in the Ville Haute quarter. It was modeled after the Jesuit school in Trier. The school flourished and in 1684 it was expanded.400 Joer Koll√©isch (√©ditions saint- paul, 2003) Vol. I : Du Coll√®ge des J√©suites au Coll√®ge Municipal 1603-1815 p.84 After the Suppression of the Society of Jesus by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, the school was renamed as the Coll√®ge royal, and was put under auspices of the clergy. Furthermore, the school's curriculum was reformed and expanded. Secularization The Ath√©n√©e de Luxembourg in 1828 In the course of the French Revolution and the political changes that followed, notably the Napoleon Regime, the school was reorganized according to French educational systems and renamed several times: √âcole centrale (1795-1802), √âcole Secondaire (1802-1808), Coll√®ge municipal (1808-1817). In 1817, the school was renamed \\"Ath√©n√©e royal grand-ducal\\". To commemorate this event, a chronogram ATHENAEVM SIT LVCELBVRGI DECOR (=1817) was placed on the backside of a portal at the school's old premises. In the course of the 19th century, the curriculum was expanded and modernized. Second World War When Luxembourg was occupied by Nazi forces in World War II in 1940, the school was forcibly Germanized, renamed as Gymnasium mit Oberschule f√ºr Jungen, and the French language was forbidden. These policies were met with considerable resistance. Infamously, when the Germans dismantled the G√´lle Fra memorial, several hundred of the school's students protested. Two Professors and 76 students of the Ath√©n√©√© lost their lives during the war. Post-World War II: A New Building After the Second World War, the school's premises became too small, and the school was relocated in 1964 to the Hollerich quarter, in the south-west of the city. Since the Ath√©n√©e moved to this location, other schools have moved to the site as well, creating Campus Geessekn√§ppchen, just to the north of the terminus of the A4 motorway. The old site of the city Athenaeum currently hosts the National Library. 21st century In 2003, the school celebrated its 400th anniversary with a series of events and the publication of a four-volume study of the school's rich history. The school's official motto is 'Tradition & Innovation', a phrase that the reflects the institution's continuous emphasis on scholarly excellence, the respect of humanist traditions and the desire to stay innovative. Since 2007, Joseph Salentiny is the principal of the 'Ath√©n√©e de Luxembourg'.

Written as a requiem and using forces similar in scale to Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony, the work calls for a full symphony orchestra, soloists, massed choirs including children's choirs, offstage instrumentalists and an organ. Foulds wrote the work between 1919 and 1921, and conceived it as a memorial to the dead of all nations in the wake of the First World War. The text (in English), assembled by his wife Maud MacCarthy, to whom the score is dedicated, is not liturgical, though it uses sections of the Requiem Mass plus several other Biblical passages as well as excerpts from John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, a poem by the Hindu poet Kabir and a few passages she wrote herself. There are 20 movements arranged in two parts of 10 movements each, though some movements are quite brief. It was premiered under the auspices of the Royal British Legion on Armistice Night, 11 November 1923 in the Royal Albert Hall by up to 1,250 instrumentalists and singers; the latter were called the Cenotaph Choir. The soloists were Herbert Heyner, Ida Cooper, Olga Haley and William Heseltine. The programme-book for that occasion proclaimed on its cover that the work was 'A Cenotaph in Sound'Cover reproduced in Chandos CD booklet. and it is likely that Foulds wished to present his work as a musical equivalent of the Cenotaph recently erected in Whitehall and designed by his friend Sir Edwin Lutyens. The performance brought Foulds such popular acclaim that after his death Maud MacCarthy was able to publish a book devoted to the positive responses to the work, though critical reaction was mixed. The work was repeated from 1924 to 1926 and constituted the first Festivals of Remembrance. The vocal score was published by W. Paxton & Co. Ltd., London, whose business was eventually absorbed by the music publishers Novello & Co. During the period when the work was being performed in the 1920s, Foulds introduced various revisions and modifications. Having lain neglected for eighty years, the BBC in association with the Royal British Legion undertook a revival of the work, performed at the Royal Albert Hall on 11 November 2007. The BBC Symphony Orchestra was joined by soloists Jeanne-Mich√®le Charbonnet, Catherine Wyn-Rogers, Gerald Finley and Stuart Skelton and the BBC Symphony Chorus was joined by the Crouch End Festival Chorus, Philharmonia Chorus and Trinity Boys' Choir and conducted by Leon Botstein.http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/08_august/09/foulds.shtml BBC Press Release The concert was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 (and was streamed online from their site) and was also recorded for later release by Chandos Records.

The Mediatization of Religion: A Theory of the Media as Agents of Religious Change. In Northern Lights 2008. Yearbook of Film & Media Studies. Bristol: Intellect Press: 7. As a consequence of this process, institutions and whole societies are shaped by and dependent on mass media.Mazzoleni, G., & Schulz, W. (1999). \\"Mediatization\\" of Politics: A Challenge for Democracy? Political Communication, 16(3), 247-261.  Origins  The \\"father\\" of this field is certainly Marshall McLuhan, who proposed that a communication medium itself, not the messages it carries, should be the primary focus of study. McLuhan, Marshall (1964). Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, published in 1964]. Mediatization is part of a paradigmatic shift in media and communication research. Following the concept of 'mediation', 'mediatization' has become the proper concept for capturing how processes of communication transform society, designating large-scale relationships. The two are complementary.Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society Media, Culture & Society 37(2) 314‚Äì324. As noted by Von Joachim Preusse and Sarah Zielmann, Kent Asp introduced and lamented on the concept of mediatization, and they clarify that: \\"Mediatisation was first applied to media's impact on political communication and other effects on politics. The Swedish media researcher Kent Asp was the first to speak of the mediatisation of political life, by which he meant a process whereby 'a political system to a high degree is influenced by and adjusted to the demands of the mass media in their coverage of politics'\\" (2010: 336). Asp used the term mediated politics to describe how the media have become a necessary source of information between politicians and those in authority and those they governed. According to Asp's understanding politics are mediated when the mass media are the main or the only source of political information through which it may influence or even shape people's conceptions of political reality. Asp's theoretical assumptions that mass media may influence and mobilize current political ideas through mediatized rituals have been adopted by various communication scholars. In the tradition of Asp, the Danish media scholar Stig Hjarvard helped to develop the concept of mediatization and suggested that mediatization is a social process whereby the society is saturated and inundated by the media to the extent that the media cannot longer be thought of separated from other institutions within the society.Hjarvard, S. (2008). The Mediatization of Religion: A Theory of the Media as Agents of Religious Change. In Northern Lights 2008. Yearbook of Film & Media Studies. Bristol: Intellect Press.  Sociocultural change  The concept has evolved to focus not only on media effects but on the interrelation between the change of media communication on the one hand and sociocultural changes on the other, as part of our everyday communication practices and our communicative construction of reality.Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society, Media, Culture & Society 37(2) 314‚Äì324. Mediatization research investigates the interrelation between media communicative change and sociocultural change, understood as a meta-process (a conceptual construct designating long-term processes of change).Couldry, N. & A. Hepp. (2013). Conceptualizing Mediatization: Contexts,Traditions, Arguments. Communication Theory 23: 191-202. Media do not necessarily 'cause' the transformations but they have become co-constitutive for the articulation of politics, economics, education, religion, etc.Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society, Media, Culture & Society 37(2) 314‚Äì324. For example, television, by showcasing know-how health specialists who promote quick individual changes in lifestyle, co-constructs the notion of health together with other institutions and broader cultural shifts in perceptions of the body. Hjarvard and Peterson summarize media's role in cultural change: \\"(1) When various forms of subcultures try to make use of media for their own purposes, they often become (re-)embedded into mainstream culture; (2) National cultural policies often serve as levers for increased mediatization; (3) Mediatization involves a transformation of the ways in which authority and expertise are performed and reputation is acquired and defended; and (4) Technological developments shape the media's affordances and thus the particular path of mediatization.\\"Hjarvard, S. & L.N. Peterson, (2013). Mediatization and cultural change, MedieKultur, 54: 3. Research mobilizing mediatization theories explores the ways in which media are embedded in cultural transformation. For example, \\"tactical\\" mediatization designates the response of community organizations and activists to wider technological changes. Kim Sawchuk, professor in Communication Studies at Concordia University, worked with a group of elderly who managed to retain their own agency in this context.Sawchuk, K. (2013). Tactical mediatization and activist ageing: pressures, push-backs, and the story of RECAA. MedieKultur 54: 47-64. For the elderly, the pressure to mediatize comes from various institutions that are transitioning to online services (government agencies, funding, banks, etc.), among other things. A tactical approach to media is one that comes from those who are subordinates within these systems. It means to implement work-arounds to make the technologies work for them. For example, in the case of the elderly group she studies, they borrowed equipment to produce video capsules explaining their mandate and the importance of this mandate for their communities, which allowed them to reach new audiences while keeping the tone and style of face-to-face communication they privilege in their day-to-day practice. Doing this, they also subverted expectations about the ability of the elderly to use new media effectively. Another example of study is one which is focused on the media-related practices of graffiti writers and skaters, showing how media integrate and modulate their everyday practices. The analysis also demonstrates how the mediatization of these subcultural groups brings them to become part of mainstream culture, changes their rebellious and oppositional image and engages them with the global commercialization culture.Encheva, K., Driessens, O., & Verstraeten, H. (2013). The mediatization of deviant subcultures: an analysis of the media - related practices of graffiti writers and skaters, MedieKultur, 54: 29. An example of study mobilizing mediatization theories would be one interested in how media's omnipresence informs the ways Femen's protests may take place on public scenes, allow communication between individual bodies and a shared understanding of activist imaginary. It aims to analyse how their practices are moulded by the media and how these are staged in manners which facilitates spreadability.Reestorff, C. M. (2014).

The wars resulted with the collapse and subordination of the Bulgarian Empire, and effectively came to an end with the Ottoman conquest of Tarnovo in July 1393, although other Bulgarian territories, such as the Tsardom of Vidin, held out slightly longer. As a result of the wars the Ottoman Empire greatly expanded its territory on the Balkan peninsula, stretching from Danube to the Aegean Sea.  The situation in the Balkans on the eve of the Ottoman invasion  From the 13th century, the two main Balkan powers Byzantium and Bulgaria fell victims to a process of decentralization, as local feudal lords grew stronger and more independent from the emperors in Constantinople and Tarnovo. This weakened the military and economic power of the central rulers. The process deteriorated central authority to an even larger extent in the 14th century, when numerous nobles came to be only nominally subordinated to the government. In Bulgaria the powerful House of Shishman ruled over the Vidin Province in the west, while in the east Balik established a quasi-independent Despotate of Dobruja. While the two Empires were facing enormous internal difficulties, the Serbs took the favorable opportunity to expand its domain. During the civil war in Byzantium in 1320s and 1330s, the Serbs conquered most of the Bulgarian and Aromanian populated Macedonia from the Byzantines. In 1330 Serbian forces defeated Bulgarian ones, led by Emperor Michail Shishman at Velbazhd effectively raising the country to the status of the most powerful state in the region. In 1346, Serbian king Stefan Uro≈° IV Du≈°an received the title of Emperor with the blessing of the Bulgarian Emperor Ivan Alexander, although after his death in 1355, the large Serbian Empire disintegrated into a few independent states. In Bulgaria of the same period Ivan Sratsimir inherited Vidin from his father Ivan Alexander in 1356, while despot Dobrotitsa ‚Äì nominally his subject ‚Äì ruled Dobruja. Lack of stability was eminent in the southern Balkans as well: in 1341‚Äì1347 the Byzantine Empire was shaken by a bloody civil war between John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos. Circa mid 14th century the Balkans were politically disunited into a number of small states frequently in competition with each other and there was no single strong entity with a powerful enough army to withstand the Muslim invaders. In addition to the mainly Orthodox countries such as Bulgaria, Byzantium and Serbia, there were a number of Catholic possessions to the west and south held by Venice, Genoa and the Kingdom of Hungary as well as Kingdom of Bosnia whose Bosnian Church (closely related to the Bogomils) was considered heretic by both Orthodox and Catholics. Religious dissimilarity was thus also a source for constant political tensions in the region.  Military actions during the reign of Ivan Alexander  During the civil war in Byzantium both Palaiologos and Kantakouzenos were trying to find external allies and used foreign mercenaries. The Bulgarian Emperor supported the first opponent whose stronghold was Constantinople. John Kantakouzenos on the other hand regularly hired Ottoman Turk mercenaries from Asia Minor who soon became a fixture on the battlefields in Thrace. The Byzantines often lost control over the Ottomans then as the latter regularly plundered villages in the Southern Balkans after the 1320s. Battle of Boulgarophygon,896.

Probably the first local ruler to become aware of the impending Ottoman threat, Momchil unsuccessfully pleaded with the emperors of Bulgaria and Byzantium for help. Even though his troops continued the resistance in the Eastern Rhodopes, in May 1345 the Turks led by Umur Beg marched from Asia Minor and devastated Bulgarian territories driving away people and livestock.Ioannes Cantacuzenus.

After Ivan Alexander's death on 17 February 1371, the lands populated by Bulgarians were divided into several independent states. Much of the former territory of the Second Bulgarian Empire came under the rule of the tsar's third son Ivan Shishman; the northwestern areas were the dominance of the eldest son Ivan Sratsimir, despot Dobrotitsa held Dobruja, and most of Macedonia was divided into several feudal states controlled by Serbian nobles.  Battle of Chernomen and its consequences  Sultan Murad I In 1371 two feudal lords in Macedonia organised a campaign against the Turks. Serbian brothers Vukashin and Uglesha, respectively the king of Prilep and the despot of Ser, gathered a numerous Christian army aiming to stop the Muslim invaders. Uglesha, whose lands bordered Ottoman territory to the east, realized the threat and unsuccessfully appealed to Serbian and Bulgarian states for help. Ruling over mixed Serbian- Greek-Bulgarian population, the two brothers set off to the east with 20 to 70,000 strong ethnically diverse army. Considerably less numerous troops led by Lala ≈ûahin Pasha attacked the united Balkan forces at night on 26 September as the latter camped by the village of Chernomen in the lower Maritsa valley. The entire army was pushed back and Vukashin and Uglesha perished along with much of their forces.–î—É–π—á–µ–≤, –ò–≤. –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–∏–µ. –û—Ç –ß–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–º–µ–Ω –¥–æ –ö–æ—Å–æ–≤–æ –ø–æ–ª–µ, –°., 1972, —Å.546 Immediately after the battle, the armies of Murad I embarked on another campaign overrunning Northern Thrace and forcing young Ivan Shishman to pull back north of the Balkan Mountains. A number of fortresses fell, though after prolonged and fierce sieges: the town of Diampol, for instance, fought against the forces of Timurtash for months but was eventually forced to surrender because of food shortage.Seadeddin, Chronica dell' origine e progresse della casa ottomana. Vienna, 1649, p. 101 One of Ivan Shishman's voivodes, Shishkin, was killed in battle on the southern skirts of the Balkan Mountains further easing the Ottoman conquest of the Rhodopes, Kostenets, Ihtiman, and Samokov. After a bloody siege they captured Bitola in the southwest and soon encroached on the Sofia Valley. In 1373 Ivan Shishman was forced to negotiate a humiliating peace treaty: he became an Ottoman vassal strengthening the union with a marriage between Murad and Shishman's sister Kera Tamara. To compensate, the Ottomans returned some of the conquered lands, including Ihtiman and Samokov.–°–∏–Ω–æ–¥–Ω–∏–∫ —Ü–∞—Ä—è –ë–æ—Ä–∏–ª–∞, —Å. 89 Between 1371 and 1373 the Ottomans emerged as a considerable power on the Balkans.

Fighting occurred at Zarenitsa, Zagrad, Gradishte, Chiltepe and Karakulas (along Vacha), Imaretdere and Momina Voda (heights close to Ardino) among others. Especially ferocious were the engagements at Momina Voda, where prominent Ottoman general Sar«é Baba was killed, and Karakulas where Enihan Baba perished.  Fall of Sofia  While Ivan Shishman was desperately trying to resist against the strong Ottoman pressure, his brother Ivan Sratsimir not only withheld help but tried to make use of the difficulties which his brother faced to expand his domains over certain areas of the Tarnovo Tsardom. As Shishman's attention was pointed to the south, Ivan Sratsimir took control of the important city of SofiaKuzev, Al.

The city which was commanded by ban Yanuka repulsed all the attacks of the superior Ottoman forces under Lala ≈ûahin. The later could not continue the siege and was forced to pull back to Odrin where he reported his failure to the Sultan. While he was absent the Turks managed to infiltrate Sofia and one Muslim Bulgarian captured ban Yanuke while hunting and sent him to Lala ≈ûahin who was in Plovdiv at that time. From there the Bulgarian commander was sent back to Sofia and when the defenders saw their captured leader they surrendered the city to the Ottomans (1382).Seadeddin, Chronica dell' origine e progresse della casa ottomana.

After the Ottomans secured the possession of the area around Sofia, they continued their march to the northwest. The main objective of Murad was to break the ties between Bulgaria and Serbia because despite the fact that Ivan Shishman was his vassal, Murad did not trust him and knew that the Bulgarian ruler was waiting for an appropriate opportunity to renege. After bitter fighting, in 1386 the Turks seized Pirot and Naissus, killing and enslaving many Bulgarians.Seadeddin, Chronica dell' origine e progresse della casa ottomana. Vienna, 1649, p. 124 sq  The campaign of 1388  The advance of the Ottomans in the central parts of the Balkan peninsula caused serious anxiety not only for Ivan Shishman but also in Serbia and Bosnia. The Serbian Prince Lazar and the Bosnian King Tvardko organized an anti-Ottoman coalition and the Bulgarian Emperor joined them but was unable to send troops. In 1387 the united forces of Bosnians and Serbs defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Ploƒçnik. However, while the Christian states did not make any attempt to exploit the victory, the Turks' reaction was swift. In 1388 a 30,000 strong army commanded by Ali Pasha passed through the eastern Balkan Mountains and struck deep into Bulgaria's north. The Bulgarians were completely surprised and the invaders seized Ovech, Shumen, Madara and other towns.Seadeddin, Chronica dell' origine e progresse della casa ottomana. Vienna, 1649, p. 137 sq Due to the surprise campaign at first the towns and the castles were unable to organize proper defence but after the initial shock the Bulgarians took precautions. When the army of Ali Pasha besieged Varna, the defenders stiffly resisted and the Turks were forced to abandon the siege and march northwards.Lennciavius. Historiae musulmane turcorum de monumentis ipsorum sxcerptae. Libri XIII, Frankfurt, 1501, p. 272 In Tutrakan the citizens allowed the Turks to install a small garrison but then they killed the Turkish soldiers and prepared for siege. Ali Pasha immediately burned the surrounding fields and soon the starving town had to surrender.Lennciavius. Historiae musulmane turcorum de monumentis ipsorum sxcerptae. Libri XIII, Frankfurt, 1501, p. 274 After this success they advanced to the west towards Nicopolis, one of the strongest Bulgarian fortresses along the Danube. The defence was organized by Ivan Shishman who was currently in the town. Although the Ottomans had nearly 30,000 men they could not take it and Ali Pasha had to seek reinforcements from Murad himself. According to Seadeddin the Sultan marched to Nikopol with an enormous army firmly decided to seize the town at all costs. When Ivan Shishman faced the new enemy he sought a truce. Murad agreed and the Bulgarians saved Nikopol but were forced to cede another key Danubian fortress, Dorostolon. However, when Ali Pasha reached Silistra, the Bulgarians refused to surrender the town. Murad besieged Nikopol for a second time and this time Ivan Shishman agreed to the Ottoman conditions and a Turkish garrison was installed in Silistra. As a result of the campaign the Turks took most of eastern Bulgaria including several key towns. Now the authority of Ivan Shishman was reduced to the lands to the west of the capital Tarnovo and several castles along the Danube. To the east the Bulgarians kept Varna and the capital of the Principality of Karvuna, Kaliakra. Probably at that time Ivan Sratsimir became an Ottoman vassal.–ù–∏–∫–æ–≤, –ü. –¢—É—Ä—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ –∑–∞–≤–ª–∞–¥—è–≤–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è –∏ —Å—ä–¥–±–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –®–∏—à–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤—Ü–∏-–ò–ò–î, 7-8, 1928, —Å.98  References  *–í–∞—Å–∏–ª –ù. –ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏, –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –¥—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–∑ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–µ, –ß–∞—Å—Ç I, II –∏–∑–¥., –ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –∏–∑–∫—É—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1970. *–ê—Ç–∞–Ω–∞—Å –ü–µ–π—á–µ–≤ –∏ –∫–æ–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤, 1300 –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∞, –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1984. *–ô–æ—Ä–¥–∞–Ω –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, –ú–∏–ª—á–æ –õ–∞–ª–∫–æ–≤, –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ö–∞–Ω–æ–≤–µ –∏ —Ü–∞—Ä–µ, –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ –¢—ä—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–æ, 1996.

During the Battle of Aizu, she fought with a naginata (a Japanese polearm) and was the leader of an ad hoc corps of female combatants who fought in the battle independently. Takeko and other women stepped forward on the front line without permission, as the senior Aizu retainers did not allow them to fight as an official part of the domain's army.Hoshi Ry≈çichi (2006). Onnatachi no Aizusens≈ç. Tokyo: Heibonsha. p. 80. This unit was later retroactively called the . With the reforms of the Meiji era, the samurai class was abolished and a western-style national army was established, making Nakano Takeko one of the last samurai in history. History= Early years  Born in Edo, Nakano Takeko was the firstborn daughter of Nakano Heinai (1810-1878), a samurai and official of Aizu, and of Nakano K≈çko (1825-1872), daughter of Oinuma Kinai, samurai in the service of Toda of the Ashikaga domain. She had a younger brother and sister: Nakano Toyoki and Nakano Y≈´ko (1853-1931). Their residence was in Beidai Ninocho, in the quarters of Tamogami Hyogo, a distant relative of her father. She was good-looking, well- educated, and came from a very powerful samurai family. From 1853 to 1863, she received a strict and complete training in martial arts, in the literary arts on Chinese Confucian classics and in calligraphy, and was adopted by her own teacher, Akaoka Daisuke, who was also the famous instructor of Matsudaira Teru, adoptive younger sister of Matsudaira Katamori, daimy≈ç of Aizu. She taught students younger than her, like her sister, who also attended school. She loved to read the many stories of Japanese female warriors, generals and empresses, but the legend of Tomoe Gozen deeply affected her. From childhood, she recited the Ogura Hyakunin isshu. Her certification (menkyo) was in Hasso- Shoken, a branch of the major Itto-ryu tradition. With this official acknowledgment of her ability, she found employment at the Itakura estate, lord of Niwase, a secondary domain in today's Okayama prefecture. She taught naginata to the lord's wife and served her as her secretary. She left this position in 1863, when she was adopted by her master, who had been transferred to Osaka for a job of the Aizu domain and had forces deployed in Kyoto for security duties. He tried to get his to marry her nephew, but since the nation was shaken by social unrest, she refused and reunited with her Edo family. After working with the adoptive father as instructor of martial arts during the sixties of the nineteenth century, Nakano was in the region of Aizu for the first time in February 1868. During those spring and summer months, she taught naginata to women and children in Aizuwakamatsu castle, as well as capturing the voyeurs of the women's bathroom.  The civil war  Her martial figure is linked to the time of the Boshin war, whose war events saw two adverse factions oppose in a civil conflict: the loyal supporters of the Tokugawa shogunate and the advocates of the restoration of the Meiji emperor, whose results were favorable to the latter would have brought the Japanese Empire to the end of the 19th century. During the conflict, Nakano Takeko worked in defense of the sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu and took part in the Battle of Aizu, in which she distinguished herself by fighting against a white weapon, brandishing a naginata, a Japanese weapon. In the clash with the overwhelming imperial forces, together with her mother and sister, she was head of an ad hoc body of female warriors. The was formed by these women: Hirata Koch≈ç and another Onna-bugeisha. * The leader of the group, Nakano Takeko. She was 21 years old at this time. * Takeko's mother and sister, Kouko and Y≈´ko.

Through rain and sleet, the women went into battle autonomously and independently, since the ancient officials of Aizu, in particular Kayano Gonbei, did not allow them to wars, officially, as part of the army of domination. This unit was later retroactively given the name of a female army (Â®òÂ≠ê Èöä J≈çshitai?). It was Furuya Sakuzaemon, the commander of Aizu's troops, who designated her as the leader of the samurai women the day before her death.  Death  Photo of unknown 205x205pxDuring the defense, at the Yanagi bridge in the area of Nishibata, in Fukushima, early in the morning she launched a charge to the firearm against the firearms of the huge troops of the Japanese imperial army of the domain of ≈ågaki, commanded by a shaguma. When the adversaries realized, surprisingly, that they were female soldiers, an order was immediately given to keep the fire in order not to kill them. This hesitation allowed the warriors to approach the enemies and face them with the white weapon: several were killed, before the fire resumed. The enemy was impressed by the lethal fury of the women of Aizu. Nakano Takeko herself killed five or six of them with naginata shots before succumbing to a rifle shot to the chest that would have been fatal for her. Rather than letting the enemy take possession of her corpse to wreak havoc, and cutting her head off to use it as a war trophy, she asked her sister Y≈´ko to behead her herself to prevent her capture and to make an honorable burial. Y≈´ko requested the assistance of an Aizu soldier, Ueno Yoshisabur≈ç, for the beheading. Hirata Koch≈ç, the foster younger sister who had studied naginata and calligraphy as Daisuke's foster daughter, was saved by Jinbo Yukiko in the battle and, being the vice-commander, assumed command of the troop to defend Aizuwakamatsu Castle after she was killed, while the deputy became Yamamoto Yaeko. After the battle K≈çko and Y≈´ko entered Tsuruga castle and joined Yamamoto Yae. After the battle, detached from the body, the head of Nakano Takeko was thus moved by her sister to the nearby H≈çkai temple of her family, modern Aizubange, in the prefecture of Fukushima, and buried with honor by the priest under a pine tree. Her weapon was donated to the temple.Yamakawa Kenjir≈ç; Munekawa Toraji (1926). Hosh≈´ Aizu Byakkotai j≈´ky≈´shi-den. Wakamatsu: Aizu Ch≈çrei Gikai. pp. 63‚Äì64.

He made 24 appearances for the club between 1996 and 2001, and spent time on loan to Ipswich Town and Wigan Athletic before making a permanent move to Oldham Athletic in 2002. He made 52 appearances in two seasons with the Latics before struggles with his mental health led to his retirement at the age of 26. Playing career Clegg, born in Ashton-under- Lyne, began his football career as a trainee with Manchester United and was part of the 1995 FA Youth Cup-winning side. He turned professional soon afterwards, and made his first-team debut on 23 November 1996, in a Premier League game away to Middlesbrough which finished as a 2‚Äì2 draw. He played in four FA Premier League games in the 1996‚Äì97 season, and although United were champions for the fourth time in five seasons it was not enough for a title winner's medal. He managed a further three appearances in 1997‚Äì98 (when United were trophyless for only the second time in the decade) before making his final two appearances in the 1999‚Äì2000 campaign, when United won their sixth title in eight seasons, but once again Clegg failed to meet the required number of appearances for a title winner's medal.

Career = Oldham Athletic  Allott initially came through the youth ranks and was highly rated as a centre forward, scoring on his debut as a substitute in a defeat against Bolton Wanderers at Burnden Park in October 1996. When Manager Neil Warnock left the club in 1998 and took a lot of the first team with him Allott featured more in Andy Ritchie's team. His second season saw him finish the campaign as top goalscorer with 12 goals and the following season he was ever present and finished with 8 goals. However, in the Summer of 2001, the club was taken over by millionaire Chris Moore who promised to bring in better quality players and despite Allott starting the season in the first team when manager Ritchie was sacked in early November new manager Mick Wadsworth had the money to bring in his own players and he was loaned out and eventually sold to Chesterfield in January 2002.  Chesterfield  At Chesterfield, Allott had a limited return as a goalscorer and was switched to a right midfield role after the arrival of manager Roy McFarland in 2003, later becoming firmly established in central midfield.  Oldham Athletic  He returned to Oldham in 2007 as a replacement for Richie Wellens, this time as a central midfielder. His game had improved in this role and his first season back saw him sweep up at the club's Player of the Season awards. However, the following season saw his defensive partner Garry McDonald depart the club to be replaced by Danny Whitaker and although the club started the season well, gaps in the midfield in some games led the club to falter badly from a position in the play-offs to midtable by the end of the season and new manager Dave Penney chose not to keep him at the club.  Chesterfield  In the summer of 2009, Allot returned to Chesterfield having initially signed a two-year contract with Tranmere Rovers, becoming the club's first signing in the 2009 summer transfer window. However, on 27 July 2009, after managerial changes at both clubs, it was confirmed that Allott had signed a two-year deal with Chesterfield under former Oldham boss John Sheridan, having been released from his contract by Tranmere after only 8 weeks without ever playing a competitive game for the club.

Sabiu, Luis Teodoro, Martin Hendry, arXiv:0803.3212v1 Resolving the universe with multifractals is a fractal/multifractal distribution of points produced via an iterative and multiplicative random process. 800px Model I (left plot): : \\\\lbrace p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4 \\\\rbrace = \\\\lbrace 1,1,1,0 \\\\rbrace Model II (middle plot): : \\\\lbrace p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4 \\\\rbrace = \\\\lbrace 1,0.75,0.75,0.5 \\\\rbrace Model III (right plot): : \\\\lbrace p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4 \\\\rbrace = \\\\lbrace 1,0.5,0.5,0.25 \\\\rbrace The plots above are examples of multiplicative cascade multifractals. To create these distributions there are a few steps to take. Firstly, we must create a lattice of cells which will be our underlying probability density field. Secondly, an iterative process is followed to create multiple levels of the lattice: at each iteration the cells are split into four equal parts (cells). Each new cell is then assigned a probability randomly from the set \\\\lbrace p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4 \\\\rbrace without replacement, where p_i \\\\in [0,1]. This process is continued to the Nth level. For example, in constructing such a model down to level 8 we produce a 48 array of cells. Thirdly, the cells are filled as follows: We take the probability of a cell being occupied as the product of the cell's own pi and those of all its parents (up to level 1). A Monte Carlo rejection scheme is used repeatedly until the desired cell population is obtained, as follows: x and y cell coordinates are chosen randomly, and a random number between 0 and 1 is assigned; the (x, y) cell is then populated depending on whether the assigned number is lesser than (outcome: not populated) or greater or equal to (outcome: populated) the cell's occupation probability. To produce the plots above we filled the probability density field with 5,000 points in a space of 256 √ó 256\\\\.

According to his biographer, Chisholm \\"was the first composer to absorb Celtic idioms into his music in form as well as content, his achievement paralleling that of Bart√≥k in its depth of understanding and its daring\\", which led some to give him the nickname \\"MacBart√≥k\\". As composer, performer and impresario, he played an important role in the musical life of Glasgow between the two World Wars and was a founder of the Celtic Ballet and, together with Margaret Morris, created the first full-length Scottish ballet, The Forsaken Mermaid. After World War II he was Professor and Head of the South African College of Music at the University of Cape Town for 19 years until his death. Chisholm founded the South African College of Music opera company in Cape Town and was a vital force in bringing new operas to Scotland, England and South Africa. By the time of his death in 1965, he had composed over a hundred works.  Early life and education  Erik Chisholm was the son of John Chisholm, master house painter, and his wife, Elizabeth McGeachy Macleod. He left Queen's Park School, Glasgow, at the early age of 13 due to ill-health but showed a talent for music composition and some of his pieces were published during his childhood. He had piano lessons with Philip Halstead at Glasgow's Athenaeum School of Music, now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and later studied the organ under Herbert Walton, the organist at Glasgow Cathedral. By the time he was 12 he was giving organ recitals including an important one in Kingston upon Hull. The pianist Leff Pouishnoff then became his principal teacher and mentor. In 1927 he travelled to Nova Scotia, Canada, where he was appointed the organist and choirmaster at the Westminster Presbyterian Church, New Glasgow, and director of music at Pictou Academy. A year later he returned to Scotland and from 1928-1933 he was organist at St Matthew's Church, Bath Street, Glasgow, later renamed Renfield St Stephen's and now St Andrew's West. In 1933 he was appointed organist at Glasgow's Barony Church; however, as he had no School Leaving Certificate, he could not study at a university. Due to the influence of his future wife, Diana Brodie, he approached several influential music friends for letters of support for an exemption to enter university. In 1928, he was accepted to study music at the University of Edinburgh, under his friend and mentor, the renowned musicologist Sir Donald Tovey. Chisholm graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1931 and as Doctor of Music in 1934. While at university, he had formed the Scottish Ballet Society in 1928 and the Active Society for the Propagation of Contemporary Music in 1929 with fellow composer Francis George Scott and Chisholm's friend Pat Shannon. From 1930 to 1934 Chisholm also worked as a music critic for the Glasgow Weekly Herald and the Scottish Daily Express.  Scottish career and World War II  After his education, Chisholm's work was described as \\"daring and original\\", according to Sir Hugh Roberton, while also displaying a strong Scottish character in works such as his Piano Concerto No. 1, subtitled Piobaireachd (1930), the Straloch Suite (1933) and the Sonata An Riobhan Dearg (1939). In 1933 he was the soloist at the premi√®re of his Dance Suite for Orchestra and Piano with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra at an International Society for Contemporary Music festival in Amsterdam. He also played the Scottish premieres of Bart√≥k's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3. From 1930 he was the musical director of the Glasgow Grand Opera Society which performed in the city's Theatre Royal, conducting the British premi√®res of Mozart's Idomeneo in 1934 and Berlioz's Les Troyens and B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict in 1935 and 1936, respectively. He was also the founding conductor of both the Barony Opera Society, the Scottish Ballet Society, the Professional Organists' Association, and in 1938 he was appointed music director of the Celtic Ballet. As director he composed four works in collaboration with Margaret Morris, the most famous being The Forsaken Mermaid; the first full-length Scottish ballet. Chisholm had many friends in the music world, including composers like B√©la Bart√≥k, Bax, Alan Bush, Delius, Hindemith, Ireland, Medtner, Sorabji, Szymanowski and Walton, and invited many of them to Glasgow to perform their works under the auspices of the Active Society. At the outbreak of World War II, Chisholm, a conscientious objector, was declared unfit for military service on the basis of poor eyesight and a crooked arm. During the war he conducted performances with the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1940, and later joined the Entertainments National Service Association as a colonel touring Italy with the Anglo-Polish Ballet in 1943 and served as musical director to the South East Asia Command between 1943 and 1945. He first formed a multi-racial orchestra in India, but after arguments with his superior, Col. Jack Hawkins, he was removed to Singapore. Here in 1945 he founded the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. Many of the musicians were ex-prisoners of War, and from them Chisholm recruited Szymon Goldberg as leader. Goldberg had successfully hidden his Stradivarius violin up a chimney in the prison camp for three and a half years. Chisholm created a truly cosmopolitan orchestra of fifteen nationalities from East and West, which gave 50 concerts in Malaya within six months. After returning to Scotland, Chisholm married his second wife, Lillias, the daughter of Scottish composer Francis George Scott. In 1946 he was appointed professor of music at the University of Cape Town and director of the South African College of Music.  South African career  Strubenholm, the home of the SA College of Music. Chisholm's obituary in The Edinburgh Tatler recalled that \\"the three highlights of his life were in hearing at age seven Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata played by Frederic Lamond on a piano roll; becoming acquainted with the music of India and lastly being offered the chair of music at Cape Town University in 1947.\\" That year, Chisholm revived the South African College of Music where he eventually would teach composer Stefans Grov√© and singer D√©sir√©e Talbot. Using Edinburgh University as his model, Chisholm appointed new staff, extended the number of courses, and introduced new degrees and diplomas. In order to encourage budding South African musicians he founded the South African National Music Press in 1948. With the assistance of the Italian baritone Gregorio Fiasconaro, Chisholm also established the college's opera company in 1951 and opera school in 1954. In addition, Chisholm founded the South African section of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) in 1948, assisted in the founding of the Maynardville Open-Air Theatre on 1 December 1950, and pursued an international conducting career.Maynardville - History The South African College of Music's opera company became a national success and toured Zambia and the United Kingdom. In the winter of 1956, Chisholm's ambitious festival of South African Music and Musicians achieved popular success in London with a programme of Wigmore Hall concerts and the London premi√®re at the Rudolf Steiner Theatre of Bart√≥k's opera Bluebeard's Castle. The company also performed Menotti's The Consul as well as Chisholm's own opera The Inland Woman, based on a drama by Irish author Mary Lavin. In 1952 Szymon Goldberg premi√®red his violin concerto at the Van Riebeeck Music Festival in Cape Town. His opera trilogy Murder in Three Keys enjoyed a six-week season in New York City in 1954, and two years later he was invited to Moscow to conduct the Moscow State Orchestra in his second piano concerto The Hindustani. In 1961, his company premi√®red South African composer John Joubert's first opera, Silas Marner. Chisholm did not support the South African policy of apartheid and had socialist leanings. Chisholm convinced Ronald Stevenson, a fellow Scot, to perform at the University of Cape Town. During a performance of Stevenson's Passacaglia, the programme made references to Lenin's slogan of peace, bread and land and also in salute of the \\"emergent Africa\\". The following day, South African police searched Chisholm's study in a failed attempt to link him with working for the USSR.Gasser, M., \\"Ronald Stevenson, Composer-Pianist : An Exegetical Critique from a Pianistic Perspective\\" (Edith Cowan University Press, Western Australia, 2013)  Later years and legacy  Composing at his Petrof piano with Towser, his concert-going Spaniel, at his feet. Sir Arnold Bax called Erik Chisholm \\"the most progressive composer that Scotland has ever produced.\\" After 19 years at the South African College of Music, Dr. Chisholm composed an additional twelve operas drawing inspiration from \\"sources as varied as Hindustan, the Outer Hebrides, the neo-classical and baroque, pibroch, astrology and literature\\". Chisholm died of a heart attack at age 61 and left all his music to the University of Cape Town. Although he composed over 100 works, only 17 were published in his lifetime, of which 14 were issued in printed score. After his death performances of his music, especially in Britain, fell into neglect but admirers have continued to press for his music to be heard more regularly. His style was called varied, eclectic, and challenging, and his modernism was sometimes considered difficult for audiences. However, in recent years through the efforts of the Erik Chisholm Trust, founded by Chisholm's daughter Morag, there has been a revival of interest in his music and several works, including orchestral, piano and vocal pieces, have been revived and recorded. Also, many of his unpublished works, formerly in manuscript, have been typeset and are available through the Erik Chisholm Trust. He had a lifelong interest in Scottish music and published a collection of Celtic folk-songs in 1964. He was also interested in Czech music, and completed his book The Operas of Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek shortly before his death. His services to Czech music were formally recognized in 1956, when he became one of the few non-Czech musicians to be awarded the Dvo≈ô√°k medal. The Manuscripts and Archives Library at the University of Cape Town holds the Chisholm collection of papers and manuscripts; his published scores are in the College of Music library and many copies are in the Scottish Music Centre in Glasgow. In addition, an important collection of manuscripts, letters and other memorabilia left to Chisholm's daughter Morag (including his extensive correspondence with Sorabji) is now housed in the Archive of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow. In his memory, the South African College of Music offers a memorial scholarship in his name and the Scottish International Piano Competition awards an Erik Chisholm Memorial Prize. The biography of Erik Chisholm, written by John Purser with the foreword by Sir Charles Mackerras, Chasing A Restless Muse: Erik Chisholm, Scottish Modernist (1904‚Äì1965), was published on 19 June 2009. An official launch was held at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, part of Birmingham City University on 22 October 2009 which was attended by his widow, his daughter Morag, two of his granddaughters and great-grandsons. His widow, Lillias, married the clarinettist John Forbes. His solo piano music has been released on CD, performed by pianist Murray McLachlan.  Works  Erik Chisholm wrote well over 100 works, including 35 orchestral works, 7 concertante works (including a violin concerto and two piano concertos), 7 works for orchestra and voice or chorus, 54 piano works, 3 organ works, 43 songs, 8 choral part-songs, 7 ballets, and 9 operas including one on Robert Burns. He also made several interesting arrangements by composers such as Handel and Mozart. He arranged a string orchestra version of the Symphony for Solo Piano, Op. 39 Nos. 4‚Äì7 by Charles-Valentin Alkan, a composer still largely unknown at that time, the original of which has been said to surpass even the Transcendental √âtudes of Franz Liszt in scale and difficulty. Pianist Murray McLachlan divided Chisholm's works into four periods: the Early Period, the \\"Scottish\\" Period, the Neoclassical Period and the \\"Hindustani\\" Period. The \\"Early Period\\" is extremely large, beginning with teenage efforts including a Sonatina in G minor, written at 18, and clearly showing something of the influence of John Blackwood McEwen. The \\"Scottish\\" Period began in the early 1930s where his works were tinged with a distinct Scottish colouring influenced by folk music, indicating most persuasively the ambitions of composers like Chisholm's contemporary B√©la Bart√≥k, to create a style based on the music of his ancestors and countrymen. Chisholm's Sonatine Ecossaise, 4 Elegies, Scottish Airs, Piano Concerto no. 1 \\"Piobaireachd\\" and Dance Suite display a percussive bite and energy influenced by Bart√≥k and Prokofiev with much use of dissonances and note clusters along with material derived from Scottish folksong, bagpipe music and dance figurations. The folk elements are so deeply integrated in this style that some have referred to Chisholm as \\"MacBart√≥k\\". Chisholm's Neoclassical Period refers to several of his works which were inspired by ancient and obscure motifs from the pre-Classical era. His Sonatina no. 3, evidently based on several ricercare motifs originally written by Dalza, fuses Brittenesque harmonies and gentle dissonances in quintessentially pianistic textures. The music of his \\"Hindustani\\" period in the late 1940s and early 1950s reflects Chisholm's wartime travels in the East, his interest in the occult and perhaps his friendship with Sorabji. Important examples of this period are his 2nd \\"Hindustani\\" Piano Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the one-act opera Simoon and the Six Nocturnes, Night Song of the Bards. These compositions display luscious textures, transcendental technical demands and intensity that are comparable to works by Szymanowski and Sorabji and to some extent an atonality reminiscent of Alban Berg. Chisholm's complete piano music has been recorded on 7 CDs on the Divine Art label by Murray McLachlan. His two piano concertos and his Dance Suite were recorded by Danny Driver, and the Violin Concerto by Matthew Trusler, all on Hyperion Records. The live premiere (2015) of the full score of his opera Simoon was recorded by Delphian Records, and a video produced by Music Co- operative Scotland was due to be premiered on 8 July 2020.McOpera, Scotland: Simoon  Writings  Chisholm, E.

Biography and works Josef Fessler was born on 2 December 1813, at Lochau near Bregenz in the Vorarlberg. His parents were peasants. He early showed great abilities. His classical studies were done at Feldkirch, his philosophy at Innsbruck including a year of legal studies, and his theology at Brixen. He was ordained priest in 1837. After a year as master in a school at Innsbruck, he studied for two more years in Vienna life, then became professor of ecclesiastical history and canon law in the theological school at Brixen, 1841-52. He published at the quest of the Episcopal Conference of Wurzburg, in 1848, a short book √úber die Provincial-Concilien und Di√∂cesan-Synoden (Innsbruck, 1849), and in 1850-1 the well-known Institutiones Patrologiae quas ad frequentiorem utiliorem et faciliorem SS. Patrum lectionem promovendam concinnavit J. Fessler (Innsbruck, 2 Volumes in octavo). This work superseded the unfinished books of Johann Adam M√∂hler and Franz Michael Permaneder and was not surpassed by the subsequent works of Alzog and Joseph Nirschl. A later edition (Innsbruck, 1890-6) was made by Prof. Jungmann of Louvain. From 1856 to 1861, Fessler was professor of canon law in the University of Vienna, after making special studies for six months at Rome. He was consecrated as assistant bishop to the bishop of Brixen, Dr. Gasser, on 31 March 1862, and became his vicar-general for the Vorarlberg. On 23 September 1864, he was named by the emperor Bishop of St. Polten, not far from Vienna. When at Rome in 1867, he was named assistant at the papal throne. In 1869 Pope Pius IX proposed Bishop Fessler to the Congregation for the direction of the coming Vatican Council as secretary to the council. The appointment was well received, the only objection being from Cardinal Caterini, who thought the choice of an Austrian might make the other nations jealous. Bishop Fessler was informed of his appointment on 27 March, and as the pope wished him to come with all speed to Rome, he arrived there on 8 July, after hastily dispatching the business of his diocese. He had a pro-secretary and two assistants. It was certainly wise to choose a prelate whose vast and intimate acquaintance with the Church Fathers and with ecclesiastical history was equalled only by his thorough knowledge of canon law. He seems to have given universal satisfaction by his work as secretary, but the burden was a heavy one, and in spite of his excellent constitution, his untiring labours were thought to have been the cause of his early death. Before the council he published an opportune work \\"Das letzte und das n√§chste allgemeine Konsil\\" (Freiburg, 1869) and after the council he replied in a masterly brochure to the attack on the council by Dr. Schulte, professor of canon law and German law at Prague. Dr. Schulte's pamphlet on the power of the Roman popes over princes, countries, peoples and individuals, in the light of their acts since the reign of Gregory VII, was very similar in character to the Vaticanism pamphlet of Mr. Gladstone, and rested on just the same fundamental misunderstanding of the dogma of Papal Infallibility as defined by the Vatican Council. The Prussian Government promptly appointed Dr. Schute to a professorship at Bonn, while it imprisoned Catholic priests and bishops. Fessler's reply, \\"Die wahre und die falsche Unfehlbarkeit der P√§pste\\" (Vienna, 1871), was translated into French by Cosquin, editor of \\"Le Fran√ßais\\", and into English by Ambrose St. John (The True and False Infallibility of the Popes, London, 1875). It is an explanation of the doctrine of Infallibility as taught by the Italian \\"Ultramontane\\" theologians, such as Bellarmine in the sixteenth century, Pietro Ballerini in the eighteenth century and Giovanni Perrone in the nineteenth century. But it was difficult for those who had been fighting against the definition to realize that the Infallibilists \\"had wanted no more than this\\". Bishop Hefele of Rottenburg am Neckar, who had strongly opposed the definition and afterwards loyally accepted it, said he entirely agreed with the moderate view taken by Bishop Fessler, but doubted whether such views would be accepted as sound in Rome. It was clear, one would have thought, that the secretary of the council was likely to know; and the hesitations of the pious and learned Hefele were removed by the warm Brief of approbation which Pius IX addressed to the author. He died on 25 April 1872. Sources and references * *Anton Erdinger, Dr. Joseph Fessler, Bischof v.

Location  The medieval castle is situated on a large late Jurassic rock on the edge of the Swabian Alb at an elevation of 743 m (2437 ft) in a strategically advantageous location on the slopes of the mountain range. Hohenneuffen Castle in 1822 Hohenneuffen Castle  History  There is evidence for a pre-historic, Iron Age settlement on Hohenneuffen. It functioned as an outpost for the oppidum at Heidengraben during the late La T√®ne period in the first century BCE. The pre- Germanic name Neuffen is derived from the proto-Celtic adjective ', meaning holy or sacred, implying that the mountain had a religious rather than a military function 2000 years ago. The castle was built between 1100 and 1120 by Mangold von Sulmetingen who later changed his name to include the element von Neuffen.H. Ossenberg: Was bleibt, das schaffen die Baumeister, p. 309 The first documentary evidence dates from 1198. At that time the castle was still in possession of the family von Neuffen, a member of which was the Minnes√§nger Gottfried von Neifen.G. Schweikle, Dichter √ºber Dichter in mittelhochdeutscher Literatur, p. 136 The castle went into the possession of the Lords of Weinsberg at the end of the 13th century who sold it on to the Counts of W√ºrttemberg in 1301. The castle proved its defensive worth in 1312 when, during the Reichskrieg, an internal conflict within the Holy Roman Empire following the election of Henry VII as Holy Roman Emperor, it could not be conquered. The expansion of Hohenneuffen Castle into a fortress began in the 14th century. However, the most important alterations to the castle structure were conducted by Duke Ulrich of W√ºrttemberg in the first half of the 16th century. Barbicans, round towers, bastions, a building for the commanding officer, casemates, stables, an armoury as well as two cisterns were built. Essentially, these fortification did not change for the next two hundred years. While the fortress had to surrender to troops from the Swabian League in 1519, it withstood the insurgent peasants' attempt to take it during the German Peasants' War of 1524/25.Baedecker Allianz Reisef√ºhrer Schw√§bische Alb, 2007, p. 274 The castle was besieged by Imperial forces for more than a year during the Thirty Years' War. In November 1635 the commanding officer Johann Philipp Schnurm and his dispirited troops managed to negotiate a surrender, allowing Schnurm and his men to depart with their weapons and possessions. Yet, in violation of the agreed terms the troops were forced to serve in the Imperial army and Schnurm lost all his possessions.F. Fischer, Der Heidengraben bei Grabenstetten, p. 143ff. Duke Karl Alexander of W√ºrttemberg planned to have Hohenneuffen altered into a fortress following the French model. Yet he died before the task was completed and his successor, Karl Eugen abandoned the plan due to the high costs and the doubtful military benefit. In 1793 it was decided to raze the castle and to sell off the building materials. The castle went out of use in 1795 and was finally destined for destruction in 1801. The inhabitants of the surrounding area were happy to utilise the cheap building materials. Only from 1830 onwards the remains of the castle were safeguarded from further destruction and in the 1860s public access to the ruin was allowed. In 1862 an inn was established in one of the buildings in the upper bailey. Similar to other fortresses Hohenneuffen was used as a holding place for prisoners of the state, where important prisoners were held and, if deemed necessary, tortured. Amongst those were a young Count of Helfenstein who fell to his death in 1502 whilst trying to escape from the castle. In 1512 Duke Ulrich had the abbot of Zwiefalten Abbey, Georg Fischer, imprisoned at the castle. On the orders of Duke Ulrich the reeve of T√ºbingen, Konrad Breuning, was held and tortured here before being beheaded in 1517 in Stuttgart. Matth√§us Enzlin, Geheimrat at the court of Duke Johann Frederick of W√ºrttemberg, attempted several escapes whilst being imprisoned on Hohenneuffen in the early 16th century. In 1737 Joseph S√º√ü Oppenheimer, Court Jew to Duke Karl Alexander was incarcerated on Hohenneuffen for several weeks before being relocated to Hohenasperg, finally to be executed in Stuttgart in 1738.S. Stern, The Court Jew, p. 257 Hohenneuffen Castle, inner courtyard  The Three-States-Conference  During the Allied occupation of Germany following the end of World War II, the military governments of the American and French occupation zones founded three states in their zones in 1946 and 1947: W√ºrttemberg-Baden in the American zone, W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern and Baden in the French occupation zone. When it became known that a constitution was being worked out for West Germany, a number of politician took the initiative to merge the three south-western states. The prime minister of W√ºrttemberg-Baden, Reinhold Maier, invited the governments of the three states to a conference which took place on 2 August 1948 at Hohenneuffen Castle. His idea was to bring the governments closer together in order to prepare for the formation of a new state in the southwest of Germany. The delegation from Baden was headed by Leo Wohleb, an uncompromising advocate of the restoration of the former Baden. W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern was represented by its home secretary, Viktor Renner.E. Kuhn, Das grosse weite Tal der M√∂glichkeiten, p. 161f. Maier had chosen the place for the conference with care. The wide view from the top of the mountain, particularly onto the border of the occupation zones which ran between the district of Reutlingen and the then district of N√ºrtingen, was meant to impress the delegates. Secluded from their respective governmental apparatus and the public, the participants were supposed to be able to engage in discussions without any disturbances. However, no agreement was reached at the end of the conference. Nevertheless, it marked the beginning of the process which led to the formation of the so-called Southwest State in 1952: Baden-W√ºrttemberg.F. Crivellari: Baden am Scheideweg, p. 50  Current use  Today, access to Hohenneuffen Castle is free for the public and some of the casemates are accessible. There is also a restaurant, beer garden and a kiosk. A fell running event (Hohenneuffen-Berglauf) takes place every June. Participants have to cover a distance of 9.3 km and a difference in altitude of 483 metres. Furthermore, the castle is also used for concerts and a medieval-style market.

Description The shrub or tree can grow to a maximum height of around and has a spreading habit. The branchlets have bristly prickling stipules with a length of in length. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen phyllodes grow in bundles that are all crowded together and are whorled that have a linear or lanceolate shape with a length of and a width of . The phyllodes are glabrous, pungent and rigid with one main visible vein. It blooms between July and December producing simple inflorescences on glabrous stalks with a length of . The ovoid the spherical flower-spikes have a length of up to with densely pack light yellow coloured flowers. The compressed an linear seed pods that form after flowering are barely constricted between each of the seeds. The pods are in length and have a width of and have quite thin valves. The elliptic shaped seeds are around in length and have a filamentous funicle that folds and thickens into a turbinate aril. Taxonomy The species was first described by Charles Louis L'H√©ritier de Brutelle in 1806 as part of Carl Ludwig Willdenows work Species Plantarum. It was reclassified as Racosperma verticillatum by Leslie Pedley in 2003 then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006. Four subspecies are known: * Acacia verticillata subsp. verticillata * Acacia verticillata subsp. ruscifolia * Acacia verticillata subsp. cephalantha * Acacia verticillata subsp. ovoidea Distribution A. verticillata is endemic to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The species is a common understorey shrub in both wet and dry sclerophyll forests as well as scrub and heath. In coastal environments it will often have much wider leaves as opposed to the regular needle-like nature of inland specimens. The range of the plant extends from the Gulf St Vincent in South Australia throughout the south-eastern parts and into southern and south eastern Victoria and far south-eastern New South Wales and Tasmania including the islands in Bass Strait where it is situated in saline, riparian and submontane areas. Uses Prickly Moses is sold commercially for cultivation and can grow in full sun or part shape in a variety of locations including plains, hills and footslopes as a second line from the coast. It will grow in clay or loam soils that are alkaline, neutral or acidic and will tolerate drought, water logging and a moderate frost. It is regarded as an excellent habitat for birds but is highly flammable and not recommended for near houses in bushfire prone areas. Indigenous Australians used the fibre from the plant to make fishing lines. In popular culture On 1 September 2016, the Reserve Bank of Australia released a replacement of the polymer five dollar note which includes a depiction of Acacia verticillata (subspecies ovoidea).

The statute of Lady Justice is meant to symbolise fairness and impartiality. English criminal law concerns offences, their prevention and the consequences, in England and Wales. Criminal conduct is considered to be a wrong against the whole of a community, rather than just the private individuals affected. The state, in addition to certain international organisations, has responsibility for crime prevention, for bringing the culprits to justice, and for dealing with convicted offenders. The police, the criminal courts and prisons are all publicly funded services, though the main focus of criminal law concerns the role of the courts, how they apply criminal statutes and common law, and why some forms of behaviour are considered criminal. The fundamentals of a crime are a guilty act (or actus reus) and a guilty mental state (or mens rea). The traditional view is that moral culpability requires that a defendant should have recognised or intended that they were acting wrongly, although in modern regulation a large number of offences relating to road traffic, environmental damage, financial services and corporations, create strict liability that can be proven simply by the guilty act. Defences exist to some crimes. A person who is accused may in certain circumstances plead they are insane and did not understand what they were doing, that they were not in control of their bodies, they were intoxicated, mistaken about what they were doing, acted in self defence, acted under duress or out of necessity, or were provoked. These are issues to be raised at trial, for which there are detailed rules of evidence and procedure to be followed. History England and Wales does not have a Criminal Code, though such an enactment has been often recommended and attempted (see English Criminal Code). Many criminal offences are common law offences rather being specified in legislation. In 1980, a Committee of JUSTICE said that, upon conducting a search, they found over 7,200 offences, and that they thought that there were probably many more. They said that \\"it is now impossible to ascertain the entire content of the criminal law at any given time\\".Breaking the Rules (1980) at page 53 In 1989, the Law Commission said that a hypothetical criminal code that contained all existing criminal offences would be \\"impossibly bulky\\".The Law Commission, Criminal Law:A Criminal Code for England and Wales (Law Com 177), Volume 1, paragraph 3.3 at page 12 In 2001, Peter Glazebrook said the criminal law was \\"voluminous, chaotic and contradictory\\".Glazebrook, P R. How Old Did You Think She Was? [2001] Cambridge Law Journal 26 at 30 In March 2011, there were more than ten thousand offences excluding those created by by-laws.Ormerod, David. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. pp. vii and 3. In 1999, P J Richardson said that as the case for a moratorium on legislation in the field of criminal justice was becoming stronger and stronger, governments seemed ever more determined to bring forward more legislation.Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 1999, preface, page vii *Treason Act 1351 and Hanged, drawn and quartered.

In Latin this is called the actus reus and the mens rea. In many crimes however, there is no necessity of showing a guilty mind, which is why the term \\"strict liability\\" is used. Actus reus An English court room in 1886, with Lord Chief Justice Coleridge presiding Actus reus is Latin for \\"guilty act\\" and is the physical element of committing a crime. It is usually the application or threat of unlawful force, though exceptionally an omission or failure to act can result in liability. Simple examples might be A hitting B with a stick, or X pushing Y down a water well. These are guilty acts and the unlawful application or force. Alternatively, one may have a pre-existing duty to another person and by deliberately not performing it, one commits a crime. For instance, not giving food is an omission rather than an act, but as a parent one has a duty to feed one's children. Pre-existing duties can arise also through contract,R v Pittwood (1902) 19 TLR 37 - a railway worker who omitted to shut the crossing gates, convicted of manslaughter when someone was run over by a train a voluntary undertaking,e.g. the partner in Gibbons who was not a blood parent, but had assumed a duty of care a blood relation with whom one lives,R v Stone and Dobinson [1977] QB 354, where an ill tended sister named Fanny couldn't leave bed, was not cared for at all and literally rotted in her own filth. This is gross negligence manslaughter. and occasionally through one's official position.R v Dytham [1979] QB 722, where a police man on duty just stood and watched three men kick another to death As the 19th century English judge, Lord Coleridge CJ wrote, > ‚ÄúIt would not be correct to say that every moral obligation involves a legal > duty; but every legal duty is founded on a moral obligation.‚ÄùR v Instan > (1893) 1 QB 450, where a bedridden aunt, ostensibly in her niece's care > developed gangrene, a \\"slur on justice\\" were it not punishable. Furthermore, one can become bound by a duty to take reasonable steps to correct a dangerous situation that one creates. In R v MillerR v Miller [1983] 1 All ER 978 a squatter flicked away a still lit cigarette, which landed on a mattress. He failed to take action, and after the building had burned down, he was convicted of arson. He failed to correct the dangerous situation he created, as he was duty bound to do.see also, R v Santana-Bermudez (2003) where a thug with a needle failed to tell a policewoman searching his pockets that he had one In many countries in Europe and North America, Good Samaritan laws also exist, which criminalize failure to help someone in distress (e.g. a drowning child). On the other hand, it was held in the U.K. that switching off the life support of someone in a persistent vegetative state is an omission to act and not criminal. Since discontinuation of power is not a voluntary act, not grossly negligent, and is in the patient's best interests, no crime takes place.Airedale NHS Trust v Bland [1993] 1 All ER 821 If someone's act is to have any consequence legally, it must have in some way caused a victim harm. The legal definition of \\"causation\\" is that \\"but for\\" the defendant's conduct, the victim would not have been harmed.e.g. R v Pagett [1983] Crim LR 393, where 'but for' the defendant using his pregnant girlfriend for a human shield from police fire, she would not have died. Note, Pagget's conduct foreseeably procured the heavy police response. If more than one cause for harm exists (e.g. harm comes at the hands of more than one culprit) the rule states that to be responsible, one's actions must have \\"more than a slight or trifling link\\" to the harm.R v Kimsey [1996] Crim LR 35, where 2 girls were racing their cars dangerously and crashed. One died, but the other was found slightly at fault for her death and convicted. Another important rule of causation is that one must \\"take his victim as he finds him.\\" For instance, if P gives his friend Q a playful slap on the head, but Q suffers from a rare cranial condition and dies, then P can be guilty of manslaughter regardless of how unlucky he is to have bickered with Q. This is known as the thin skull rule.e.g. R v Blaue [1975] where a Jehovah's witness (who refuse blood transfusions on religious grounds) was stabbed and without accepting life saving treatment died. Between the defendant's acts and the victim's harm, the chain of causation must be unbroken. It could be broken by the intervening act (novus actus interveniens) of a third party, the victim's own conduct,e.g. R v Williams [1992] where a hitchhiker who jumped from a car and died, apparently because the driver tried to steal his wallet, was a \\"daft\\" intervening act. cf R v Roberts [1971] Crim LR 27, where a girl jumped from a speeding car to avoid sexual advances and was injured and R v Majoram [2000] Crim LR 372 where thugs kicked in the victims door scared him to jumping from the window. These actions were foreseeable, creating liability for injuries. or another unpredictable event. A mistake in medical treatment usually will not break the chain, unless the mistakes are in themselves \\"so potent in causing death.\\"per Beldam LJ, R v Cheshire [1991] 3 All ER 670; see also, R v Jordan [1956] 40 Cr App R 152, where a stab victim recovering well in hospital was given an antibiotic. The victim was allergic, but he was given it the next day too, and died. The hospital's actions intervened and absolved the defendant. For instance, if emergency medics dropped a stab victim on the way to the hospital and performed the wrong resuscitation, the attacker would not be absolved of the crime.R v Smith [1959] 2 QB 35, the stab was still an \\"operating\\" and \\"substantial\\" cause of death. The interplay between causation and criminal responsibility is notoriously difficult, and many outcomes are criticized for their harshness to the unwitting defendant and sidestepping of hospitals' or the victim's own liability. In R v DearR v Dear [1996] Crim LR 595 a stab victim reopened his wounds while in the hospital and died. But despite this suicidal behavior, the attacker was still held fully responsible for murder. *R v Holland (1841) 2 Mood. & R. 351 break in causal chain *R v Instan (1893) 1 QB 450 duty of care, to not omit to help some dying of gangrene *R v Smith (Thomas Joseph) [1959] QB, negligence of medics does not stop murder *R v Hughes [2013] UKSC 56, driver who was not as fault for a crash could not be responsible for others deaths although he was prosecuted for driving without a licence or insurance Mens rea Mens rea is another Latin phrase, meaning \\"guilty mind\\". It is the mental element of committing a crime and establishes the element of intent. Together with an actus reus, mens rea forms the bedrock of criminal law, although strict liability offenses have encroached on this notion. A guilty mind means intending to do that which harms someone. Intention under criminal law is separate from a person's motive. R v Mohan [1975] 2 All ER 193, intention defined as \\"a decision to bring about... [the actus reus] no matter whether the accused desired that consequence of his act or not.\\" In the special case of murder, the defendant must have appreciated (i.e. consciously recognized) that either death or serious bodily harm would be the result of his actions. In R v Woolin,R v Woolin [1998] 4 All ER 103 a man in a fit of temper threw his three-month-old son onto a wall, causing head injuries from which he died. Although death was certain and the father should have realized, he did not in the least desire that his son be killed or harmed. The English House of Lords sentenced him for manslaughter, but not murder.overturning R v Nedrick [1986] 1 WLR 1025, whose guidelines for the jury were to be certain \\"[1] that death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) as a result of the defendant's actions and [2] that the defendant appreciated that such was the case.\\" Here the defendant poured paraffin through the letter box owned by a woman he didn't like and lit it. A child died in the fire. He was convicted of manslaughter. If a defendant has foresight of death or serious injury the jury may, but is not bound to, find the requisite mens rea.R v Matthews and Alleyne [2003] EWCA Crim 192 A lower threshold of mens rea is satisfied when a defendant recognizes that some act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is recklessness. For instance if C tears a gas meter from a wall to get the money inside, and knows this will let flammable gas escape into a neighbor's house, he could be liable for poisoning.cf R v Cunningham [1957] 2 All ER 863, where the defendant did not realize, and was not liable; also R v G and Another [2003] UKHL 50 This is called \\"subjective recklessness,\\" though in some jurisdictions \\"objective recklessness\\" qualifies as the requisite criminal intent, so that if someone ought to have recognized a risk and nevertheless proceeded, he may be held criminally liable.previously in the U.K. under Metropolitan Police Commissioner v Caldwell [1981] 1 All ER 961 A novel aspect of the law on intention is that if one intends to harm somebody, it matters not who is actually harmed through the defendant's actions. The doctrine of transferred malice means, for instance, that if a man strikes another with his belt, but the belt bounces off and hits a nearby woman, the man is guilty of battery toward her.R v Latimer (1886) 17 QBD 359; though for an entirely different offense, e.g. breaking a window, one cannot transfer malice, see R v Pembliton (1874) LR 2 CCR 119 Malice can also be general, so that terrorists who plant bombs to kill random people are certainly guilty. The final requirement states that both an actus reus and a mens rea coincide. For instance, in R v Church,R v Church [1966] 1 QB 59 For instance, Mr. Church had a fight with a woman which rendered her unconscious. He attempted to revive her, but gave up, believing her to be dead. He threw her, still alive, in a nearby river, where she drowned. The court held that Mr. Church was not guilty of murder (because he did not ever desire to kill her), but was guilty of manslaughter. The \\"chain of events\\", his act of throwing her into the water and his desire to hit her, coincided. In this manner, it does not matter when a guilty mind and act coincide, as long as at some point they do.see also, Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1968] 3 All ER 442, where angry Mr Fagan wouldn't take his car off a policeman's foot *R v Steane [1947] KB 997, defective intent to help the Nazis, by doing radio broadcasts, rather than help family *Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 1 QB 439 *R v Parker [1977] 1 WLR 600 *R v Heard [2007] EWCA Crim 125 *R v Faulkner (1877) 13 Cox CC 550 mens rea for one act does not transfer to others Strict liability Not all crimes have a mens rea requirement, or the threshold of culpability required may be reduced. For example, it might be sufficient to show that a defendant acted negligently, rather than intentionally or recklessly. In offences of absolute liability, other than the prohibited act, it may not be necessary to show anything at all, even if the defendant would not normally be perceived to be at fault. England and Wales has strict liability offences, which criminalize behavior without the need to show a criminal mens rea. Most strict liability offences are created by statute, and often they are the result of ambiguous drafting. They are usually regulatory in nature, where the result of breach could have particularly harmful results. An example is drunk driving. *R v Woodrow (1846) 15 M&W; 404 selling impure food, strict liability, overturning R v Dixon (1814) 3 M. & S. 11 that required mens rea *R v Stephens (1866) LR 1 QB 702 strict liability for dumping refuse into a river, despite the defendant (ostensibly) having no knowledge *Betts v Armstead (1888) LR 20 QBD 771 *Fitzpatrick v Kelly (1873) LR 8 QB 337 food safety *Sweet v Parsley [1970] AC 132 mens rea needed for liability for cannibis being smoked on premises, statutory construction presumes a mens rea *R v Lambert [2001] UKHL 37, cocaine possession claiming no knowledge *Road Traffic Act 1988 s 3ZB Corporate crime Serious torts and fatal injuries occur as a result of actions by company employees, have increasingly been subject to criminal sanctions. All torts committed by employees in the course of employment will attribute liability to their company even if acting wholly outside authority, so long as there is some temporal and close connection to work.e.g. Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2001] UKHL 22; see also R Stevens, 'Vicarious Liability or Vicarious Action' (2007) 123 Law Quarterly Review 30; Middleton v Folwer (1699) 1 Salk 282 and Ackworth v Kempe (1778) 1 Dougl 40 It is also clear that acts by directors become acts of the company, as they are \\"the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation.\\"Lord Haldane Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd [1915] AC 705; see also, Bolton v Graham & Sons Limited, per Lord Denning, \\"A company may in many ways be likened to a human body. It has a brain and nerve centre which controls what it does. It also has hands which hold the tools and act in accordance with directions from the centre... (the) directors and managers represent the directing mind and will of the company and control what it does. The state of mind of these managers is the state of mind of the company and is treated by the law as such.\\" But despite strict liability in tort, civil remedies are in some instances insufficient to provide a deterrent to a company pursuing business practices that could seriously injure the life, health and environment of other people. Even with additional regulation by government bodies, such as the Health and Safety Executive or the Environment Agency, companies may still have a collective incentive to ignore the rules in the knowledge that the costs and likelihood of enforcement is weaker than potential profits. Criminal sanctions remain problematic, for instance if a company director had no intention to harm anyone, no mens rea, and managers in the corporate hierarchy had systems to prevent employees committing offences.e.g. Tesco Supermarkets v Nattrass [1972] AC 153 One step toward reform is found in the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007. This creates a criminal offence for manslaughter, meaning a penal fine of up to 10 per cent of turnover against companies whose managers conduct business in a grossly negligent fashion, resulting in deaths. Without lifting the veil there remains, however, no personal liability for directors or employees acting in the course of employment, for corporate manslaughter or otherwise.See Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 830 The quality of a company's accountability to a broader public and the conscientiousness of its behaviour must rely also, in great measure, on its governance. *Criminal Finances Act 2017 *Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 Participatory and inchoate offences *Encouraging or assisting crime - Part 2 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 *Soliciting to murder, contrary to section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 *Aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence *Conspiracy, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977 *Conspiracy to defraud *Conspiracy to corrupt public morals *Conspiracy to outrage public decency *Attempt, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 Parts 1 to 3 of Schedule 3 to the Serious Crime Act 2007 list numerous statutory offences of assisting, encouraging, inciting, attempting or conspiring at the commission of various crimes. *R v Shivpuri [1986] UKHL 2, reversing Anderton v Ryan [1985] AC 560 attempting the impossible *R v Anderson [1986] AC 27 *R v Betts and Ridley (1930) 22 Cr App R, accessory to crime need not be present *R v Clarkson (1971) 55 Cr.

of the common law. There are general defences. Insanity, automatism, mistake and self defence operate as defences to any offence. Inadvertence due to intoxication is a defence to all offences requiring proof of basic intent if the intoxication is involuntary, and in cases where the risk would not have been obvious to a reasonable and sober person and/or the defendant, if it is voluntary, and to offences that require proof of a specific intent. Duress and necessity operate as a defence to all crimes except murder, attempted murder and some forms of treason. Marital coercion is a defence to all crimes except treason and murder. *Connolly v DPP [2007] EWHC 237 (Admin) no Human Rights Act 1998 defence for sending graphic pictures of abortions, considered malicious *Director of Public Prosecutions v Camplin [1978] UKHL 2, provocation, now Coroners and Justice Act 2009 loss of control *R v Oye [2013] EWCA Crim 1725 *R v Quayle [2005] EWCA Crim 1415 *R v Martin (Anthony) [2001] EWCA Crim 2245 *R v Coley [2013] EWCA Crim 223 *Re A [2001] 2 WLR 480 *R v Hitchens [2011] EWCA Crim 1626 *R v Howe [1987] AC 417 *R v Ray (Steven)' [2017] EWCA Crim 1391 Partial defences to murder There are two main partial defences that reduce murder to manslaughter. If one succeeds in being declared \\"not guilty by reason of insanity\\" then the result is going to an asylum, a clearly inadequate result for somebody suffering from occasional epileptic fits, and many conditions unrecognized by nineteenth century medicine. The law has therefore been reformed in many ways.e.g. in the U.K. Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991, giving the judge discretion to impose hospitalization, guardianship, supervision and treatment or discharge. One important reform, introduced in England and Wales by statute is the diminished responsibility defence. The requirements are usually more lax, for instance, being \\"an abnormality of mind\\" which \\"substantially impair[s] mental responsibility for his acts and omission in doing or being a party to the killing.\\"The Homicide Act 1957, section 2(1) Loss of control may be pleaded under sections 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Infanticide now operates as a defence to both murder and manslaughter. See the Infanticide Act 1938 as amended by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Insanity William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress, depicting the world's oldest psychiatric hospital, Bethlem Hospital Insanity is a deranged state of mind, and consequently no defence to strict liability crimes, where mens rea not is a requirement. An old case which lays down typical rules on insanity is M'Naghten's caseM'Naghten's case (1843) 10 C & F 200 where a man suffering extreme paranoia believed the Tory party of the United Kingdom, were persecuting him. He wanted to shoot and kill Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, but got Peel's secretary in the back instead. Mr M'Naghten was found to be insane, and instead of prison, put in a mental hospital. The case produced the rules that a person is presumed to be sane and responsible, unless it is shown that (1) he was laboring under such a defect of reason (2) from disease of the mind (3) as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong. These elements must be proven present on the balance of probabilities. \\"Defect of reason\\" means much more than, for instance, absent mindedness making a lady walk from a supermarket without paying for a jar of mincemeat.R v Clarke [1972] 1 All ER 219, caused by diabetes and depression, but the lady pleaded guilty because she did not want to defend herself as insane. Her conviction was later quashed. A \\"disease of the mind\\" includes not just brain diseases, but any impairment \\"permanent or transient and intermittent\\" so long as it is not externally caused (e.g. by drugs) and it has some effect on one's mind.R v Sullivan [1984] AC 156, on epilepsy So epilepsy can count, as can an artery problem causing temporary loss of consciousness (and a man to attack his wife with a hammer).R v Kemp [1957] 1 QB 399 Diabetes may cause temporary \\"insanity\\"R v Hennessy [1989] 2 All ER 9; though see R v Quick [1973] QB 910 and the automatism defence. and even sleep walking has been deemed \\"insane\\".R v Burgess [1991] 2 All ER 769 (on sleepwalking) \\"Not knowing the nature or wrongness of an act\\" is the final threshold which confirms insanity as related to the act in question. In R v WindleR v Windle [1952] 2 QB 826 a man helped his wife commit suicide by giving her a hundred aspirin. He was in fact mentally ill, but as he recognized what he did and that it was wrong by saying to police \\"I suppose they will hang me for this\\", he was found not insane and guilty of murder.Mr Windle was not hanged! Automatism Automatism is a state where the muscles act without any control by the mind, or with a lack of consciousness.Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland [1963] AC 386 A successful automatism defence negatives the actus reus element of a crime. If someone raises this defence, then it is for the prosecution to disprove. Automatismic actions can be a product of insanity, or not. One may suddenly fall ill, into a dream like state as a result of post traumatic stress,R v T [1990] Crim LR 256 or even be \\"attacked by a swarm of bees\\" and go into an automatic spell.see Kay v Butterworth (1945) 61 TLR 452 However to be classed as an \\"automaton\\" means there must have been a total destruction of voluntary control, which does not include a partial loss of consciousness as the result of driving for too long.Attorney-General's Reference (No. 2 of 1992) [1993] 4 All ER 683 Automatism can also be self-induced, particularly by taking medical treatment.R v Bailey [1983] 2 All ER 503, a diabetic who did not eat enough after taking his dose of insulin hit someone with an iron bar. He was still convicted because automatism did not exist on the facts. Self-induced automatism can always be a defence to crimes of specific intent (such as murder, wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent, theft, robbery and burglary). But automatism is no defence to other crimes (i.e. of basic intent, e.g. manslaughter, assault and battery) if the defendant was reckless in becoming automatismic or it happens through alcohol or illegal drugs. Only where the defendant does not know his actions will lead to an automatismic state where he could harm something can self-induced automatism be a defence to these crimes. For example, in R v HardieR v Hardie [1984] 1 WLR 64 Mr Hardie took his girlfriend's Valium, because she had just kicked him out and he was depressed. She encouraged him to take them, to make him feel better. But he got angry and set fire to the wardrobe. It was held that he should not be convicted of arson because he expected the Valium to calm him down, and this was its normal effect. *Hill v Baxter [1958] 1 QB 277, dangerous driving, when automatism possible Intoxication Technically, intoxication is not a defence, but negates the mens rea for specific intent offenses (e.g. it commutes a murder sentence to manslaughter). In other words, a defendant may have been so drunk, or drugged, that he was incapable of forming the criminal intention required.per Lord Birkenhead, DPP v Beard [1920] AC 479 Voluntary intoxication is considered reckless, a state of basic intent,DPP v Majewski 1977 AC 433, where M was drunk and drugged and attacked people in a pub. He had no defence to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. which means one cannot have one's sentence reduced for crimes of basic intent (e.g. manslaughter, assault, etc.). So for instance, in R v Sheehan and Moore two people threw petrol on a homeless person and set fire to him. They were cleared of murder, but were still convicted of manslaughter, since that is a crime of basic intent. Of course, it can well be the case that someone is not drunk enough to support any intoxication defence at all.R v Gallagher [1963] AC 349 On the other hand, if someone becomes involuntarily intoxicated, because his drink is laced or spiked, then the question is whether the normal mens rea was present at the incident's time. So where a blackmailer drugged a man's coffee, invited him to abuse a 15-year-old boy, and photographed it, the man was denied the defence of intoxication because the court simply did not believe that the man did not intend to commit the abuse.R v Kingston [1994] 3 All ER 353 Sometimes intoxicated people make mistakes, as in R v LipmanR v Lipman [1970] 1 QB 152 where the defendant took LSD, thought his girlfriend was a snake and strangled her. Here, intoxication operated as a defence because Mr Lipman was mistaken in his specific intent of killing a snake. But intoxication does not negate the basic intent crime of manslaughter, with his \\"reckless course of conduct\\" in taking drugs. Lastly, while a mistake about a person or the actual action is acceptable, a mistake about how much force to use to defend oneself is not. Using a sledgehammer to fend off an \\"attacker\\" after 20 pints of beer is disproportionate.see R v Hatton [2005] All ER (D) 230 *R v O'Grady [1987] QB 995 voluntary intoxication Mistake *Williams (Gladstone) [1987] 3 All ER 411, mistake of fact depends on reasonableness Self defence In all instances one may only use reasonable, and not excessive, force in self defence. In R v CleggR v Clegg [1995] 1 All ER 334 a soldier in Northern Ireland shouted at a car approaching a checkpoint to halt. When it did not, Mr Clegg fired three shots, killing a woman. She was hit in the back, and Mr Clegg was sentenced for murder because by then the car had passed, the force was excessive and there was no justification for self- defence. Another way of expressing the rule on defensive force is that it must be proportionate to the threat. For instance, as the notorious case of R v MartinR v Martin [2002] shows, shooting a teenager in the back with a shotgun several times as he tries to escape is not a justified or proportionate exercise of self-defensive force for the Norfolk farmer, even if robbers had trespassed on his property. In that case, Mr Martin was found to have diminished responsibility for his actions, because he was mentally ill. Duress One who is \\"under duress\\" is forced into something. Duress can be a defence for all crimes, except murder, attempted murder, being an accessory to murdercf DPP for Northern Ireland v Lynch [1975] 1 All ER 913, the old English rule whereby duress was available for a secondary party to murder; see now R v Howe [1987] 1 AC 417, where the defendant helped torture, sexually abuse and strangling. Being threatened into helping was no defence. and treason involving the death of the Sovereign. In R v Howe it was held that to allow the defence of duress as a defence to murder would, in the words of Lord Hailsham, withdraw the protection of the criminal law from the innocent victim and cast the cloak of its protection upon the coward and the poltroon - ordinary people ought to be prepared to give up their lives to the person making the threat in preference to killing an innocent.R v Howe [1987] AC 417, 432 R v Gotts, in a similar fashion, disallowed the defence of duress for someone charged with attempted murder, as the Lords could not see a reason why the defence should be open to an attempted murderer when it was not open to a murderer.R v Gotts [1992] 2 AC 412 In order to prove duress, it must be shown that the defendant was induced by threats of death or serious physical injury to either himself or his family that he reasonably believed would be carried out and that also that \\"a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the accused\\" would have responded in the same way.R v Graham [1982] 1 WLR 294, 296 Examples of someone's characteristics that might be relevant are age, gender, pregnancy, physical disability, mental illness, sexuality, but not IQ.R v Bowen [1997] 1 WLR 372 Using duress as a defence is limited in a number of ways. The accused must not have foregone some safe avenue of escape.R v Gill [1963], where someone told to steal a lorry could have raised the alarm; see also R v Hudson and Taylor [1971] where two teenage girls were scared into perjuring, and not convicted because their age was relevant and police protection not always seen to be safe. The duress must have been an order to do something specific, so that one cannot be threatened with harm to repay money and then choose to rob a bank to repay it, because that choice implies free will.R v Cole [1994] Intoxication is irrelevant to duress, but one cannot also say one is mistaken about duress, when intoxicated. Then a number of cases turn on the choice to join a gang, and inevitably do bad things. The rule is that where one is aware of the gang's nature and puts himself in a position where he could be threatened, duress is not a defence - joining a gang that carries out armed robberies probably precludes any duress defenceR v Sharp [1987] but joining a gang that is not violent at the time of joining may not.R v Shepherd [1987] *R v Hasan [2005] UKHL 22, duress, threat of serious injury Necessity Sketch of the Mignonette by Tom Dudley from R v Dudley and Stephens Whilst a duress defence relates to the situation where a person commits an offense to avoid death or serious injury to himself or another when threatened by a third party, the defence of necessity related to the situation where a person commits an offense to avoid harm which would ensue from circumstances in which he/she or another are placed. Duress operates as an excuse but necessity operates as a justification, rendering the defendant's conduct lawful. Necessity is a defence that argues \\"I desperately needed to do X, because consequence Y would have been really bad.\\" Logically, this is identical to the concept of \\"duress of circumstance\\", where the situation rather than a person is the threat.per Lord Woolf, R v Shayler [2002] 2 All ER 477 The common elements are (1) an act is done to prevent a greater evil (2) the evil must be directed to the defendant or someone for who he is responsible (3) the act must have been a proportionate response. But only necessity is a potential defence for murder. The defence of necessity was first tested in the 19th century English case of R v Dudley and Stephens.R v Dudley and Stephens [1884] 14 QBD 273 DC The Mignotte, sailing from Southampton to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and a cabin boy were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. Lord Coleridge, expressing immense disapproval, ruled, \\"to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it.\\" The men were sentenced to hang, but public opinion, especially among seafarers, was outraged and overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the Crown commuted their sentences to six months. Since then, in the 1970s, in several road traffic cases, although obiter dicta, it has been stated that there is a defence of necessity. In Johnson v Phillips [1975], Justice Wein stated that a police constable would be entitled to direct motorists to disobey road traffic regulations if this was reasonably necessary for the protection of life or property. In a later case, Woods v Richards,Woods v Richards [1977] Justice Eveleigh stated that the defence of necessity depended on the degree of emergency which existed or the alternative danger to be averted. In DPP v HarrisDPP v Harris [1995] a police officer, charged with driving without due care and attention through a red traffic light contrary to s 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, and having collided with another vehicle containing armed robbers whilst pursuing that vehicle, was not allowed to advance the defence of necessity. Again in Chicon v DPP [1994] the defence of necessity was not allowed in a case of a pit bull terrier dog being kept in a public place without a muzzle - the owner had removed the muzzle to allow the dog to drink. But in the case of In re F (Mental Patient Sterilization),In re F (Mental Patient Sterilization) [1990] the defence of necessity was allowed. In the case of R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust,R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust [1998] the defence of necessity (in the case of Tort law) was recognized and applied by the House of Lords to justify the informal detention and treatment of a mentally incompetent person who had become a danger to himself. This approach was subsequently found to be a violation of Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights in HL v United Kingdom. Subsequent to this decision, individuals who lack capacity must be deprived of their liberty in accordance with the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (an amendment to the Mental Capacity Act 2005), not under the common law doctrine of necessity. But more recently, duress of circumstancee.g. R v Cairns [1999] EWCA Crim 468 where a perceived threat of men running at car (when they wanted to help) was held acceptable as duress of circumstance, when one man was run over. and necessity have been recognized and used by courts. In a leading case, Re A (Conjoined Twins),Re A (Conjoined Twins) [2000] 4 All ER 961 conjoined twins were born, one reliant on the other for her heart and lungs. Unless they were separated, both would die, but if separated, the reliant twin would die, the doctors therefore being liable to prosecution for murder. It was, however, held that in this special and incredibly sensitive situation, that the separation was necessary to save the first twin's life.

Under his orders, German infantry killed 164 Greek civilians which was followed in the coming days by the razing of most villages, looting, and the destruction of livestock and harvests.Keefe, Thomas.

He spent his entire 14-year professional career at Sheffield Wednesday. He made one appearance for England in 1964. Playing career Born in Harton in South Shields, Young played schools' football in Jarrow. He was on the books of Newcastle United at the age of 16, but returned to junior football after finding opportunities limited. Upon leaving school, Young played for the Hawthorn Leslie shipyard team in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear. Young signed for Sheffield Wednesday in the early part of 1955 as a centre forward, however his chances of breaking into the side were restricted by the presence of players of the calibre of Redfern Froggatt and Roy Shiner. He made his debut on 2 March 1957 in an away defeat at Blackpool, but did not become a regular in the Wednesday side until December 1962 when Tony Kay was sold to Everton and Young was switched to central defence by manager Vic Buckingham as a replacement. While playing as a forward in the 1961‚Äì62 season he scored a hat trick in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against A.S. Roma. Young was an ever-present in the following 1963‚Äì64 season when Wednesday finished sixth in Division One. His good form earned him an England call up on 18 November 1964, against Wales. He was called up again for the following match against the Netherlands in December 1964 but had to pull out after rupturing a thigh muscle; he missed most of the rest of that season and never got the chance to play for England again. Young was part of the Sheffield Wednesday side which reached the FA Cup final in 1966 playing in all six matches. Young's part in that final will always be remembered for the mistake he made to allow Derek Temple to score the winning goal in a 3‚Äì2 victory for Everton. Young failed to control a long downfield punt, Temple dispossessed him and ran on to beat Wednesday goalkeeper Ron Springett. Gerry Young stayed with Wednesday until he retired at the end of the 1970‚Äì71 season he played 310 league games (345 including cup games) scoring 20 goals. He formed a central defensive partnership with Vic Mobley during the period from 1964 to 1969, his final game was on 2 January 1971 in a 1‚Äì4 FA Cup 3rd round defeat at Tottenham Hotspur. After playing Young joined the Sheffield Wednesday staff on retiring from playing in 1971, initially as coach of the second team, and later as chief coach. He remained in that position until October 1975 when he was sacked along with manager Steve Burtenshaw after Wednesday dropped down to the Third Division. Gerry Young then went into business with former Wednesday player John Quinn opening a sports and trophy shop on Middlewood Road which stayed in business for many years. He later joined the staff at Barnsley. He died on 2nd September 2020 at the age of 83.

The village lies within the Isle of Axholme, and south-east from Crowle. There is a gas offtake from the National Transmission System at Beltoft, which is run by Scottish Power. It is connected by a pipeline to a gas compression station on Hatfield Moor, which pumps gas into a depleted natural gas field located below the moor. When more gas is required, the gas is extracted again, and re-enters the National Transmission System at Beltoft. The only public building in the village is the Methodist Chapel. In the 18th century, the Quakers were quite active in the area, and they had their own burial ground in the village. This site was reused by the Methodists, who built the first chapel there in 1833. That building was demolished and a new chapel built in 1904, and the premises were extended in 1923, when a Sunday School was added. The building sits in a wide plot, with a grassed area to the east of it, which was the former burial ground. Beltoft was one of the first villages to benefit from the third phase of the Northern Lincs Broadband initiative, a programme designed to ensure that rural communities were not left out in the provision of super-fast and ultra-fast broadband services. The multi-million pound programme uses Fibre-to-the-Premises (FTTP) technology, which involves running fibre-optic cables from the telephone exchange into the business premises or homes of customers. Many other parts of North Lincolnshire will have a Fibre-to-the-Cabinet (FTTC) service, which provides super-fast broadband, but not the ultra-fast service available in Beltoft. The scheme is funded by North Lincolnshire Council, and benefitted from ¬£2.9 million saved by efficiencies during the first phase of the programme.

It was the second neighbourhood to have construction commenced by the New Town corporation, after the nearby Adeyfield. History The area was mostly farmland up until the construction of the new town. The name first appears as a farmstead owned by \\"Roger de Beneyet\\" around 1269. Old maps show Bennetts End Farm and Bennets End House as the only nineteenth century buildings. A local industry, dating back to medieval times, was tile and brick making which used the local brickearth clay. This is particularly suitable for making bricks at the low temperatures achievable in wood fired kilns. Local street names \\" Tile Kiln Lane \\" and \\"Kiln Ground\\" remember this activity. The area has many dells, hollows in the ground dug out by the brickmakers or by farmers seeking the deeper chalk to spread on their land and make them more fertile.Yaxley, Part 1 Chapter 1 The Rural landscape.

Since 1924, a border guard detachment has been stationed there.

On the plaque written in Russian letters \\"Russia\\" (Coordinates:) Until the mid-1930s, Razyezd 86 / Otpor had little significance as a station, as all border formalities were done at Matsiyevskaya station (deeper into Russia) and at Manzhouli Railway Station, on the Chinese side of the border. The station was expanded in the mid-1930s, as the railway on the Chinese side had been sold by the USSR to Manchukuo and converted from the gauge of the Russian Railways to the China Railway; Otpor thus became the last Russian-gauge station. The station became quite important in 1945, as one of the bases of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, which also saw the rail line on the Chinese side temporary re-converted to Russian gauge. The station's importance continued as the main rail connection between the USSR and the Communist China. On China's request, in 1958 the Soviets changed the name \\"Otpor\\" to the neutral Zabaykalsk (i.e., \\"a city in Transbaikalia\\", or \\"a city beyond Lake Baikal\\"). Otpor Incident The incident which later became known as the Otpor Incident occurred in 1938, when the many Jews who fled the Nazi Germany were stranded in Otpor (Zabaykalsk), asking entry into Manchukuo. By Hideki Tojo's order, Major General Kiichiro Higuchi of the Harbin branch of Kwantung Army, assisted by Norihiro Yasue and supported by Yosuke Matsuoka in Japan, let the Jewish refugees enter Manchukuo and further move to Shanghai or Japan, in spite of Japan's alliance with Germany at that time.Report Reveals Japanese General Personally Saved 20,000 Jewish Refugees in 1938 Transportation Zabaykalsk, where travelers wait for the switch in railway gauge from Russian to Chinese. Note two railway gauges. The Russo-Chinese highway AH6 passes through the town. Zabaykalsk/Manzhouli is one of the three direct connections between Russian and Chinese Railways. The other two are in Primorsky Krai, much farther to the east; besides, much traffic between Russia and China travels on the rail line crossing Mongolia. It is served by what is now officially called the Southern Branch of the Transbaykal Railway (–Æ–∂–Ω—ã–π —Ö–æ–¥ –ó–∞–±–∞–π–∫–∞–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–π –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–π –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∏): a line that branches off the present-day main Trans-Siberian Railway line at Karymskaya junction (east of Chita), and continues southeast toward the Chinese border. Originally (until 1916), this line was part of the main Moscow-to-Vladivostok rail route, where trains coming from the west would continue into China on the former Chinese Eastern Railway, in order to cut across Manchuria on their way to Russian Vladivostok. After the modern route of the Trans-Siberian Railway, located entirely within Russian national territory, was completed in 1916, the Southern Branch's role was restricted to that of servicing Russia's border communities, and providing connectivity to China. Zabaykalsk has been a transshipment station for a break of gauge since the 1930s, when the railway on the Chinese side had been sold by the USSR to Manchukuo and converted from the gauge of the Soviet Railways to the Manchukuo National Railway. Since 2005, a number of projects have been carried out to increase the capacity of the \\"Southern Branch\\", and its connection to China. The goal was to enable the railway by 2010 to handle 30 trains in each direction, each one up to 71 cars long. By 2005, the maximum weight of the trains using the line had already been increased from 4,000 to 6,300 tons. –ó–∞–±–∞–π–∫–∞–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–∞—è –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∞  –ò–Ω–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç \\"–Æ–∂–Ω—ã–π —Ö–æ–¥\\"  –û–±—â–∏–µ —Å–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è (Transbaikal Railway: The Southern Branch investment project: General information) In 2008, TransContainer's container transshipment facility was expanded.Railway Gazette International November 2008, p845 Work on modernizing the facility for passenger railcar bogie exchange was conducted as well.

In 2007 Grill was expelled from the Australian Labor Party over a donation he facilitated on behalf of a client to the WA Nationals during the 2004/05 financial year. Later in 2007, he was forced to publicly apologise to the Legislative Assembly for leaking a draft parliamentary committee report to Precious Metals Australia in 2006 after receiving it from longtime friend and former Labor minister John Bowler.Weber, David. Grill apologises to WA Parliament. ABC News, 2007-08-14. The following year, he was ordered to apologise in writing to the Western Australian Legislative Council for giving Burke documents from an inquiry into the iron ore industry. However, he refused to do so, putting him at risk of being jailed for contempt of parliament, though the Upper House ultimately opted against jailing him. Grill was investigated by the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia and was charged. He was subsequently found not guilty of all charges. In 2014 Grill was involved in business providing specialist expertise in negotiation, business acquisitions, property development and general management.

The band is known for their short, punchy tunes with pop riffs and a lo-fi sound, influenced by bands like Huggy Bear and Beat Happening. The Cribs have released five albums on the Wichita label, the first two being The Cribs (produced by Ed Deegan and Bobby Conn), and The New Fellas (produced by Edwyn Collins, singer in influential indie band Orange Juice).

The Cribs' fifth album, \\"In the Belly of the Brazen Bull\\" was released on 7 May 2012. Ross is known by friends for his dry sense of humour and as a very down to earth person. When asked about being designated the band's drummer, Jarman said; \\"As far as me being on the drums, I‚Äôm sure it's purely to do just with the fact that I‚Äôm the youngest so I get the worst instrument. You know, like the oldest kid gets the biggest room; the youngest gets the smallest bedroom. The youngest gets the drum kit while the oldest gets a guitar and sing at the front.

He served as Member of Parliament for Winchester from 1689 to 1710, for Lymington from 1710 to 1715 and for Winchester from 1715 until his death in 1729. His 2nd marriage was to Anne Egerton daughter of Major General Randolph Egerton who lived in Betley, thereby presumably his connection to Betley village. In 1797 an order recorded 'housing of the impotent poor on the Common' In those days 'Impotent' meant those who were unable to sustain themselves, i.e. the old, weak & unemployed. These developed into small farms, originally predominantly arable land but with the advent of the enclosure act these soon became traditional livestock holdings. Today the Common is accessed by an unadopted road and has many pleasant footpaths and green lanes. The West Coast Main Line railway runs between London and Glasgow to the west of the Common. Betley Mere is a nearby Site of Special Scientific Interest, managed by Natural England it is the habitat of several rare and important fauna & flora.

Victoria County History of Hampshire: Fordingbridge In the 13th and 14th centuries the manor was in the hands of the Fitz Aucher family, and in the 15th century it was held by the Romsey family. The manor descended to the Bartholomews, but a dispute arose in the 16th century when Thomas Bartholomew and his wife Anne complained that Arthur Bulkeley and others had entered their manor-house of Bickton, broken down their hedges and gates, driven away their cattle and taken away \\"a greate bell hanging in the roffe of the said manor- howse wyche of a veri long tyme hadd hanged there and used as a warnyng bell when any daunger of enemyes fyer or theves were abought the seid howse.\\" In 1632 the manor was sold to John Davenant who was at that time the bishop of Salisbury, and the manor stayed with the Davenants throughout the 17th century. It was purchased by Sir Eyre Coote in 1766, being joined to the West Park estate in Rockbourne. A mill has existed at Bickton since the time of the Domesday Book. In the 19th century the mill employed about 25 people.

The short River Unk passes through the hamlet. In previous centuries it was a township in the Clun division of the hundred of Clun. The Bicton Burial Circle is a prehistoric stone circle, located south of the settlement between the River Unk and River Clun. Two barrows are seen as circular crop marks. The cremation at the burial site is suspected to belong to the Beaker period. The hamlet has been in existence for centuries. Although not listed in the 1086 Domesday Book, it is mentioned in county court papers dating from 1221, in which the county ruled that John Fitzalan I, Lord of Clun, was right to claim that Bicton belonged to his fiefdom. Little remains of Bicton Castle, also known as Bicton Motte, a motte and bailey dating from the 11th or 12th century. The motte's height is 2.2 metres today, as parts have been dug away during gravel extraction. Originally it was circular, with a diameter of 30 metres. The small bailey measured 14 by 25 metres. The castle is classified as E3: \\"feeble or damaged earthworks\\". Its location on the River Unk, like its counterpart in Newcastle on the River Clun, suggest it served as a forward defence of Clun Castle against the Welsh, rather than as an instrument of exploitation. When after the Norman Conquest Picot de Say was Lord of Clun, other nearby minor castles such as Hopton and Acton provided him with military service, so it is assumed that the same applied to Bicton Castle. Records show that agricultural work took place at Bicton at least in the 14th century. Its fields were among the most fertile in the Clun Valley. They were occupied by Welsh bondsmen, unfree tenants farming open fields. It was the location of a demesne sheep stint for 300 animals owned by the Fitzalans in the early 14th century. In 1354 a worker was paid four bushels of rye for spreading dung for seven weeks; and there is a later account of the same activity in 1372. In 1355 sixty Welshmen provided mowing services to the manor at Bicton. In 1373 240 sheared sheep were sent from nearby Clunton and Kempton to the reeve of Bicton. Swapping flocks of sheep between the locations of Bicton, Newton, Kempton, and Clunton was a recurring event throughout the second half of the 14th century. Bicton Farm has been farmed by the same family for centuries. The farm has one of the four water mills on the River Unk. Records from 1919 show activities of agroforestry. A 14th century court known as \\"hallmoot of the Welsh\\" is presumed to have met at times at Bicton. The unfree tenants of the Lord of Clun's demesne were tried here.

The four ships were built for the Royal Banana Monopoly Business (Regia Azienda Monopolio Banane). These ships were originally built to be \\"banana boats\\", built for transporting refrigerated bananas to Europe from Somaliland and Eritrea in Italian East Africa. However, in the event of war, the design of Ramb III allowed it to be refitted for commerce raiding. She was 3,667 tons displacement, oil powered and capable of 18¬Ω knots. Convoy escort Ramb III never made it to East Africa. When Italy declared war on 10 June 1940, she was the only ship in the class in homeport. After being requisitioned by the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), Ramb III served as a convoy escort. Like Ramb I and Ramb II, Ramb III was refitted and armed with two 4.7 inch (120 mm) guns and eight 13.2 mm anti- aircraft guns. On 12 November 1940, during the raid on the Italian port of Taranto, the British Royal Navy detached a cruiser division with accompanying destroyers for a quick swing through the lower Adriatic Sea. This force found a small convoy of four Italian merchant ships escorted by Ramb III and the torpedo boat Fabrizi. The ships were bound for Brindisi from Vlor√´. Ramb III fired 19 salvos in its own defense and succeeded in breaking away without suffering any damage. The Fabrizi stayed with the merchant ships and fought a close action with the British force. As a result, the Fabrizi was hit immediately and suffered serious damage. The Fabrizi continued to fight back until being disable by the cruisers' fire. After the Fabrizi was neutralized, the British force divided up the targets and sank all four of the Italian merchant vessels. This action took place near the Strait of Otranto. Ramb III capacity for 2,418 ton of either refrigerated or general cargo saw her involved in convoy activity both to the Dodecanese and North Africa during the 1940-41 winter, in her role of armed transport ship. On 10 May 1941 Ramb III was torpedoed by the British submarine in Benghazi harbour. She was salvaged by the Italians and returned to Trieste. Kiebitz On 9 September 1943 Ramb III was seized by German troops at Trieste. Refitted as a minelayer and pressed into the service of the Kriegsmarine, Ramb III was renamed Kiebitz. As a minelayer she laid over 5,000 mines in the Adriatic Sea until she ran into one of her own mines off Ancona. Running astern, she reached Rijeka with no further damage, where Allied aircraft sank her in November 1944. Galeb After the war, Kiebitz was refloated by the Yugoslav Navy. She was converted at Pula into a training ship in 1952 and renamed Galeb (\\"seagull\\"). Ultimately the Galeb became the presidential yacht for President Josip Broz Tito. In this service, with her appearance greatly altered from her original incarnation as Ramb III, she served for 40 years. She is in display at the Port of Rijeka as a museum ship.

The 1964 Mount Isa Mines dispute was an Australian eight-month industrial dispute between miners and management at Mount Isa Mines (MIM) in Mount Isa, Queensland. Background A previous 1961 strike at MIM was precipitated by legislation that threatened employees' contract bonuses. It ended with an uneasy truce when State Premier Frank Nicklin proclaimed a state of emergency, ordering unions back to work, and MIM back to the negotiating table. The dispute erupted again in August 1964, when the State Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Commission rejected a proposal for a weekly pay rise of ¬£4 in lieu of an increase to the bonuses. The miners, prominently led by Pat Mackie, began to work to wage, a go slow tactic that led to reduced mine output. Dissension arose in union ranks over the direction the industrial dispute should take, with AWU leaders refusing to expand the dispute outside Mount Isa. Mackie was accused of communism and expelled from the AWU. Mackie and other militant unionists were also dismissed from MIM. By 10 December, Premier Nicklin issued an order-in-council, demanding MIM employees return to contract work, and increasing police powers to enforce the matter. The order-in-council was quickly amended to allow the dismissal of workers unwilling to comply. MIM immediately fired 230 underground miners and locked out the rest. State of emergency Premier Nicklin declared another state of emergency on 27 January 1965, permitting police to cordon off Mount Isa, enter houses without warrant, and seize strike materials. This order-in-council was met with widespread disapproval, and was withdrawn four days later. The dispute petered out through February and March, as enough miners returned to work to resume production. A large number of workers' demands were eventually met in the MIM Award of June 1965. The story of the dispute inspired a Queensland Music Festival musical production titled Red Cap, which premiered at the Mount Isa Civic Centre on 11 July 2007.

There are at least 220 genera and 2,200 described species in Ptinidae worldwide. The family includes spider beetles and deathwatch beetles. The Ptinidae family species are hard to identify because they are so small, and they have a compact body structure. They also have similar morphologies within the genera and species of the family. There are three main groups in the superfamily Bostrichoidea: Bostrichidae, Anobiidae, and Ptinidae. These have undergone frequent changes in hierarchical classification since their inception. They have been treated as a single family, three independent families, the two families Bostrichidae and Anobiidae, or the two families Bostrichidae and Ptinidae. More recent literature treats these as the two families Bostrichidae and Ptinidae, with Anobiidae a subfamily of Ptinidae (Anobiinae). A recent discovery in Peru is that of five new genuses of wildlife beetles within the Ptinidae family: Byrrhodes, Caenocara, Mirosternus, Petalium, and Cryptorama) Spider beetles are so named because they look like spiders. Some species have long legs, antennae that can seem like an additional pair of legs, and a body shape that may appear superficially like that of a spider. Deathwatch beetles are named because of a clicking noise that two (and possibly more) species tend to make in the walls of houses and other buildings. This clicking noise is designed to communicate with potential mates, but has historically caused fear of impending death during times of plague and sickness. Pests The larvae of a number of Ptinidae species tend to bore into wood, earning them the name \\"woodworm\\" or \\"wood borer\\". Several species are pests, causing damage to wooden furniture, house structures, tobacco, and dried food products. The deathwatch beetles Xestobium rufovillosum, Hemicoelus carinatus, and Hemicoelus gibbicollis are economically significant pests, damaging flooring, joists, and other timber in housing. The \\"furniture beetle\\", Anobium punctatum, is a species that is often found emerging from in-home wood furnishings. The \\"drugstore beetle\\", Stegobium paniceum, is known to infest a variety of stored materials, including bread, flour, cereal, prescription drugs, strychnine powder, packaged foods, and even Egyptian tombs. The \\"Cigarette beetle,\\" Lasioderma serricorne, is a widespread and destructive pest of harvested and manufactured tobacco. Damage and economic losses from L. serricorne infestations were estimated by the USDA to be 0.7% of the total warehoused tobacco commodity in 1971.

Overview The drama anthology stars Coney herself. Aside from her, actresses who alternate to play protagonist/central role for some episodes are Jaclyn Jose and Gina Alajar (two of the most respectable award-winning actresses). In her program's episodes, Coney had been working with major celebrities such as Vic Sotto, Vilma Santos, Helen Vela, Aiza Seguerra, German Moreno, Aga Muhlach and Judy Ann Santos, among others.

She later took over production of the show when she put up CAN Television (\\"CAN\\" was derived from Coney's real name, Constancia Angeline Nubla, under which she was credited as the show's producer). It was then retitled Coney Reyes On Camera (with the last name \\"Mumar\\" dropped after her estrangement with then-husband Larry Mumar).The late 1980s titlecard for Coney Reyes on Camera After the sequestration of RPN on February 11, 1989 (which would later become CNN Philippines), the show, along with Eat Bulaga! and Agila (both produced by TAPE), moved to ABS-CBN. TAPE produced shows would remain on the network until January 22, 1995. Despite the transfer of Eat Bulaga! and other TAPE shows to GMA Network, the show remained on ABS-CBN. Coney began to fully produce the show through the network's production unit, where it remained until its timeslot was temporarily replaced by Sports Unlimited and later, permanently replaced by Ang Munting Paraiso, a weekly drama series also starring herself. The show aired its final episode on December 26, 1998. It was reaired on ZOE TV Channel 11 (now GMA News TV) from 2002 to 2003. Trivia *The show's theme is \\"It's My Turn,\\" performed by Diana Ross. *In its latter years, the show ended with a Biblical quotation of relevance to the episode. *In the show's later years, Coney stopped acting in the show and only did the opening and closing segments. *The show won the \\"Best Drama Anthology\\" award from the Philippine Movie Press Club (PMPC) Star Awards for Television three times. *The show had competition with Lovingly Yours, Helen of GMA Network. However, out of respect and friendship, both Coney Reyes and Helen Vela agreed to air on different time slots. \\"Lovingly Yours Helen\\" occupied the Sunday afternoon timeslot.

It was the first national expedition organized by the Philippines to reach the summit of world's highest mountain. One of the expedition members, Leo Oracion, became the first Filipino to reach the summit of Mount Everest and put the Philippine flag on top of the mountain on 17 May 2006 at 3:30 p.m. Nepal time. His fellow expedition member, Erwin \\"Pastour\\" Emata, became the second Filipino to reach the summit the following day, 18 May 2006. Background Before 2006, only a few Southeast Asian countries have achieved the feat of organizing a national expedition to the summit of Mount Everest. In September 1996, an Indonesian woman, Clara Sumarwati, became the first Southeast Asian to reach the summit. In May 1997, Malaysian climber M. Magendran became the second Southeast Asian and first Malaysian on the summit. The following year, Singapore also made a successful bid to reach the summit. In 2003, during the annual Mountaineering Federation of the Philippines Inc. (MFPI) Congress in Pe√±ablanca, Cagayan, the First Philippine Mount Everest Expedition (FPMEE) was organized by former Transportation Undersecretary Arturo Valdez, then MFPI president Reggie Pablo, and MFPI members Butch Sebastian, Fred Jamili and John Tronco. A former MFPI president from 1974 to 1986, Valdez previously had plans to organize an all-Filipino expedition to Mount Everest as early as 1982, but this never progressed from the planning phase. In a press conference on 23 March 2004, the group announced the establishment of the expedition and opened the application process to local mountaineers, athletes and sports enthusiasts. The original plan was to ascend Mount Everest during the summer climbing season in 2007, with two climbing teams ascending from the Tibetan side (north) and the Nepalese side (south), respectively, which will then meet at the summit before descending. Preparations The group named Valdez as the expedition leader, with Jamili serving as deputy leader and Pablo as spokesperson. They also tapped Dr. Ted Esguerra of the Philippine Coast Guard's Medical Service as expedition doctor, being the only doctor in the country with experience in treating altitude sickness. Tronco was assigned as expedition photographer given his mountaineering and photography experience. Sebastian, along with fitness instructor and adventure racer Florentino \\"Jong\\" Narciso assisted in helping the climbers become physically fit and well-experienced in alpine climbing before the expedition began. Selection process A nationwide selection process commenced to determine who will be part of the expedition, with up to 29 individuals from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao applying to be part of the two teams. The 29 applicants were: Aside from the 29 applicants, IT system analyst Romi Garduce, who has previously hiked up to the summit of Africa's tallest mountain, Mount Kilimanjaro at , was also invited to be part of the expedition. Given his job at a top multinational IT firm, which would make it difficult for him to commit to the preparations, Garduce ultimately declined the national team's invitation to join the expedition. He also stated in his blog that he preferred to climb alone or with a small group. Garduce eventually decided to organize his own expedition in 2005 and received financial support from TV network GMA 7, which had exclusive coverage rights to his climb. Training Mustagh Ata, the second highest mountain in the Pamir Range, which members of the First Philippine Mount Everest Expedition climbed in 2005 in preparation for their Everest ascent. The expedition set a three-year preparation period to allow its members to gain experience and familiarize themselves in high-altitude alpine climbing. They adopted the training program designed by David Lim, leader of the First Singapore Mount Everest Expedition, albeit with some adjustments based on the team's schedule. During the course of the training, the 29 applicants were narrowed down based on mountaineering experience, capability, compatibility and commitment. The group organized several minor climbing expeditions in the Philippines and abroad to prepare the 29 applicants, including treks in the country's 10 highest mountains. Because the highest mountains in the Philippines are below 3,000 m, the team also went to Sabah, Malaysia to climb to the summit of Mount Kinabalu (4,095 m) to gain high-altitude climbing experience. The group also went to Manali, India to train in advanced mountaineering at the Western Himalayan Mountaineering Institute. During the training, they scaled the Baralacha Pass (4,890 m) near Manali and Kyorang Peak (6,300 m) in Ladakh. In April 2005, the 10 remaining applicants ‚Äî A√±onuevo, Ambayec, Aquino, Belarmino, Dayondon, Emata, Honoridez, Oracion, Nayangahan, and Wenceslao ‚Äî went with the team to New Zealand for a 10-day preparatory climb which involved summitting Mount Aylmer (2699 m) and Mount Cook (3,724 m) in the Southern Alps. After New Zealand, the team along with Ambayec, Emata, Oracion, Nayangahan, Dayondon went to China's Xinjiang Region in August 2005 to climb Mustagh Ata (7,509 m), with Oracion and Emata being the first and second Filipinos to summit the mountain. They also broke the Philippine altitude record that Garduce set in January 2005 when he reached the summit of Mount Aconcagua in Argentina. Ambayec suffered a mild stroke during the climb forcing the team to carry him back to base camp in a seven-hour trek. Support To raise funds for training and the expedition, the FPMEE was registered as a company and solicited support from various Filipino companies and brands. The group initially had difficulty securing funding given that only few Filipinos at the time have experience in high-altitude alpine climbing. The group's training program in India was funded through a loan that Sebastian secured from a friend, which the group members had to pay with interest. During the group's preparatory climb in New Zealand, Globe Telecom, one of the Philippines' top telecommunications companies and where Pablo was an executive, sponsored them. During the Mustagh Ata expedition, the team slept at the airport and ate food samples from vendors to save the $100 per diem given to each member. The group also approached GMA Network, one of the Philippines' top television networks, to secure funding in exchange for coverage rights, but the network declined because it could not meet the team's request for airtime. The group then approached rival TV network ABS-CBN who provided funding and sponsorship in return for exclusive coverage rights of the ascent. With ABS-CBN securing the coverage rights, it secured advertising and sponsorship deals from brands such as Philippine Airlines, Fitness First, Coleman Company, FedEx, Kodak, Globe Telecom, Rudy Project, National Sports Grill, PowerUp and Philippine Accident Manager's Insurance. Stratworks Inc. served as the expedition's official public relations agency, while MedCentral became its official medical services provider. Before the expedition, ABS-CBN sent journalist Abner Mercado to follow the team during their training in New Zealand and report on their preparations in the network's primetime newscasts. During the expedition, the network also sent Mercado and fellow ABS-CBN journalist Vince Rodriguez at the Everest Base Camp with a broadcast team to report live via satellite on the climbers' preparations and ascent progress. Expedition The Everest Base Camp on the Nepali side as viewed from Kala Patthar in January 2006. Arrival in Nepal After Garduce announced his solo bid to ascend Mount Everest, the national team decided to accelerate their preparations and move their ascent of Everest to spring of 2006 in a bid to be ahead of Garduce. Instead of the original plan of ascending Mount Everest from both the north and south cols, the team prioritized the ascent of its strongest and most experienced members, Oracion and Emata, via the traditional south col route that pioneer Everest summitters Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay originally took in 1953. In February 2006, Oracion and Emata went to Nepal to begin acclimatization with the rest of the team arriving in Kathmandu on the first week of April. The team contracted Thamserku Trekking as their official trekking agency during the expedition, which provided them with two Sherpa guides Pemba Chhoti and Lakpa Gyalzen as well as several porters. The team flew from Kathmandu to Lukla on 11 April and trekked to Everest Base Camp (EBC) via Namche Bazaar and Lobuche, arriving on 17 April. With Oracion and Emata's ascent as the priority, the rest of the team's climbers, particularly female climbers Belarmino, Dayondon and Wenceslao, along with Pablo and Nayangahan were told to focus on preparing for an all- female Everest climb the following year. Taking advantage of their stay in the Khumbu Region, they scaled Dingboche Peak (5,200 m), Kala Patthar (5,644.5 m) and Island Peak (6,189 m). On 26 April, Oracion and Emata began their acclimatization hikes, crossing the Khumbu Icefall to reach Camp I (6,000 m). The following day, they reached Camp II (6,300 m) below the Lhotse Face and on 28 April, they reached Camp III (7,115 m) on the Lhotse Face. They set up their tents and equipment in each camp before returning to EBC from Camp III on 29 April. Oracion's ascent Oracion together with Sherpa guide Pemba Chhoti left the EBC on 13 May and arrived at Camp IV (7,900 meters) on the morning of 16 May where the pair rested. With the aid of supplemental oxygen, the pair left the camp at 10:00 p.m. amid windy, snowfall conditions but as they got higher the snowfall stopped and the weather became quieter. The pair was bogged down by the traffic ahead of them consisting of the British, Swiss and other expedition teams. Chhoti led the final stretch to summit and assisted Oracion. The pair arrived at the summit on 17 May at 3:30 p.m. ‚Äî 18 hours and 30 minutes after leaving Camp IV. Upon reaching the top, Oraci√≥n radioed to Valdez and said: \\"The Philippine Eagle has landed.\\" His statement is based on Neil Armstrong's message \\"The Eagle has landed\\" when the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, nicknamed the \\"Eagle\\", landed on the moon. Chhoti also took photos of Oracion waving the Philippine flag that he brought with him to the summit as well as showing a crayon drawing of the Philippine flag made by Oracion's five-year-old daughter. The pair stayed at the summit for 30 minutes before descending to Camp IV at 10:00 p.m. of 17 May. Emata's ascent After Oracion and Chhoti arrived from their descent of the summit, Emata and his Sherpa guide Lakpa Gyalzen left Camp IV at 10:20 p.m. of 17 May under windy conditions. Aided by supplement oxygen since leaving Camp III, the pair reached the summit at 5:20 a.m. of 18 May under good weather, making Emata the second Filipino to reach the summit of Mount Everest. They completed the ascent in just seven hours, which was faster than Oracion and Chhoti's ascent. Upon arrival at the summit, Emata radioed Valdez at base camp, saying: \\"Summit to Base Camp. Summit to Base Camp. Ang ginaw-ginaw dito! (It's so cold here!)\\" After staying at the summit for 30 minutes, the pair descended and arrived at Camp IV at 9:45 a.m., rested for three hours, and then went down to Camp II along with Oracion and Chhoti. Oracion and Emata along with their Sherpas arrived at base camp on the afternoon of Friday, 19 May. The expedition returned to Kathmandu on 25 May and left Nepal on the evening of 29 May, arriving in the Philippines the following day, 30 May. Reception Leo Oracion, the first Filipino to reach the summit of Mount Everest, answers questions from media partner ABS-CBN via satellite communication, after his successful summit attempt on 17 May 2006. The ascent was celebrated in the Philippines, appearing in major prime time newscasts and on the front pages of several Filipino newspapers. The expedition members were treated to a hero's welcome upon arrival in Manila. Then Philippine President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo called it \\"a mark of Filipino excellence, perseverance and courage in braving the hard trek of nation-building.\\" The team's spokesperson Reggie Pablo compared it to \\"putting a Filipino on the Moon.\\" On 7 February 2007, Arroyo conferred to Oracion and Emata the highest civilian honor called the Order of Lakandula with the special rank of \\"Champions for Life.\\" Oracion's hometown of Mandaue City, Cebu gave him a hero's welcome upon his return, with the city government drafting a resolution commending him for his feat and awarding him a P25,000 incentive. Likewise, Emata was met with a grand welcome upon his arrival in Davao City and his hometown of Tagum City, Davao del Norte With the success of the First Philippine Mount Everest Expedition, the organizers were able to organize a successful all-female Mount Everest expedition composed primarily of Wenceslao, Dayondon and Belarmino during the spring climbing season in 2007. Controversy As the First Philippine Mount Everest Expedition celebrated their success, a fourth Filipino climber, Dale Abenojar dampened the celebratory mood by claiming to have reached the summit of Mount Everest via the northern route from Tibet. According to a press statement by Abenojar's wife Liza, her husband actually reached the summit at 8 a.m. of 15 May ‚Äî two days before Oraci√≥n and Chhoti, but his attempt was undocumented. After nearly a month, Everest chronicler Elizabeth Hawley listed Abenojar's claim on The Himalayan Database, which records every ascent in the Himalayas region since 1903. However, in her entry, she indicated that Abenojar's claim is disputed or unverified as he only presented his Sherpa and two summit photos as proof. She showed the photos to Canadian-Australian mountaineer Vince Walters, who had just climbed from the northern side but did not summit. Walters said the pattern and colors of the person's down clothes in the photo were the same as those on Abenojar's clothes. However, in her route notes for Abenojar in The Himalayan Database, Hawley also included this statement which she made in response to a correspondence with mountaineer James Ben Mallen: Hawley also noted that Abenojar presented a certificate from the China Tibet Mountaineering Association as proof that he reached the summit of Mount Everest. The certificate was awarded based interviews conducted by the liaison officer with Abenojar, his sherpa and other climbers that summitted through Tibet. The First Philippine Mount Everest Expedition has dismissed Abenojar's CTMA summit certificate as a \\"forgery\\" and his claim a \\"hoax\\", and maintained that Oracion and Emata were the first and second Filipinos to conquer Mount Everest.

There he gained a reputation for his vast Talmudic knowledge and expertise while still in early youth. He studied under the greatest rabbis of his generation, including such legendary figures as the Sfas Emes, Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk and the Ridvaz, as well as learning under and with the Avnei Nezer; Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik; the Rogatchover Gaon; the Chofetz Chaim; and Rabbi Aharon Kotler, all world-renowned rabbinic luminaries. Rabbi Greenspan obtained semicha at the young age of eighteen, indicative of his acceptance into the highest circles of rabbinic scholarship due to his tremendous knowledge and ability. Britain Upon the outbreak of World War I, Rabbi Greenspan fled to Britain via Belgium with his children. His wife Beila returned to Warsaw to look after the family's restaurant business. Initially he was Rosh Yeshiva in Liverpool and later moved to Leeds to take up the position of Rosh Yeshiva there. He finally moved to the East End of London, where he assumed leadership of the Etz Chaim yeshiva. Rabbi Greenspan remained at Etz Chaim for the rest of his life, where he produced many hundreds of learned students and pupils alongside distinguished colleagues such as Rabbis Elya Lopian, Leib Gurwicz and Nosson Ordman. Among his more well-known students were future Chief Rabbi Lord Jakobovits, Dayan Pinchas Toledano, Judge Leonard Gerber and Arnold J. Cohen. Rabbi Greenspan died at the age of eighty-three, and with his death Europe lost one of its primary and most exceptional Torah scholars. A large number of people attended his funeral, where he was eulogised by Chief Rabbi Israel Brodie, Rabbi Leib Gurwicz, Dayan Grosnass of the London Beth Din and Rabbi Eliezer Lopian, rosh yeshiva of Toras Emes in London. Rabbi Greenspan met Rav Kook when he just came to Britain and became his talmid. Writing of Rabbi Greenspan in the Jewish Chronicle, Rabbi Nosson Ordman described his deceased colleague as the \\"humblest and most well-mannered of men\\" despite his \\"scholarship and intellectual\\" abilities. He noted that Rabbi Greenspan's death was \\"a great and irreplaceable loss both to the yeshiva and Anglo-Jewry. He was... one of the outstanding... Talmudists of this generation\\". Rabbi Jakobovits, in deep reverence of Rabbi Greenspan, commented, \\"he may have been the greatest Torah scholar in England\\" and also noted his teacher's great modesty and knowledge of secular disciplines.Shashar, Michael, Lord Jakobovits in Conversation, First Edition, Vallentine Mitchell, 2000, Rabbi Greenspan was survived by his wife, two daughters, son and grandchildren. Although he left many Halachic and Talmudic writings, a large number of his written manuscripts were destroyed in the First World War.

He was at first drawn to the serial technique but from 1966 on he turned to another mode of inspiration. Of Andr√© Jolivet he said: \\"As a professor, he has never tried to influence me, nor push me toward any special kind of style. Our professor- student relationship was of a spiritual order. Yet through his suggestion and what Rivier had said, I came to realize that it was in the oriental way of thinking that I would find my style in music.

It is the smallest city in Fukushima Prefecture, both in terms of population and size.  Geography  Located in the center of Fukushima Prefecture, Motomiya possesses a wide range of geographic features from the hills in the east, to the plains in the west. The average elevation of the city is about 200 meters above sea level. The city is 400 to 500 meters above sea level in some areas. Running through Motomiya, the Abukuma River divides the city in two. On the former Motomiya Town side, bordered by the ≈åu Mountains (including Mount Adatara) in the west, and the Abukuma River in the east, flat plains run north to south extending into the K≈çriyama Basin. The mountains to the north in ≈åtama Village and K≈çriyama serve as the sources for several rivers and streams including the Hyakunichi River (ÁôæÊó•Â∑ù), Adatara River (ÂÆâÈÅîÂ§™ËâØÂ∑ù), Seto River (ÁÄ¨Êà∏Â∑ù), and Gohyaku River (‰∫îÁôæÂ∑ù). The Hyakunichi River and Adatara River share the same source but diverge downstream. The former Shirasawa Village is surrounded by gentle rolling hills. Climate Motomiya has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Cfa) characterized by mild summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Motomiya is 12.1 ¬∞C. The average annual rainfall is 1212 mm with September as the wettest month.

Per Japanese census data,Motomiya population statistics the population of Motomiya peaked around 2000, but has slightly declined since.  History  The area of present-day Motomiya was part of ancient Mutsu Province. The oldest known record refers to the area of Motomiya as \\"Honmoku\\" (Êú¨Áâß). Later in the Nara period, the characters for Honmoku were rewritten as (Êú¨ÁõÆ), also pronounceable as Motome. Motome was then rewritten as (Êú®ÁõÆ). Then in the 11th century, it became the current Motomiya (Êú¨ÂÆÆ). The origins of the name Motomiya, literally meaning \\"Central Shrine,\\" refer to the Adatara Jinja (ÂÆâÈÅîÂ§™ËâØÁ•ûÁ§æ), a Shinto shrine in the city's northern district. As a starting point for roads to Aizu, Miharu, S≈çma, and many other destinations, Motomiya became well known as an inn town. In addition, with the growth of lesser roads to Aizu, Adachi no Umaya (ÂÆâÈÅîÈßÖ), a government-maintained rest stop and messenger station, was established in Motomiya. Currently, the stone marker indicating the start of the Aizu road is preserved at the Motomiya City Historical Folk Museum. Date Masamune (‰ºäÈÅîÊîøÂÆó) used Motomiya as a base during the Battle of Hitotoribashi (‰∫∫ÂèñÊ©ã„ÅÆÊà¶„ÅÑ). Afterwards during the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate, Motomiya was part of the holding of Nihonmatsu Domain. During the Boshin War a number of battles were fought within the city limits. After the Meiji Restoration, the area was organized as part of Adachi District in the Nakad≈çri region of Iwaki Province. The town of Motomiya was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. During the Meiji and Taish≈ç period, the Motomiya Electric Corporation was established and constructed a power plant in present Otama Village's Tamanoi district which provided electricity to the area. From this point many famous industries were born in the area. During the Showa era, Gunze, a Japanese textiles company, opened a factory and began operations in Motomiya. During World War II, Allied bombers attacked Motomiya, because the Gunze factories manufactured cloth used to cover the wings of [ Mitsubishi Zero fighters. After the war, Japan entered a time of rapid economic growth, and industrial parks were zoned and constructed in Motomiya, Arai, Nukazawa, and Shiraiwa districts. Soon after, Asahi Beer was enticed to construct a brewery in the city limits. In the 1980s, mid-size housing developments such as the Northern K≈çriyama New Town and Hikari ga Oka developments were begun as an influx of workers to K≈çriyama and Fukushima created a demand for bedroom communities. The city of Motomiya was established on January 1, 2007, by the merger of the former town of Motomiya absorbing the village of Shirasawa (both from Adachi District).

City districts  * Motomiya, Êú¨ÂÆÆ This is the original Motomiya area, and includes the city hall and government offices Portions of the former agricultural northern area have been converted to industrial and residential use. * Aota, ÈùíÁî∞ This district is a typical farming area. While the eastern half is undergoing rapid development thanks to its proximity to National Route 4, the western half remains largely agricultural. * Arai, Ëçí‰∫ï This district has well-developed retail and industrial areas. Many large shopping centers and factories are located in this area. * Niita, ‰ªÅ‰∫ïÁî∞ This is a geographically narrow district. Because of its shape, homes and businesses line the roads giving it an appearance reminiscent of the Showa era. * Iwane, Â≤©Ê†π The northern part of this district is mountainous, while the southern part is farmland. The origin of the district's name comes from the large instances of peculiarly shaped rocks. Even now, specimens can still be seen. A rise in the district's population can be attributed to the Mizuki ga Oka housing development. * Sekishita, Èñ¢‰∏ã This district is a farming area following the Abukuma River with large belts of worked arable land. * Takagi, È´òÊú® This is the downtown district. Like Niita District, homes and shops line the road as in the Showa era. Constructed above in the hills, Kita Koriyama New Town has contributed to a population increase in this district. * Shiraiwa, ÁôΩÂ≤© This was the nucleus of the former Shirasawa Village, and still contains the Shirasawa gymnasium, Yume Library, Village Sports Grounds, Community Center, Culture Center and many other civic buildings. Nestled in the hills, farmers have taken to growing rice and crops in small fields between the slopes. * Nukazawa, Á≥†Ê≤¢ A quiet farming area on the western part of former Shirasawa Village, the opening of Hikari ga Oka housing development makes this district one of the most populous in the former Shirasawa Village. * Wada, ÂíåÁî∞ This district is a farming area on the northern part of former Shirasawa Village. It is home to the Wanda Spring. * Inazawa, Á®≤Ê≤¢ Having won prizes for demonstrating \\"what a farming village should be,\\" this district is the very paradigm of a Japanese farming community. * Nagaya, Èï∑Â±ã This district is another mountainous farming district with farming practices similar to Shiraiwa. * Matsuzawa, ÊùæÊ≤¢ Government Motomiya has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 20 members. Tamura, together with Adachi District contributes one member to the Fukushima Prefectural Assembly.

However, predating rail links, roads leading to towns all over Fukushima including Aizu City, Soma City, and Miharu City converged here, making Motomiya a hub for transportation. Even though it had only gravel roads, the transportation industry quickly grew, and with it, the bus and taxi services as well. Since these times, much of the traffic has been diverted to nearby Koriyama and Nihonmatsu. But even now, roads to Aizu from National Route 4 (Prefectural Route 8, Motomiya-Atami line), and roads to the Tosaki(Êà∏Â¥é) traffic circle such as Prefectural Route 118 from Obama (Â∞èÊµú) (Nihonmatsu) and Route 146 from Ishimushiro(Áü≥Á≠µ) (K≈çriyama) converge in Motomiya, still making it an important hub for transportation and large numbers of freight trucks still pass through.

Adenylylation,Garrett, R.H., and C.M. Grisham. Biochemistry. 3rd ed. Belmont, CA: Thomas, 2007. 815-20 more commonly known as AMPylation, is a process in which an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) molecule is covalently attached to the amino acid side chain of a protein.Itzen, Aymelt, Wulf Blankenfeldt, and Roger S. Goody. \\"Adenylylation: renaissance of a forgotten post-translational modification.\\" Trends in Biochemical Sciences 36.4 (2011): 221-228. Print.

Print. Adenylylation involves a phosphodiester bond between a hydroxyl group of the molecule undergoing adenylylation, and the phosphate group of the adenosine monophosphate nucleotide (i.e. adenylic acid). Enzymes that are capable of catalyzing this process are called AMPylators. The known amino acids to be targeted in the protein are tyrosine and threonine, and sometimes serine.Casey, A. K., & Orth, K. (2018, February 14). Enzymes Involved in AMPylation and deAMPylation. Chemical Reviews. American Chemical Society. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00145 When charges on a protein undergo a change, it affects the characteristics of the protein, normally by altering its shape via interactions of the amino acids which make up the protein. AMPylation can have various effects on the protein. These are properties of the protein like, stability, enzymatic activity, co-factor binding, and many other functional capabilities of a protein. The most commonly identified protein to receive AMPylation are GTPases, and glutamine synthetase. AMPylator having attached the ATP, now an AMP to the targeted protein, completing AMPylation.  AMPylators  Enzymes responsible for AMPylation, called AMPylators, fall into two different families, all depending on their structural properties and mechanism used. These two families are the DNA-Œ≤- polymerase-like and the Fic family.Hedberg, C., & Itzen, A. (2015). Molecular perspectives on protein adenylylation. ACS Chemical Biology, 10(1), 12‚Äì21. https://doi.org/10.1021/cb500854e DNA-Œ≤-polymerase-like, is a family of Nucleotidyltransferase. It more specifically is known as the GlnE family. There is a specific motif that is used to clarify this particular family. The motif consists of a three stranded Œ≤-sheet which is part of magnesium ion coordination and phosphate binding. Aspartate is essential for the activity to occur in this family. The Fic family, which is a filamentation induced by cyclic AMP domain, is known to perform AMPylation. This family of proteins are found in all domains of life on earth. It is mediated via a mechanism of ATP- binding-site alpha helix motif. Infectious bacteria use this domain to interrupt phagocytosis and cause cell death. Fic domains are evolutionarily conserved domains in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that belong to the Fido domain superfamily. These enzymes have been shown to be comparable to kinases due to their ATP hydrolysis activity and reversible transfer of the metabolite to a hydroxyl side chain of the protein substrate.  De-AMPylation  GS-ATasE (GlnE) is an AMPylator that has been shown to catalyze de-AMPylation of glutamine synthetase by removing the covalent linkage between AMP and a hydroxyl residue of a protein. It contains two adenylyl transferase domains that are involved in the addition and removal of AMP to glutamine synthetase. De-AMPylation occurs at the N-terminus of the domain. Following the removal of AMP from glutamine synthetase, GS-ATase forms ADP and unmodified glutamine synthetase.  Pathogenicity  Bacteria proteins, also known as effectors, have been shown to use AMPylation. Effectors such as VopS, IbpA, and DrrA, have been shown to AMPylate host GTPases and cause actin cytoskeleton changes. GTPases are common targets of AMPylators. Rho, Rab, and Arf GTPase families are involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and vesicular trafficking. They also play roles in cellular control mechanisms such as phagocytosis in the host cell. The pathogen enhances or prevents its internalization by either inducing or inhibiting host cell phagocytosis. Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes food poisoning as a result of raw or undercooked seafood consumption in humans.Luong, P., L. N. Kinch, C. A. Brautigam, N. V. Grishin, D. R. Tomchick, and K. Orth. \\"Kinetic and Structural Insights into the Mechanism of AMPylation by VopS Fic Domain.\\" Journal of Biological Chemistry 285.26 (2010): 20155-20163. Print. VopS, a type III effector found in Vibrio parahaemolyticus, contains a Fic domain that has a conserved HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif that contains a histidine residue essential for AMPylation. VopS blocks actin assembly by modifying threonine residue in the switch 1 region of Rho GTPases. The transfer of an AMP moiety using ATP to the threonine residue results in steric hindrance, and thus prevents Rho GTPases from interacting with downstream effectors. As a result, the host cell‚Äôs actin cytoskeleton control is disabled, leading to cell rounding. IbpA is secreted into eukaryotic cells from H. somni, a Gram-negative bacterium in cattle that causes respiratory epithelium infection. This effector contains two Fic domains at the C-terminal region. AMPylation of the IbpA Fic domain of Rho family GTPases is responsible for its cytotoxicity. The AMPylation on a tyrosine residue of the switch 1 region blocks the interaction of the GTPases with downstream substrates such as PAK.

The four ships were built for the Royal Banana Monopoly Business (Regia Azienda Monopolio Banane). These ships were originally devised as \\"banana boats\\" for transporting refrigerated bananas from Somaliland and Eritrea in Italian East Africa. In the event of war, the design of Ramb IV allowed it to be refitted as an \\"auxiliary cruiser\\" for commerce raiding. She was 3,667 tons displacement, oil powered, and capable of knots. Following a declaration of war, Ramb IV was capable of being armed with two guns and eight anti-aircraft guns and of becoming an auxiliary cruiser. Instead, Ramb IV was converted into a hospital ship for the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina). The goal of Ramb IV, in case of fall of Eritrea, was transporting Italian wounded back to Italy. However, this mission was impossible because of the British control of the Suez Canal. In addition, it would have been suicide to attempt to round the Cape of Good Hope and enter the Mediterranean Sea past Gibraltar. The work to convert the banana boat to a hospital ship was performed at the Eritrean port of Massawa. Ramb IV was part of the Italian Navy's Red Sea Flotilla. When the port of Massawa fell on 10 April 1941 during the East African Campaign, the British captured Ramb IV. Pressed into British service, she then operated in the Red Sea and later off Libya.

In 2014, the first film was digitally restored into HD and was to be released via Kapamilya Blockbusters. Reception=Critical response The '90s version of John en Marsha was Home Along Da Riles. Dolphy used to play the character of John, a jobless father who has his own way of making money through devious and comical ways. But his character in Home Along Da Riles is the complete opposite where he played the role of Mang Kevin Cosme, who works as a janitor from a placement agency. His portrayal of this role mirrored the typical Filipino family who may not have enough, but remains happy and contented amid lacking financially. Mang Cosme Generation Dolphy was able to separate all his notable characters that made him a wonderful actor.

Melchior was born in Berlin. He studied botany at Berlin University, became assistant to G. Haberlandt at the Institute for plant physiology and took his doctor's degree with him in 1920. Later he was assistant at the Botanical Museum and Herbarium, Berlin-Dahlem, on 1 October 1920, the beginning of an uninterrupted career at that institute in which he went through all the ranks, ending as interim director (1958‚Äì1959), and having been professor of botany from 1940 teaching at Technical University of Berlin. Among his many contributions to taxonomy are his treatments of the Medusagynaceae, Theaceae, Violaceae, and Canellaceae for the second edition of the Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien of Engler & K. Prantl, the publication as editor with E. Werdermann, of ed. 12 (1954-1964) of Engler's \\"Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien\\", and, as a last major contribution (with Hans Kastner) of Gewurze (1974). He died in Berlin, aged 89. His main interest was in the Violaceae, Theaceae, and Bignoniaceae and, especially in his earlier years, in the flora of the Alps. He received his introduction to this flora in his excursions as a student with Engler, retained the best possible memories of these events, and attributed to them the awakening of his interest in plant systematics. Melchior was a founding member of I.A.P.T. and stayed in this institution until his death. The genus Melchiora Kobuski, synonym of Balthasaria in the family Theaceae, is named in his honour.
