Rice Charleton, portrait by Thomas Gainsborough Life Charleton was educated at the University of Oxford, where he took the degrees of M.A., M.B., and M.D. He settled in practice at Bath, Somerset, was elected physician to the Bath General Hospital 2 June 1757, and then lived in Alfred Street. He belonged to the Royal College of Physicians. Charleton wrote on the chemistry of mineral waters, and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 3 November 1747. He then retired from the Society, in 1754. He resigned his post at the hospital 1 May 1781, and died in 1789. Works In 1750 Charleton published A Chemical Analysis of Bath Waters. The book describes a series of experiments to determine the mineral constituents of the thermal springs at Bath. The chemical system of Hermann Boerhaave was followed. He published a second tract An Inquiry into the Efficacy of Bath Waters in Palsies, and reprinted it in 1774, with his first publication and Tract the Third, containing Cases of Patients admitted into the Hospital at Bath under the care of the late Mr. Oliver, with some additional Cases and Notes. The volume is dedicated to Thomas Osborne, 4th Duke of Leeds, who was one of Charleton's patients. It contains case histories, and argues that part of the reputation of the Bath waters as a cure for palsy was due to the large number of cases of paralysis from lead poisoning who arrived with useless limbs; and were cured by abstinence from cider having lead in solution, and by frequent bathing.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History Cornelius (\\"Bill\\") and Kathryn Tuomy were siblings from a family with deep roots in the Ann Arbor area. The pair were in the real estate business, and were responsible for the development of the Tuomy Hills area of Ann Arbor. In 1928, when Stadium Boulevards was first constructed, the Tuomys decided that the area where Stadium crossed Washtenaw needed a gas station. They hired Ann Arbor architects Lynn Fry and Paul Kasurin to design this service station, though other sources list the architect as Frank Carson (winner of the 1925 Prix de Rome). The Standard Oil Company leased the station, and exhibited a replica it at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago. When Bill Tuomy died in 1966, Standard Oil bought the station, and ran it until 1988 when it was boarded up. In 1999, the station was refurbished for use as a University Bank ATM branch. In 2005, Bearclaw Coffee Co. moved into the station, and remains there as of 2020. Description The Tuomy Hills Service Station is a single story commercial building, constructed in a style variously described as reflecting an Irish gatehouse or English gatekeeper's cottage. The walls consists of eight inches of brick faced with eight inches of stone. The station sits on a heavy concrete pad, and is roofed with slate. The structure has two porte-cochères, each supported with hand-hewn oak pillars.

The pressure-/load proofs of the EN 124:1994 are the foundation of the proofs of suitability, which the ISO 15398 pretends. Additional to this you have to render comprehensive material specific proofs - e.g. impact resistance, cold-climate- crack-test, UV-resistance of the introduced plastics.

Emperor Frederick II restored the construction to use it as residence for his mistress Bianca Lancia, while under the Angevines it was used mainly as prison. Later, from 1464 to 1485, the fortress was the residence of the exiled Albanian condottiero Skanderbeg. The castle was largely rebuilt in the late 15th century by Ferdinand I.

History Lowline formed in their home town of Manchester in late 2007 releasing their first single \\"Monitors\\" through 1234 Records early 2008 with producer Owen Morris. Both \\"Monitors\\" and the follow up single \\"Sound Of Music\\" (also produced by Morris) reached number 6 in the UK Indie charts. The band formed after a chance meeting at a fall show. With a similar predilection for Krautrock and post- punk including The Chameleons, The Clash and Echo and The Bunnymen, the band soon won a reputation as ‘the black sheep’ of the Manchester music scene – eschewing traditional venues preferring to set up their own shows in semi- derelict warehouses in Salford and Ancoats. Lowline soon counted Morris as well as Mani and Nick McCabe among their supporters. With two Morris-produced, self-released singles selling out by word of mouth, subsequent airplay by Radio One’s Zane Lowe and Huw Stephens, as well as playlists on XFM and 6Music, tours with The Enemy, The Happy Mondays and The Charlatans followed as did a burgeoning interest from record labels. Left contemplating the band’s future, the members collectively decided to leave the UK for a hectic touring schedule of Europe, the proceeds of which were used to finance recording themselves and on their own terms. The band toured extensively across Europe and the UK before returning to Manchester to start their Deaf Radio label facilitating their own album release. The band released their debut album Lowline in 2011 through their own label Deaf Radio. The album was recorded in Stockport and was produced by George Shilling. The album consists of 12 tracks and 2 bonus tracks-including a Jagz Kooner remix of opening track \\"Disko Killers\\". Their track \\"Outside\\" taken from the album was made \\"Single of the Week\\" on iTunes in The United States helping the album climb to number 20 in iTunes USA Alternative chart and maintain a position in the top 30 for over a week.

The restaurant's chef, Hadleigh Troy, was trained by leading Perth chefs Alain Fabregues and Neal Jackson. He later worked in Michelin-starred restaurants in the United Kingdom, and for Gordon Ramsay. Restaurant Amusé offered only a degustation menu. It was given a two star rating, and the award for Restaurant of the Year, by The West Australian Good Food Guide 2013, and retained its two star rating for 2014. The restaurant was also named the best restaurant in Western Australia for eight consecutive years by Gourmet Traveller.

The show centres on three professional chefs who immerse themselves in a different culture each episode and then attempt to cook meals in the style of that culture with produce acquired by traditional means and with no commercial kitchen. Format Hosted by Dr Shini Somara (previously the host of The Health Show), each episode focuses on a different \\"traditional\\" or \\"tribal\\" culture.No Kitchen Required by Jay Tavare (Huffington Post, 4 April 2012) The three participating chefs are introduced to tribal or cultural elders who provide an overview of their culture and cuisine. The chefs are then treated to a traditional meal to allow them to gain an understanding of the local cuisine. A ballot is then drawn to determine which \\"core ingredient\\" each chef will be required to use. The following day, with the assistance of a tribal or traditional advisor, each chef is required to acquire their core ingredient. During the 10 episodes of Season 1, core ingredients included hunted wild boar, hand-caught rock lobster and trap-caught river eel. Though the chefs are given instructions and guidance, they are expected to catch and kill animals themselves using traditional methods. The core ingredients are then supplemented with produce from local farmers, barter markets and gathered food. The chefs then return to \\"camp\\" where they cook a three-course meal which is supposed to blend their own cooking style with traditional techniques and flavours from that culture. Each chef is allowed to bring a chef's knife and a single additional (non-traditional) ingredient. They prepare food with basic utensils at a covered bench and cook over an open fire. Their food is then served to a panel of 4 judges from that tribe or culture. Judges are given three colours tokens (each colour corresponds to a particular chef) and are asked by the host to cast a single vote for the chef they believes best represented their traditional cuisine. In each instance, a tribal leader is chosen who holds a casting vote in the event of a tie. The winner is announced and the winning chef is brought before the traditional elders to be \\"honoured by the tribe\\". The winning chef then thanks the judges and presents the tribe with gifts. Gifts during Season 1 included sporting equipment, fishing gear and children's games. Season 1 The first season of the show included visits to international tribes and traditional cultures in Dominica, New Zealand, Thailand and Fiji and domestic (US) cultural groups in the Louisiana bayou, New Mexico, Florida and Hawaii.No Kitchen Required First Look: BBC America Introduces Survivalist Cooking (Video) by Michael O'Connell (The Hollywood Reporter, 23 February 2012) =Participants= *Madison Cowan - UK- born chef, first ever Grand Champion of Food Network's Chopped, Extreme Chef judge and winner of Iron Chef America's Battle Kale. *Michael Psilakis - Greek-American New York City restaurateur, a judge on Ultimate Recipe Showdown, a participant on Iron Chef America and a host of The Best Thing I Ever Ate. *Kayne Raymond - New Zealand-born private chef and a participant on Chopped.

It formed on October 1 in the Caribbean Sea as the seventeenth tropical storm, and initially moved slowly to the north. While passing west of Jamaica, the storm damaged banana plantations and killed one person. On October 3, the storm became a hurricane, and the next day crossed western Cuba. Advance warning in the country prevented any storm-related fatalities, although four people suspected of looting were shot and killed during a curfew in Havana. The German travel writer Richard Katz witnessed the hurricane while in Havana, and described the experience in his book \\"Loafing Around the Globe\\" (\\"Ein Bummel um Die Welt\\"). After entering the Florida Straits, the hurricane turned to the northeast, producing tropical storm winds along the Florida Keys. High rainfall caused flooding, while three tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged houses in the Miami area. The hurricane reached peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) on October 6 while moving through the Bahamas. It subsequently weakened and became extratropical on October 8\\\\. The former hurricane lashed the coast of Nova Scotia with high winds and rain, leaving about $1 million (1933 CAD) in damage. Rough seas sank several ships and killed nine people in the region. The remnants of the hurricane eventually dissipated on October 9 to the south of Newfoundland. Meteorological history Toward the end of September 1933, there was a large area of disturbed weather across the southern Caribbean Sea. By September 30, a low pressure area developed south of San Andrés island. The next day, observations from a station at Cabo Gracias a Dios and a ship indicated a tropical storm had developed off the eastern coast of Honduras. Low atmospheric pressure suggested the system had winds of tropical storm force despite lack of direct observations. Moving northward, the storm gained size as it slowly intensified. Based on observations and interpolation of data, it is estimated the storm became a hurricane early on October 3 while passing west of Jamaica. That day, a station at South Negril Point that day reported a force 8 on the Beaufort scale, well to the east of the center. While approaching the southern coast of Cuba, the hurricane reached estimated winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). At 0900 UTC on October 4, the hurricane made landfall on the Zapata Peninsula of Cuba, followed by a second landfall on the Cuban mainland three hours later. Beginning at 1600 UTC that day, the capital, Havana, observed the passage of the eye, where a pressure of was reported. The hurricane weakened slightly over land before emerging into the Straits of Florida and re-intensifying. On October 5, it turned to the northeast while remaining southeast of the Florida mainland, although the strongest winds remained over water. Early on October 6 while the hurricane was moving through the Bahamas, a ship reported a pressure of , although it was unknown if it was in the center or the periphery of the storm. Based on the data, the maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125 mph (205 km/h), although the ship estimated winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). The storm maintained peak winds for about 18 hours, after which it weakened while accelerating to the northeast. After passing to the west of Bermuda on October 7, the hurricane became extratropical the next day while still maintaining hurricane-force winds. The storm brushed the coast of Nova Scotia before it was last noted approaching another extratropical storm on October 9 to the south of Atlantic Canada. Preparations and impact Early in its duration, the developing storm brushed the coast of Honduras with light winds. In Jamaica, gusts approached hurricane force, while heavy rainfall damaged transportation in Kingston. The storm wrecked small houses and damaged the local banana industry. There was one death in Jamaica. The hurricane crossed western Cuba with winds estimated at 105 mph (165 km/h). This prompted officials to declare a curfew for the capital in the midst of political upheaval following a coup. A newspaper described the curfew before the storm as \\"the most peaceful night in a week.\\" However, the government ordered soldiers in Havana to shoot anyone suspected of looting, and four looters were killed during the storm's passage. Heavy associated rainfall caused rivers to overflow in three provinces, flooding low-lying areas. In Cienfuegos, the storm destroyed several houses. Offshore northern Cuba, two United States ships took shelter at the port in Matanzas due to rough seas. High tides flooded the Havana waterfront up to deep, and several boats sank at the city's harbor. Due to advance warning and evacuations, there were no direct deaths in the country, and 20 people were injured. Storm warnings were issued on the west coast of Florida to Boca Grande and on the east coast to Titusville, with hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys. Although the hurricane passed just southeast of the Florida Keys, the highest winds reported in Florida were 44 mph (70 km/h) in Key West. The storm passed closest to Long Key, where winds were estimated at 63 mph (102 km/h), due to being on the weak side of the storm. Farther north, Miami reported winds of 35 mph (56 km/h). Rainfall reached over in 24 hours in Key West. There, the storm knocked over several trees and caused some power outages. Portions of the city were flooded while boats were washed ashore. Elsewhere in Florida, three tornadoes were reported during the hurricane's passage. In Fort Lauderdale, a tornado injured one person, and another one in Miami knocked down four homes and injured two. The third tornado was in Hollywood, where several houses were damaged. Later as the hurricane moved through the Bahamas, it produced winds of 100 mph (161 km/h) at Hope Town and 91 mph (146 km/h) at Millville, both on Abaco. The outer periphery of the storm brushed Nantucket to the west with winds of 39 mph (63 km/h) and Bermuda to the east with 46 mph (75 km/h). While moving offshore Atlantic Canada, the former hurricane produced gale-force winds, peaking at 52 mph (83 km/h) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. There, the storm also dropped heavy rainfall reaching 9.84 in (250 mm) over two days, including 3.6 in (90 mm) in 24 hours. Flooding covered streets in the province, causing traffic jams, and farmlands. In Annapolis Valley, the rainfall washed out a bridge while the winds damaged about one-third of the apple crop. The dam at Chocolate Lake overflowed due to the rainfall, and a dam broke in Great Village, destroying a nearby bridge. Many trees fell during the storm, resulting in power outages after some fell onto lines. Outside Nova Scotia, the storm produced winds of 51 mph (81 km/h) in Shediac, New Brunswick, where high waves left coastal damage. In Newfoundland, the storm washed out three bridges, as well as portions of roads and rails, and flooded one house. Throughout Atlantic Canada, high waves washed ashore, sank, or broke at least ten boats from their moorings, killing nine people including seven from an overturned boat sailing from Boston to Yarmouth. Overall damage in Canada was estimated at around $1 million (1933 CAD), including $250,000 in lost apple crop.

The center is visited by a quarter of a million scholars, 15% from outside Turin, many from outside Italy. The foundation has relationships with the Colegio de México and Cornell University, facilitating research on regional integration, comparative models of employment and social policy, and contemporary political and economic thought. In 1984 the statute was reformed by eliminating the presence of law of the secretary of the PLI by the governing board of the Foundation, in order to start a process totally independent, essentially aimed to study the new guidelines that faced in those years in Italy opening new horizons to the spread of liberal culture. Dissolved the PLI in 1993 in the collapse of the traditional parties, the Foundation has been to represent the continuity of liberal culture, suddenly claimed by many as an essential element of new and old political parties, few practiced in bipolar coalitions that have come affirming starting since 1994. Even then, however, it appeared clear that the transition to the bipolar transversely cutting the Liberal membership; and in fact those who were (in and out of PLI) recognized in the membership, divided into the new system by choosing different political militancy, or none. In acknowledge it, the Einaudi Foundation in Rome has decided to maintain and even more so to strengthen their choice, not of neutrality but of impartiality: no neutrality because the Foundation has its foundation and orientation in the liberal culture, but of impartiality, because the liberal culture, for the same characteristics that distinguish it, it does not lead to predetermined party options. The choice made by the Foundation is of greater importance in the present moment, despite the verbal statements, it is clear that the liberal culture is altogether a minority in the new political system, and thus requires initiatives and tools that help to make it grow, in what distinguished by other patently functional foundations in locations partisan and coalition. The way to do that, or at least try, is to constantly practiced by Einaudi Foundation: develop the debate and dialogue between different positions, present any problem to a rational analysis and motivated schematics without preconceptions, to offer to those who want a place of freedom discussion. The choices of those who intend to take an active part in militant politics does not involve in any case the Foundation, returning them in the exercise of personal responsibility of each.

Karol (not to be mistaken with his father) worked in his youth as an electrician and showed great technical skills in it. In 1883 he was employed in the laboratory of British company \\"The Patent Utilisation Co\\". He designed and recorded his first patents in that period. In 1885 he attended electrotechnics studies at the Royal Polytechnic University in Charlottenburg.  Activity  In Berlin, Pollak ran electrotechnical factory \\"G. Wehr Telegraphen-Bau-Anstalt\\". Later he returned to Britain to commercialize his patents, which were released under anglicised version of his name, \\"Charles Pollak\\". In 1886, he became the director of a Paris company of electric tramways of his design. In the meantime he worked on the design of Electrochemical cell. He was very successful in this topic and it made him famous. Later he founded battery factories in Frankfurt, (Germany) and Liesing, Austria. Many battery-manufacturing companies have licensed his designs. In 1899 he founded his own laboratory and proceeded with further research. He obtained 98 patents on his inventions. In 1922 he returned to Poland, where a year later he founded a factory in Biała, which exists to the present day.Fabryka Akumulatorów EnerSys Sp. z o.o The company started under the name of Polskie Towarzystwo Akumulatorowe and was co-founded by professor and president of Poland, Ignacy Mościcki. However, Pollak was the first president of this company. Pollak is sometimes referred as the Edison of Poland. In 1925 he received the title Doctor Honoris Causa of Warsaw University of Technology.  Most important inventions  Battery constructed by Karol Pollak His numerous inventions also cover other areas, among them: electric motors, color printing device, and a type of microphone. His main activity was related to chemical sources of energy – galvanic cells and batteries. He obtained a patent for manufacturing lead-acid batteries.

Cannon was honorably discharged as a sergeant in 1970, after which he joined the River Rouge Police Department. In 1977, Cannon enlisted in the Michigan Army National Guard and joined the Kalkaska County Sheriff Department. Cannon served as sheriff of Kalkaska County from 1987–2004. From 2003-2004, Cannon served as the commander of the Joint Detention Operations Group Joint Task Force Guantanamo. Roll Call reported that Cannon doesn't think his service at Guantanamo should be seen as unpatriotic, saying of it, \\"I've done that gladly. I've done that proudly. I would do it again.\\" He was promoted to Brigadier General in 2004, assuming command of the 177th Military Police Brigade in Taylor, Michigan. He was promoted to Major General in 2006 as Commanding General of the 46th Military Police Command in Lansing, Michigan. Cannon served two deployments in Iraq during the Iraq War. His first deployment was 2008-2009 where he served as Deputy Commanding General responsible for developing Iraqi police forces. His second deployment to Iraq was 2010-2011 where he served as U.S. Forces-Iraq Provost Marshal General and Deputy Commanding General for Detention Operations. After his last deployment in Iraq, he returned to the Michigan Army National Guard and in February 2012 was placed in the Army Retired Reserves, effectively signaling his retirement from the military. 2014 congressional candidacy In August 2013, Cannon announced that he would challenge Republican Congressman Dan Benishek in Michigan's 1st congressional district. Cannon ran unopposed in the Democratic primary on August 5, 2014. He was defeated by Benishek in the general election. Cannon was endorsed by the Sierra Club, and the League of Conservation Voters. Nancy Pelosi's campaign committee has donated to Cannon's campaign. In January 2014, Cannon was interviewed by a reporter from the Daily Mining Gazette. The day after the interview, the reporter called Cannon to ask follow-up questions. The person who answered the phone identified himself as Cannon, and went on to express his dislike of the Affordable Care Act. Cannon's campaign denied that he had made the anti-Affordable Care Act comments, and the newspaper later revealed that the reporter had dialed the wrong number and had spoken with a Cannon impersonator, and not Cannon himself. Cannon's campaign subsequently confirmed his support for the Affordable Care Act. Cannon has noted his belief that the \\"worst thing that could be done\\" to the Affordable Care Act is to \\"throw it all away.\\" Personal life Cannon has a wife, Elizabeth. The Cannons live in Fife Lake, Michigan. Cannon is a member of the Kalkaska Memorial Health Center Board of Trustees, chairman of the Garfield Township Parks and Recreation Committee, and a board member of the Northern Michigan Law Enforcement Training Group.

The body camera footage depicts Stephenson begging the responding Midland officer and Cannon, the Garfield Township Police Chief who was off duty at the time, to not send him to jail.

It ties into (and tells the story of) the Coldplay album Mylo Xyloto.Announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2012 Publication history On 10 July 2012 the Coldplay website announced a six-part Mylo Xyloto comic, with the first issue to be released at that week's Comic-Con. Published by Bongo Comics, the story followed the tale of Mylo, a 'Silencer', who, in the words of co-writer Mark Osborne (filmmaker), is a part of a \\"war against sound and colour\\". Together with Osborne, Dylan Haggerty also writes the comic (starting in the second issue) with art by Alejandro Fuentes. Main characters *Mylo: a disillusioned Silencer (a member of Silencia's secret police) who joins the rebels after he touches one of the Sparkers' musical graffiti. *Rex: a fellow Silencer of Mylo's who is devoted to his work and the struggle against the Sparkers. *Major Minus: the Irdok's representative on Silencia and the public face of Irdok rule. He is also the Irdok official that oversees the Silencers. He appears on the Hypnofeed regularly on the show Miles of Smiles, and he publishes propaganda about Sparkers and colour. *Fly: the leader of the Sparkers and the romantic interest for Mylo. She is such a significant threat to Major Minus that he offers free Hypnofeed to the person who catches her. Synopsis In the world of Silencia, a species known as the Irdoks rule over the Silencians in a dystopian police state. They have a military police force recruited from Silencians known as the Silencers, which are taught to enforce the Irdok's rule of law, which is known as Chromatic and Acoustic Level Management (CALM). The Irdoks defend their policy of CALM by talking about a \\"Great War of Colour\\" which brought about a species known as the Eaters which the Irdoks protect the Silencians from. To make up for the lack of colour and sound in their world, the Silencians use a tool known as the Hypnofeed, which constantly feeds them with visual and (ostensibly) audio stimulation. Major Minus, however, has a problem involving continued rebellion by a section of the populace known as the Sparkers, who create Sparks (which are colourful musical graffiti) in an effort to wake the populace up from the Hypnofeed.

The pub gives its name to the adjacent road junction, where the A2 between central London and Kent meets the A102, which provides access to the Blackwall Tunnel. Several Transport for London (TfL) bus routes pass close to the junction. There has been a meeting point at this location since the Middle Ages. It was allegedly a stopping point of King Henry VIII when riding from Greenwich to Shooter's Hill with his Queen and several Lords. The present pub dates from around 1745 and its name comes from the sight of the setting sun amidst dust, kicked up by sheep herded by drovers from Kent travelling towards London. It was originally an isolated inn on heathland, frequented by highwaymen known as \\"the Trojans\\", who regularly engaged in pickpocketing. William Hazlitt was known to visit the inn. The junction was built in stages, due to various 20th-century projects to bypass the old Roman Road between Blackheath and Dartford. The A2 to the south was constructed as part of the \\"Shooters Hill By-Pass\\" which took most of the 1920s to complete. The modern roundabout interchange dates from the late 1960s. As well as the road junction, the pub has also given its name to the nearby Sunfields Methodist Church and to the adjacent Sun Lane, a former caravan repair site which now hosts a garage.

The New Englanders eventually overwhelmed them and many Mi'kmaq were enslaved. Historical context Prior to King Philip's War, there is no record of New England and the Mi'kmaq being in conflict. During the First Abenaki War, Major Richard Waldron captured natives for the slave trade. The most significant seizure of natives happened in Dover on September 7, 1676. Later, Waldron gave a mandate to the merchant, Henry Lawton (or Laughton), of the Piscataqua area, to seize all the Indians \\"of the East\\" who had been raiding the New England villages along the border with Acadia. On November 9, 1676 (o.s.), they hired a vessel, the Endeavor, commanded by Captain John Horton. They stopped at Machias and nine natives were taken captive. Then they sailed to Cape Sable Island where 17 Mi'kmaq were taken captive, including the local chief and his wife. They were taken to the Azores and sold as slaves to the Portuguese. A New England vessel in the Azores notified the authorities in Boston of this possible illegal activity and Endeavor was seized and taken to Boston. Mellanson was released when his mother, Prescilla Mellanson, bailed him. After this, he skipped bail, and went into hiding. He changed his surname to Laverdure to avoid detection and lived in Port Royal thereafter. Henry Lawton and William Waldron were kept in jail but were eventually acquitted. The battle The Mi'kmaw response came in July 1677, when about 80 natives attacked 26 New England fishermen who were in six fishing vessels at Port La Tour. The natives boarded one of the vessels, stripped the men of their clothing, tied them up and left them on deck until nightfall, when they commanded them to set sail towards the Penobscot River in Maine, close to Castine. A few hours later, while in the harbor, the New England captain was able to overthrow the natives. Although some natives escaped, the New Englanders imprisoned the rest. They took the prisoners to Marblehead, Massachusetts, where they were tortured and stoned to death by a group of women. Afterward As an immediate response, some merchants from Salem, to whom most of the vessels belonged, armed a large ketch, transforming it into a warship. It was manned by forty men who sailed for southern Nova Scotia. They scanned the coast, scrutinized every port, but to no avail. The Indians had gone into hiding.

A member of the Democratic Party, she was the Democratic candidate to represent Illinois' 13th congressional district in the 2014 federal elections. Early life and education Callis received both her bachelor's degree and her law degree from St. Louis University. Callis is a native of Granite City, Illinois and is the daughter of attorney and Democratic Party activist Lance Callis. Judicial career Callis began her legal career as a prosecutor in the state's attorney offices of Madison County and St. Clair County. Callis was sworn in as an associate judge to Illinois's Third Judicial Circuit in 1995. At the time of her selection for the court, she was the youngest of 21 candidates. In the same year, she was given the \\"lowest rating for legal ability among 152 judges in Illinois outside of Chicago\\" by an Illinois State Bar Association poll. Callis noted that she had not received any complaints about her performance, and the low rating reflected the fact that she had been on the bench only a few months and most lawyers had not appeared before her. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, prior to Callis' appointment there were \\"months of reports she had the job locked up because of her influential father\\" and she \\"was dogged early in her career by allegations that she got to the bench because of her influential father.\\" She was named a circuit judge in 1999, and chief judge in 2006. As a judge, Callis was involved with the creation of the first Veterans’ Court in Illinois, which received the national 2010 Paul H. Chapman Award. The court is run by veterans and provides services to county veterans. Callis also created mediation programs aimed at helping homeowners and lenders avoid mortgage foreclosures. In a 2012 poll of lawyers, Callis was recommended for retention, with 83.64% of those responding saying Callis \\"meets requirements of office.\\" Three other judges from the 3rd Judicial Circuit received higher scores than Callis. Her lowest score in the judicial evaluations, 82.63%, was in the category \\"impartiality.\\" Her highest scores were 98.8 in \\"health\\" and 92.77 in \\"sensitivity.\\" 2014 U.S. House campaign Callis stepped down as a judge in 2013 in order to run for Congress in Illinois's 13th congressional district. The Chicago Tribune endorsed Callis's Democratic primary competitor, George Gollin, writing: \\"Callis sticks to safe talking points, occasionally name-checking Durbin. Her answers to our survey are carefully scripted, heavy on promises to protect seniors and middle-class families without explaining what she'd actually do.\\" Callis won the Democratic primary on March 18, 2014. Callis lost to Republican incumbent Rodney L. Davis in the November 4, 2014, general election. Callis was endorsed by Democratic Senator Dick Durbin and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Her campaign was supported by Nancy Pelosi, who appeared at \\"When Women Succeed, America Succeeds, Women on a Roll\\" bus tour. Callis was endorsed by the national Veteran's Vision publication. She was also endorsed by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Callis was endorsed by EMILY's List, who called her a \\"perfect foil\\" for incumbent Rodney Davis. In October 2014, Roll Call reported that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee would be cutting back initially planned ads supporting Callis in the second-to-last-week of the cycle, part of a larger series of cuts that \\"serve as a signal the party does not see a path to victory for these candidates or races.\\" Issue positions Callis supports the Affordable Care Act, saying: \\"We can't just shut down our government and cost our economy billions of dollars because we disagree with a law.\\" When asked if she supported single-payer health care, Callis said: \\"I think we need to wait and see what the Affordable Healthcare Act does.\\" Personal life Callis has two children: a son who is serving as a US Army Ranger, and a daughter who is a teacher. Callis has been delinquent or late in paying property taxes in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013. “As soon as anything was brought to Ann’s attention, the fees were paid in full,” according to Callis' spokesman Marshall Cohen.

It has its origins in the Conductors Union founded in 1868. Later it extended membership to brakemen. In 1969 the ORC merged with three other unions to form the United Transportation Union. Organizational history =Foundation (1868)= The first Conductor's Union was formed in early 1868 at Amboy, Illinois, by a group of conductors on the Illinois Central Railroad. Soon after another division was formed at Galesburg, Illinois, by a group of conductors from the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The two groups met in July 1868 at Mendota, Illinois, and formed the \\"Conductors Union\\", which was to organize conductors across the country. On December 15, 1868 the group met at Columbus, Ohio, where they elected the leaders to form a \\"grand division\\" and adopted a constitution and bylaws. The ORC represented the interests of train conductors, whose job function approximated that of an ocean ship captain and were consequently the most prestigious and highly compensated railway workers of their era. The ORC was governed by conventions held every three years and was not part of the American Federation of Labor. =Benefit and temperance society (1869-1890)= Cover of the January 1885 issue of Railway Conductor's Monthly. The original organization was a fraternal benefit and temperance society rather than a labor union. It adopted the name \\"Conductors Brotherhood\\" at its first annual convention in 1869, and changed to the \\"Order of Railway Conductors of America\\" in 1878. The order began to publish its official organ, the monthly magazine Railway Conductor's Monthly, in 1884. The publication was renamed The Railway Conductor and moved to a semi-monthly frequency in August 1889. The magazine's frequency reverted to monthly status in June 1891. The order was incorporated in 1887 and made its headquarters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The objectives given in the 1887 articles of incorporation were, \\"To unite its members; to combine their interests as railway conductors; to elevate their standards as such and their character as men for their mutual improvement and advantage, socially and otherwise...\\" The order provided mutual support and assistance to conductors, and administered a death and disability insurance plan. It covered the territories of the United States and Canada. Membership was open to white men in the occupations of road conductors, assistant conductors and ticket collectors; road brakemen, flagmen and train baggagemen; yard conductors, yard foremen and other yard trades. From 1877 to 1890 any member that participated in a strike would be expelled from the order. This led to the perception among other railway labor organizations that the conductors were strikebreakers. In response, the rival Brotherhood of Railway Conductors was formed as a labor union in 1885. A later report of this event in the journal of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen said \\"the Brotherhood of Railway Conductors was organized at a time when the Order of Railway Conductors could scarcely be said to be in good standing with the laboring people because it had not a protective constitution. The young Brotherhood was organized to supply a pressing want of the time...\\" During a strike of switchmen in Chicago in 1886, the Rock Island Division 106 of the Order of Railway Conductors said the demands of the switchmen were unjust and unreasonable. In response, one of the lodges of the Switchmen's Mutual Aid Association resolved, \\"That we extend our contempt and detestation to the members of Division 106, Order of Railway Conductors, for grovelling at the feet of railroad officials...\\" =Consolidation (1890-1941)= This ORC membership card for 1912 features a perforated serial number reminiscent of the train tickets punched by conductors. Internal and external pressures combined to cause an upheaval in the organization in 1890. The old leaders were dismissed and a new, more aggressive policy of trade regulation was adopted. Good relations were established with other unions. The order continued to provide strong fraternal and beneficial services, but the focus shifted to regulating working conditions and negotiating trade agreements to resolve difficulties with railroad owners. At the September 21, 1891 meeting of the Brotherhood of Railway Conductors its Grand Chief George W. Howard recommended consolidation with the Order of Railway conductors. The rival Brotherhood was absorbed into the order. In 1888 Edgar E. Clark had been elected Grand Senior Conductor of the order. In 1890 he became Grand Chief Conductor of the Order. Clark would head the union until 1906. Assisting him, in 1894 Austin B. Garretson was elected grand senior conductor, while C. H. Wilkins was assistant grand chief conductor. Garretson and Wilkins then exchanged positions. In 1900 E. E. Clark made a speech at the Chicago Conference on Conciliation where he said that the men favored arbitration for settlement of labor disputes. On 1 September 1906 Austin B. Garretson was elected Grand Chief Conductor of the Order. His title was changed to president in 1907. In 1907 the ORC and other railroad unions managed to get Congress to pass laws that limited to sixteen the maximum number of hours a railroader could work in one day. Garretson was appointed a member of the Commission on Industrial Relations created by the United States Congress on 23 August 1912. The commission sat through 154 days of public hearings between the fall of 1913 and the spring of 1915, uncovering many abuses and making various recommendations. In the late summer of 1916 Garretson played a leading role in negotiations in which railway workers won the right to an eight-hour day and time and a half overtime pay with the passage of the Adamson Act. Garretson retired in 1919. Lucius E. Sheppard (1863-1934) was president of the Order of Railway Conductors from 1919-28. He was one of the committee of six leaders of the main railway unions who founded the Conference for Progressive Political Action in Chicago in February 1922. The order's president S. N. Berry died on June 27, 1934. On 16 July 1934 James A. Phillips was appointed to fill his unexpired term as president. Phillips was elected chairman of the Railway Labor Executives' Association in February 1940. He replaced George Harrison, who resigned. Phillips became President-Emeritus of the Order of Railway Conductors in 1941. =Later history (1941-1969)= Harry W. Fraser was president of the Order of Railway Conductors of America from 1941 to 1950. During World War II he was a representative of labor interests of the government's Management-Labor Policy Committee. Fraser encouraged the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors to join the Order of Railway Conductors during the war. The Order of Sleeping Car Conductors amalgamated with the ORC in 1942. Fraser was twice president of the Railway Labor Executives' Association. Fraser died of a series of heart attacks at the union convention in May 1950. Roy O. Hughes of Milwaukee was elected as his successor. During the period from 1951 to 1954 various agreements were made over wage increases, cost of living adjustments and rules changes. The order had been accepting brakemen as members since the 1930s, and in 1954 the union changed its name to the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen (ORC&B;). On May 26, 1955, after mediation, a strike ballot and Presidential Emergency Board 109, the order achieved agreement on a graduated rate of pay system. Further gains were made in 1964, when employees won paid holidays and expenses away from home, and in 1966 when further improvements to wages and benefits were gained. In 1969 the ORC&B; merged with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and the Switchmen's Union of North America to form the \\"United Transportation Union\\" (UTU).

He then became a medical student at Guy's Hospital in London, going on to the University of Edinburgh and University of Leyden, where he graduated. Cooke became physician to the Royal General Dispensary in Bartholomew Close, in the City of London. In April 1784 he was elected physician to the London Hospital, a post he held for 23 years, and delivered the first clinical lectures given there. On 25 June in the same year he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1807 he was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians, and ten years later a Fellow of the Royal Society. He delivered the Croonian lectures at the College of Physicians in 1819, 1820, and 1821, and the Harveian oration in 1828. Cooke was president of the Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1822 and 1823. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. In his latter years he gave up practice and went out little. He died at his house in Gower Street, London, 1 January 1838. Works Cooke's thesis was on the use of Peruvian bark, in cases where there is no rise of temperature. In 1820 he began the publication of A Treatise on Nervous Diseases, completed in 1823. An American edition, in one volume, was published at Boston in 1824. This work is based on his Croonian lectures. It gives an account of the existing knowledge of hemiplegia, paraplegia, paralysis of separate nerves, epilepsy, apoplexy, lethargy, and hydrocephalus internus, without major innovations. The method is comparable to that of his friend Thomas Young in his Practical and Historical Treatise on Consumptive Diseases (1815).

This historic event marked the beginning of British rule in Mizoram that lasted till the Indian Independence in 1947. Indirectly, it also paved the way for Christian missionaries to introduce Christianity among the Mizos. Kidnapping Mary Winchester lived with her father at Cachar, Assam, India. She was an illegitimate child of James Winchester and his Meitei worker. Her father was a manager of the British tea plantation, and had been there for 12 years. When she turned six years of age in 1871, her father decided it was time for formal education in Britain. Her farewell party was arranged on 23 January at Alexandrapur plantation at the place owned by her father's close friend George Seller. While they were strolling in the garden, the workers were suddenly in commotion, and Seller was frantically galloping around on his horse. When she and a nurse headed towards the bungalow, her father met them on the way and ran her to a stable. But then the Mizo tribal warriors caught up and cut her father on the head and shot him down from behind. The warrior snatched her away from the dying clutch of her father, who murmured, \\"Dear, only God knows your fate.\\" The invaders left him to die and carried the girl away. A number of people were killed in the clash, some were taken as hostages, including Mary Winchester. Probably all except the girl, of whom they took special care, were killed on their journey to Mizoram. In captivity Mary Winchester was the first white person most Mizos had ever encountered. Though a hostage, she was most of the time treated with good care. But some warriors wanted to depose her for fearing the consequences. She was finally lodged in the house of Bengkhuaia, the chief of Sailàm, one of the most formidable chiefdoms. Her arrival in the village was celebrated with wine and meat, led by the queen. Not understanding her language to know her name, the Mizos called her Zolûti (Zo for \\"Mizo\\" or \\"Mizoram\\", lût for \\"enter\\"). The village chief then entrusted the girl under the ward of his most trusted woman, Pi Tluangi, wife of the village elder Vansuakthanga (grandparents of Vangchhunga, one of the first three Mizo pastors). Pi Tluangi eventually cared for her like a princess, sleeping with her, and making garments and toys for her. Rescue The British government was compelled to make a retaliation and recovery, a military campaign called the Lushai Expedition was launched on 8 October 1871. The British army crushed the Mizo villages one by one. The right column of the campaign reached Sailàm village on 21 January 1872. The siege started at 0830 in the morning, and after a few gunshots and shelling, the Mizos found their tribal weaponry no match to such advanced artillery and soon tendered their submission. After destroying the granaries and crops, they rescued Mary Winchester. The moment of her rescue is told in two different versions: #according to T.H. Lewin, the expedition leader, Mary Winchester was simply taken from the chief's hut. She was found sitting on the log platform of the hut, wearing a blue rag round her loins, and a smoking pipe in her mouth. She was heard giving commands to small boys who were running around in fear. A few days short of a year in captivity, she had already lost her mother tongue, and the English soldiers had to lure her with sweets. #according to Sailam residents, the popular story is that she was handed over by the queen. Being completely adapted to the Mizo life, other British were strangers to Mary Winchester. She even called them, \\"Foreigners.\\" Therefore, Pi Tluangi on pretence took her to a forest for gathering firewoods (or for cleaning at the stream, yet in another version). In the forest, her guardian left her to the awaiting soldiers, who had to drag her away against her will. In Britain Mary Winchester was immediately transported to Calcutta and from there directly to Scotland. She lived with her grandparents in Elgin, Moray. She graduated from Royal Moray College, where she met Harry Innes Howie. They got married after she got a job as headmistress and moved to London. She died in 1955.

Written by lead vocalist Myles Kennedy and lead guitarist Mark Tremonti, it was featured on the band's 2013 fourth album Fortress. The song was also released as the lead single from the album on August 20, 2013, peaking at number 4 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and reaching the top 20 of several other Billboard charts. Background and release \\"Addicted to Pain\\" was one of the first songs written during sessions for Fortress, which vocalist Myles Kennedy claimed helped the band to progress with the writing of the rest of the album, as well as encouraging them to be \\"more experimental\\". According to lead guitarist Mark Tremonti, Kennedy wrote the lyrics to the track in response to \\"somebody close to him ... venting about his problems\\". The song was first made available for online streaming on August 7, 2013 on Alter Bridge's YouTube channel, before it was officially released as the first single from Fortress on August 20. Speaking in a track-by-track feature of the album, Tremonti explained that the band chose the song as the album's lead single due to the success of \\"Isolation\\", the first release from 2010's AB III, which he compared to the Fortress track as a \\"more aggressive song ... that's straight to the point\\". The song was later featured as a playable track on the 2015 video game Guitar Hero Live. Music video The music video for \\"Addicted to Pain\\", directed by Daniel Catullo, was released on September 5, 2013. In North America, it was initially exclusive to the website Loudwire. Writing for the website, Mary Oullette described the video as featuring the group performing \\"on a large stage decked out with three monstrous video screens towering behind [them]\\", interspersed with footage related to the lyrics of the song including \\"someone being set on fire in a crowd\\" and \\"an antique car [being] left on train tracks only to meet its impending doom\\". Reception =Commercial= \\"Addicted to Pain\\" peaked on several Billboard charts in the United States: number 4 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, number 8 on the Hard Rock Digital Songs chart, number 12 on the Active Rock chart, number 14 on the Heritage Rock chart, and number 20 on the Rock Airplay chart. Outside of the US, the single reached number 150 on the UK Singles Chart on August 24, 2013. The single spent 30 weeks on the Mainstream Rock chart, more than any other release by the band. =Critical= Media response to \\"Addicted to Pain\\" was generally positive. In a review of Fortress for Loudwire, Mary Oullette described the song as \\"a straight-forward screaming rocker with blazing guitar riffs and melody driven choruses\\", praising it as a \\"perfect radio-ready track\\". Similarly, Chad Bowar for Loudwire noted that it \\"features first-class riffage and a blazing solo\\", describing it as \\"heavy, but still melodic and accessible enough that radio stations will be more than willing to play it\\". Upon its release as a single, Rock Sound magazine called it \\"a hard rockin' banger\\", while Irish news website Joe described it as a \\"proper head-banger of a tune\\". Melodic magazine praised the track as the band's \\"fastest fist pumping anthem\\". The song was included on Loudwire's 66 Best Hard Rock Songs of the 21st Century.

He studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 1635 and an MA in 1638. He was among the initial fellows of the Royal Society. Life The son of Thomas Coxe, he was born in Somerset. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1633, graduating BA in 1635, and MA in 1638. He took his MD degree at Padua 12 December 1641, and was later incorporated at Oxford, in 1646. A physician in the parliamentary army during the First English Civil War, Coxe is supposed to have pointed Thomas Sydenham in the direction of medicine while attending his brother. He associated with the Hartlib circle. He also visited Sarah Wight, one of Henry Jessey's congregation, who undertook a 75-day fast in 1647, and was then connected with radical religious groups. Coxe became a fellow of the College of Physicians on 25 June 1649. Around 1655, he took on the Puritan John Janeway as a tutor in his household, a short-lived post. In the later 1650s he was in touch with Henry Oldenburg at Oxford. He contributed to Robert Boyle's unpublished Essay of Poisons of this period. Early in 1658 he was consulted by the family of Robert Rich, 3rd Earl of Warwick on the Earl's health; Coxe summoned Richard Wiseman, who pronounced that Warwick was not in danger.Charlotte Fell-Smith, Mary Rich, Countess of Warwick (1625-1678): her family and friends (1901); pp. 263–264; archive.org. In 1660 he delivered the Harveian oration, and in 1662 was on the first list of Fellows nominated by the council of the Royal Society. From 1676 to 1680 Coxe was Treasurer of the College of Physicians and in 1682 elected its President. Coxe, with Edward Alston and John Micklethwaite, ensured the College took a generous line in licensing nonconformist ministers to practice medicine. As a close friend of William Waller, Coxe acted as executor of his will, which included legacies to Thomas Case and Gabriel Sangar. While Coxe became a physician to Charles II in 1665, his views were unpopular and his presidency of the College in the 1680s lasted only one year, as he was marked out as an early Whig. One of his acts as president was to order the printing, unusual at this period, of lectures of Walter Charleton, covering the theories of Giovanni Alfonso Borelli on the heart, but without due acknowledgement. Coxe ran into difficulties in his old age, and avoiding his creditors, died of apoplexy in France in 1685. Works From 1665 a group in the Royal Society followed up the possibility of blood transfusion, at the suggestion of John Wilkins; Coxe worked first on pigeons. After a demonstration with Edmund King in November 1666, Coxe, in Philosophical Transactions for 1667, reported on a transfusion experiment carried out on dogs, from a spaniel to a mongrel. The language of the paper was later picked up in The Virtuoso by Thomas Shadwell. Family Coxe's son Thomas was also a Cambridge graduate and physician. His daughter Mary married Thomas Rolt of Milton Ernest, and was mother of the Member of Parliament Samuel Rolt.historyofparliamentonline.org, Rolt, Samuel (c. 1671-1717), of Epsom, Surrey She then married Sir Thomas Rolt of Sacombe and was mother of Edward Rolt, also an MP.historyofparliamentonline.org, Rolt, Edward (1686-1722), of Sacombe, Herts, Harrowby, Lincs, and Spye Park, near Chippenham, Wilts. Richard Baxter published in 1680 his funeral sermon for Coxe's wife, Mary. In the dedicatory epistle Baxter clarifies that he was one of Coxe's patients.

It is headquartered in Gangnam-gu, Seoul and was opened on March 18, 2010. History In March 2010, KMP Holdings was established via a joint venture between S.M., YG, JYP, Star Empire, and other companies like Media Line, CAN Entertainment and Music Factory Entertainment. KMP is the official distributor of releases from these companies (KMP stands for Korean Music Power). Its chief executive officer is songwriter-producer Kim Chang-whan, representative of Media Line. KMP Holdings encompasses many fields including: music service, digital music distribution, and TV program production. It is a service platform that works to provide a more reasonable digital music system. Many believe this is held to challenge the duopoly on music distribution by Mnet Media and LOEN Entertainment. KT Music, the music contents arm of KT Corporation, eventually acquired KMP in November 2012, and in mid-June 2013, it absorbed KMP's distribution network.

Anagni is referred to as the 'City of the Popes' (città dei Papi): Five popes lived, reigned or were born in Anagni. Innocenzo III, (born Lotario dei Conti di Segni in 1160), Gregorio IX, (born Ugolino dei Conti di Segni), Alessandro IV, (born Rinaldo dei Conti di Segni 1180?–1185?) and Bonifacio VIII, (born Benedetto Caetani in Anagni in 1235). Bonifacio's mother was Emilia Conti, sister of pope Gregorio IX. Another Conti pope was Michelangiolo Conti, who was elected in 1721 as pope Innocenzo XIII. Filippo Coletti's son Tito would eventually marry into this illustrious Conti family. Anagni was the summer residence of the papacy until a recent transfer to Castel Gandolfo. The town centre consists of romanesque churches, campaniles, the cathedral, the palace of Bonifacio VIII, the civic palace and steep twisting streets enclosed by Roman built town walls. Via Maggiore (now Via Vittorio Emanuele) in Anagni, the street of Coletti's birth house Coletti's parents, Venanzio Coletti and Angela Viti, were of modest means and education. The Colettis had eight children: Rosa, Filippo, Andrea, Alessandro, Temistocle, Domenico and two other daughters. The family lived in the town center, on the corner of Via Maggiore and Vicolo Cellacchio. With Filippo Coletti's singing fees which were administered by his father Venanzio, the family moved into a large property outside Anagni in 1843. Venanzio continued to invest in land and buildings. Upon the death of Venanzio, the administration was taken over by Coletti's brother Andrea. The Coletti estate exists today as a winery, Coletti- Conti.website of the Coletti Conti family estate Coletti's younger brother Domenico was an opera singer who moved to the United States and lived in New York. In 1845 the 33-year-old Coletti married the seventeen-year-old Maria, daughter of Anagni's town clerk (Segretario comunale) Giovanni Ambrosi. The marriage was arranged by Coletti's father Venanzio, and proved to be a happy one. Filippo and Maria had four children: Tito, Decio, Lavinia and Valeria. Coletti with wife and daughters  Early career 1834–1840  Coletti started his musical education in Rome, then moved to the Naples Real Collegio di Musica, where he studied with the tenor Alessandro Busti, a pupil of the castrato Girolamo Crescenti.Giampiero Raspa, Note biografiche sul baritono anagnino Filippo Coletti (1811–1894), in Scritti in memoria di Giuseppe Marchetti Longhi, vol. II, pp. 483ff., Istituto di Storia e di Arte del Lazio Meridionale, 1990. In Italian. Busti dedicated to Coletti a Studio di canto per baritono (published 1874). Coletti débuted at the Teatro del Fondo (1834) as Prosdocimo in Rossini's Il turco in Italia. His performance was considered a great success by the court and launched his career. Teatro San Carlo Naples Coletti transferred to the neighboring Teatro San Carlo, where he sang coloratura and bel canto roles in Vincenzo Bellini's La straniera (Valdeburgo), Rossini's Mosè in Egitto, Maometto II and Semiramide (Assur), as well as Giuseppe Curci's cantata Ruggiero, in January 1835.Mentioned as a talented young singer by the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, Band 37, July p. 503 Later that year Coletti created his first of many roles in a Giovanni Pacini opera – Briano/Wilfredo in Ivanhoe. Beyond Naples, Coletti appeared in the Carlo Felice in Genoa in the 1835–1836 season, sang in Donizetti's Gemma di Vergy at the Teatro Valle in Rome, and in Bellini's I puritani in Padova (1836).Giampiero Raspa, Note biografiche sul baritono anagnino Filippo Coletti (1811–1894), in Scritti in memoria di Giuseppe Marchetti Longhi, vol. II, pp. 483ff., Istituto di Storia e di Arte del Lazio Meridionale, 1990. In Italian. A four-year engagement at the Real Teatro de São Carlos in Lisbon (1837–40) included the first Lisbon production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, operas by the Ricci brothers, Saverio Mercadante, Giuseppe Persiani and Ferdinand Hérold as well as the title roles of Donizetti's Torquato Tasso (January 1837) and Marin Faliero, Prospero Salsapariglia in Donizetti's Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali and the role of Visconti in Bellini's Beatrice di Tenda. During his time in Lisbon Coletti appeared in a new role almost every week. By the time he left Lisbon, after singing a last Belcore in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore in November 1840, Coletti had covered most of the bel-canto baritone repertoire of Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti.Giampiero Raspa, Note biografiche sul baritono anagnino Filippo Coletti (1811–1894), in Scritti in memoria di Giuseppe Marchetti Longhi, vol.

London riot of 1840  Pierre Laporte, the impresario of Her Majesty's Theatre in London, engaged the talented but unknown Coletti as replacement for the public's idol, the baritone Antonio Tamburini, (1800–1876). Laporte hoped to get rid of the expensive Tamburini, thinking Coletti his equal and casting him in I puritani. But as talented as was Coletti, he was not a member of the 'old guard', and the diva Giulia Grisi and others instigated a riot.Jennifer Hall-Witt, Fashionable Acts: Opera and Elite Culture in London, 1780–1880 (Becoming Modern: New Nineteenth-Century Studies), University Press of New England (2007) , pp. 208, 210–211 > The opera passed off in perfect quiet; and, indeed, was received with the > usual applause, of which Coletti, who has been substituted for Tamburini, > received a very considerable share – an indication, no doubt, on the part of > the intended insurgents, that there was no personal feeling against this > excellent performer.

H. Barham describes the riot in A row in an omnibus (i.e. 'theatre box'): A legend of the Haymarket (from Barham's Ingoldsby Legends): > 'Though Fiddle-de-dee (i.e. Tamburini) sings loud and clear, And his tones > are sweet, yet his terms are dear!

After creating the title role of Pacini's Duca d'Alba in Teatro La Fenice (1842) in Venice, Coletti moved to Naples, where he would remain till 1846 as San Carlo's leading baritone.Giampiero Raspa, Note biografiche sul baritono anagnino Filippo Coletti (1811–1894), in Scritti in memoria di Giuseppe Marchetti Longhi, vol. II, pp. 483ff., Istituto di Storia e di Arte del Lazio Meridionale, 1990. In Italian. In Naples Giovanni Pacini wrote the role of Piero Zampardi in his opera Fidanzata Corsa (1842) for Coletti; the opera and Coletti's performance proved a hugh success.Gazzetta musicale di Milano, 26 December 1842, p. 226). Coletti created Lusignano in Gaetano Donizetti's Caterina Cornaro (1844). The opera suffered a disastrous opening night, and Donizetti blamed the cast and Coletti for the failure.Candida Syndikus and Sabine Rogge (eds), Caterina Cornaro: Last Queen of Cyprus and Daughter of Venice / Ultima regina di Cipro e figlia di Venezia. Proceedings of the International Conference, Venice, 16–18 September 2010, Münster: Waxmann, 2013, pp. 219–222 The relationship between the two was repaired a few months later, when Donizetti returned to Naples to mount Maria di Rohan.Program notes to Maria di Rohan, Teatro La Fenice In 1845 Coletti created Gusmano in Verdi's Alzira. The tenor Gaetano Fraschini, who sang frequently with Coletti, created the role of Zamoro. Eugenia Tadolini sang the role of Alzira. Verdi had insisted on Coletti's participation by contract, and proved faithful to Coletti for many years to come. Coletti was also Verdi's first choice for the opera Una vendetta in domino intended for Naples and never written.Julian Budden, Verdi Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 79 Coletti sang the 1846 first performance of Verdi's I due Foscari in Paris, and in the season 1847–48 sang the title role of Mozart's Don Giovanni, and in the Rossini's operas La gazza ladra and La donna del lago. Vienna, Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, and Cologne followed.Giampiero Raspa, Note biografiche sul baritono Anagnino Filippo Coletti (1811–1894)  Second London period 1847–1851 and I masnadieri  Benjamin Lumley Following star-baritone Tamburini's defection to Covent Garden, Coletti returned to Her Majesty's Theatre, hired by Laporte's successor, Benjamin Lumley. Lumley chose Verdi's Nabucco \\"in order to introduce Coletti, who appeared in the part of the maddened king (previously so effectively sustained by Fornasari), and was welcomed with enthusiasm.\\"Benjamin Lumley, Memoires of the Opera p. 172 Benjamin Lumley was determained to procure the best artists for his theatre.Zicari, M.

For Coletti the role creation of Francesco in Verdi's I masnadieri, conducted by Verdi himself, was a personal success: \\"Coletti's reception by the public on Saturday night had added another laurel to Mr. Lumley's brow, and has given the public increased confidence in all the promises set forth in his so fiercely catechized prospectus.

Apollo, 1854) and I vespri siciliani (T. Argentina, 1856). He also created the role of Hamlet in Luigi Moroni's Amleto (1860). In Venice La Fenice Coletti sang in Lucia di Lammermoor, Verdi's I due Foscari and Stiffelio (1852) (which he sang in La Scala as well, in 1851). In 1854 Verdi transposed down the part of Germont in La traviata for him.Article with numerous examples of the two versions of Germont's lines: Julian Budden, The Two Traviatas, Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association, Vol. 99, (1972–1973), Taylor & Francis pp. 43–66 This version, as performed at the Venice Teatro Gallo, (Teatro San Benedetto) became definitive: The Gazzetta Musicale di Milano maintained that Coletti, in this revival of La Traviata, \\"had made one know the character of Germont for the first time truly, that Coletti would then proceed to interpret innumerable times in all theatres of Italy\\"cit. da Gazz. mus. di Milano, XII [1854], p. 158. Quoted in: Coletti, Filippo, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 26, pp.734–736, Rome 1982: In 1857 Coletti created the title role of Saverio Mercadante's Pelagio at the Teatro S Carlo, Naples (1857). Verdi was considering Coletti as the title role in his opera Re Lear for Naples, (which he never wrote).Gary Schmidgall, \\"Verdi's King Lear Project\\", 19th-Century Music, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Autumn, 1985), University of California Press, p. 99 In a letter from that period regarding a revival of Simon Boccanegra, Verdi writes: > \\"If you really intend to mount Boccanegra, an ideal cast would be Coletti, > Fraschini and Penco as well as a Basso profundo, which one would still need > to find.

Retirement from the stage  In the season 1861–1862 Coletti, no longer first choice in Italy, found work in the Teatro Real, Madrid, singing in Donizetti and Verdi operas as well as Achille Peri's Giuditta.Turina Gómez, Joaquín, Historia del Teatro Real, 1997, Alianza Editorial,, pp. 540 In Naples he created his last new role – Appio Claudio in Errico Petrella's Virginia; But Coletti's voice had deteriorated to the extent that he was forced into retirement. After a few years of teaching and living alternately between Rome and Anagni, Coletti wrote Verdi in 1866 asking for help. Verdi responded with warmth and delicacy, but could not help him. Coletti attempted a brief comeback in 1867, singing the bass role of Mefistofeles in Gounod's Faust in Palermo, earning applause and a polite review. Another bass role Coletti sang that year was Filippo II in Verdi's Don Carlo in Turin. Always a beloved artist in San Carlo in Naples, Coletti was rehired for the 1868–69 season, but after a \\"tempestuous performance of the opening opera of the season, Jone by E. Petrella on October 28, he dissolved the contract and retired for good\\". Coletti moved to Rome, then to his hometown Anagni. In his later years Coletti became involved with Anagni civic duties, as well as teaching – (Édouard de Reszke was one of his pupils)Herman Klein, Edouard De Rezske, Musical Times, 1 July 1917, p. 301 and writing. Coletti published an Album Melodico of songsFilippo Coletti, Album melodico : per Canto con accomp.to di Pianoforte / Musica dell'Artista Filippo Coletti, containing the following titles: N.1.

Nothing much is known of his last years in Anagni. Coletti was working on a 'method of singing', which remained unfinished at his death. His manuscript breaks off at the point where he writes: \\"I cease writing musical notes because my sight, weakened by my old age, is becoming ever more obscured, hence I need to suspend my work, with the intention of continuing it and completing it if the good Lord wants to keep me living for a bit longer\\". Coletti died in 1894. In his obituary, The Musical Times of 1 August 1894 said of Coletti: \\"he is also memorable as the sole performer in whom Carlyle saw any merit on his famous visit to the opera\\".The Musical Times, Vol. 35, No. 618 (1 August 1894), p. 554  Critical appreciation  Philosopher and writer Thomas Carlyle: \\"One singer in particular, called Coletti or some such name, seemed to me, by the cast of his face, by the tones of his voice, by his general bearing, so far as I could read it, to be a man of deep and ardent sensibilities, of delicate intuitions, just sympathies; originally an almost poetic soul, or man of genius, as we term it;\\" Italian opera composer Giovanni Pacini, from his Memoires: \\"The celebrated Coletti in the role I entrusted him was not able to be surpassed by any other artist. Even Paris, when my fortunate work was presented at the Theatre Italienne, proclaimed Coletti 'The Greatest', 'unreachable'.\\"Giovanni Pacini,Memorie artistiche, Firenze, Guidi, 1865, p. 100 From the nineteenth- century British music journal Musical WorldMusical World, p. 150, Saturday February 27, 1847: \\"The faults we have to lay to his charge – for which of us is without them? – are a want of colour in his expression, a monotony in the form of his cadences, and a method of reaching the high notes, which belongs to a bad school of singing.\\" Lexicographer Francesco RegliFrancesco Regli writes: \\"One observes with great astonishment the ease with which he executed the most difficult of roles, dramatic as well as those of agility, the extraordinary extension of his voice and the colour that is so indispensable in the various characters in the music.\\" { +Portraits of the three baritone rivals, by Josef Kriehuber  Giorgio Ronconi  Filippo Coletti  Antonio Tamburini II }  Roles created  Composer Giovanni Pacini – Coletti created 6 roles in Pacini's operas * 1835 Briano/Wilfrido Giovanni Pacini Ivanhoe Teatro San Carlo, Naples * 1836 Rodolfo/Alì Pascia Tommaso Genoves (Spanish composer Tomás Genovés y Lapetra) La battaglia di Lepanto, Teatro Valle, Rome * 1841 Edmondo Otto Nicolai Il Proscritto, La Scala, Milan * 1841 Cantareno Carlo Emery Coen (the artistic name of composer Henry Cohen) Antonio Foscarini, Teatro del Comune, Bologna * 1842 Piero Zampardi Giovanni Pacini La fidanzata corsa Teatro San Carlo, Naples * 1842 Egbert Alessandro Curmi Elodia di Herstall 26 September 1842 with Eugenia Tadolini as Elodia * 1842 Duca d'Alba Giovanni Pacini Duca d'Alba Teatro La Fenice, Venice * 1844 Lusignano Gaetano Donizetti Caterina Cornaro Teatro San Carlo, Naples * 1844 Pietro Candiano IV Giovanni Battista Ferrari Candiano quarto Teatro Gallo San Benedetto, VeniceLibretto online * 1844 Francesco Sforza Vincenzo Battista (Italian composer 1823–1873) Margherita d'Aragona Teatro San Carlo, Naples(with Fanny Goldberg as Margherita) * 1845 Gusmano Giuseppe Verdi Alzira Teatro San Carlo, Naples * 1845 Rodrigo Saverio Mercadante Il Vascello de Gama, Teatro San Carlo, NaplesCopy of Libretto online * 1845 Gianni di Capua, Giovanni Pacini Stella di Napoli, Teatro San Carlo, Naples * 1847 Francesco Giuseppe Verdi I masnadieri Haymarket Theatre, London * 1850 Ferdinand Halévy La tempesta (The Tempest) Haymarket Theatre, London * 1851 Ivon Michael William Balfe I quattro fratelli Haymarket Theatre, London * 1851 Manuzza Sigismond Thalberg Florinda Haymarket Theatre, London * 1851 Morillo Gualtiero Sanelli (It. comp. and tenor Ferdinando Sanelli 1816–1861) Tradito!

He is the founder and director of Studio 8 Architects, a UK-based multidisciplinary and international practice in sustainable urban planning, architecture and landscape, focusing on interpretations of social, cultural and environmental programmes. Along with Simon Dickens and Bernd Felsinger (2006-2016), Lim leads PG Unit 10 within The Bartlett School of Architecture's Architecture MArch (ARB/RIBA Part 2) course. Lim's research of cities is developed through a new urban paradigm – the 'Smartcity'. The work addresses what the spatial and phenomenological implications are when sustainable design is applied to a city and the role that citizens play in the production of a relevant social space. A central component of the Smartcity is the establishment of an ecological symbiosis between nature and built form to create diverse forms of resilient landscapes and urbanism including and beyond urban agriculture. Lim has held a long preoccupation with architectural storytelling, exploring how narratives from science fiction, history, politics and humanity can inform spatial propositions and the innovation of architecture and resilient cities through his research and publications including ‘Once Upon A China’ (2021), ‘Short Stories: London in two-and-a-half dimensions’ (2011), ‘Virtually Venice’ (2006), and ‘Sins + Other Spatial Relatives’ (2000). The Royal Institute of British Architects has awarded Lim the President's Medals International Teaching Awards for contribution to architectural education on four occasions (1999, 1998, 1998, 1997). In 2006, the Royal Academy of Arts London awarded him the Grand 'AJ/Bovis Lend Lease' Architecture Prize. He also won the Worshipful Company of Chartered Architects Award in 2006 and 2007.

It is traditionally served as a Christmas dessert, but it's also enjoyed year round. Parrozzo is officially designated as a traditional food product of Abruzzo.  Origins  Parrozo was invented in 1920 by Luigi D'Amico, a bakery owner in Pescara. D'Amico wanted to create a cake that resembled the traditional rough bread made by local farmers with corn flour. Parrozzo has the same round shape as the bread, contains eggs to mimic the yellow of the corn, and is covered with a layer of dark chocolate reminiscent of the burnt surface of the bread. The first person to try parrozzo was the poet Gabriele D'Annunzio. Afterwards, he composed a madrigal called \\"La Canzone del Parrozzo\\" (The Song of Parrozzo), written in Abruzzese dialect: > \\"È tante ‘bbone stu parrozze nove che pare na pazzie de San Ciattè, c’avesse > messe a su gran forne tè la terre lavorata da lu bbove, la terre grasse e > lustre che se coce… e che dovente a poche a poche chiù doce de qualunque > cosa doce…”  Ingredients and preparation  The dough of parrozzo is made of semolina (alternatively yellow or white flour with corn starch), sugar, eggs, ground almonds, almond extract, and orange or lemon zest. All ingredients are mixed and baked in a round aluminum tray. When the cake has cooled, it is removed from the tray and covered with molten dark chocolate.

It was first synthesized by Curtius and Gloebel in 1888 and was the first compound containing a peptide bond to be studied by X-ray crystallography in 1938. It occurs in cocoa and bread and has a metallic and bitter taste. 2,5-Diketopiperazines (2,5-DKPs) which include mono- and disubstituted 2,5-diketopiperazines, their annulated, spiro-annulated and bridged derivatives are amongst the most ubiquitous peptide derivatives found in nature. They are found in fermentation broths and yeast cultures and this subunit is often found alone or embedded in larger more complex architectures in a variety of natural products isolated from fungi, bacteria, plants, and mammals, and their core structure occurs in several drugs. In addition, they are often produced as degradation products of polypeptides, especially in processed food and beverages, and have been identified in the contents of comets.  Occurrence as natural products There is a widespread occurrence of the 2,5-diketopiperazine core in biologically active natural products. The most structurally diverse 2,5-diketopiperazine natural products are based on tryptophan and proline modified by heterocyclisation and isoprenyl addition. These range from the hepatoxic brevianamide F (cyclo(L-Trp-L-Pro)) to the annulated tremorogenic verruculogen and the spiro-annulated spirotryprostatin B which represent a promising class of antimitotic arrest agents, to the structurally complex (+)-stephacidin A, a bridged 2,5-diketopiperazine that possess a unique bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane core ring system and is active against the human colon HCT-116 cell line.

The unsaturated derivatives are illustrated by phenylahistin the anti-cancer microtubule binding agent, and the mycotoxin roquefortine C found in blue cheeses. File:Bicyclomycin.svgBicyclomycin File:Gliotoxin.svgGliotoxin File:Phenylahistin.svgPhenylahistin File:Structure of Roquefortine C.svgRoquefortine C  Occurrence in foods and beverages 2,5-Diketopiperazines are often formed during chemical and thermal processing of food and beverages as the degradation products of polypeptides. They have been detected in stewed beef, beer, bread, Awamori spirits, cocoa, chicken essence, roasted coffee, Comte cheese, dried squid, aged saki and yeast extract. In food systems, 2,5-diketopiperazines have been shown to be important sensory compounds contributing to the taste of the final products and being perceived as astringent, salty, grainy, metallic or bitter. Although these range from proline, aromatic, aliphatic to polar 2,5-diketopiperazines, the proline 2,5-diketopiperazines are the most abundant and structurally diverse 2,5-diketopiperazines found in food. The valine derivative cyclo(L-Val-L-Pro) at a concentration of 1742 ppm, was identified as the most important bitter 2,5-diketopiperazine contributing to the bitter taste of roasted cocoa. It has also been found as one of the major 2,5-diketopiperazines in autolyzed yeast extract and stewed beef and is also present in chicken essence and coffee. It has also been isolated from a variety of marine microorganisms and has been identified as an active LasI quorum-sensing signal molecule important for the plant growth promotion by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most studied of all the simple 2,5-diketopiperazines is the histidyl-proline 2,5-diketopiperazine cyclo(L-His-L-Pro) which is found in a variety of foods, with particularly high concentrations in fish and fish products. It is well absorbed orally, and crosses the blood–brain barrier via a non-saturable mechanism. It also occurs in humans as a metabolite from the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and exhibits a wide variety of central nervous system, endocrine, electrophysiological, and cardiovascular effects. Derivatives of cyclo(L-His- L-Pro) have been studied extensively to develop therapeutic agents for neurodegeneration.  Structure and conformation  The 2,5-diketopiperazines (2,5-DKPs) are the smallest possible cyclic peptides, which are peptidomimetic in nature and bear resemblance with a constrained protein beta turn. These cyclic dipeptides incorporate both donor and acceptor groups for hydrogen bonding and are small, conformationally constrained heterocyclic scaffolds in which diversity can be introduced at up to six positions and stereochemistry controlled at up to four positions, and they are stable to proteolysis. These characteristics enable them to bind to a wide range of receptors which result in a widespread class of biologically active natural compounds. They have a rigid backbone, which can mimic a preferential peptide conformation and contain constrained amino acids embedded within their structures without the unwanted physical and metabolite properties of peptides. This improves their bioavailability and resistance to enzymatic degradation in comparison to their linear analogues. Boat & Planar conformation of 2,5 diketopiperazinesEpimerization of Cis and Trans isomers of 2,5-dketopiperazines These conformationally constrained heterocycles are flexible because the six-membered ring can exist in an essentially flat conformation 1 or a slightly puckered boat form 2, with only a few kcal/mol difference in energy between the boat and planar forms. In addition, the 2,5-DKPs can be configured as both cis and trans isomers. As a consequence of their predominant biosynthetic origin from L-α-amino acids most naturally occurring 2,5-DKPs are cis configured as the cyclo(L-Xaa-L-Yaa) isomers. However, 2,5-DKPs epimerize under basic, acidic and thermal conditions. The composition of the cis and trans isomers in the equilibrium state varies widely depending on the bulk of the side chains, if a ring (e.g. proline) is present, or if the nitrogen atoms are alkylated . Although epimerization was historically an issue in the synthesis of 2,5-DKPs, several mild methods have been developed recently that avoid epimerization.  Synthesis  In the synthesis of 2,5-diketopiperazines there are essentially three methods of ring closure: amide bond formation, N-alkylation and C-acylation. Methods of bond formation in ring closure synthesis of 2,5-DKPs = Amide bond formation = The most commonly used synthesis of 2,5-diketopiperazines 3 is amide bond formation by cyclisation of dipeptide 1 or 2. These dipeptides can be formed by coupling two amino acids together by the many methods of peptide synthesis or by using the Ugi reaction of an isonitrile, amino acid, aldehyde and amine, followed by deprotection. Dipeptides substituted with an amine at one terminus and an ester at the other 1 can spontaneously cyclize to form a 2,5-diketopiperazine at a range of pHs. However, careful selection of reaction conditions is required to limit racemization. This has been achieved in a general, efficient, and environmentally benign solution-phase synthesis of 2,5-diketopiperazines using microwave-assisted heating in water, which in contrast to other published methods is independent of the amino acid sequence, and no epimerization was seen.Amide bond formation of 2,5-DKPs via dipeptide cyclization from peptide synthesis and Ugi reaction The Ugi reaction using an isonitrile, amino acid, aldehyde and amine, can produce a dipeptide in equally high yield and optical purity, to that formed by standard peptide couplings. Commonly, an isonitrile is chosen to give a labile terminal amide to enable cyclization. For example, the direct 2,5-DKP ring formation via such an activated leaving group using the stable, easily accessible and versatile convertible isonitrile 1-isocyano-2-(2,2-dimethoxyethyl)-benzene 4 gave a one- pot synthesis of N-substituted 2,5-diketopiperazine's 7. One-pot synthesis of N-substituted 2,5-DKPs via indolamide The mild acidic and chemoselective post Ugi activation of 5 involving simultaneous indolamide formation and tert- butoxycarbonyl (Boc) removal gives the active amide 6 which allows cyclization to 7 without affecting other peptidic or even ester moieties and with stereochemical retention of the chiral centers. = N-Alkylation = Intramolecular amide N-alkylation of alpha-haloacetamide amides 8 with ethanolic potassium hydroxide using ultrasonication gave the 2,5-diketopiperazines 9, where 8 was obtained by an Ugi reaction between amines, aldehydes, isocyanides, and chloroacetic acid. However this route is limited by epimerization at the stereogenic centre and failure to obtain the 2,5-diketopiperazine ring if R1 = Alkyl.Synthesis of 2,5-DKPs via N-Alkylation. = C-Acylation = Formation of the 2,5-diketopiperazine ring by enolate acylation was used in the construction of the 2,5-diketopiperazine ring in 11 by intramolecular cyclization of the enolate of 10 onto the carbonyl of the phenyl carbamate to give 11 in 90% yield.Synthesis of 2,5-DKPs via intramolecular enolate acylation Reactions =Reactivity at carbon (C-3 and C-6)= Regio- and sterocontrolled C-functionalization of 2,5-diketopiperazines at C-3 and C-6 involve enolate, radical and cationic precursors (and N-acyliminium ion) and are sensitive to polar and steric effects. Alkylation of enolates Alkylation of the bis- paramethoxybenzyl (pMB) protected 2,5-DKP 1 using the base LHMDS and an alkyl bromide R1Br, gave the mono-alkylated derivative 2, which on further alkylation gave the symmetrical trans-disubstituted derivative 3 Enolate akylation at C-3 and C-6 Halogenation and displacement The 3-monobromides 6 and the 3,6-dibromides 5 are prepared from the benzyl protected 2,5-DKP 4 by radical halogenation with N-bromosuccinimide in carbon tetrachloride. Displacement of these labile bromides readily occurs with a range of nucleophiles SR, OR, NR2, alkyl and aryl to give 7 .Bromination of 2,5-Diketopiperazines followed by Nucleophilic displacement Aldol addition A one- or two-fold aldol condensation of N-acetylated 2,5-DKP 8 gives access to 3-dehydro-2,5-diketopiperazines 9 and 3,6-didehydro-2,5-diketopiperazines 10 and the condensation of 8 can controlled in a stepwise fashion using triethylamine in dimethylformamide to give the unsymmetrical 3,6-didehydro-2,5-diketopiperazines 10 (R1 = Ar1, R2 = Ar2). Aldol condensation with 2,5-Diketopiperazines =Reactivity at nitrogen= Alkylation The most common method for alkylation of the lactam nitrogen of 2,5-diketopiperazines is based on the use of sodium hydride as base. However epimerisation can occur especially with proline-fused 2,5-diketopiperazines, even with milder methods such as under phase-transfer catalyst conditions for example 1 to 2. N-Alkylation of 2,5-Diketopiperazines and epimerisation =Reactivity at carbonyl carbons (C-2 and C-5)= Reduction  Reduction of the carbonyl groups of chiral 2,5-diketopiperazine with lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) cleanly gives the corresponding chiral piperazines. For example, cyclo(L-Phe-L-Phe) 1 gives the chiral piperazine (2S,5S)-dibenzylpiperazine 2. Reduction of the carbonyl groups of 2,5-DKPs  Dihydropyrazine and pyrazine synthesis Reaction of the lactam-derived enol phosphates 4 of 2,5-diketopiperazines with palladium catalyzed reactions (reduction, Suzuki and Stille cross-coupling reactions) enables the synthesis of a range of functionalised 1,4-dihydropyrazines 5 which can be aromatized to 1,4-pyrazines 6 in the presence of acid. Synthesis of dihydropyrazines and pyrazines from 2,5-diketopiperazines via enol phosphates Applications =Therapeutics= There are numerous bioactive molecules containing the 2,5-DKP core template in the literature arising from natural products and available from combinatorial libraries. These small, conformationally rigid, chiral templates have multiple H-bond acceptor and donor functionality and have multiple sites for structural elaboration of diverse functional groups with defined stereochemistry. These characteristics not only enable them to bind with high affinity to a large variety of receptors, showing a broad range of biological activities, but also allow the development of the drug-like physicochemical properties required for the multiobjective optimization process of transforming a lead to a drug product. The structure–activity relationship (SAR) has been explored for many of these 2,5-DKP templates, and several have been developed into clinical drugs. These include tadalafil (a PDE5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction), retosiban (an oxytocin antagonist for preterm labor), aplaviroc (a CCR5 antagonists for HIV), epelsiban (an oxytocin antagonist for premature ejaculation) and the experimental cancer drug plinabulin (NPI-2358/KPU-2) that is active in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cell lines.

This approach is useful for the production of unnatural amino acids with stereochemical control. The diketopiperazine skeleton protects both the N and O termini of the glycine. For this application, the diketopiperazine is O-alkylated with concomitant N-deprotonation to give what is called the Schöllkopf reagent.

The water taxi departs from Dobbins Landing in downtown Erie and travels to the Waterworks in Presque Isle State Park, with a stopover at Liberty Park.  History  In 1997, the Waterworks Ferry Dock in Presque Isle State Park received a $1.1 million renovation and dredging to reverse decades of deterioration. Water taxi service between the Waterworks and downtown Erie began on June 7, 1997 with the introduction of the Presque Isle Express--a , 36-passenger pontoon boat. The Presque Isle Express ran for two years until the Erie–Western Pennsylvania Port Authority purchased two ferry boats in 1999. The Port Authority was appropriated $800,000 from the federal government by the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) for the acquisition. The service was originally expected to have three stops along the Erie bayfront and two on Presque Isle. The twin , fiberglass boats were named Aquabus I and Aquabus II; a third vessel was procured in 2001 and christened the Canadian Sailor. Though similar to the Aquabuses, the Canadian Sailor has a capacity of 42 passengers, an enclosed seating area, and the ability to travel out of the sheltered confines of Presque Isle Bay and into Lake Erie. The Canadian Sailor made trips from Erie to Barcelona, New York in 2002 and was part of a proposal to operate a ferry route between Erie and Canada. In 2011, the Canadian Sailor was the subject of a short-term lease to Buffalo Sailing Adventures to trial a ferry service in Buffalo, New York.  Current operations  The Presque Isle Water Taxi departs from Dobbins Landing, at the end of State Street, on the hour. The water taxi stops in Liberty Park before reaching its final destination of Presque Isle State Park--total time for a roundtrip takes 50 minutes. It usually makes eight trips a day, seven days a week during the summer months with weather permitting as the water taxi does not run in rain and windy conditions.

Literature Morrow's first book Hollow: An Unpolished Tale was released April 21, 2010. In Hollow, she recounts her three-decade long battle with an eating disorder and her coping mechanisms. A central theme of the memoir is her positive relationship with Christianity in relation to her eating disorder and body image issues. Her second book Hope for the Hollow: A Thirty-Day Inside-Out Makeover for Women Recovering from Eating Disorders was released three years later on June 28, 2013. Hope for the Hollow is a collection of thirty Christian devotionals used to battle eating disordered behaviors. Morrow has also published two collections of Christian devotional poetry, titled Verses from a Yielded Vessel and Reflections of Grace. She has been quoted at length in June Hunt's book How to Defeat Harmful Habits: Freedom from Six Addictive Behaviors. Hunt's book looks at overeating, alcohol and drug abuse, sexual addiction, codependency, anorexia, and bulimia and more from a Christian counseling perspective. In other media Morrow also is a popular commentator on eating disordered topics, writing op-ed pieces for magazines and blogs and giving interviews on the radio. She travels the United States speaking to groups about eating disorders and how detrimental they are in people's lives. Personal life Morrow attended North Central College in Naperville, Illinois.

Observations recorded with iNaturalist provide valuable open data to scientific research projects, conservation agencies, other organizations, and the public. The project has been called \\"a standard- bearer for natural history mobile applications.\\" History iNaturalist.org began in 2008 as a UC Berkeley School of Information Master's final project of Nate Agrin, Jessica Kline, and Ken-ichi Ueda. Nate Agrin and Ken-ichi Ueda continued work on the site with Sean McGregor, a web developer. In 2011, Ueda began collaboration with Scott Loarie, a research fellow at Stanford University and lecturer at UC Berkeley. Ueda and Loarie are the current co- directors of iNaturalist.org. The organization merged with the California Academy of Sciences on April 24, 2014. In 2014, iNaturalist celebrated its one millionth observation. In 2017, iNaturalist became a joint initiative between the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society. Observations The iNaturalist platform is based on crowdsourcing of observations and identifications. An iNaturalist observation records an encounter with an individual organism at a particular time and place. In addition to recording actual audio and photos of the organism, an iNaturalist observation may also record evidence of an organism, such as animal tracks, nests, and scat. However, the scope of iNaturalist excludes natural but inert subjects such as geologic or hydrologic features. Users typically upload photos as evidence of their findings, though audio recordings are also accepted and such evidence is not a strict requirement. Users may share observation locations publicly, \\"obscure\\" them to display a less precise location, or make the locations private. On iNaturalist, other users add identifications to each other's observations in order to confirm or improve the \\"community identification.\\" Observations are classified as \\"casual,\\" \\"needs ID\\" (needs identification), or \\"research grade\\" based on the quality of the data provided and the community identification process. \\"Research grade\\" observations are incorporated into other online databases such as The Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Users have the option to license their observations, photos, and audio recordings in several ways, including for the public domain, Creative Commons, or with all rights reserved. Platforms app Users can interact with iNaturalist in several ways: * through the iNaturalist.org website, * through two mobile apps: iNaturalist (for iOS/Android) and Seek (for iOS/Android), or * through partner organizations such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility website. On the iNaturalist.org website, visitors can search the public data set and interact with the individuals adding observations and identifications. The website provides tools for registered users to discuss and confirm organism identifications. Users can also create project pages to recruit participation in and coordinate work on their topics of interest. On the primary iNaturalist mobile app, registered users can contribute nature observations to the public, online dataset. Seek, which was designed for children and families, requires no online account registration and all observations may remain private. Seek incorporates features of gamification, such as providing a list of nearby organisms to find and encouraging the collection of badges by doing so. Seek was initially released in the spring of 2018. Both apps are free software released under the MIT license. Automated species identification is included in both apps. Automated species identification In addition to observations being identified by others in the community, iNaturalist includes an automated species identification computer vision tool. Images can be identified via an artificial intelligence model which has been trained on the large database of the \\"research grade\\" observations on iNaturalist. A broader taxon such as a genus or family is typically provided if the model cannot decide what the species is. If the image has poor lighting, is blurry, or contains multiple subjects, it can be difficult for the model to determine the species and it may decide incorrectly. Multiple species suggestions are typically provided; the suggestion that the software believes to be most likely is at the top of the list. Participation , iNaturalist users contributed over 56,400,000 observations of plants, animals, and other organisms worldwide, with around 265,000 users active in the previous 30 days. iNaturalist is the preferred application for crowd-sourced biodiversity data in Mexico and southern Africa. Users have created and contributed to thousands of different projects on iNaturalist. The platform is commonly used to record observations during bioblitzes, which are biological surveying events that attempt to record all the species that occur within a designated area, and a specific project type on iNaturalist. Other project types include collections of observations by location or taxon, or documenting specific types of observations such as animal tracks and signs, the spread of invasive species, roadkill, fishing catches, or discovering new species. In 2011, iNaturalist was used as a platform to power the Global Amphibian and Global Reptile BioBlitzes, in which observations were used to help monitor the occurrence and distribution of the world's reptiles and amphibian species. The US National Park Service partnered with iNaturalist to record observations from the 2016 National Parks BioBlitz. That project exceeded 100,000 observations in August 2016. In 2017, the United Nations Environment Programme teamed up with iNaturalist to celebrate World Environment Day. =City Nature Challenge= In 2016, Lila Higgins from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and Alison Young from the California Academy of Sciences co-founded the City Nature Challenge. In the first City Nature Challenge, naturalists in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area documented over 20,000 observations with the iNaturalist platform. In 2017, the challenge expanded to 16 cities across the United States and collected over 125,000 observations of wildlife in 5 days. The challenge expanded to a global audience in 2018, with 68 cities participating from 19 countries, with some cities using community science platforms other than iNaturalist to participate. In 4 days, over 17,000 people cataloged over 440,000 nature observations in urban regions around the world. In 2019, the challenge once again expanded. This time 159 cities were involved, and 35,126 participants were engaged in collecting 963,773 observations of over 31,000 species. Although fewer observations were documented during the 2020 City Nature Challenge, more cities and people participated and more species were found than in previous years.

Gaviña & Sons Inc) is a coffee importer and roaster located in Vernon, California. It produces the Gaviña and La Llave espresso brands, as well as private label (own brand) coffees.  History The company was founded by brothers José María and Ramón Gaviña, who emigrated from Spain to Cuba in 1870 and operated their own coffee plantation in the city of Trinidad. In the 1930s, the company's business expanded to include coffee roasting as well as coffee growing. In 1959, the family left Cuba, establishing F. Gaviña & Sons Inc in Vernon eight years later. Initially, the company focused on roasting Cuban-style coffee, but later expanded into coffees for other ethnic markets, including blends to appeal to Middle Eastern and Vietnamese palates.  Operation and brands  By 2002, Gaviña's whole- bean coffee was the top-selling brand in Los Angeles grocery stores, with its ground coffee ranked third behind Folgers and Maxwell House and the company decided to expand supermarket supplies to other regions of the US. Gaviña had begun selling its coffee to a small group of McDonald's restaurants in Southern California in 1983 and, in 2005, it created a stronger blend that resulted in double-digit growth in coffee sales through the fast-food outlets. It was one of three U.S. suppliers subsequently chosen to produce espresso for the McCafe program. By 2010, Gaviña was roasting about 40 million pounds of coffee per year and was a $114m business, with a fifth of revenue from making and packaging private label coffees for McDonald's, 7-Eleven and Costco stores, according to the Los Angeles Times. The company, which remains family owned, still produces roasts for different ethnic markets, as well as supplying supermarkets, such as Ralphs, Walmart and Safeway. It sells coffee in 20 states and its range includes the Don Francisco and La Llave brands.
