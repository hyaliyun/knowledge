Baseball Hall of Fame member Rube Foster played for the Hot Springs Arlingtons in 1901.  History  The Hot Springs Arlingtons were so named due to being sponsored by Alfred Holden, who was the headwaiter of the Arlington Hotel in Hot Springs. The Arkansas Gazette, 6/10/1896, p.2 The Hot Springs Arlingtons began play in 1896 as a professional Negro team. The Arlingtons played at Whittington Park and drew white and black fans to their games. Their main competition was the Little Rock Quapaws.\\"Notes on the Game\\", David Wyatt, Freeman (Indianapolis), 2/5/1910 In 1897, the Hot Springs Arlingtons began play in a formation of a southern Negro league, which featured Hot Springs, the Little Rock Quapaws, Memphis Cliffords, Pensacola Acmes, Birmingham Unions and a Montgomery, Alabama team. The Little Rock Quapaws traveled to games in Hot Springs in a wagon. The 1897 Hot Springs Arlingtons played integrated exhibition games against the Little Rock Senators and the Hot Springs teams, both members of the Arkansas State League.The Tennesean (Nashville), 5/12/1897, p.6Daily Arkansas Gazette (Little Rock, Arkansas), 9/05/1897, p.2-3. The Arlingtons continued play though 1903. The last documented games played by the Arlingtons were in May, 1903. In June, 1903 a streetcar boycott occurred when legislation requiring black Arkansans to sit in the back of public streetcars was implemented. As Whittington Park was located at the end of Hot Springs' streetcar line and Whittington Park was owned and operated by the Hot Springs streetcar company, the Arlingtons ceased play. In 1904, the team became known as the Hot Springs Blues. The Blues played ten documented games in 1904.  The ballpark  The Hot Springs Arlingtons played home games at Whittington Park. Whittington Park hosted numerous major league baseball teams for spring training, including the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cleveland Spiders, Brooklyn Superbas, Detroit Tigers, New York Highlanders and Chicago Colts. Today, as part of the \\"Hot Springs Baseball Trail\\" there are historical markers at the site of Whittington Park, as well as the Arlington Hotel.

Hazimis believe that those who do not unconditionally excommunicate (takfir) unbelievers are themselves unbelievers, which opponents argue leads to an unending chain of takfir. The ideology has been described as \\"ultra-extreme\\" and \\"even more extreme than ISIS\\". Its spread within ISIS triggered prolonged ideological conflict within the group, pitting its followers against a more \\"moderate\\" faction led by Turki al- Binali.  Beliefs  Central to Hazimism is the doctrine of takfir al-‚Äòadhir (\\"excommunication of the excuser\\"). For the third \\"nullifier\\" in his treatise Nullifiers of Islam, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab - the founder of Wahhabism - writes that those who do not takfir unbelievers are themselves, unbelievers, whether that is because they doubt their disbelief or otherwise. However, those who are deemed \\"ignorant\\" are shielded from takfir by a principle known as al-‚Äòudhr bi‚Äôl-jahl (\\"excusing on the basis of ignorance\\"). Al-Hazimi rejects al-‚Äòudhr bi‚Äôl-jahl for matters he considers to be of \\"greater polytheism\\" (al-shirk al-akbar) and \\"greater disbelief\\" (al-kufr al-akbar), such as voting in elections. In these scenarios, al-Hazimi states that those who refuse to pronounce takfir by citing al-‚Äòudhr bi‚Äôl-jahl are unbelievers as per the third nullifier.Cole 2009, p. 14.  History = Al-Hazimi in Tunisia  Between December 2011 and May 2012, al-Hazimi delivered four lectures in Tunisia. He was supported by the Islamic Good Society and Hay al- Khadra‚Äô Mosques Committee; members of the former were arrested for financing terrorism, while the latter maintained links to Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia (AST). With the aid of the committee, al-Hazimi founded the Ibn Abi Zayd al- Qayrawani Institute for Sharia Sciences, which promoted his teachings. His views were also amplified through AST's Facebook page.  Hazimism in ISIS  In the following years, several Tunisians who adopted al-Hazimi's views joined ISIS. During the group's infighting with the Al-Nusra Front, the Tunisians remained loyal and were rewarded with senior administrative and religious posts. With increasing influence, however, their belief in takfir al-‚Äòadhir became a source of concern for ISIS leadership. Bahraini scholar Turki al-Binali, who led the group's Office of Research and Studies, prepared a series of lectures and pamphlets against the doctrine. He argued that while al-‚Äòudhr bi‚Äôl-jahl was invalid in instances of greater polytheism and disbelief, this does not necessarily mean that those who make excuses are disbelievers. In a tweet, he also described the belief as bid ªah. The Binalis, as they were later termed, also claimed the Hazimi view led to an \\"infinite regress of takfir\\" (al-takfir bi‚Äôl-tasalsul). In March 2014, audio leaked of several high-level Hazimi officials, including the wƒÅli of Hasakah, pronouncing takfir on the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. A separate leak showed takfir being made on Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. In late 2014, 50 Hazimis fled to Turkey while 70 were imprisoned and executed by ISIS after they made takfir on elements of its leadership which did not consider Ayman al-Zawahiri to be a disbeliever. Following their arrest, a pro-Hazimi statement surfaced describing ISIS as a \\"kafir jahmiyyah state\\". Several Hazimi cells were formed afterwards; the breakup of one in Raqqa being featured in Dabiq where they were branded as kharijites. Despite the crackdown, several groups of Hazimis remained, including one led by a certain Abu Ayyub al-Tunisi and supported by the wƒÅli of Aleppo. In 2016, Hazimis clashed with ISIS in the vicinity of Al- Bab and Jarabulus. In an account of the incident, senior Hazimi Abu Muath al- Jazairi called ISIS the \\"Idols' State\\" and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the \\"taghut\\" of Syria. In a statement published in Al-Naba in April 2017, ISIS' Central Office for Overseeing the Sharia Departments banned the discussion of al-‚Äòudhr bi‚Äôl-jahl and takfir al-‚Äòadhir, but warned that hesitation in takfir was inexcusable. On 17 May 2017, ISIS' Delegated Committee issued a memorandum which condemned al-takfir bi‚Äôl-tasalsul but stated that takfir was from the \\"foundations of the religion\\", rebuking those who hesitate in making it and branding them as murji'ah.Cole 2009, p. 17. Shortly afterwards, al-Binali published a response to the memorandum and claimed its intent was to placate the Hazimis. On May 31, al-Binali was killed in a coalition airstrike, followed by two other scholars who supported him. The timing was seen as suspicious by the Binalis, who accused the Delegated Committee of leaking their locations. In September 2017, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi reportedly dismissed and detained several Hazimis, reshuffling the Delegated Committee. In 2019, Hazimi foreign fighters, including a large contingent of Tunisians, failed a two-day coup attempt against al-Baghdadi. ISIS alleged they were led by Abu Muath al-Jazairi and placed a bounty on him.  Post-ISIS  In June 2020, it was estimated there were over 100 Hazimis in the Netherlands.

Over time, there was a growing mismatch between the ethnicity and the naming, similar to the Gaul. While initially Gothic names belonged to the Goths, by the 10th century the choice was influenced by the fashion independently of the ethnicity. Often the names were hybrids: German suffixes were added to Roman roots (e.g., Forteramnus =Forte + -ramn + -us) and vice versa (Hrodemia, from Hro√∞r). Eventually Germanic names have become predominant, but did not displace the Latin- language ones completely.Wilson, p. 68 Christianity has played a considerable role in preservation of the classical Greco-Latin names, related to religious ideas and saints.

Republican Bob McDonnell became governor, and Bill Bolling was re-elected as lieutenant governor. Cuccinelli was inaugurated as Attorney General of Virginia on January 16, 2010. He donated $100,000 from his inauguration fundraising effort to a Richmond non-profit that provides medical and mental health services to the homeless, saying inauguration events should be used to shed light on impoverished and underserved citizens. Two weeks after taking office, Cuccinelli drew questions for continuing to represent a private client in a court proceeding, although this was not illegal.  Healthcare  Cuccinelli (right) speaking at US Department of Justice announcement of resolution with Abbott Laboratories for its off-label promotion of the drug Depakote In 2010, Cuccinelli filed a federal lawsuit (Virginia v. Sebelius) challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), claiming that it exceeded the federal government's power under the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution. He was the first attorney general to file a lawsuit against the ACA. During his 2013 run for governor, Cuccinelli opposed the ACA's Medicaid expansion. The lawsuit was unsuccessful.  Immigration  In July 2010, Cuccinelli joined eight other states in filing an amicus brief opposing the federal government's lawsuit challenging an Arizona immigration enforcement statute. In August 2010, Cuccinelli issued a legal opinion authorizing law enforcement officials to investigate the immigration status of anyone that they have stopped; previously this was done only for those arrested. Cuccinelli noted that the authority to investigate the immigration status of a stopped person should not \\"extend the duration of a stop by any significant degree.\\" Critics note that the opinion circumvents changing the policy by legislation and that bills to make this change have died in the General Assembly.  Environment  Cuccinelli rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2010, Cuccinelli filed a request with the Environmental Protection Agency to reopen its proceeding regarding EPA's finding that greenhouse gasses endanger public health. He also sought judicial review of EPA's finding in Federal court. His press statement explained, \\"We cannot allow unelected bureaucrats with political agendas to use falsified data to regulate American industry and drive our economy into the ground\\". In 2012, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected Cuccinelli's arguments, unanimously ruling in Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that the EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as part of a strategy to address anthropogenic climate change and that the EPA's finding that \\"greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare\\" was well-founded in science and public policy.Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, June 26, 2012 In 2010, Cuccinelli announced he would challenge the March 2010 standards for motor vehicle fuel efficiency specified in the Clean Air Act.  Litigation against climate scientists  In April 2010, Cuccinelli served a civil investigative demand on the University of Virginia seeking a broad range of documents related to Michael E. Mann, a climate researcher now at Penn State who was an assistant professor at UVA from 1999 to 2005.Retrieved 2010-05-04. Cuccinelli based his demand on the 2002 Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, although no evidence of wrongdoing was given to explain the invocation of the law. Following the Climatic Research Unit email controversy numerous accusations about Mann's work on climate reconstructions had been sent to the university, and investigations of these allegations by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and Penn State subsequently cleared Mann of any wrongdoing. The Washington Post quoted Rachel Levinson, senior counsel with the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) as saying Cuccinelli's request had \\"echoes of McCarthyism.\\" A. Barton Hinkle of the Richmond Times-Dispatch criticized Cuccinelli for \\"employing a very expansive reading of Virginia's Fraud Against Taxpayers Act.\\" Among the groups urging the University of Virginia to resist producing the data were: a letter published in Science signed by 255 members of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American Civil Liberties Union and the AAUP. Also in May 2010, the University of Virginia Faculty Senate Executive Council wrote a letter strongly rebuking Cuccinelli for his civil investigative demand of the Mann records, stating that \\"[Cuccinelli's] action and the potential threat of legal prosecution of scientific endeavor that has satisfied peer-review standards send a chilling message to scientists engaged in basic research involving Earth's climate and indeed to scholars in any discipline.\\" In 2011 in response to the escalating attacks from the Virginia AG's office, the Union of Concerned Scientists published a defense of scientific integrity titled \\"Timeline: Legal Harassment of Climate Scientist Michael Mann\\". In May 2010, the University of Virginia began legal proceedings challenging Cuccinelli's investigative demand. The school's petition states that Virginia's \\"Fraud Against Taxpayers Act\\" (FATA) cited by Cuccinelli is not applicable in this case, as four of the five grants were federal, and that the fifth was an internal University of Virginia grant originally awarded in 2001. The filing also states that FATA was enacted in 2003 and is not retroactive. In August 2010, Albermarle Circuit Court Judge Paul Peatross heard argument on when Cuccinelli should get the requested data. On August 30, 2010, Judge Paul M. Peatross Jr. said that \\"the nature of the conduct is not stated so that any reasonable person could glean what Dr. Mann did to violate the statute,\\" the judge wrote.Ruling. Retrieved August 31, 2010. In September 2010, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli sent a new civil subpoena to the University of Virginia renewing a demand for documents related to the work of Mann. Cuccinelli narrowed his request to documents related to a grant that funded research unrelated to climate reconstructions. The demand also sought emails between Mann and 39 other climate change scientists. Cuccinelli filed a notice of appeal of the case to the Virginia Supreme Court, which ruled that Cuccinelli did not have the authority to make these demands. The outcome was hailed as a victory for academic freedom.  LGBT rights  Cuccinelli opposes homosexuality, describing homosexual acts as \\"against nature\\" and \\"harmful to society.\\" Cuccinelli opposes same-sex marriage. He has argued against the constitutionality of same-sex marriages. In 2010, Cuccinelli called on Virginia universities to remove \\"'sexual orientation,' 'gender identity,' 'gender expression,' or like classification, as a protected class within its nondiscrimination policy, absent specific authorization from the General Assembly.\\" Virginia Democratic State Senator John Edwards said that Cuccinelli was \\"turning back the clock on civil rights in Virginia.\\" The American Association of University Professors and the University of Virginia also criticized the opinion. Cuccinelli defended the legal opinion: \\"Our role isn't in the political arena on this subject. Our role is to give legal advice, to state what the law is.\\" The Washington Post said previous attorneys general of both parties held that local governments could not enact nondiscrimination policies for the same reason that Cuccinelli cited. Republican Governor Bob McDonnell supported the legal reasoning in the opinion. However, he issued Executive Directive One to all state agency heads stating that he would not allow them to discriminate based on sexual orientation.  Crime = Combating usury  Since 2007, the Virginia Attorney General's Office has negotiated settlements of almost $8 million representing refunds from eight auto-title lenders. The office filed a lawsuit on May 18, 2010 against CNC Financial Services, Inc., doing business as Cash- N-A-Flash, a Hampton-based auto \\"title lender,\\" for charging interest rates of 300 percent or more on its loans. This rate is alleged to exceed the 12 percent limit in the Virginia's Consumer Finance Act. However, effective October 1, 2010, Virginia's interest rate limit increased to 264 percent. The Attorney General's Office filed two separate lawsuits against two Virginia Beach-based mortgage modification companies for charging customers up to $1,200 in illegal advance fees in exchange for allegedly helping to prevent foreclosure.  Combating sex trafficking and sodomy  Cuccinelli has been a staunch advocate against human trafficking during his time in office, describing it as \\"one of the most egregious human rights violations\\". He has slammed popular media for portraying prostitution and other forms of selling sex as \\"just another career choice\\". While in the state Senate he created a plan, which he has implemented as attorney general, to crack down on trafficking on the state and served on the Senate Human Trafficking Commission. As attorney general, he has devoted full-time staff in the attorney general's office to prosecute human trafficking, and in May 2013 one of his assistant attorneys general was honored by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for breaking up and prosecuting a sex trafficking ring in Fairfax County. The advocacy group Polaris Project named Virginia one of the most improved states in cracking down on human trafficking in 2010 under Cuccinelli's leadership. He made human trafficking legislation his priority in his efforts during the 2013 General Assembly session, teaming up with Democratic and Republican lawmakers in support of three anti-human trafficking bills, all of which were passed and signed into law. He defended the constitutionality of Virginia laws prohibiting sodomy. In March 2013, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down Virginia's anti-sodomy law in a case involving William Scott MacDonald, a 47-year-old man who solicited, but did not receive, oral sex from a 17-year-old girl, finding it unconstitutional based on the Supreme Court's 2003 ruling in Lawrence v. Texas\\". On June 25, 2013, Cuccinelli filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking the Court to uphold the law, saying the appeals court ruling would release MacDonald from probation and \\"threatens to undo convictions of child predators that were obtained under this law after 2003.\\" Although the statute purported to ban all acts of sodomy and made no mention of age, Cuccinelli said the law is important for prosecutors to be able to \\"obtain felony charges against adults who commit or solicit this sex act with minors,\\" and noted that the law \\"is not ‚Äì and cannot be ‚Äì used against consenting adults acting in private.\\" In October 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Cuccinelli's appeal.  Antitrust enforcement  A $173 million settlement was reached with six international manufacturers of computer chips. The settlement resolved claims that the companies engaged in a price-fixing arrangement that cost government purchasers and consumers millions of dollars in overcharges for their chips. Cuccinelli and 32 other state attorneys general participated in the investigation and the settlement of a court case that was first filed in Court in 2006, before Cuccinelli took office.  Extradition of Jens Soering to Germany  Jens Soering, 43, the son of a German diplomat and former Jefferson scholar at the University of Virginia, was convicted in 1990 and sentenced to two life terms for the 1985 first-degree stabbing murders of his then-girlfriend's parents, Derek and Nancy Haysom, in their Bedford County home, and held at the Buckingham Correctional Center in Dillwyn, Virginia. Former Gov. Timothy Kaine, on the last day of his administration in January 2010, approved a request from the German government and asked the Justice Department to transfer Soering back to Germany to complete his sentence. Newly elected Gov. Bob McDonnell, along with Cuccinelli, adamantly opposed the transfer. McDonnell formally notified the Justice Department just three days after taking office that it was imperative that Soering serve his time in Virginia and not in Germany, where a US news report said that he could have applied for parole after two years, although parole is only applicable after a minimum 15 years according to the German penal code. On July 7, 2010, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that he would not consider transferring Soering to a prison in his home country without the state's \\"clear and unambiguous\\" consent.  Exoneration of Thomas Haynesworth  Cuccinelli was involved in advocating for the exoneration of Thomas Haynesworth, who had served 27 years in prison for rape until new evidence emerged. As attorney general, Cuccinelli argued in court for Haynesworth's exoneration and Cuccinelli hired Haynesworth to work in his office as a clerk. Haynesworth said Cuccinelli was \\"an extraordinary guy\\", having \\"put it on the line for me\\", and continues to work in Cuccinelli's office. Shawn Armbrust of the Innocence Project, who helped bring the Haynesworth case to Cuccinelli's office's attention, said Cuccinelli invited Haynesworth to his office and personally apologized for the 27 years Haynesworth spent in jail. George Mason University political scientist Mark Rozell said, \\"People perceive Cuccinelli as a hard-right figure on a number of issues. They don't tend to see him as having a soft side.\\"  Education policy  On November 24, 2010, Cuccinelli issued a legal opinion that police, school administrators, and teachers could search students' cell phones on the basis of reasonable suspicions in order to deter cyberbullying and \\"sexting\\". The ACLU and the Rutherford Institute said that Cuccinelli's opinion was in error, lacking a legal foundation. On January 28, 2011, Cuccinelli issued a legal opinion saying that school systems could not charge students the $75 testing fee when students take Advance Placement (AP) tests. Typically, AP courses are offered to academically advanced high school students to teach college-level materials. At the end of the course, students take a nationally administered AP test, and can receive college credit if the test score meets a specified level. Cuccinelli said that public schools were required to provide a free education, so schools could not charge students taking the AP class the exam fee.  Donor intent  In February 2012, Cuccinelli filed a brief in the case of seven Anglican parishes that had left the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia as part of the Anglican realignment, including The Falls Church and Truro Church. Cuccinelli took the side of the departing Anglican churches, arguing that they should be entitled to keep personal property amounting to several million dollars that was donated to the parishes between 2003 and 2007 and marked by the donors as for the use of parishes only, not for the diocese. Cuccinelli made this argument on \\"donor intent\\" grounds. \\"That donor intent is paramount,\\" Cuccinelli argued, \\"and governs the disposition of property, both real and personal, by one entrusted with its management, is a principle beyond dispute and interwoven throughout the law governing charitable trusts.\\" The Fairfax County Circuit Court should not rule, Cuccinelli concluded, \\"in violation of the clearly expressed intent of the donors.\\" The court sided with the diocese, ruling that the properties must be handed over.  Virginia seal  In May 2010, Cuccinelli used a historical state seal which shows Virtus, the Roman goddess of bravery and military strength, carrying a breastplate to cover her left breast on lapel pins he provided as gifts to his office staff. The current official seal shows Virtus holding a spear and her left breast is exposed. The original state seal was designed by George Wythe, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and adopted in 1776. Cuccinelli's spokesman, Brian Gottstein, said lapel pins with the breast covered were paid for by Cuccinelli's political action committee, not with taxpayer funds. In response to media inquiries, Cuccinelli released a statement including the following explanation:  Advocacy for veterans  In 2010, Cuccinelli announced plans to introduce a new level of veterans advocacy to the Attorney General's office, including training state agencies how to use the law to better advocate for their clients when it comes to obtaining federal veterans benefits. Cuccinelli said that one of the most important things he could do for veterans was to help speed up the process for them to obtain the services they are eligible for from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Other priority issues include ensuring that veterans have opportunities to become and stay employed in Virginia and working with the Virginia judiciary to determine how best to educate judges on how posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury issues affect veterans.  Ethics = Campaign contributions  Cuccinelli received $55,500 in campaign contributions from Bobby Thompson, a director of the U.S. Navy Veterans Association. The group was later found to be a racket. Thompson was Cuccinelli's second-largest campaign donor. After receiving the contribution, Cuccinelli met with Samuel F. Wright, a USNVA representative on February 15, 2010, to discuss legislation which had passed the State Senate that would exempt the group from having to register with Virginia regulators. After an investigative report in the St. Petersburg Times in March 2010 raised questions about the Navy Veterans Association and Thompson, all other Virginia politicians, including Gov. Bob McDonnell, donated contributions from Thompson to other veterans' organizations. Cuccinelli refused to do so, despite calls from Virginia Democrats. Cuccinelli's spokesman said \\"if Mr. Thompson was convicted of wrongdoing relative to the misappropriation of funds, and contributions to our campaign came from money that was supposed to go to active duty military or veterans, we would donate those contributions to military support organizations here in Virginia.\\" Sen. Don McEachin asserted that the standard for donations should be \\"much higher than that.\\" A month later in June, a Cuccinelli spokesman said $55,500 would be set aside in a restricted account pending the outcome of the investigation into Thompson and USNVA. On July 28, 2010, Cuccinelli announced that he would donate the $55,000 to veterans' charities in Virginia. Cuccinelli stated that his decision was prompted by statements from Thompson's lawyers indicating that Thompson could no longer be located.  Star Scientific tax dispute lawsuit  In March 2013, Cuccinelli's role in a tax dispute case came into question when media reported on a lawsuit between the state of Virginia and Star Scientific, a nutritional supplements company. The Washington Post reported that Cuccinelli had failed to disclose investments in Star Scientific for a year; after realizing the oversight, he corrected it and disclosed the holdings. Cuccinelli has disclosed $18,000 in gifts from Star Scientific's chief executive, Jonnie R. Williams. He said he could not return them because they were dinners, vacations, and flights; things that could not be returned. He has sold his stock in the company. The Washington Post found no evidence that Cuccinelli sought to personally intervene in the lawsuit. In April 2013, Cuccinelli recused himself from the case, hiring private attorneys to defend the state. Cuccinelli subsequently announced that he had discovered the equivalent of $4,500 in additional gifts from Jonnie R. Williams that he had not previously disclosed, including free use of Williams' Smith Mountain Lake vacation lodge in 2010 and 2012. In response, Cuccinelli asked the Commonwealth's attorney to review his disclosure filings. On July 18, 2013, a state prosecutor announced that he had found no evidence that Cuccinelli had violated the law, saying Cuccinelli did not appear to be attempting to conceal the relationship with Williams and he did not intentionally mischaracterize any gifts. After Bob McDonnell's ties to Williams came under investigation, Cuccinelli urged McDonnell to call a special session of the General Assembly to re-examine disclosure and campaign finance laws. McDonnell, who as governor has the exclusive power to call a special session, declined Cuccinelli's request. In September 2013, Cuccinelli donated, from his personal money, an amount equivalent to the value of the gifts he received from Williams to charity.

In 1931 the designer and his wife flew Errant on a seven month world tour. Design and development The 'A Special' was designed to meet the needs and abilities of a competent, non-professional pilot wanting a safe and forgiving two seat tourer, rather than a multi-role aircraft capable of aerobatics. As part of the early design process Day had studied the flight characteristics that underlay many light plane accidents in order to minimize them. The result was an equal span biplane with generous wing area and large () stagger. The stagger allowed the side-by-side seats to be ahead of the lower wing leading edge, giving good fields of view both downwards and in steeply banked turns. Both upper and lower wings were set with 3¬∞ of dihedral and were rectangular in plan out to rounded tips. They were braced together with a forward-leaning N-strut on each side and the upper wing centre section was held over the fuselage by pairs of outward-leaning, parallel cabane struts. Flight tests showed its ailerons, inset and mounted only on the lower wing, retained control in the stall. Its fuselage was flat-sided apart from rounded decking. A nose-mounted Martin 333 inverted, air-cooled inline engine producing was gravity fed from a tank under the front cowling. It had an open, side-by-side cockpit, well-instrumented with controls on the left and a baggage compartment behind it. The biplane had a large, span tailplane, adjustable for trim from the cockpit and carrying large elevators mounted well above the thrust line on top of a trapezoidal fin and out of the downwash of the lower wing, thus avoiding tail stalls. It had a large balanced rudder. Tests showed that compass headings could be maintained under blind flying conditions without use of the rudder; Day's accident analysis showed that rudder misuse was a frequent cause of accidents initiated in these conditions. Landing safety was maximized by fixed landing gear with an track. Its wheels, well ahead of the centre of gravity were on landing legs with long travel shock absorbers from the upper fuselage longerons. They had low pressure tyres and brakes. The gear was a split axle type with the inner ends of the axles on a transverse V-strut from the lower longerons. This V-strut and the two drag struts from the outer axle ends were mounted on the central fuselage underside. The world tour Before the tour Charles Day's original suggestion was that he and his wife Gladys should use it for a tour around the United States but she preferred to see more and a world tour was planned instead. There were a few modifications to the biplane: a reserve fuel tank was installed under the luggage space behind the seats, the oil tank increased in capacity and a second baggage space provided behind the engine firewall. The aircraft was shipped to Heston Aerodrome near London in the summer of 1931. The couple packed some spares, fitted a new compass and set off through Central Europe, the Balkans, Asia Minor and East Asia to Shanghai. After shipping the biplane to San Francisco they flew home to New York. The trip took seven months, visited 74 cities and 20 countries; the overall flown distance was about .

In the 1980s Arizona State University (ASU) began the Payson Archaeological Research Expedition (PARE), a long-term research program that combined cultural resource management with an archaeological field school program. In cooperation with the Tonto National Forest, ASU personnel selected the Shoofly Village Ruins as the locale for the field school that began in 1984 and continued through four seasons. ASU personnel also conducted archaeological investigations in conjunction with a Tonto National Forest land exchange project. The goals of the research program were to define settlement patterns in the Payson region, in particular the relationship between the Shoofly Village and other, smaller with two to three structures, often three walled; rock-ringed roasting pits; and agricultural fields. The Shoofly Village was constructed around 1000 CE, beginning a time of growth, development, and population aggregation. Occupation appears to have ended around 1300 CE. A book by Charles L. Redman ‚ÄúPeople of the Tonto Rim: Archaeological Discovery in Prehistoric Arizona‚Äù is a record of ASU‚Äôs research on Shoofly Village. Redman presents a settlement model that defines household communities (small sites occupied by single households), hamlets, and primary villages. Four primary villages, of which Shoofly Village is the largest, are known to be present in the area. The primary villages are evenly spaced across the landscape within relatively large production zones. Shoofly occupies the northernmost position, a vantage that permitted special access to the resources directly below the Mogollon Rim and proximity to the route up and over the rim. Redman suggested that the spatial layout and architectural variability of the site indicates that it was a conglomeration of discrete units, each resembling individual hamlet sites. He proposes that formerly separate social groups, each with its own distinctive building traditions, joined together to form the Shoofly Village. The village was built in four phases, with the ‚Äúcore‚Äù room block of contiguous masonry rooms constructed later than the surrounding compounds of low-walled, cobble-jacal masonry structures. This suggests that the architectural differences on which Redman focuses may be temporal as well as ethnic in origin, although the other primary villages in the area have a similar layout and presumably also building history.

Biography  Marie Rachel Bouffa was the daughter of Nicolas Joseph Adolphe and Clarisse Catherine Jos√®phe Antoine. In 1942, single and 58 years old, Bouffa owned and operated a guest house called \\"la Ferme de la Chapelle\\" (The Farm of the Chapel), which was a part of her large estate in Belgium. On September 15 of that year, an emissary was sent by the command of Belgium's Secret Army to her community, La Reid, near Liege, to set up a local group to resist the occupying German forces. Bouffa, who was not Jewish, became the first member on December 1, 1942. Bouffa helped a variety of people fleeing oppression. She was known to shelter resistance fighters, those fleeing compulsory labor, escaped prisoners and downed Allied airmen, all being hunted down by the enemy. In addition to providing a safe hiding place, she provided false documents and helped identify an escape route. She also distributed works by the underground press, transmitted military intelligence and stored arms and ammunition. A simplified version of the medal awarded to those who are named Righteous Among the Nations.Beginning in August 1942, Bouffa also hid, for two years, a Jewish family, the seven members of the Sluchny family, who had fled their home in Antwerp, Belgium after authorities began deporting the Jews living there. The family was living with Bouffa when, one day, a neighbor told her that the Gestapo were on their way to search the premises. She quickly moved the Sluchnys to a neighboring village, Queue-du-Bois and, after the immediate danger had passed, she had the family returned to her protection, living in a building behind a large wall on her estate. On February 17, 1944, another surprise search took place. The Jewish family managed to escape the raid, moving on to other hiding places, but Bouffa was caught and arrested by the Gestapo. Bouffa was deported to a concentration camp for women in northern Germany, Ravensbr√ºck, where she was executed on February 1, 1945.

Historical interpretation of the Commune influenced subsequent revolutionary ideology and sociopolitical events. As of the late 20th century, there were two main historiographical schools of thought: the political interpretation, that the Commune was a patriotic eruption of fury in response to circumstantial hardship following the Siege of Paris; and the social interpretation, that the Commune was the result of macro socioeconomic forces boiling over, e.g., that it was a war of class struggle. Histories in the latter interpretation have used the Commune's events to make ideological points on behalf of their authors, either that the Commune was an illegitimate, criminal aggression, or that the Commune was the consummation of revolutionary momentum. Similarly, historians within both the political and social interpretations have disagreed as to whether the Commune was inevitable or accidental (though there is agreement that the uprising was unplanned), a harbinger of the future or a sunset for revolutionary zeal. Shortly after the brutal end of the Commune, which killed, imprisoned, or exiled 100,000 Parisians, the Commune quickly became subject to polarizing legend. Conservative contemporaries of the Commune attributed the insurrection to revolutionary conspiracy by the First International and its affiliates. Partly in response, revolutionary socialists did not acknowledge organizations as contributing to the Commune. Their sense of the revolution's legitimacy rested in its popular spontaneity, as compared to the deliberate planning of a coup. Scholarship of the Commune began with Georges Bourgin's Histoire de la Commune just prior to World War I, and thus became viewed through the lens of 1917. It received treatments from preeminent scholars including C.L.R. James and Henri Lefebvre, and was the subject of most of Jacques Rougerie's career. Communist historiography fell out of favor by the end of the 20th century. Where there had previously been debate over whether the Commune was a revolutionary socialist movement or a movement of artisans, Rougerie's La Commune: 1871 (1988) attributed the Commune to an amalgam of both. Roger Gould's 1995 Insurgent Identities challenged Marxist (David Harvey) and humanist urban theory (Lefebvre and Manuel Castells) narratives of the Commune.

Early life Meyer was the eldest son of Izaak Johannes Meijer and his wife, Martha Maria Elizabeth Landman and the grandson of Lucas Johannes Meyer, a Voortrekker leader and member of the Volksraad of the Natalia Republic. As a young man, Meyer went to Natal and lived in Ladysmith and Newcastle, but in 1865 he settled in the Utrecht district in the South African Republic. In 1872 he was elected field cornet. Career He strongly opposed the British annexation of the Transvaal. At the battle of Ingogo, during the First Anglo- Boer War he was badly wounded and unable to fight at the Battle of Majuba Hill. After the war, he served as magistrate of Utrecht from 1882 to 1884. In 1884 he became the district commandant and the leader of a group of Boers who assisted Prince Dinuzulu during the power struggle in Zululand, against his brother Zibhebhu. At the Battle of Tshaneni on the 5th of June 1884 Dinuzulu and his warriors, with the help of some 100 Boers, defeated Zibhebhu. After the victory, Dinizulu handed a piece of land to the Boers as compensation for their assistance and Meyer played a leading role in the establishment of the Nieuwe Republiek on the land. In August 1884, he was appointed Commandant- General and Acting President and when his friend and confidant, Commandant- General Piet Joubert who had been elected president refused the appointment, Meyer became president. Meyer fought for the recognition of the Nieuwe Republiek, as the Republic was recognized only by the German Empire and the South African Republic. He then took a leading role in obtaining British permission for the incorporation of the Nieuwe Republiek into the South African Republic as the Vryheid district, which permission was granted in 1888. In 1890, Commandant-General Joubert appointed Meyer as frontier commissioner of the Transvaal's southern border and he held office until he was elected the first member of the Volksraad for Utrecht in 1893 and in 1899, he became chairman of the Volksraad. Meyer played an important role in Natal during the Second Anglo-Boer War as General of the southern commandos in the Transvaal and the various advances into Natal. He commanded the Boer forces attacking Dundee at the Battle of Talana Hill on 20 October 1899. However, due to illness, he was forced to leave the scene of fighting during the battle at Modderspruit on 30 October 1899 and command was taken over by General Louis Botha. Meyer returned to the battlefield and took part in the Battle of Vaal Krantz during February 1900 and also assisted with the occupation of Biggarsberg in May 1900. Because of ill health, he was unable to take an active part during the latter part of the war and at the conclusion of the war, he became a member of the Executive Council, taking part in the peace conference and was one of the signatories of the Treaty of Vereeniging.  Personal life and death Meyer was a tall, powerfully built man, immensely popular and was commonly referred to as the 'Lion of Vryheid'. He was married twice, first to Margaretha Johanna van Niekerk and after her death in 1892, he married Petronella Burger. Three children were born from his first marriage. During a visit to Europe he died of heart disease in Brussels, Belgium. He was buried in the cemetery in Vryheid.

It is also a Special Area of Conservation. Features Ballyteigue Burrow was legally protected as a national nature reserve by the Irish government in 1987. The site has also been designated a Special Area of Conservation. The site has been assessed as being of international importance due to the variety of physical features including dune slacks, salt marshes, sand dunes, and mudflats. The name \\"burrow\\" is in reference to the large number of rabbits that were bred on the site from Norman times. There is still a large population of Oryctolagus cuniculus, the European rabbit, on the reserve which rises and falls due to the presence of the disease myxomatosis. Four protected plant species have been recorded in Ballyteigue Burrow: lesser centaury, wild asparagus, Borrer's saltmarsh grass, and perennial glasswort. It is the main location in Ireland for perennial glasswort, and the only location in Ireland in which the rare lichen Fulgensia fulgens is found. Other plants found in the reserve include wild thyme, birds-foot trefoil, common centaury, kidney vetch, restharrow, spring vetch, sea pea, and henbane. Further inland from the coast, the soil is acidic with marram grass as the key species of the sand dunes. Other lichen recorded at the site include Usnea articulata and the moss Tortula ruraliformis. The sand dunes create a warm environment for wasps, ants and bees, including the endangered great yellow bumble bee and the shrill carder bee, as well as moths and butterflies such as the dark green fritillary and small heath. Small numbers of the rare pale pill woodlouse Armadillidium album have been recorded on the reserve, along with the common lizard Lacerta vivipara, whose numbers have been declining. The area close to the estuary offers overwintering habitats for a number of important birds including pale- bellied Brent geese, lapwings, black-tailed godwits, and golden plovers. The mudflats are home to a variety of waders, swans and ducks. Other birds that inhabit the reserve include linnets, little terns, meadow pipits, reed buntings, skylarks, stonechats, wheatears, and wrens.

He was a supporter of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal. He became a priest as a member of the Franciscans in 1971. From 1981 until 1984 he served as a spiritual assistant in Mostar, but was mainly active in Medjugorje after the alleged apparitions in June 1981. There, he was appointed a chaplain in 1984, and succeeded Fr. Tomislav Vla≈°iƒá as a spiritual director of the alleged seers. Fr. Slavko remained in Medjugorje until his transfer to Blagaj near Mostar in 1985. Nevertheless, he still continued his activity in Medjugorje, contrary to the Bishop's orders. He was moved to Humac near Ljubu≈°ki, but in 1991 illegally moved to Medjugorje again, where he remained until his death. His confessional jurisdiction was suspended by the Bishop twice due to his disobedience in 2000.  Early life and priesthood  Barbariƒá was born in the Dragiƒáani hamlet in ƒåerin near ƒåitluk in Herzegovina. He was foruth of six children. He attended elementary school in ƒåerin, and a high school seminary in Dubrovnik from 1961 to 1965. He entered the novitiate of the Franciscan Province of Herzegovina on 14 July 1965. Barbariƒá enrolled at the Faculty of Theology and Philosophy in Visoko in 1966, and continued his education in Sarajevo and graduated in Schwaz, Austria in 1971. He gave monastic vows in La Verna, Italy, on 17 September 1971, and was ordained a priest in Reutte, Austria on 19 December 1971. While studying pastoral psychology in Italy, he became impressed with mysticism and Catholic Charismatic Renewal. During his studies in Rome, he joined the Catholic Charismatic \\"Community and Freedom (Comunione e liberazione). As a member of the Franciscan community in Frohnleiten in Austria, he was pastorally active there, and attended the Faculty of Theology in Graz, where he gained a master's degree in pastoral theology in 1973. As a priest, Fr. Slavko was first appointed a chaplain in ƒåapljina on 22 September 1973. There, he saw Pope's decree Romanis Pontificibus being published in June 1975, by which the Pope ordered the redistribution of parishes in the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno between the Franciscans and the diocesan clergy. Fr. Slavko remained in ƒåapljina until 1978, when he left for Freiburg, Germany to study. There, he earned Ph.D. in religious pedagogy and got the title of \\"psychotherapist\\" in 1982.  Medjugorje phenomenon  While he was in Freiburg, in June 1981, the alleged seers of the Marian apparitions had their first visions. Fr. Slavko was named a chaplain in Mostar on 18 August 1981. In Mostar, he served as a spiritual assistant, with his main task being the religious education of youth and students. He used this position to go on the pilgrimage with students in Medjugorje as often as possible. His pastoral activity became mainly focused on Medjugorje, where he lived. The Franciscan province asked for his transfer to Medjugorje, and Bishop Pavao ≈Ωaniƒá, not knowing about his illicit activities in Medjugorje, approved the request on 16 August 1984. Barbariƒá succeeded Fr. Tomislav Vla≈°iƒá as a spiritual director of the alleged seers after Fr. Tomislav was transferred to Vitina near Ljubu≈°ki few days later. He continued to conduct the Chronicle of Apparitions, started by Fr. Tomislav. In 1985, Bishop Pavao ≈Ωaniƒá asked the Franciscan Province of Herzegovina to transfer Fr. Slavko from Medjugorje over the controversy regarding the alleged apparitions. However, the Province never responded, while the seers claimed that Madonna told them in a vision that Fr. Slavko should take over the parish.: \\"However, the alleged \\"Our Lady\\" intervened explicitly and decisively, announcing through the \\"seers\\" her pastoral \\"decree\\" to Fr. Slavko Barbariƒá, appointing him, as usual, the \\"leader\\" of the parish on 3 February 1985:'I want Father Slavko to stay here, to lead the parish and gather news so that when I no longer come, a complete picture of everything that has happened will remain, and at this moment I am praying especially for Father Slavko and for all those who work in this parish.'\\" After the bishop insisted on his transfer, Fr. Slavko was moved to Blagaj near Mostar on 20 July 1985. Barbariƒá continued his activity in Medjugorje, promoting the cult of Our Lady of Medjugorje and traveling around the world with the alleged seers. Three years later, the Franciscan Province proposed the Bishop to name him a chaplain in Humac, Ljubu≈°ki, which Bishop approved on 16 September 1988. Even after being transferred to Humac, Fr. Slavko remained mostly active in Medjugorje. Fr. Slavko Barbariƒá's grave in Medjugorje The conclusion of the Conference of Bishops, published in Zadar on 10 April 1991, regarding the alleged apparitions, stated that the apparitions \\"non constat de supernaturalitate\\", that is that on the basis of previous examinations, it is impossible to establish that these are supernatural apparitions or revelations. However, the Conference left the possibility of the pilgrimage. In connection to the conclusion, Fr. Slavko stated: \\"We have our sanctuary. We have permission for the people to come here. Why do we need the seers anyway?\\" The same year in July, the Province proposed the Bishop that Fr. Slavko should remain in Humac, which the Bishop approved. However, Fr. Slavko on his own initiative returned to Medjugorje, claiming he agreed to this verbally with the Provincial Fr. Drago Tolj, due to the lack of confessors. The Episcopal Ordinariate wasn't even informed about the transfer, so Fr. Slavko remained active without the necessary decree from the bishop. The Episcopal Ordinariate was in turmoil due to the war in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that brake out in October 1991. In 1993, Bishop Pavao ≈Ωaniƒá was replaced by Ratko Periƒá. The Ordinariate continued to communicate with Fr. Slavo regularly, presuming that his transfer in Medjugorje was legal. In 1999, Bishop Ratko asked the Province to transfer him from Medjugorje again, after he found that Fr. Slavko was active in Medjugorje without a pastoral decree. Fr. Slavko refused to transfer, so the Bishop suspended his confessional jurisdiction on 20 February 2000. Fr. Slavko asked the Bishop for revision, but the Bishop confirmed his previous decision. He again complained to the Holy See over the issue, and the Bishop insisted that Fr. Slavko signs the statement of obedience and leave Medjugorje. He signed the statement on 20 June 2000 but still remained active in Medjugorje. The bishop suspended his confessional jurisdiction once again on 30 October 2000. He died on 24 November 2000.

Carver started the Carver Pump Factory with his brother and then later owned the company Bandag, which gained the 909th spot on Fortune top 1,000 companies. He donated to multiple Iowa causes. He started the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust, which provided millions of dollars to the University of Iowa, Augustana College, and St. Ambrose University. Personal life and career Carver was born on December 5, 1909, to James and Laura Carver in Preemption, Illinois. In 1927, he completed high school in Moline, Illinois. After earning a BS degree in engineering from the University of Illinois in 1934, Carver became state engineer for Illinois. In 1938, during the Great Depression, Carver and his brother Ralph started the Carver Pump Company in Matherville, Illinois. The company created self-priming pumps, and it soon supplied the United States and Allied Forces navies during World War II. Due to the need for a larger facility, the company was moved to an abandoned sauerkraut factory in Muscatine, Iowa. Carver also lived in Muscatine, and shortly after moving there he married Lucille Young in 1942. The two of them had five children. Carver bought the North American rights to a manufacturing process for tires created by Bernard Anton Nowak as a part of Bandag, Inc. The process \\"cures or vulcanizes rubber tires at lower temperatures than other retreading processes\\". After Nowak died in 1961, Carver bought the worldwide rights to the process and gained full ownership of Bandag. Bandag became one of the top American corporations in the early 1970s. In 1973, the company's sales earned the 909th spot on Fortune top 1,000 companies. During the late 1970s, Carver created more than 850 dealership franchises in more than 50 countries. In 1954, Carver flew alone across the Atlantic Ocean from Newfoundland to Paris in a one-engine Beechcraft Bonanza. He made only one stop during the plane trip. Starting in 1972 after divorcing his wife, Carver spent most of his time at his Miami home. He also bought a villa in Cannes, a 25,000-acre ranch in Central America, two yachts, multiple airplanes, and many expensive cars. Philanthropy and death Carver primarily donated money to people in Iowa, and it was noted in the Muscatine Journal that \\"he took great pleasure in helping others\\". He also contributed financially to Richard Nixon presidential campaign and to Augustana College. In 1971, Carver donated shares of Bandag stock valued at $3.5 million to the University of Iowa, which was the university's largest donation at the time. The first donation to the University of Iowa was one of several. He started the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust, which provided millions of dollars to the University of Iowa, Augustana College, and St. Ambrose University. He founded the Roy Carver Memorial Pavilion, a treatment center at the University of Iowa Hospitals, and the Carver Wing of the Museum of Art. He died of a heart attack on June 7, 1981, at 71 years of age in Marbella, Spain.

Short (April 2, 1870 - March 5, 1952) was a career officer in the United States Army. A veteran of the Spanish-American War, Pancho Villa Expedition, and World War I, he attained the rank of brigadier general. Short was most notable for the organization and training of several units during the first World War, and his command of the 1st Cavalry Division between World War I and World War II. Early life Walter Cowen Short was born in Columbus, Ohio on April 2, 1870, a son of John Short and Elizabeth L. (Cowen) Short. He was raised and educated in Columbus, and attended Marietta College from 1887 to 1888. He was a student in the preparatory department at Ohio State University from 1888 to 1889. Short attended Michigan Military Academy from 1889 to 1890. After graduating, he remained on the academy's faculty as professor of grammar and arithmetic. Start of career While attending Marietta College, Short joined the Ohio National Guard's 3rd Infantry Battalion. He was soon commissioned as a captain, and he remained with the battalion for two years. In 1889, he was commissioned as a colonel on the staff of Governor Joseph B. Foraker, and his duties included arranging for the participation of Ohio National Guard troops in the inauguration of Benjamin Harrison as president. At Michigan Military Academy's 1891 graduation ceremony, U.S. Army officers in attendance including Colonel Edward Miles Heyl, commended the drill and ceremony of cadets under Short's command and made note of Short's bearing and appearance. When a lieutenant's vacancy occurred in the 6th Cavalry Regiment shortly after the graduation, Heyl recommended Short for the appointment despite the fact that he was not among the 1,800 individuals who had applied. He did not pass the week-long qualifying examination on the first attempt. He passed on the second, and received his commission as a second lieutenant of Cavalry on October 7, 1891. Short reported for duty with the 3rd Cavalry at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Soon after he arrived, the Garza Revolution began when Catarino Garza launched an attack on Mexico from Texas in an effort to topple the government of Porfirio D√≠az. Short was ordered to Fort Ringgold with two cavalry troops under the command of a captain. He was soon assigned to command of the troops, and led them until hostilities died down when Garza went into hiding to avoid capture by U.S. soldiers. During this conflict, the units under Short's command participated in a number of engagements along the Texas-Mexico border and took several prisoners. After leaving Texas, Short joined the 6th Cavalry at Fort Niobrara, Nebraska, and assumed command of Troop L (the regiment's American Indian scouts). During the 1894 Pullman Strike, the 6th Cavalry was on duty in Chicago, and Short served on the regimental staff. After the strike, the 6th Cavalry was assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia and Short continued to serve on its staff. Spanish-American War Short and Cavalry School staff, 1905 At the start of the Spanish-American War in 1898, Short was assigned command of the 6th Cavalry's Troop A. While the regiment was in Tampa, Florida awaiting transportation to Cuba, Short was appointed an assistant adjutant general of United States Volunteers with the temporary rank of major. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate, but Short declined in order to serve at the front with his regiment. After arriving in Cuba, Short was promoted to temporary captain. The 6th Cavalry led the charge at the July 1, 1898 Battle of San Juan Hill, with most troopers marching because they had been required to abandon their horses due to the difficult terrain. Short was mounted in order to better direct his troops, and his horse was shot during the fighting. He continued to lead on foot, and was among the first soldiers to reach the top of the hill. During the battle, Short was shot three times, with one round entering his side and passing out near the spine, one causing a flesh wound to one of his arms, and one wounding his wrist. Despite his wounds, Short remained on his feet until clearing the Spanish army's breastworks. His comrades, inclding John J. Pershing, carried him from the battlefield, convinced he would not recover. A photo in The Illustrated London News of August 20, 1898 depicted the scene of Short being carried, and he gained a measure of fame as a result. Short was evacuated to a military hospital in Key West, Florida. After convalescing for ten days, he was well enough to sneak away from the hospital and rejoin the 6th Cavalry in Cuba. He received a brevet promotion to major in recognition of his heroism and remained in Cuba until the end of the war. Post-war After leaving Cuba, Short served with the 10th Cavalry regiment at Fort Riley, Kansas and Fort Sam Houston, Texas. He was then ordered back to Cuba as the officer in charge of a 100-man detail from the 10th Cavalry. Short and his men took part in the United States Military Government in Cuba, and Short was appointed de facto governor of the city of Bayamo and surrounding towns. Under his leadership, 10th Cavalry soldiers drove out or captured gangs of robbers who had long dominated the area, and killed 37. They improved sanitation in Bayamo, established several new schools, installed telegraph lines, and improved the roads between the city and Cuba's coastline. After his service in Cuba, Short was assigned to Vancouver Barracks, Washington as a major in the 35th United States Volunteer Infantry. The regiment was soon ordered to the Philippines, where Short served during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. He was mustered out of the volunteer service in 1901 and promoted to captain as a member of the 13th Cavalry at Fort Keogh, Montana. Short (second from right) with representatives of the Belgian military, June 1918) In 1902, the Army established the Cavalry School at Fort Riley, and Short was appointed its first senior instructor. He remained on the faculty until 1907, when he was selected for attendance at the Cavalry School in Saumur, France. After completing the course as a student, which enabled him to observe French methods of instruction, Short returned to Fort Riley as the Cavalry School's assistant commandant, where he remained until 1911. Short was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Regiment in 1911. In addition to performing duty with his regiment at the Presidio of San Francisco, Short was also assigned as commander of Fort Yosemite and the troops assigned to oversee the operations of Yosemite National Park. In 1913, Short was assigned to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii as a member of the 4th Cavalry Regiment. In 1915 he was promoted to major and assigned to the 16th Cavalry at Fort Ringgold, Texas. During this assignment, Short performed duty on the Texas-Mexico Border during the Pancho Villa Expedition. World War I In May 1917, Short was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In August 1917, he was promoted to temporary colonel and assigned command the 337th Infantry Regiment during its initial organization and training. He subsequently commanded the 312th and 315th Cavalry Regiments, which he organized and trained. When the Army determined that Cavalry units were not needed on the front lines, Short was responsible for converting these regiments to Field Artillery, and they went to France as the 71st and 72nd Artillery Regiments. From September to October 1918, Short commanded the 8th Infantry Regiment at Camp Fremont, California. He was promoted to temporary brigadier general in October 1918 and assigned to command 32nd Infantry Brigade, 16th Division at Camp Kearny, California. The war ended before the 16th Division departed for France, and Short reverted to his permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in 1919. Post- World War I Short's 1920 passport photo After World War I, Short served in Belgium as manager of the U.S. equestrian team at the 1920 Summer Olympics. He attended the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth.

In October 1927, Short was promoted to brigadier general and assigned to the Advanced Air Corps School at Fort Langley, Virginia. He subsequently served at the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia and the Cavalry School at Fort Riley. In 1928, he took command of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade at Fort Bliss, Texas. Also in 1928, Short was manager of the U.S. equestrian team that took part in the Summer Olympics, which were held in Amsterdam. He commanded the 1st Cavalry Division from 1930 to 1932.

On August 10, 1941, the army was disbanded *Southern Front (Lieutenant General Dmitry Ryabyshev, from October 5, Colonel General Yakov Cherevichenko): **12th Army (Soviet Union) (Major General Ivan Galanin); **18th Army (Soviet Union) (Lieutenant General Andrey Smirnov); **9th Army (Soviet Union) (Lieutenant General Fyodor Kharitonov). The advancing forces consisted of the troops of Army Group South: *17th Army (St√ºlpnagel); *1st Panzer Group (Kleist); *Part of the 11th Army (Manstein); *Main forces of the 3rd Romanian Army. The superiority of the enemy over the Soviet troops was:Most of the troops of the Southwestern Front died near Uman (August 1‚Äì8) and Kiev (September). The direction to Rostov was covered only by the 18th Army of the Southern Front, but it was also surrounded and killed near Chernigovka (October 1‚Äì8, 1941) *In manpower and aviation ‚Äì 2 times; *In guns and mortars ‚Äì 3 times. Operation On September 29, the Germans launched an offensive. The 1st Panzer Group (from October 6, the 1st Tank Army) and the motorized division of the 11th Army almost immediately broke through the defenses of the Soviet troops and entered the area of the city of Osipenko. With this maneuver, they surrounded parts of the 18th and 9th Armies. The encirclement continued until October 10. The 12th Army took up defenses on the Pavlograd, Vasilkovka, Gavrilovka line to contain the enemy's advance and ensure the withdrawal of the remaining troops. At the same time, the Taganrog Combat Area was created, consisting of 3 rifle divisions to organize defense on the eastern bank of the Mius River from Uspenskaya to Taganrog and to cover the approaches to Rostov-on-Don. On October 14, the 9th Army and the Taganrog Combat Area (the troops of the Southern Front) launched a counterattack and pushed the enemy forward units by 10‚Äì15 kilometers. However, with the approach of the main forces of the 1st German Tank Army, the Soviet troops were again forced to retreat. The troops of the right wing of the front, by order of the Headquarters of the Supreme High Command, retreated to the Krasny Liman, Debaltsevo line, and the left wing (18th and 9th Armies), under pressure from superior German forces, to the Debaltsevo ‚Äì Krasny Luch ‚Äì Bolshekrepinskaya ‚Äì Khapry line, where they took up defensive positions. Outcome The enemy managed to defeat the remnants of the Southern Front of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, reach the Sea of Azov and enter the Crimea. The southwestern part of Donbass was also occupied. In early November, the 1st Panzer Group of the Wehrmacht resumed the offensive on Rostov-on-Don (Rostov Defensive Operation).

History The church sits along Magdalene Street facing the medieval Abbot's Kitchen across the road in Glastonbury Abbey. On the same site, once stood the original Catholic church in that of an old converted stable which was pulled down in 1938. Behind the church there was once the St. Louis Convent school which operated from 1925 until 1984.http://www.stlouisconvent.co.uk/index.html The new church was made at a cost of ¬£11,000 and was built using Bath and Corsham stone. At the front of the church, carved into the stone are statues of Madonna and child, St Dunstan to the left and Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury on the right. Father Michael Fitzpatrick worked on raising these funds and relied upon local donations to do so. Relics After its consecration on July 2, 1941 by Bishop Lee of Clifton - the church was blessed and relics from saints placed within the altar and reliquaries from: *Oliver Plunkett - Patron saint of Peace and Reconciliation in Ireland *Thomas Becket - Patron saint of the Roman Catholic Secular Clergy *Pope Innocent I - Once pope for 16 years *Benedict of Nursia - Patron saint of students and the dying et al. *Victoria of Albitina - Patron of Anticoli, Italy *Saint Barbara - Patron saint of artillerymen and miners *Pope Clement I - Patron saint of stone cutters and sailors Interior Behind the alter is the statue of 'Our Lady St. Mary of Glastonbury' which was made in 1955.

She was the first Native American student admitted to the University of California at Berkeley in 1968. She led the drive to create the Native American Student Organization and became its chair. As a leader of the Third World Strike at UC Berkeley in 1969, she was arrested but succeeded in obtaining approval for the first ethnic studies courses to be included in the university's curricula. A few months later, she became one of the organizers of the Occupation of Alcatraz in 1969. After the occupation, she completed her bachelor's degree at the University of California, Berkeley and went on to study law at Antioch School of Law in Washington, D.C. While in Washington, she participated in the takeover of the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in 1972. Returning to Idaho in 1974, War Jack (then known as Boyer) was involved in tribal politics and served a two-year term on the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation of Idaho Tribal Council. In 1979, she moved to Nevada and operated a ranch near Wadsworth, gaining certification in permaculture from the Permaculture Institute at Tagari Garden Farm, near Sisters Creek, Tasmania. Along with her husband, Gus James, a Northern Paiute, she worked on preserving natural resources for American Indian use. When they divorced in the early 1990s, she returned to Idaho and earned a master's degree in public administration and a PhD in political science from Idaho State University. She served for three years as the Executive Director of the Shoshone Bannock Tribes. She has continued her activism on behalf of Native people and is a distinguished professor at Boise State University, teaching Native law and governance courses. Early life and education LaNada Vernae Boyer was born in 1947 on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Bingham County, Idaho to Olive May (n√©e Burns) and Edward Queep Boyer. Her mother was a veteran of World War II and had worked as a welder in the Vancouver shipyard before returning to the reservation to raise her family. On her maternal side, her grandparents were Edith (n√©e Bartlett), a teacher descended from Teash Ocean, and John Burns, son of the Bannock chief, Tahgee. Her father had also served in the United States Navy in Vancouver and later became a council member and chair of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation of Idaho during the termination period. He represented the tribe in their land claims, and testified before the U.S. Congress on civil rights, education, and water rights in the 1960s. In the 1970s, he founded the Shoshone-Bannock Legal Research Project to continue the cultural and civic protection of American Indians. He was descended from war chief Tah mon mah. Boyer attended school on the reservation and in the American Indian boarding schools system. She was a good student, but was frequently expelled and had to change schools because she spoke out about the institutional environment. \\"Children were beaten for speaking their native language, practicing their culture, and following their own religions\\". In 1965, because there were no jobs on the reservation, Boyer moved to San Francisco, through the U.S. government relocation program. She married Theodore L. Means, a relative of Russell Means. The couple had two children but divorced in 1967. In January 1968, she enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, becoming the first Native American student admitted to the institution. Active in student politics, she led the drive to create the campus Native American Student Organization and became its chair. Student activism (1969‚Äì1973) In January 1969, Means became involved in the Third World Strike, which demanded that the university included histories of communities of color in their curricula to be taught by people of color. It united students from the Afro-American Students Union, the Asian American Political Alliance, the Mexican-American Student Confederation, and the Native American Student Organization. Means was among the students arrested during the protests and suspended for her leadership of the demonstrations, along with Manuel Ruben Delgado and Ysidro Macias. In the 1960s, it was rare for political movements to have women in leadership positions and supporting Means in her authority to lead became a symbol for indigenous feminism. Within three months, the strikes were successful in securing an agreement for launching the first ethnic studies department in the United States at UC Berkeley. Since the 1964 Occupation of Alcatraz, the island had been a powerful symbol to urban Indians in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1969, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors granted Lamar Hunt preliminary approval for the commercial development of Alcatraz. Shortly after, in October, the San Francisco Indian Center, the primary meeting place and administrative center for social services for the Bay Area's urban Indians burned. The United Council of the Bay Area proposed Alcatraz as a replacement facility and began plans to take over the island. On November 9, 1969, Means and Richard Oakes led 12 other students to occupy Alcatraz Island overnight. Lacking food and shelter, they left the following day. Distancing herself from \\"so called Indian leaders\\" who were distrusted because of their age and social status in mainstream society, Means urged the student activists to plan a return to the island when John Folster, Adam Fortunate Eagle, and George Woodward were out of town. The students chose November 20, because the leadership were scheduled to be away at a national Indian educational conference. Means, one of the few who remained on the island for the 19-month occupation, brought her 2-year-old son, Deynon and on Sundays would leave to check on her apartment and communicate with her professors. Consciously choosing to bring their families, activists hoped to convey the generational and inter-tribal nature of their quest for indigenous rights. She wrote the grant proposal for $300,000 seeking to create a cultural and university facility on Alcatraz and served in a leadership role throughout the occupation, traveling throughout the United States and speaking to raise support for their cause. She became friends with Jane Fonda, who assisted her in obtaining engagements and television appearances. The Occupation of Alcatraz became a symbol of the struggle of indigenous people to re-establish their identity and led to over 50 other occupations of government facilities. When the occupation ended, Means completed her education in 1971, graduating with honors in Native American Law & Politics. One of the founding members of the Native American Rights Fund, she served on its executive board for a decade. She relocated to Washington D.C. and enrolled in law school at the Antioch School of Law. In November 1972, she took part (as LaNada Boyer) in the occupation of the offices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The activists remained in the building for a week seeking to raise awareness of government failures in providing for American Indians and in treaty violations. Politics (1976‚Äì1990) Boyer returned to the reservation, and in 1974, ran for a seat on the Shoshone-Bannock Tribal Council. In 1976, she ran again, and was successful in obtaining a seat on the Tribal Council, serving a two-year term. During her time on the Council, the tribe was in a dispute with the Power County Board of Commissioners over zoning rights, hunting and fishing rights, and representation for non-Native residents on the tribal council. Boyer's position was that the reservation was created for tribal members and should remain within the purview of tribal law. In 1979, Boyer married Alvin Ray \\"Gus\\" James, a Paiute involved in the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation resource rights litigation with the federal government. By the early 1980s, James was living in Nevada and operating a ranch near Wadsworth, where they engaged in permaculture for their organic garden. She earned a Certificate in Permaculture Design in 1985 from the Permaculture Institute at Tagari Garden Farm, near Sisters Creek, Tasmania. She had two more children and assisted Gus in pressing the water rights case regarding the Truckee River. She also served on the Ad Hoc Committee to Protect Indian Water Rights and represented the organization in public meetings regarding proposed legislation. In 1986 the couple circulated a successful petition to reject a proposed bill to compensate the tribe for water use, but which did not contain provisions for adequate lake levels for spawning fish. That year, James also ran on the Democratic ticket for the Nevada Assembly as a representative for District 34, but was defeated. Later career (1990‚Äìpresent) James divorced and returned to Idaho. She enrolled in a master's program at Idaho State University, earning her degree in public administration. In 1997, she worked as a congressional fellow in Washington, D.C. Continuing her studies, she graduated with a PhD in political science in 1999, becoming the first member of her tribe to earn a doctorate. James began using her tribal name LaNada War Jack, and served three years as Executive Director of the Shoshone Bannock Tribes. In 2002, War Jack attended the Land Retention Summit in Epes, Alabama, which allowed advocates and activists to share their stories and advice on retaining and managing their lands. She founded a non-profit organization, the Atzlana Foundation, to focus on protecting indigenous rights to air, land, fishing, and water. War Jack has continued her activism and was involved in the Standing Rock protest of 2016, the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Alcatraz Occupation, and protests against the celebration of Columbus Day. In addition to speaking widely on Native rights issues, she has taught Native American History at Creighton University and lectured at her alma mater, UC Berkeley. She is a distinguished professor at Boise State University and teaches Native law and governance courses.

Two significant fires occurred during its lifetime, one in 1933 destroying the pavilion then dubbed the \\"Taj Mahal of the North\\", and another in 1991, the latter which condemned the pier as unsafe and demolition took place the following year in 1992. Layout An arcade existed at the pier entrance with covered walkways either side that led onto a central covered walkway. At the pier head was a ballroom, small theatre and a skating rink, the latter two having been added following widening into a T-shape configuration. The promenade was wide with 140mm timber boards laid in a longitude arrangement. History The pier was proposed around 1867 and began construction the following year, opening on 25th March 1869 at a cost of ¬£10,000 (). Built at a length of , the pier was enlarged during the early 1870s at a cost of ¬£5000 () and strengthened in 1896. A pavilion was built sometime around 1897 although was destroyed in a fire in 1933, replaced by art deco style buildings of a simpler architecture. Steamers called at a pier until 1914. Following the opening of new West End Pier, the older pier, then renamed to Central Pier, opened its own grander pavilion in July 1898, which with a capacity of 3,000 people, could hold 50% more than the newer West End Pier's five-domed pavilion. The longer traveling distance from Lancashire's cotton towns meant Morecambe was only able to attract around 10% of the numbers that Blackpool's piers attracted. Dubbed the \\"Taj Mahal of the North\\", the building was destroyed by a fire in the early evening of 31st July 1933. At the time, the pier was mostly deserted although within 30 minutes, the fire had spread to the pavilion while wind blew sparks onto nearby promenade buildings causing some to alight. A new 2000-seat ballroom was built during the mid-1930s at a cost of ¬£25,000 (). Closure and demolition During Easter of 1986, decking collapsed at the seaward end of the pier which forced its closure and a fire on 4th February the following year damaged the amusement arcade. Having been declared unsafe in 1987, another fire destroyed the pavilion and ballroom on 31 March 1991 and following a condemnation report by the council, demolition occurred in March the following year.

The espionage network was later named as the Red Orchestra by the Abwehr. Company In the autumn of 1938, Leopold Trepper made contact with Grossvogel, whom he had known while he was in Palestine in the 1920s. At the time, Grossvogel managed a business called Roi de Caoutchouc or The Raincoat King in Brussels, on behalf of its owners. He had been employed by the firm as an employee since 1929 and became the commercial director of its foreign subsidiary The Excellent Raincoat Company in 1935. In 1937, his job position changed when he became the travelling inspector for the company. Although Grossvogel was related to one of the owners by marriage and who recognised him as a good worker, he had become unpopular with his employees due to his communist sympathies and his errant behaviour during a strike at their Brussels plant in 1938. They were relieved when he suggested that he was planning to establish an independent subsidiary of The Raincoat King, to increase profits. Trepper had a plan to create a business that would be the export division of The Raincoat King and agreed with Grossvogel the plan for a new business, without telling Grossvogel of his own plans. Trepper considered it the ideal cover for an espionage network. Trepper's plan was to wait until the company gain market share, and then when it was of sufficient size, infiltrate it with communist personal in positions such shareholders, business managers and department heads. Trepper financed Grossvogel to the sum of $8000 to create the new business, that was given an unidiomatic name of The Foreign Excellent Raincoat Company. while his employees supplied the other half of the funding, around $8000-$1000 dollars. In December 1938, Grossvogel formed the new company and became commercial director of the new firm. The other directors of the firm were his brother-in-law, Louis Kapolowitz, former Belgian consul, Jules Jasper and two other Belgian businessman. Jasper's brother, Henri Jaspar was the former prime minister of Belgium, so Jaspar was seen as the ideal person to direct the company, providing it with a veneer of respectability. The business operated in the open and local regulations were followed to the letter. Contact with local government officials were maintained to ensure a veneer of respectability. At the same time in 1939, Grossvogel spent most of the year travelling around seven major sea ports that were trading with the United Kingdom to establish branches of company and putting in agents to run them. The ports were at Oslo, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Wilhelmshaven, Ostend and Boulogne. However, owing to local regulations it was difficult to create the type of branch office that was required. In fact, only one branch was created in Stockholm. In March 1939, in a plan created by Trepper, Grossvogel arranged for Red Army Intelligence agent Mikhail Makarov to become manager of a branch of the raincoat company in Ostend, replacing Grossvogel wife. Makarov planned to put a transmitter in the city, to establish communication with an agent in England. During the Conquest by the Belgium in May 1940, the Ostend branch of the Raincoat Company was bombed by the Luftwaffe.

It is a slender, erect shrub with wedge-shaped to oblong leaves and white or pale pink flowers at the ends of branchlets. It is the only philotheca with four sepals and petals. Description Philotheca virgata is a slender, erect shrub that typically grows to a height of about and has prominently glandular warty branchlets. The leaves are sessile, narrow wedge- shaped to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide and glandular warty on the upper surface. The flowers are arranged singly on the end of branchlets on a thin pedicel long. The four sepals are more or less round, fleshy and about long. The four petals are white or pale pink, broadly elliptic and about long and the eight stamens are about long and hairy. Flowering occurs from May to December and the fruit is about long with a short beak. Taxonomy Tasmanian wax-flower was first formally described in 1840 by Joseph Dalton Hooker from an unpublished description by Allan Cunningham who gave it the name Erisotemon virgatus. Hooker published the description in The Journal of Botany. In 1998, Paul Wilson changed the name to Philotheca virgata in the journal Nuytsia.

Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains north into tributaries of the Sauk River, or south into headwaters of Silver Creek which is a tributary of Skykomish River. Neighbors surrounding Silvertip include Gothic Peak, Del Campo Peak, Sheep Mountain, Cadet Peak, and Columbia Peak. Silver Lake and Poodle Dog Pass lie on the east flank of Silvertip, the Monte Cristo mining ghost town sits at the northeast base, and the Mineral City ghost town is at the southern foot of this peak. This peak was named in association with the nearby Silver Tip mining claim. Climate Silvertip Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Silvertip Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The weird thing is that there‚Äôs no difference.\\" For Film Pulse, Adam Patterson gave a generally positive review, but pondered if Arquette could be well received by the audience as an underdog: \\"This [...] may be a hard pill to swallow for some, considering he has had a seemingly successful career, lives in a beautiful home and has a family who cares for him deeply.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2020 films Category:2020 documentary films Category:American films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentaries about sports Category:Documentary films about actors Category:Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Professional wrestling documentary films ","title":"You Cannot Kill David Arquette"},{"id":"64949563","text":"Jacob Bobenmoyer (born May 28, 1997) is an American football long snapper for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL).

Unveiled to the public in August 12, 2020, it is the first one-off car built by the brand.  Specifications  The XP-1 is the first hydrogen-powered supercar and has a top range of 1016 miles, assuming that 55% of the driving is city and 45% is on the highway. The XP-1's curb weight comes out to just 1248 kg (2751 lb), typical of many other petrol-powered supercars in that field, due to an ultra- light carbon-titanium monocoque chassis and the fact that a full tank of hydrogen weighs nothing against a full tank of petrol. The 1016-mile range of the XP-1 is actually possible due to a bigger hydrogen tank than other hydrogen-powered vehicles such as the Toyota Mirai, or the Honda Clarity. The CEO of Hyperion Motors, Angelo Kafantris, wants to make an infrastructure of hydrogen-refueling stations, similar to Tesla's Supercharger network. However, there will be fewer stations to recharge tanks of hydrogen due to the extremely long range of the XP-1. The XP-1 is powered by 4 electric motors, one at each wheel, which are in turn powered by the main fuel cell, making it capable of top speeds of 221 mph (356 km/h) and have a 0 to 60 mph (100 km/h) time of just 2.2 seconds. The XP-1 comes with a 3-speed automatic transmission, and huge amounts of power are possible through ultracapacitors, which help increase the power output of the fuel cell to the electric motors.  Design  The XP-1 took nearly a decade of development from the design to actual feasibility. The body includes active aerodynamic elements that double as solar panels to get more energy. The double-barrel exhaust stacks allow deionized water vapor to come out as the only exhaust. The interior of the XP-1 boasts a 98-inch display that could be controlled by hand gestures, along with a 134-inch glass canopy. The V-wing doors (another more notable supercar to have these doors is the Lamborghini Murci√©lago) are inspired by the \\"Winged Victory of Somothrace,\\" according to Hyperion Motors.  Production  The XP-1 will go into production in 2022, with a limited run of 300 units.

It is a shrub with thin, cylindrical leaves and white flowers with a pink central stripe, usually arranged singly in leaf axils. Description Philotheca wonganensis is a shrub that typically grows to a height of with corky branchlets. The leaves are thin, scattered, needle- shaped, , sometimes glandular-warty, and channelled on the upper surface. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils on a thin, club-shaped pedicel about long. There are five broadly egg-shaped sepals about long and five white, oblong to elliptical petals about long with a pink central stripe. The ten stamens are free from each other and form a pyramid above the ovary. Flowering occurs from August to October and the fruit is about long with a short beak. Taxonomy and naming This philotheca was first formally described in 1982 by Paul Wilson who gave it the name Eriostemon wonganensis and published the description in the journal Nuytsia from specimens collected by Kevin Kenneally near Wongan Hills township in 1980.

Boone won state 4-H titles in high school for both sheep breeding and tobacco growing. He was a three-time football letterman and graduated in 1961. Boone did not go to college and instead started a family and became a farmer. By the 1970s, Boone was cultivating what was said to be the best breed of pot in Kentucky, labeled \\"Kentucky Bluegrass\\" by High Times. In the 1980s, Boone was a leader in the Cornbread Mafia, a drug organization in Kentucky dubbed the \\"largest domestic marijuana syndicate in American history.\\" During his time in the organization, he helped set up marijuana farms in his home state of Kentucky as well as surrounding states in the Midwest including Indiana, Illinois, and Kansas. He was arrested in 1987 as the ringleader of the organization and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In June 2008, police discovered Boone growing 2,421 marijuana seedlings on his farm outside Springfield, Kentucky in Washington County, but Boone escaped arrest, under threat of a life sentence without parole because the bust would be his third federal conviction under the Three Strikes Law. Boone became a fugitive and the subject of a segment of America's Most Wanted. On Dec. 22, 2016, after eight years on the run, Johnny Boone was arrested in a small town outside Montreal.

The mosque is situated opposite the railway line and Thomastown railway station. Associated with the Turkish Australian community, the mosque is owned by and the centre of the Thomastown Turkish Education and Islamic Society. History Turkish immigrants from Turkey arrived and settled in Thomastown, a working class suburb that at the time was a remote part of Melbourne. Turks which settled were often young families seeking employment or to purchase a home in the area, whereas some sent remittances to Turkey. Due to their difficult economic plight, sentiments arose among the community that desired its religious needs to be addressed to cope with the situation. In the early 1980s, the Muslims in Thomastown numbered some 30 people and the Turkish Islamic Society purchased a property to cater for its community regarding prayers. A neighbouring property was purchased to serve as a home for the imam. By 1991, the Muslims numbered 2,574 and there was community need to have a mosque. The Thomastown Turkish Education and Islamic Society was granted a permit, subject to various restrictions and conditions, to have a community centre by Whittlesea Council in February 1983. Some of those included having no more than 15 people present on the premises and an annual renewal of the permit, undertaken by Whittlesea Council between 1984-1986. In 1987, no renewal was attempted. Whittlesea Council rejected multiple applications from the Islamic Society for the property to be used for worship. Instead, the Whittlesea Council suggested was that he Islamic Society submit an application for a community centre. Misunderstandings of Whittlesea Council actions led the Islamic Society to view the Muslim community as recipients of discrimination. The Islamic Society was informed by Whittlesea Council (May 1987) that the permit expired and the property could not be used as a community centre. An application was lodged with Whittlesea Council for a planning permit for a mosque and community centre. Four locals, after being informed through an advertisement, were opposed to the plans. By November 1987, deliberation by Whittlesea Council of the application resulted in a Refusal Notice. Three reasons were given, that congestive parking would affect the residential area, increased noise, in particular at night, and funeral ceremonies conducted on the property perceived as detrimental. Whittlesea Council also stated that the neighbouring Islamic Society premises could only be used for residential purposes and a fence should be reinstalled between both properties. Another application was put forward by the Islamic Society in January 1988, later withdrawn after talks with Whittlesea Council. In February, a new application was submitted for a community centre and the Islamic Society was told that no religious activities could take place and the fence needed to be reinstalled. During 1988, Whittlesea Council permission was given for 20 people to be present at any given time at the community centre. The restrictions from the Whittlesea Council motivated the Islamic Society to submit an appeal at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. During July 1988, the Tribunal extended the permit until March 1990 and allowed for a mosque to be built. The Islamic Society held discrimination toward them as a reason for the difficulties it encountered. Identified as such by the Islamic Society were Whittlesea Council actions like its recommendation that the word \\"Islamic\\" or \\"Islam\\" on signs not be displayed in return for assistance, opposing parking over traffic concerns and having gone to court 10 times, or giving a church funds for repairs, but not them.

Schrunk served as district attorney of Multnomah County, Oregon, United States from 1981 until 2012. He is believed to be the longest- serving district attorney in Oregon. Schrunk was born in North Portland in 1942. His father, Terry Schrunk, was elected mayor of Portland when Mike was a teenager. He was a football star at Roosevelt High School and at Portland State University, and joined the United States Marine Corps at the height of the Vietnam War. After eight Portland narcotics officers were implicated for misconduct in 1981, Schrunk, sought pardons from the governor for 58 people convicted. In 1985 a Portland police officer killed Lloyd Stevenson, a Black man, using a chokehold. It was ruled a homicide while under Schrunk's investigation, but a grand jury convened by Schrunk declined to indict either of the officers involved, citing the wording used in the homicide ruling as insufficiently definitive. Simultaneous with Stevenson's funeral, two officers sold T-shirts to fellow officers that read \\"Smoke Em, Don't Choke Em.\\" The two officers were fired, but reinstated by a union arbitrator. After three men beat and killed Ethiopian national Mulugeta Seraw in Southeast Portland in 1988, Schrunk's office prosecuted them. Schrunk described them as members of East Side White Pride, which he stated was the largest skinhead group in the state. In 1989 Schrunk called on the county to devote more funds to drug use and gangs. Programs he championed have been replicated across the country. He played a part in launching the nation's second drug court; twenty years later, there were 2500 such courts in the United States. In 2002 Willamette Week searched the trash of Schrunk, then-mayor Vera Katz, and then-chief of police Mark Kroeker, for a story in response to a police decision endorsing the search of citizens' trash during investigations. Of the three targets, only Schrunk responded with poise and good humor. A 2019 Oregon Supreme Court ruling which referenced the story established that privacy rights do in fact extend to an individual's trash. In 2003 a star witness of Schrunk's ended up imprisoned himself, in a bizarre and complex case regarded as a blemish on Schrunk's record. By 2009, Schrunk was regarded as the most influential politician in the county. That power was exemplified by his open refusal to try cases against a specific judge he believed was too sympathetic to suspects. In 2010, due to budget constraints, he made a controversial decision to treat a number of illegal acts as crimes. Schrunk never sought higher office. Upon his retirement in 2012, Schrunk endorsed Rod Underhill, who was elected to the office unopposed in 2012 and 2016.

He was Chief Justice of Ontario from 1897 to 1900.  Biography  Burton was born in Sandwich, Kent, England, on 21 July 1818, the second son of Admiral George Guy Burton, Royal Navy, of Chatham. He was educated at the Rochester and Chatham Proprietary School. In 1836, Burton moved Upper Canada to Ingersoll, Oxford County, where he began the study of the law in the office of his paternal uncle, Edmund Burton. After his articles, he was called to the Bar in Easter Term, 1842, and practised law in Hamilton, where acquired a large practice. He identified himself with the Reform Party in politics, and took an active part in various local elections. He was frequently asked to enter Parliament, but declined to concentrate on his practice. He formed various partnerships, but was always the guiding spirit of the firm, and became known from one end of the Province to the other as a sound and learned lawyer. His connexion with Mr. Charles A. Sadleir lasted for many years, and the firm of \\"Burton & Sadleir\\" was one of the best known in the western part of the Province. On June 9, 1850, Mr. Burton married Miss Elizabeth Perkins, daughter of the late Dr. F. Perkins, of Kingston, Jamaica, and niece and adopted daughter of the late Colonel Charles Cranston Dixon, of the 90th Regiment. He had many wealthy merchants and corporations for his clients, and was regarded as an adept in the law relating to railway companies. He was for many years Solicitor for the City of Hamilton; also for the Canada Life Assurance Company, of which he was a Director, having been elected to that position soon after his elevation to the bench. In 1856 he was nominated a Bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and when that body became elective by the profession at large, under the Ontario Act of 1871, he was elected to the position. In 1863 he was appointed Queen's Counsel. Burton was appointed a Judge of the Court of Error and Appeal on May 30, 1874, moving to Toronto. Upon the elevation of Mr. Justice Strong to the Supreme Court at Ottawa, in October, 1875, Mr. Burton became the Senior Justice of the Court of Appeal. Burton was appointed Chief Justice of Ontario in 1897 and was knighted in 1898. The former Township of Burton was named after him.

It is the third installment in its Mr. Driller series, and the last released for arcades. Controlling one of seven characters, players must make it to the bottom of the level by destroying colorful formations of blocks. G introduces several new ideas to the series, such as power-ups, a story campaign, and online multiplayer. The game was developed by Project Driller, the nickname given to Namco's Creative Department #2. Production was headed by series producer Hideo Yoshizawa and Yasuhito Nagaoka. G was intended as the last game in the series, leading to the addition of a larger cast of characters and proper introduction to the in-game world. It was also designed to bridge connections with Dig Dug, an older Namco arcade game that served as inspiration for Mr. Driller. The soundtrack was composed by Go Shiina, featuring a distinct mix of acid house and jazzy J-Pop compositions. Mr. Driller G performed well in arcades, leading to a home release on the PlayStation the same year. The game was well-received both at release and retrospectively, and is cited as one of the best games in the series. Reviewers praised its visual presentation, amount of content, soundtrack, and additions to the gameplay of its predecessors. In 2013, it was digitally re- released in Japan for the PlayStation Network. Gameplay Susumu Hori destroying a group of blocks in the PlayStation version. Mr. Driller G is a puzzle game similar to Puyo Puyo (1990) and the classic arcade game Dig Dug (1982). The story revolves around Susumu Hori, the titular Mr. Driller, and his friends trying to stop the villainous Dr. Manhole and his Ankoku Drillers from destroying the world with giant drills. G has a greater emphasis on story compared to its predecessors, with stylized anime-esc intermissions preceding levels. Players choose from one of seven characters to play as: Susumu Hori, the protagonist; Ataru Hori, Susumi's self-contained older brother; Taizo Hori, the protagonist of Dig Dug; Puchi, Susumu's dog; Anna Hottenmeyer, a rival driller from Germany; and Holinger-Z, a drilling robot. In each level, players must make it to the bottom of a well by destroying, or \\"drilling\\", colorful formations of blocks. Destroying blocks results in those above it falling and connecting with similarly-colored ones; should four or more matching blocks connect, they will be destroyed, which is useful for creating chain reactions. Blocks will also fall if there is nothing underneath to support them, which can crush players that are underneath them. Players will need to manage their constantly-depleting oxygen, which acts as both a health bar and a timer. Oxygen is replenished by collecting blue air capsules, while oxygen is lost by destroying brown X-marked blocks. If a player is next to a block with an open space above it, they can \\"jump\\" to that block. There are also power-up items scattered around levels, such as those that provide a protective shield or refill the player's oxygen to 100%. The PlayStation version of Mr. Driller G features multiple additions to the game. The main focus is Scenario Driller, an adventure-based story mode where players control each character through a series of levels as they ultimately team up to stop Dr. Manhole. Dristone Mode takes a different approach from the core gameplay, instead playing more like an action role-playing game. Players lose one percent of oxygen by destroying a block, instead of losing it gradually. Destroying certain blocks reveals gems known as Dristones, which are stored in the player's inventory. Depending on their color, Dristones can have a wide array of effects, such as destroying all blocks of a same color on the screen or warping the player back to a previous section. In the multiplayer mode, two players could compete against each other online by connecting to Namco- operated network services through a computer or mobile phone. Development and release Mr. Driller G was designed by Project Driller, the nickname given to Namco's Creative Department #2. Production was lead by series producer Hideo Yoshizawa and R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 director Yasuhito Nagaoka. Yoshizawa intended G to be the final entry in the series; as such, it was designed to expand on the Mr. Driller universe with an extensive cast of characters and to bridge the connection between Mr. Driller and its predecessor series Dig Dug. The soundtrack was composed by Go Shiina, who is known for his work on franchises such as Tales and God Eater. Where as the first two Mr. Driller games' music were known for its acid house inspiration, the one in G adds new types of music such as jazzy J-Pop. Minoru Sashida, the head graphic designer for Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere, was responsible for the game's bright, visually-distinctive menu interface and graphics. The designs for the new characters were provided by Kaori Shinozaki, as she had done for the first Mr. Driller. Namco demonstrated Mr. Driller G at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union (AOU) tradeshow in February, presented alongside the lightgun shooter Vampire Night. According to Edge magazine, it attracted considerable attention from attendees. The game was released in Japan in March, running on the company's PlayStation-based System 10 arcade system board. A home release for the PlayStation was released in Japan on November 22, 2001, which added new modes and gameplay features. Computer and Video Games reported that Namco was looking to find a publisher for the game in Europe, however G ultimately remained Japan-exclusive. On June 26, 2013, Mr. Driller G was digitally re- released for the PlayStation Network in Japan under the Game Archives series. Reception According to Game Machine, a Japanese arcade trade publication, Mr. Driller G performed well in arcades; its April 15, 2001 issue reported that it was the second best-selling arcade game in Japan, behind Capcom's Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper. The PlayStation version sold 10,938 copies during its first week on the market, and was awarded the Silver Hall of Fame award by Famitsu. Both at release and retrospectively, Mr. Driller G was well received. Greg, a writer for the French magazine Joypad, believed it was the best Mr. Driller game up to that point. Critics were pleased with the game's amount of content and additions to the gameplay of the series. Masumi Kawamoto of Game Watch called it \\"the culmination of the series\\", recommending it to those who haven't played the original or Mr. Driller 2 yet. Mediums Kat Koller agreed, applauding its wide array of playmodes and inventive gameplay mechanics. In a preview, Computer & Video Games writer Paul praised the addition of multiplayer and power-ups, features that were previously absent from its predecessors. The gameplay and visuals also received praise. Retronauts co- founder Jeremy Parish outright stated G is \\"essentially the pinnacle of the Mr. Driller arcade experience\\", and worth importing from the Japanese PlayStation Network. Kawamoto shared his admiration of the game's sound effects and music, in addition to the extensive cast of characters. Koller applauded the presentation for its slick aesthetic and its characters for being visually-distinctive from one another. He concluded his review with: \\"It builds on what works in the two games before it, and it successfully establishes the basis for the two that would come later. Mr. Driller G is Great. And now you know what it stands for.\\" NotesReferences Category:2001 video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Namco games Category:Namco arcade games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Mr. Driller G"},{"id":"64950815","title":"Kansas's 20th Senate district"},{"id":"64950933","text":"Jacky Hunt-Broersma is an amputee ultramarathon runner.

The game was held at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 29, 1976. In a matchup of two Big Ten Conference teams, the Indiana Hoosiers defeated the Michigan Wolverines 86‚Äì68 to earn the university's third championship. The Hoosiers' victory concluded the last undefeated season in Division I men's college basketball. Background=Indiana The Hoosiers were coached by Bob Knight, who was in his fifth season with the team. Indiana was coming off of a 1974‚Äì75 season in which they had a perfect 18‚Äì0 record in Big Ten Conference play and remained undefeated overall until losing in the regional finals of the 1975 NCAA Tournament. Among the players from the 1974‚Äì75 team lost to graduation was Steve Green, the Hoosiers' top scorer. However, they retained a veteran core, and the 1975‚Äì76 squad had four seniors and one junior included as regular starters. Forward Scott May was the Hoosiers' leading scorer in 1975‚Äì76, averaging 23.5 points per game. Center Kent Benson, the team's leading rebounder with 8.8 rebounds, contributed 17.3 points per game, and forward Tom Abernethy averaged 10.0 points. Guard Bob Wilkerson led Indiana with 5.3 assists per game and added 7.8 points, and fellow guard Quinn Buckner posted averages of 8.9 points and 4.2 assists. All five players later competed in the National Basketball Association, as did forward Wayne Radford. Other players on the Hoosiers' roster included guards Bob Bender, Jim Crews, and Jim Wisman, and forward Rich Valavicius. Indiana began the season as the number- one ranked team in the country. The team's first game, on November 29, 1975, was against UCLA, the previous season's national champions. By a 20-point margin, the Hoosiers opened with a win. After an 83‚Äì59 win over Florida State, the Hoosiers had two consecutive games against top-15 teams. On December 11, against Notre Dame, the Hoosiers withstood a late Fighting Irish rally to post a 63‚Äì60 victory. Four days later, they were forced into overtime against Kentucky before winning by nine points, 77‚Äì68. After four wins by margins of over 20 points, the Hoosiers faced 17th-ranked St. John's at Madison Square Garden, winning 76‚Äì69. Entering the beginning of the Big Ten schedule, Indiana's record stood at 9‚Äì0. The Hoosiers' first Big Ten game was on January 3, 1976, at Ohio State. By a 68‚Äì66 score, they improved to 10‚Äì0 on the season. After a 17-point win over Northwestern, they played on the road against 19th- ranked Michigan, in a game they won 80‚Äì74. Two double-digit victories followed, before a four-point win against Purdue. Having improved to 18‚Äì0 with three further wins, Indiana again faced Michigan, and the Wolverines took them to overtime before the Hoosiers managed a five-point triumph. During the rest of the regular season, the Hoosiers' only game with a margin of less than 10 points was their second meeting with Purdue, who lost to Indiana 74‚Äì71. The Hoosiers maintained their number-one ranking throughout the season, and entered the NCAA Tournament with a perfect 27‚Äì0 record. In the first round of the NCAA Tournament, Indiana again faced St. John's, winning by 20 points. Alabama gave the Hoosiers a more competitive game in the regional semifinals, but by a 74‚Äì69 margin, the Hoosiers advanced to the regional final, where they defeated Marquette 65‚Äì56. That win gave the Hoosiers a spot in the Final Four, where they won 65‚Äì51 over UCLA to claim a berth in the national championship game. It was the third title game appearance for Indiana, and its first since 1953. Michigan Johnny Orr, who was in his eighth season with the team, was Michigan's head coach in 1975‚Äì76. The Wolverines reached the 1975 NCAA Tournament, but were eliminated in their first game. Michigan had three future NBA players on its roster. Guard Rickey Green was the team's leading scorer with an average of 19.9 points per game. Forward Phil Hubbard added 15.1 points per game, and led the Wolverines in rebounding with 11.0 per game. Freshman guard Alan Hardy also played in the NBA later in his career. Forwards John Robinson and Wayman Britt, and guard Steve Grote, averaged double-figure points per game. Other players on the Wolverines included centers Tom Bergen and Joel Thompson, and guard Dave Baxter. After beginning the season with a 90‚Äì63 win against Vanderbilt on December 2, the Wolverines lost at eighth- ranked Tennessee by one point, 82‚Äì81. Michigan posted five consecutive victories before playing another ranked team, number 10 UNLV, who defeated them 108‚Äì94 in Las Vegas. The loss left the Wolverines at 6‚Äì2 entering their Big Ten schedule. Michigan won its first three Big Ten games, including a 95‚Äì72 result against 16th-ranked Minnesota on January 5. The six-point loss to Indiana was the Wolverines' first in conference play, and left the team at 9‚Äì3 on the season. Victories over Ohio State, Michigan State, and Purdue followed, before a one-point defeat at Illinois. After two further wins, the Wolverines posted their second loss to the Hoosiers. Over the last eight games of the season, they won seven, all but one of which were conference games; only Minnesota defeated them during this stretch. The Wolverines had a 21‚Äì6 record prior to the NCAA Tournament, and their 14‚Äì4 record in Big Ten games was second-best in the conference. The Wolverines' first opponent in the NCAA Tournament was Wichita State, who lost to Michigan by only one point, 74‚Äì73. In another close game in the regional semifinals, the Wolverines advanced over Notre Dame by an 80‚Äì76 final score, before they defeated Missouri by seven points to secure a Final Four appearance. In that round, the Wolverines faced Rutgers; like the Hoosiers, the Scarlet Knights entered the round undefeated for the season, with a record of 31‚Äì0. However, Michigan jumped out to a 17-point lead by halftime and went on to give Rutgers their first loss, 86‚Äì70. The victories by Indiana and Michigan set up an NCAA championship game between teams who were members of the same conference, the first time that had happened. The Wolverines had appeared in one previous NCAA tournament final, losing in 1965. Game summary The contest was held on March 29, 1976, at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The announced crowd was 17,540 fans. A third-place game was held between the two losers of the national semifinals, Rutgers and UCLA. The Bruins won 106‚Äì92, as Marques Johnson led all scorers with 30 points. In the first half, the Hoosiers were forced to deal with the absence of starter Wilkerson, who was injured within the first three minutes and taken to a hospital. The Wolverines made 61.5% of their field goal attempts, and entering halftime they held the lead, 35‚Äì29. Benson and May helped the Hoosiers gain a foothold early in the second half, combining to score the team's first 10 points. The pair, along with Buckner, were responsible for all but two of the Hoosiers' first 38 points in the half. Indiana tied the score at 39‚Äì39; although Michigan did claim a 43‚Äì41 lead six minutes into the half, the teams were tied six further times. Britt, who was defending May, found himself in foul trouble and was forced out of the game with four fouls less than four minutes into the second half; he ultimately fouled out, along with Hubbard. With 10:15 remaining in regulation, the teams were tied, 51‚Äì51. Twenty seconds later, May scored a basket to put Indiana in front. The Hoosiers scored the next three points; Abernethy contributed two points before Benson added a free throw that made the score 56‚Äì51. At the time Hubbard fouled out, there were under eight minutes left and the Hoosiers held a six-point advantage. Fifteen minutes into the second half, Indiana had extended their lead to double digits, 69‚Äì59. The Hoosiers were in the midst of a 22‚Äì8 scoring run that gave them a comfortable lead of 73‚Äì59 inside the last four minutes of regulation. Indiana was able to expand their lead further before the end of the game, wrapping up an 86‚Äì68 victory that gave them the national championship and a perfect record for the season. It was the third national title won by the Hoosiers, following triumphs in 1940 and 1953. They became the fourth Division I program to conclude a perfect season with an NCAA Tournament title, and the team's 32 wins tied the 1956‚Äì57 North Carolina Tar Heels for the most by an NCAA champion that ended the season unbeaten. The 1975‚Äì76 Hoosiers were the seventh men's national champion with a perfect record. As of 2020, they are the last Division I men's basketball team to finish undefeated for an entire season. Statistical summary The Hoosiers converted 32 of their 61 field goal attempts, or 52.5%. May hit 10 of his 17 shots and scored a game-high 26 points while adding eight rebounds; 18 of his points were scored in the second half. Benson had a team-high nine rebounds and 25 points, 15 of which came in the second half. Buckner added 16 points and five steals, while Abernethy also had a double-figure point total, 11. Wisman had six assists, the most by a player on either team. Michigan had a lower field goal percentage than Indiana, converting at a 47.4% rate (27 for 57). Green was the top scorer for the Wolverines, posting 18 points on 7‚Äì16 shooting. Grote had 12 points and Britt had 11, while Hubbard scored 10 points and had 11 rebounds, the high amount for both teams. Robinson had a team-high five assists and contributed eight points. Aftermath Having lost several starters from the 1976 NCAA title game to graduation, the Hoosiers posted a 16‚Äì11 record in the 1976‚Äì77 season, including an 11‚Äì7 mark in Big Ten play, and did not qualify for the 1977 NCAA Tournament. The team returned to the tournament the following season, reaching the regional semifinals before being eliminated. Over the next decade, Knight's Hoosiers won two further national championship games, in 1981 and 1987. Having set a program record with 25 wins in 1975‚Äì76, Michigan surpassed its mark the following season, when it had a 26‚Äì4 record, including 16 wins in 18 Big Ten games. The Wolverines reached the NCAA Tournament, where they were knocked out in the regional finals. After 1977, the team did not return to the tournament until 1985. Michigan went back to the national championship game in 1989, winning the program's only NCAA title.

He was governor of the province of Congo-Kasa√Ø in the Belgian Congo from 1925 to 1929. Early career (1883‚Äì1929) Joseph Beernaert was born on 21 April 1883. He was attached to the Ministry of Colonies in 1909. He made many trips to the Belgian Congo during his term of office. He was commissioner general, assistant to the governor of the province of Congo-Kasa√Ø from 1925 to 1929. From 1928 he was secretary general, assistant to the governor general of the colony. Governor of Congo-Kasa√Ø (1929‚Äì1933) Beernaert replaced Alphonse Engels as governor and deputy governor-general of Congo-Kasa√Ø on 19 June 1929. His headquarters were at L√©opoldville. In 1931 there was an economic crisis in the Belgian Congo triggered by problems in Belgium, the primary market, and an overvalued currency, leading to reduced exports. The head tax (imp√¥t indig√®ne) increased, and villages were unable to pay it. In 1931 there were widespread disturbances in the Kwango District of Congo-Kasa√Ø, which the Ministry of Colonies later attributed to new administrative structures, availability of Force Publique units and overreaction by administrators. Additional troops were transferred to Kwango and Kikwat, and the district administrations declared martial law in the most unsettled areas. The troops acted as punitive columns. At Mukuku in August 1931 troops killed 56 people in a single encounter. Word of the violence spread, and villagers fled before the columns reached them, leading to optimism among the authorities that the rebellion was calming down. The Dengese people in particular were influenced by millenarian cults that talked of driving out the Europeans. In √âquateur Province, Governor Charles Duchesne responded with limited police action, and by the end of February 1932 the crisis there was over. Beernaert was less sympathetic to the Dengese, and on 20 October 1932 declared a state of emergency under decrees of 1906 and 1920, applied martial law to five chefferies and dispatched troops to restore order. The commissioner of Sankuru District blamed fetishism, claiming that traditional religious views had been distorted into claims that expelling the Europeans would solve all problems. He sent Force Publique troops into Kole Territory to force the villages to submit to authority. Beernaert held office until 1933. His successor was Paul Ermens, appointed on 17 August 1932. Later career (1933‚Äì1950) Beernaert was promoted to Major-General on 26 March 1939. Until 26 December 1939 he commanded the 1st Cavalry Division. On 26 December 1939 he was appointed General Officer Commanding 2nd Cavalry Division. In 1944 he was Inspector-General of the Army. He died in 1950.

Weinberg is an American-born Canadian former television producer and businessman and convicted felon best known as the co-founder of the Cinar animation studio (later to be known as Cookie Jar Group), and its co-CEO during a scandal that eventually brought down the company. In 2014, he was charged with 26 counts of fraud in Montreal. Two years later, Weinberg was sentenced to 9 years in prison.  Cinar  In 1976, Weinberg met his future wife, Micheline Charest, in New Orleans, where he attended Tulane University. The two organized an event for a women's film festival, and worked at distributing foreign films to US theatres. The couple moved to New York and formed Cinar as a foreign film distributor. In 1984, the company relocated to Montreal, and changed its focus to children's television. Scandal In March 2001, an internal audit revealed that about $122 million (US) was invested into Bahamian bank accounts without the boardmembers' approval.Swift, Michael. Cinar had also paid American screenwriters for work while continuing to accept Government of Canada grants for content. The names of Canadians, most notably Micheline Charest's sister, Helene via the alias 'Eric Alexandre' (Eric and Alex Weinberg are the names of Charest Weinberg's sons), were credited for the work, allowing Cinar to benefit from Canadian tax credits. While the province of Quebec did not file criminal charges, Cinar denied any wrongdoing, choosing instead to pay a settlement to Canadian and Quebec tax authorities of $17.8 million (CAD) and another $2.6 million (CAD) to Telefilm Canada, a Canadian federal funding agency. The value of Cinar stock plummeted, and the company was soon delisted. In 2001, as part of a settlement agreement with the Commission des Valeurs Mobili√®res du Qu√©bec (Quebec Securities Commission) Charest and Weinberg agreed to pay $1 million each and were banned from serving in the capacity of directors or officers at any publicly traded Canadian company for five years. There was no admission of guilt and none of the allegations have been proven in court. In March 2004, Cinar was purchased for more than $140 million (US) by a group led by Nelvana co-founder, Michael Hirsh. Charest and Weinberg reportedly received $18 million (US) for their company shares. In August 2009 Claude Robinson, a graphic artist and writer, won a copyright case against Cinar, Weinberg, Charest and Co. in relation to his work, Robinson Curiosit√©, which was plagiarized for the internationally successful animated series Robinson Sucro√´. Arrest On March 2, 2011, Weinberg was arrested in connection with his involvement in the scandal. On January 17, 2014, former CFO Hasanain Panju pleaded guilty to undisclosed crimes. The judge noted these crimes were \\"disgraceful\\" and placed a publication ban on details surrounding the trial. Panju was sentenced to four years in prison.

Its activities include receiving reports of adverse drug events and taking necessary action to remedy problems. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation established the program in 2010. It is part of the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission. History Many developed countries set up their pharmacovigilance programs following the Thalidomide scandal in the 1960s. India set up its program in the 1980s. This general concept of drug safety monitoring went through different forms, but the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation established the present Pharmacovigilance Program of India in 2010. Now the program is well integrated with government legislation, a regulator as leader, and a research center as part of the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission. Activities As of 2018 there were 250 centers around India capable of responding to reports of serious adverse reactions. One of the challenges of the organization is training doctors and hospitals to report adverse drug reactions when patients have them. The Pharmacovigilance Program makes these reports itself, but ideally, such reports could originate from any clinic. The Pharmacovigilance Programme seeks to encourage a culture and social expectation of reporting drug problems. The organization uses VigiBase software to manage its case reports. One of the successes of the program was detecting adverse effects of people in India using carbamazepine. While this drug is safer among people native to the Europe, people of South Asia have different genetics and are more likely to experience problems when using it. Other countries could not have been able to detect this problem, and the Pharmacovigilance Programme's detection of it was a success story. Collaboration The establishment of the Pharmacovigilance Program made India a more attractive international destination for foreign companies to bring clinical trials research. Understanding the quality of India's pharmacovigilance programme is key to international researchers conducting trials in India. The program collaborates both in India and internationally with the World Health Organization on projects for safe medication. As a collaborating center, the Pharmacovigilance Programme assists the WHO in developing international policy for other countries to manage their own drug safety programs. While the United States and Europe have pharmacovigilance systems which are developed well in some ways, the Indian programme has more and specialized expertise to apply for the unique circumstances of India. The Pharmaceutical industry in India produces more drugs than any other national industry. Because of the large amount of drugs and the many countries which import them, the Indian program monitors in some ways more than anywhere else.

A review in The Lancet concluded that \\"the cases are too recent and too few in number to enable any definite opinion to be formed as to the value of the treatment, but we believe the author to be thoroughly convinced of the truth of his theory.\\" A negative review in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences commented that \\"his few experiments are insufficient and his deductions are poorly founded. The book is quite unconvincing to the scientific reader.\\" In contrast, a positive review in the International Journal of Medicine and Surgery stated that \\"the book is written interestingly and deserves the careful perusal of all who are interested in the subject of cancer.\\" In 1924, Walter Sydney Lazarus-Barlow chief of the Cancer Research Department at Middlesex Hospital disputed Ross's potassium treatment for cancer.

NDCTR 2019 and section 3.7.1 to 3.7.3 of ICMR guidelines requires that all researchers conducting a clinical trial must publicly document it in the Clinical Trials Registry - India. Various government agencies and laws regulate clinical trials. The Drugs Controller General of India grants approval for clinical trials and is the top level authority which specifically oversees clinical trials. The Drugs Controller is a part of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation and answers to that organization. Both of those organizations answer the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare as the highest level government agency overseeing everything related to medicine and health. The Indian Council of Medical Research governs the professional and ethical behavior of the doctors and scientists. The Pharmacovigilance Program of India tracks reports of harm from the use of drugs. Outside of the central government, each state has its own regional regulatory agencies with some input into governing trials. Since the early 2000s there have been international discussions from science, medicine, and business sectors which observed that India is both an attractive and challenging place to conduct medical research. Favorable characteristics of India included that there are many trained workers including health professionals, there is a large and diverse population, and that the cost of research is relatively low in India in comparison to other countries capable of doing research. Challenging characteristics include lack of research capacity, evolving and uncertain government regulatory infrastructure, diversity of languages, and the need for a culture of research participant confidentiality. In the years around 2010 there were various scandals in media and popular discussion in which companies conducted clinical trials in unethical ways. There were many discussions raising many complaints, including that researchers were not getting informed consent from research participants, and that the medical research was dismissing high rates of injury and death among research participants. Following the 2013 case Swasthya Adhikar Manch v. Union of India in the Supreme Court of India, various government agencies reformed their regulations to make clinical trials more ethical. There have been many changes with various responses. Among the responses, some say that the clinical trials are safer for participants, and others say that the new rules favor large domestic and international companies over other stakeholders. Government regulation Since 2009 the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization has mandated that anyone conducting clinical research in India must preregister in the Clinical Trials Registry ‚Äì India before enrolling any research participants. Various government agencies and laws regulate clinical trials. The Drugs Controller General of India grants approval for clinical trials and is the top level authority which specifically oversees clinical trials. The Drugs Controller is a part of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation and answers to that organization. Both of those organizations answer the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare as the highest level government agency overseeing everything related to medicine and health. The Indian Council of Medical Research governs the professional and ethical behavior of the doctors and scientists. The Pharmacovigilance Program of India tracks reports of harm from the use of drugs. Before 2005 India had a \\"phase lag\\" policy for clinical trials from foreign countries. In this policy, all clinical research in India had to begin at phase one. A 2005 change to liberalize the policy begin allowing companies to skip earlier phase trials to start with more risky trials in India, if there was prior research doing those earlier trials in another country. Clinical trials have to be monitored by an ethics committee which registers with the government. A study examining all registered ethics committees in 2017 reported that few of them were in academic medical institutions, which is the global norm and desirable for such organizations. Some legal commentators describe how the Constitution of India provides fundamental rights in India which apply to participants in clinical trials. Overview of trials Various reports have discussed the number of clinical trials which the Indian government has approved per year. A theme of these reports is that the number of trials generally increases, and that changes in the rates of the number of trials approved corresponds with regulatory changes. { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" + style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Count of clinical trial approvals - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year !! scope=\\"col\\"  Trials - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2008  65 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2009 391 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2010  500 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2011  262 } The government approval process for clinical trials is sporadic. A 2013 report commented that in one day, the Indian government approved 50 trials after not having approved any in the past six months. The same report noted that the rate of government approval changes by year. A single study examining a sample of academic papers which reported the results of dentistry- related clinical trials in 2011-12 found that the reporting was poor. Ethics Various commentators have noted that there is a conflict between the opportunity for business investors to conduct research in India and the rights and safety of the volunteer research participants who participate in these clinical trials. Discussions of this issue often propose some kind of balance where researchers do trials, but not too many or too quickly, and that the trials collectively support ethical and safety practices which community stakeholders, academic researchers, doctors, and the government all create together. Wealthy companies in countries with strong economies routinely seek to purchase clinical trial research in India as they seek comparable results at lower cost. As the wealthy country has the power of its money, and as typical participants in clinical trials are volunteers with no understanding of the money involved or power dynamics, many ethical issues arise. A 2018 study on informed consent found that in a set of cancer-related trials, nearly all research participants had serious misconceptions about their research participation. A common misconception was an expectation of improved health care. The study recommended improved research participant education as a way to make the management of trials more ethical. Government talks of permitting human challenge studies in India began in 2017. The Translational Health Science and Technology Institute expressed support for allowing these trials at that time. One 2015 audit of 5 years of trials at a single site found that the expected percentage of people invited to participate declined to do so. That study said that this rate of refusal was an indication of an appropriate level of persuasiveness in study participant recruitment. An evaluation of about 50 clinical trials in 2007-08 found that the reported results had higher than expected rates of false positive errors due to the statistical methods the researchers used. Comparison to other countries India's clinical research is a subject of comparison with that of China, countries in Africa, and countries with similarly sized economies. India is both an attractive and challenging place for both Indian and foreign clinical research for various reasons. A common motivation for foreign companies doing research in India is relatively lower cost in as compared to comparable research elsewhere. India was a single nation with a large, diverse population. Many potential research participants in India had not previously had medical treatment, and clinical trials get better data from such people. India also has a well trained workforce and many research sites which met international good clinical practice standards. India's national health system provides a lot of care in large urban hospitals. This centralization is also favorable to conducting research. One challenge to doing research is a shortage of research sites which could conduct research and expand the sector. This shortage has various causes, including lack of educational programmes leading health professionals into research as a career track, the lack of experienced administrators who could expand study capacity, and a national research environment with either insufficient quality control processes. When researchers conduct trials in multiple countries collecting patient-reported outcomes is useful. However, to make sense of any such reports from India, then researchers have to adapt the instructions for local Indian culture. A 2011 evaluation found that a sample of clinical trials in India complied with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials. To make India more compliant with international standards the government amended the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 in 2005 and 2008. At the end of 2010 India was conducting 7% of phase III and 3% of phase II trials globally. In 2019 India was hosting about 1% of the world's clinical trials. Social awareness There was perception in the research community that the media had usefully brought public scrutiny of the ethics and conduct of clinical trials. While researchers and investors wanted trials, they also wanted a reliable research environment which the public and media could trust. Various changes in government regulation sought to make trials safer for research participants and investment in trials. The response to having changes in general was positive, although there was intense debate from stakeholders on the individual changes. The criticism tended to argue that the changes were too strict. There was criticism that medical journals in India were publishing the results of trials without requiring that the articles describe compliance with regulatory standards including Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials. Injury In 2013 the Supreme Court of India ordered the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to police and prevent multinational companies from conducting illegal clinical trials in India. There is public information reporting how many people die during clinical trials. It is also known that when people die during trials in India, the trial organization rarely pays compensation to the family of the deceased. The research industry has formulas for calculating how much money to pay when someone dies in a clinical trial. Foreign influence A 2011 paper noted that low operational costs, improved government regulation, and existing business infrastructure have made India increasingly attractive as a place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials. Some clinical trials based in the United States also do research in India. A 2019 examination of 10 years of United States children's health research found that of about 9000 trials registered about 120 of them also included clinical trials in India. This study found that these trials were for health issues which actually affect children in India, and that consequently, the research was appropriate for India. Some researchers study global practices for managing clinical trials and apply lessons learned to multiple countries at once, with India being among them. When foreign companies conduct only phase III trials in India, the researchers conducting those trials tend to not publish as many scientific insights as researchers typically do in other circumstances. There is a foreign expectation that perhaps because India has relatively less regulation than foreign countries which export clinical research, then perhaps the researchers in India would have more insights. The reasons for this are not clear, but one reason may be that researchers who oversee the trial for longer periods and not just the last phase tend to care more about publishing research results. When financial investment is the priority then foreign sponsored research tends to focus on the health concerns of the host country rather than the health needs of India. A characteristic of a healthy clinical trials sector in a country is prioritizing the most urgent health concerns of the population. Some researchers advocate for reflection on India's research priorities. A review of clinical trials from 2006-13 foundation that when India hosted clinical research for either the United States or European Union, and when research in India led to the availability of a new drug in those places, then in 40% of cases India did not also get domestic approval to use that drug. This low rate of domestic drug approval demonstrates that the research is not actually a medical benefit to the local population in India. More frequent drug approvals for drugs tested in India and approved elsewhere would be a public benefit. Business Various reports describe the global industry of outsourcing clinical research from one country to another, and present India as one of the lower cost countries for conducting trials. A 2007 paper reported that in the past few years the annual revenue of the clinical trials industry had grown 25% annually. Companies conducting clinical trials in India often do so through a contract research organization. Since the 2000s there has been recognition that India is an attractive place to grow an industry of drug research. A 2008 report described the entry of multinational companies into India for clinical trials research as a frenzy. At the time there was a perception that the industry was going to grow fast for the foreseeable future in a way that favored the research investor. Most investors wished into enter India through contract research organizations. Foreign investment in India has resulted in a concentration of international research centers in India. Larger research companies are growing faster than small ones, and larger ones are capturing the influence to propose government regulations more quickly than other stakeholder groups. The investment from foreign companies has resulted in more education, professional training, and jobs in the clinical research sector. However, there has been an obvious sudden increase of influence by both foreign and domestic large companies as this research field has developed. The establishment of the Pharmacovigilance Program made India a more attractive international destination for foreign companies to bring clinical trials research. History Until 1995 the United States, Europe, and Japan conducted most clinical trials. The first evaluation of good clinical practices for research in India was done in 1995. A 2004 paper advised that India lacked the research environment which most clinical researchers require. Because of the risks, that paper advised that foreign countries would not gain benefit from outsourcing clinical trials to India. 2005 to 2013 India agreed to comply with the TRIPS Agreement in 2005. The agreement changed the way India recognizes intellectual property and changed the research environment in way that enabled foreign companies to conduct clinical trials in India. Foreign contract research organizations were able to conduct clinical trials in India from this point. An estimate in 2007 predicted that India would be conducting about 20% of the world's clinical trials by 2010. Further speculation of the time was that India would be the preferred global destination for many sorts of clinical trials. Among all that growth, a major concern was establishing regulation to improve the ethics and integrity of clinical research in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research established the Clinical Trials Registry - India in July 2007 with the intent to improve India's clinical trials research environment. In 2008 a representative for the Indian Council of Medical Research remarked that increased government regulation would be necessary to ensure research integrity and public safety in clinical trials. In 2008 a group of Indian medical journals made a pledge that from 2010 onward, they would only publish research on clinical trials if that trial was appropriately registered. Prior to this, there were essays considering whether the time was right to do this. In 2009 there was a significant expansion in clinical trials done in India. Beginning in 2013 there were many regulatory changes which had the effect of reducing the number of clinical trials while also drawing attention to ethical challenges of clinical research in India. In May 2012 the 59th report of the Indian Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare issued a report criticized the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization. The report complained that the organization was underfunded and understaffed. Because of lack of staff, the organization would never be able to perform its duties. The staff who were there were working under a misguided mandate to \\"meet the aspirations ‚Ä¶ demands and requirements of the pharmaceutical industry\\", which was an error and a conflict of interest against protecting the health of the public. Another problem that the report identified was that although India requires drug companies to conduct at least phase III trials in India if other countries have already approved the drug, for some undocumented reason, the Drugs Controller was granting approvals without this research. Also, in 3 cases, drugs which neither had approval in other countries nor trials in India got approval for undocumented reasons. 2013 to 2019 By 2013 the problems with clinical trials had become troublesome to the point of media and public attention. When the media criticized trials, those reports tended to say that the researchers were exploiting the research participants by treating them as experimental guinea pigs. The media attention and public discussion resulted in researchers conducting fewer trails. The number of trials went from 529 in 2010, to about 250 in 2012, to about 100 in 2013. The response to this was that various government agencies organized regulatory changes to resolve many problems at once. Researchers reflected on the causes of the problems, and the necessary changes to prevent future problems, and the regulatory reform which would support the changes in science and industry. One change was that the government named a list of responsibilities and divided among the ethics committee, the investigator, and the sponsor. This way, each of those agents in a clinical trial take responsibility for their parts.From this point the researchers must register all clinical trials into the Clinical Trials Registry - India. Another change was that ethics committees associated with clinical trials had to themselves register with the Drugs Controller General of India. The informed consent process had to include all information both in the text document and a verbal description. No principal investigator can oversee more than three trials at once. Anyone funding a principal investigator has to disclose to the government how much they are paying. The government regulator set up audit process for ethics committees. The researchers must report serious adverse events quickly to the study sponsor, the ethics committee, and the government regulator. All trials will comply with publicly available payment formulas for calculating how much money to give in case of someone dying or experiencing any other serious adverse effect. In the informed consent process there were was consensus for addressing some communication issues. One was explaining that the control group in a placebo-controlled study will get no treatment. Another was explaining that the drug candidate is experimental, and not necessarily an effective therapy. There was also recognition that many administrative, procedural, and reporting functions needed national standardization. In 2018 the government established a process for approving drugs in India, without clinical trials, in exceptional circumstances such as an epidemic. 2019‚Äîpresent In 2019 the government enacted the New drugs and clinical trials rules 2019. These rules provided more guidance for how the ethics committee of a clinical trial should oversee it. Critics of the rules said that the government compromised public safety in favor of industry and financial interests. Special populations When Indian people consider volunteering for clinical trials they frequently have the same reasons for either joining or declining. Motivations for joining include intent to gain health benefit, altruism, in respect of the request of their physician, to get money for participating, and to get an opportunity to learn more about health and research. Reasons for not wanting to participate in a trial include mistrust of the organizations managing the research, fear of trial risks, stress, the obligation of participating, fear that the trial will not respect their personal information, creating a burden on their friends and families to support them in the trial, and the lack of available information about the research in their own local language. People with schizophrenia require specific cultural support to participate in clinical trials. A 2009 report described how innovation in phase 1 cancer research trials could have a big impact on Indian health. Various studies in the United Kingdom have described how British researchers can make trial participation easier for South Asian people living in the UK. A 2011 report encouraged teaching clinical research in the curriculum of medical students to prepare them to conduct trials. A 2019 survey found that respondents in India were cautious in saying that they would approve of clinical trials related to the sexual health of adolescent girls.

The game was created in New York. Five dice and paper to record players' scores are all that is needed. A player rolls the five dice and if the throw does not include a 2 or 5, they receive the score of the total numbers added together. That player is also able to roll the dice again. When a player rolls the dice and any of them contain a 2 or 5, they score no points and the dice that includes a 2 or 5 is excluded from any future throws that they make. A player's turn does not stop until their last remaining die shows a 2 or 5. At that point, the player \\"drops dead\\" and it becomes the next player's turn. The highest total score wins.

Early life Agnos was born in Lima, Ohio, in 1936, and had served in the United States Air Force for some time prior to moving to Arizona in 1961 to join the Phoenix Police Department. Agnos would go on to serve as Phoenix Police's assistant chief prior to winning a term as the Maricopa County Sheriff in 1988. Tenure as Maricopa County Sheriff During his tenure as sheriff, Agnos instated 100% pay for employees who were hurt on the job, a practice that was later adopted by other agencies. Controversy Agnos was at the center of controversy following the Waddell Buddhist temple shooting. In the aftermath of the shooting, MCSO deputies arrested five men from Tucson, Arizona based on a tip from a psychiatric patient. It was later discovered that the men were coerced into confessing, with investigators extracting false confessions by exaggerating evidence, badgering them with leading questions, and threatening the death penalty. One of the five men arrested was freed after he provided an alibi, but the other four, dubbed by the media as the \\"Tucson Four\\", remained in custody even though no physical evidence linked them to the crime. Charges were eventually dismissed, and their innocence was established in late 1991 when two men were found to be the suspects responsible. Members of the Tucson Four later filed lawsuits against Maricopa County, and in 1994, two of the people who sued received $1.1 million each, while another received $240,000. The investigation was criticized by the Maricopa County Attorney at the time, as well as Dennis DeConcini, who was Arizona's Senator at the time. For his part, Agnos said he believed the arrests were justified, and that the confessions were worthy of murder charges. Publicity generated by Agnos' handling of the temple shooting led to his defeat by Joe Arpaio in the November 1992 general election. Death Agnos died on December 20, 2004, at his home in Sun City West. It was reported at the time that Agnos died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but Agnos' wife said he had been battling terminal cancer.

The battle was claimed to have taken place at a place called Akumcham, where the Builsa united and defeated the leader of the Zabarma warriors.  History  According to historians, Babatu was said to have hailed from Indunga, a town in Niger He recruited people from Grunshie Mossi, Hausa, Fulani as fighters who took part in slave raids in the Northern Territories. It was said he conquered an area that stretched from Ouagadougou in the north to what is now Upper East region and certain parts of Northern region in Ghana. It is said Babatu brought the people of Zabarma state to its peak of power and prestige in the late 1880s.  Background  It was said certain events took place before the confrontation between the two sides. Babatu attacked the Builsa for about three months. He captured many warriors of the village of Wiaga as prisoners. Some of the warriors rushed to Sandema and he pursued them. Babatu was defeated in a battle that took place in a hill between Sandema and Fiisa called Azagsuk. The warriors from Navrongo, Fumbisi, and Kunkwa united as one Builsa. The Zabarma were defeated with the help of white men. It is claimed the battle took place between 1890 and March 1897. Other sources claim it took place between the market and where the current Old Primary School is in 1896.  Legacy  After the Zabarma were defeated, their weapons were collected as relics of war and kept in Fiisa which has a shrine in Sandema. Slaves under Babatu were freed by the Builsa. The Feok Festival is celebrated every year in the third week of December to mark their victory and encounter with the slave raiders and also the War dance after it became a public event in 1972. The festival means abundance of food.

She is a regular contributor to left-wing alternative media organisation Novara Media, for which she presents and produces video content. She has contributed to other publications such as The Guardian, The Independent, The Washington Post and The Telegraph and appeared on Sky News and BBC Politics. Gebrial is a PhD candidate at LSE researching topics of the gig economy under neoliberalism, climate justice, anti-racist social movements and the effects of gender and race on labour-based capitalism.  Early life  Gebrial was born to Egyptian parents in 1993. Her father emigrated to the UK from Egypt at the age of 25. Gebrial studied English literature at the University of Warwick and the University of Oxford before going on to study Human Geography MSc at LSE. Since September 2017, she has been studying for a PhD at LSE. Career In 2017, Gebrial was the editor of a special issue of the journal Historical Materialism which focuses on identity politics. Gebrial co-edited the volume \\"Decolonising the University\\", published by Pluto Press in 2018, with Gurminder K. Bhambra and Kerem Ni≈üancƒ±oƒülu in which they discuss how colonial thinking can be challenged inside and outside the classroom across the world's universities. The book was inspired by a movement of South African students in 2015 to remove another statue of Cecil Rhodes in the University of Cape Town, drawing comparisons and contrasts with the same issue in Oxford and how colonialism is fought in a former colony or its native nation-state. Likewise, in the book, Gebrial makes the argument that \\"the role of the historian is to simply 'reveal' facts about pasts that are worth revealing\\" through the role of the institution.  Political views and activities  Gebrial describes herself as being an anti-capitalist and a feminist and these two elements are interlinked. In her view, feminism cannot be compatible with capitalism. While a student at Warwick in 2013, Gebrial participated in protests against the university for its alleged links to sweatshops in the Far East and South Asia who were involved in producing branded clothing for the university. She said that her support, along with other students, was to \\"take a stand against the exploitation of third world workers\\". During her time at University of Oxford, Gebrial was involved in anti-racist activism to remove the statue venerating slave trader and British imperial officer Cecil Rhodes in 2015. Commenting on the movement, she said that \\"taking down the Rhodes statue would not immediately fix or reverse all of this\\" but that such a move would signal that the university wants to \\"seriously engage with this problem\\". Similarly, Gebrial at a 2017 Oxford panel stated that the existence of the Rhodes statue at Oriel College \\"stands as a metaphor for the empire\\", for which she rejected the idea of removing it simply to create a safe space and instead to be \\"representative of a wider change in the university\\". This line of activism has been expanded more broadly to what Gebrial calls \\"decolonising the curriculum\\" in order to remove the colonial slant that has been placed on the teaching of British history in which there is little focus placed on historic black and brown voices both within Britain and in its colonies. This was partly inspired by her experience where she says \\"I studied history to A-level standard and I never once engaged with the Empire\\" and it is this that creates a \\"cognitive dissonance\\" in the general population where \\"people really don't know what the realities of the British Empire were\\". Gebrial defended the removal of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol in June 2020. From July 2016 to September 2017, Gebrial was the campaign co-ordinator of People & Planet, a student advocacy organisation focussed on creating solutions to the climate crisis across borders.

TorrentFreak reported that the sites had audiences of millions and that for a time, KissAnime was \\"the most visited pirate site in the world\\".  History  The website, as well as KissManga, was shut down on 14 August 2020 after about 8 years of existence (the .com website had been registered in 2012 and a more recent .ru domain in 2016), citing copyright complaints related to new Japanese laws on online piracy. In 2017 the site was also a target of a subpoena by US company FUNimation, which described its actions as aimed at \\"someone... disseminating infringing content on a MASSIVE scale, for profit.\\" In 2018 the site was blocked in Australia.  Reactions  The site has been universally criticized for its copyright infringement and occasionally for advertising that contained malware, but it has been praised for popularizing anime and manga, and for providing access to content that is not legally available in certain areas, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. One commentator noted that \\"fans are furious\\" as \\"in many countries they really have nowhere to go\\" for the kind of content that was hosted on the site. Another commentator has described the outcome as both \\"a major strike to media piracy [and] a blow to the history of anime\\", noting that the website has also been an archive of rare titles, such as the 1993 original video animation, Battle Angel. Many of the works may be lost as not only are many not legally distributed in many countries, but in some cases are only available on physical media, which is subject to degradation over time, and are not streamed legally anywhere in the world.

Habitat in the region is distinguished from the Tonle Sap freshwater swamp forests ecoregion that runs through the middle, as that ecoregion is only seasonally flooded.  Location and description  There are four main sectors to the ecoregion. The smallest is northwest of Tonle Sap Lake on the outer edge of the lakes wetlands. A second sector is to the east of the Tonle Sap River. A third stretches across the Cambodia-Vietnam border on the left bank of the Mekong, and the fourth spreads along the south side of the Mekong Delta. The ecoregion is set back from the saltwater-affected coast, which is in the Indochina mangroves ecoregion. In much of the Vietnamese portions of the ecoregion, the water table rises to the surface, and the soils area heavy with organic material.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical savanna climate - dry winter (K√∂ppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year, and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, and is drier than the average month.  Flora and fauna  85% of the region has been brought under cultivation; only 15% of the land is forested. On alluvial clay soils in the region there are extensive wetlands featuring sedge and grass species such as Phragmites karka, hardy sugar cane (Saccharum arundinaceum, and Coix gigantea. A type of swamp found nearest the brackish mangroves are known as 'paperbark swamps', dominated by Long-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca leucadendra), a member of the myrtle family.

Traffic stop  According to a Georgia State Patrol (GSP) report, around 9 p.m. on Friday, August 7, 2020, Thompson attempted to stop Lewis's Nissan Sentra for a broken taillight on Stoney Pond Road near Sylvania, Georgia, in a rural part of Screven County about 60 miles northwest of Savannah. According to a Lewis family attorney, Lewis had gone to a convenience store to buy a grape soda for his wife and was on his way home at the time. Lewis did not stop and Thompson briefly chased Lewis down several rural roads. Thompson forced Lewis's car to stop in a ditch using a \\"precision intervention technique\\" or \\"PIT maneuver\\". According to Thompson's report of the incident, after Lewis's vehicle stopped, Thompson pulled up alongside and drew his handgun as he exited. Lewis revved his car's engine and Thompson activated the light on his gun. Thompson saw Lewis with both hands on the steering wheel, \\"wrenching the steering wheel in an aggressive back-and-forth manner towards me and my patrol vehicle.\\" Thompson wrote that Lewis \\"was trying to use his vehicle to injure me\\" and that, \\"Being in fear for my life and safety, I discharged my weapon once.\\" According to prosecutors, Thompson fired one shot \\"at some point\\", striking Lewis in the face and killing him. According to an attorney for Lewis's family, Thompson shot Lewis \\"almost immediately\\" after the PIT maneuver. Thompson reported that he unsuccessfully tried to help Lewis after shooting him. Lewis was pronounced dead at the scene. Thompson was not injured. According to their attorney, Lewis's family did not learn about his whereabouts or death until around 1 a.m. the next day.  Prosecution  Thompson was fired, arrested, and charged with felony murder and aggravated assault on August 14, 2020. He was booked into Screven County Jail. An autopsy of Lewis's body is being conducted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.  Impact  A candlelight vigil was held for Lewis on August 14 in front of Sylvania City Hall with funeral services held the following day. According to the Associated Press, Thompson \\"was charged amid a national outcry over racial injustice\\" after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Rayshard Brooks. Lewis's family attorney described the decision to fire and arrest Thompson only a week after Lewis's death as a surprise, which he believed was a direct result of protests surrounding the police killings of Floyd and Breonna Taylor earlier in 2020. The Georgia NAACP described the killing as \\"a case of racial profiling\\".

History Graveyard The Kukli Bey Mosque lies near city center in the Sara√ßhane Quarter, historically known for the tanning and gristmill trades. The mosque is located near the Halveti Teqe and the Gazi Mehmet Pasha Hammam (Turkish bath). In 1531, it was built by Mehmet Kukli Bey, then governor of a region stretching from Thessalonica to Bosnia. The southwestern-facing porch was demolished in 1963 during road widening. 1977 and 1994 renovations plastered the interior walls and removed the murals, while the stone roof was replaced with clay tile; more renovations were done from 2000 to 2003. In 2008, the porch was rebuilt, but the interior burned in an electrical fire in 2009. Description The mosque is a 9 x 9 m square built from stone mortared with lime. An externally hexagonal roof originally built from stone slabs is layered above an octagonal interior dome underneath. The fa√ßade plaster shows clearly the masonry structure, in which irregular river stones are bound by lime mortar. Wooden hatches connecting the fa√ßade to the central structure are also visible, as is an entry door on the southwestern side. The door is wooden with a semi-arched frame of carved stone, and a nearby sign identifies the mihrab. In the southern corner, close to the door, is the hexagonal-based stone minaret, a rounded structure topped by a conical kylah or dome on top of the ≈üerefe or balcony, the latter covered in rich geometric ornamentation.

From 1385 to 1389 Ruissel crafted jewelry mainly for Philip the Bold.After 1389 he also executed works for Charles VI of France and his brother Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans and Louis's wife Valentina Visconti, Duchess of Orl√©ans. From 1390, he held the court title of Valet de chambre to Charles VI. Among Ruissel's early works is the Three Brothers, created in 1389 for Philip's eventual successor John the Fearless. The Brothers (now lost) were for a time part of the Crown Jewels of England. The piece consisted of three rectangular red spinels of 70 carats each in a triangular arrangement, separated by three round white pearls of 10-20 carats each, with another pearl suspended from the lowest spinel. The middle of the pendant was a deep blue diamond cut as a pyramid or octahedron, and weighing about 30 carats. Charles VI commissioned 32 works by Ruissel. 17 of these commissions stipulated that a duplicate of the work be made for his younger brother, Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans, as a gift. Ruissel made 18 gold buttons decorated with broom flowers and heraldic mottos for the 1396 marriage of Isabella of Valois to King Richard II of England. In 1400, Ruissel was commissioned to make a large image of the Trinity for Charles, using jewels ‚Äì scores of pearls, and also diamonds, rubies, and sapphires ‚Äì taken from a brooch in the form of a white-enameled golden hart and large golden collar which Richard II had given to Charles, and which Charles had had disassembled and melted down shortly after Richard's 1400 deposition and death. Ruissel also made the piece now known as the Calvary of King Matthias Corvinus, a crucifix executed in gold, white enamel, pearls, and other gems, made using the Ronde-bosse technique. Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, commissioned the work as a gift celebrating the New Year in 1403 for her husband, Phillip the Bold. It is now in the treasury of Esztergom Basilica in Hungary. For Henry V of England Ruissel created a golden necklace with white enamel bears, which were one of Henry's heraldic devices. The necklace was later gifted to Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Germany and Hungary, on the occasion of his visit to England in 1416.

This record arrived at time when many fans thought the band might be finished making new music. They recorded their third album Sordid Fiction in 2004 but when that record didn't generate the response the band was hoping for, they disbanded in 2007. A few years later, in 2011, they released a remastered 20th Anniversary edition of their debut album Shakespeare My Butt and got back together for a very successful tour that culminated with a sold- out show at Toronto's Massey Hall and discussions for a fourth album were underway. These plans were scrapped in 2013 when original guitarist Stephen Stanley announced he was leaving the band. Lead singer Ron Hawkins said, shortly after his departure, that the future of the band was very much in doubt. \\"The Low is in a 'dust settling' phase right now. Stephen leaving was a surprise and no one in the band is quite certain as to why he left. We're not clear as to whether or not a Lowest of the Low with a new guitarist makes sense.\\" In 2015, the plans became clearer as Brian MacMillan took over lead guitar duties and two new singles 'The Kids Are All Wrong' and 'In The Blink Of An Eye' were released. These singles indicated that the band was very much alive and the new album arrived two years later. There were more lineup changes by the time the new record came along. MacMillian was replaced by Michael McKenzie (formerly of Universal Honey) and Dylan Parker, who had replaced original bassist John Arnott on the previous album was now gone with Derrick Brady in his place. Brady has a long history with Hawkins having played in two of his other bands, The Rusty Nails and The Do Good Assassins. Despite his exit, Parker gets credit for the germ of the idea that inspired the record when he suggested \\"what about something kind of like a 'Shakespeare My Butt 2.0?' Hawkins embraced the idea and went to work writing new material. \\"The feeling that I might be writing a spiritual successor to 'Shakespeare' was very much alive while I wrote 'Do The Right Now.' I liked the idea of 52-year old me having a conversation with 25-year old me.\\" The album doesn't just feature Hawkins re-examining the 'Shakespeare' era as a songwriter, it actually features two songs that didn't make the cut back in 1991 when that record was released. \\"Something to Believe In\\" and \\"Gerona Train\\" were both songs that were in the bands repertoire back then but they had never been recorded. \\"We were already playing them in (pre-Lowest of the Low band) Popular Front. We thought, 'That's old!' back then and the joke is we did them 25-years later.\\" The omission of 'Gerona Train' from Shakespeare My Butt was something Hawkins regretted. \\"'Gerona Train' was about the Spanish Civil War. There are two songs on 'Shakespeare' about the Spanish Civil War so it was kind of meant to be a trilogy of songs but for whatever reason we decided to leave the third one off the album.\\" The album was recorded at Revolution Recording in Toronto with co-owner Joe Dunphy serving as the records co- producer along with Hawkins. Not only was the material a throwback to the band's first album when it came to the writing process, but Hawkins feels that carried through into the studio as well. \\"There is a certain punky spirit to it, there is a certain kind of mixing of jangly rock and punk and folk music. There are the sort of journalistic lyric writing that I didn‚Äôt do as much of later, and those things in my mind really defines the Lowest of the Low. And there‚Äôs that ragged sense, because of the nature of the personalities of all the guys in the band, that the wheels might come of it at any time.\\" Two months before the album was set for release, the first single, \\"Powerlines\\" debuted. Hawkins felt the track established the retrospective tone of the new record. \\"The song 'Powerlines' is kind of central. It's the history of the band in three verses, with the final one about how you gotta go for it. The line ‚Äúscrape your pretty practiced autograph in the windshield frost‚Äù is about how you can pose all you like about how you don't care if you make it, but at a certain point you need to just own it and admit that you've got a lot of things you wanna say, and you hope that people listen.\\" In Gerrod Harris' review for Canadianbeats.ca he said \\"Lowest Of The Low have hit a high point with their returning record, Do The Right Now. The album is nostalgic of a time when indie and alternative rock wasn‚Äôt driven by electronic textures and synths, or in the opposite direction- simply acoustic progressions, banjos, and stomp boxes...In the end, Do The Right Now may be one of the strongest alternative and indie records to come out this year and is more than worth checking out.\\" When the band signed a deal with Warner Music Canada in 2018, \\"Do The Right Now\\" was given a vinyl release as part of the boxset \\"Shakespeare My Box!!\\" Track listing All songs written by Ron Hawkins # \\"Powerlines\\" ‚Äì 3:41 # \\"Gerona Train\\" ‚Äì 4:19 # \\"Do the Right Now\\" ‚Äì 1:58 # \\"Saint Spurious\\" ‚Äì 3:41 # \\"Minuteman\\" ‚Äì 5:36 # \\"The Hard Way\\" ‚Äì 2:19 # \\"Something to Believe In\\" ‚Äì 4:11 # \\"Don't Let It Lay You Low\\" ‚Äì 3:06 # \\"Sister Jude\\" ‚Äì 2:34 # \\"Infinite\\" ‚Äì 4:29 # \\"Immortal\\" ‚Äì 3:09 # \\"California Gothic\\" ‚Äì 4:30 References Category:2017 albums Category:The Lowest of the Low albums ","title":"Do the Right Now"},{"id":"64955826","text":"The Shey Gompa (Nepali: ‡§∂‡•á ‡§ó‡•Å‡§Æ‡•ç‡§¨‡§æ, She gumba) is a Buddhist monastery located in the She Phoksundo rural municipality of the Dolpa district in Nepal at an elevation of 4200m.

He is chief executive officer of the Royal Entomological Society and National Insect Week Coordinator in the UK.  Education and Career  Tilley is from Cheshire and studied his biology undergraduate degree at the University of Sheffield graduating in 2005. He received his Ph.D from the University of York in 2010, studying the parasitoid wasps of shore flies in lettuce and celery crop glasshouses. He then worked as a research manager at Stockbridge Technology Centre (formerly Horticulture Research International) while coordinating National Insect Week. In 2012 he joined the Royal Entomological Society to work as Director of Outreach and Development, rising to Chief Executive Officer in 2018.  Research  Tilley's research looked at the parasitoid wasp Aphaereta debilitata as a biological control agent of the shore fly Scatella tenuicosta, a pest in glasshouse crop soil. He found that the wasps reduced numbers of flies emerging from soil and subsequently there was a decrease in lettuce damage levels. He also found that levels of algae growing on the soil were negatively correlated with A debilitata and concluded that growers should encourage algal growth, as part of a conservation biological control programme. He has also been involved in research on the interactions between beneficial insects such as hoverflies and parasitoid wasps and in finding gaps in knowledge about the conservation of beneficial insects  Science Communication  As well as National Insect Week, Tilley coordinates other outreach activities such as Insect Festival, the Great Bug Hunt which runs in collaboration with the The Association for Science Education and is editor of INSTAR with Adam Hart. He has organised international symposia on insects and the public, is an expert contributor to the Guinness Book of World Records and has written about insects for a range of different publications including the National Association of Environmental Education.

The Pontifical Foundation Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) stated that the pandemic has not become \\"just a medical, social and economic problem, but also a pastoral problem\\", which leaded ACN to start encouraging a special program for the actions of priests and religious against the virus spread. In March 2020 all public Masses were suspended in Vatican City and Italy due to the coronavirus pandemic. These suspensions began in late-February in the Archdioceses of Milan and Venice and were extended to the rest of the Italian peninsula on 8 March. Setting an example for churches unable to celebrate public Masses due to the lockdown, Pope Francis began livestreaming daily Mass from his home at Domus Sanctae Marthae on 9 March. Outside Italy, Mass in cities around the world were suspended in the days that followed. At the height of the outbreak in Italy, on 27 March, Pope Francis imparted the Urbi et Orbi blessing, normally reserved for Christmas and Easter, from an empty Saint Peter's Square following a prayer for the health of all the world.. For the prayer service, Francis brought the crucifix from San Marcello al Corso which had processed through the streets of Rome during the miraculous plague cure of 1522. The prayer service concluded with Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, as church bells were rung and sirens blared across Rome.. The spread of COVID-19 soon slowed in Italy, and public Masses were allowed to resume on 18 May, with Pope Francis celebrating his last daily live-stream Mass and first public Mass since the lockdown on the centenary of the birth of Pope John Paul II. All over the world, many churches have suspended the presence of the faithful in their Masses, and resorted to virtual services for broadcasting the celebrations, such as live streaming or other ones, like television and radio. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place at the end of Lent ‚Äî Christian penitential period ‚Äî, would be canceled. Some dioceses ordered their churches to be closed to the public, while in other dioceses, such as the Archdiocese of New York, although they canceled the Masses, their churches remained open for prayer. In Spain, many cities canceled their Holy Week festivities. This event is usually celebrated with parades and significant collections with tourism; in Seville, it was the first time that events were canceled since 1933. Due to the interruption of several Catholic religious activities (if not their totality), Pope Francis greatly encouraged the prayer of the Holy Rosary.

Subspecies  The subspecies of Ochus subvittatus found in India is: * Ochus subvittatus subradiatus Moore, 1878 ‚Äì Khasi tiger hopper Distribution This species is found from Sikkim to Arunachal Pradesh in India, and in Bhutan, Nepal and several places in Myanmar. Description Both wings of upside are iridescent Van Dyke brown. In the forewing, several bright yellow streaks divided by the veins placed obliquely beyond the end of the cell; or even immaculate; with all the cilia are lighter yellow than the spots when present and broadly interested with the brown opposite to the end of the veins. In underside, both wings and the bases of the cilia are rich in Van Dyke brown throughout with darker than the above; veined and margined with rich chrome yellow. In the forewing the costal margin is little beyond its middle, the costal and subcostal nervules to the costal and outer margins. The extremity of the third median nervule veined, and the external machines, and the extremity of the third median nervule veined, and the outer margin bordered, with chrome-yellow, so that the wings may be described as increasingly bordered from base to the apex, and increasingly from the apex to the sub- median nervule with yellow streaked with dark brown. The hindwing is yellow bordered, with the yellow veins broadly pointed on both sides with yellow. The upperside of the head, thorax and the abdomen are dark Van Dyke brown with a yellow underside. Habit and habitat The tiger hopper is mostly found in the high evergreen forests that experience ample rainfall. It prefers to fly close to the ground. The flight is weak and follow the fluttering pattern. Shaded or semi-shaded forest tracks are its preferred area. Males are sometimes found puddling in damp soil or wet rock. Females are hardly seen. They also spotted basking in the sun, opening their wings. Seasonality The flight period for the tiger hopper is from April to October.

She was the leading light of the Edinburgh Ladies Association and together they funded the education at Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia in the nineteenth century. Life Mackay was probably born in Brora in 1777 or 1778. Her parents were landed gentry even if their estate was small. They were Isabella (born McLeod of Geanies) and John Gordon of Carrol. She married John Mackay of Rockfield on 3 May 1803 and the following year they bought a small estate at Tarbat, Easter Ross which they called \\"Rockfield\\". They were the largest landowners in Tarbat. Her husband was briefly in the civil service in India until he was declared blind. He was given a pension and returned to Scotland. They were Presbyterians and their father-in-law was Reverend Thomas Mackay who was a University of Edinburgh graduate and a previous minister of Lairg. They enjoyed a high social status and they lived in a number of places in England in Scotland, including the highlands, Devon and London. In 1823 they returned again to Edinburgh and settled, although they spent their summers at \\"Rockfield\\" which they maintained and improved. In 1832 she appealed to the Edinburgh Ladies' Association to support her interests. She was concerned with supporting the Scottish Presbyterian people in Nova Scotia in Canada. In particular the colony on Cape Breton Island. She and the association acted as one and Mackay would write to prominent Scots for support. The association recruited teachers in Scotland and sent them to Canada to help the children of the island to learn, become good Presbyterians and to learn Gaelic. In 1837 the Boularderie Academy opened and Mackay is credited with remotely causing this to happen. The academy offered lessons about English grammar, geography, Latin, algebra, and navigation. Moreover, she was arranging bursaries for leading Cape Breton Island students to attend the Free Church College in Halifax. The college would welcome these students as it was Mackay who paid for a third of that college library's costs. Death and legacy Mackay died in Edinburgh in 1850. By this time \\"her\\" Association was funding three teachers, five ministers, eight catechists and three students in Cape Breton Island. Laurie Stanley-Blackwell published \\"The Well-watered Garden: The Presbyterian Church in Cape Breton, 1798-1860\\" in 1983 which identifies Isabella Gordan Mackey as a \\"whirlwind\\". In 1995 a memorial of thanks was raised to her and the Edinburgh Ladies Association. Thanks to them Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia enjoyed teachers, ministers, an academy, books and bibles to improve their spirits. The stone is at the position of where the academy was. The academy was staffed by a young couple who taught children there and they would write to the association that sent them. Alexander and Catherine Munro were both trained at David Stow's Glasgow Normal School and Catherine was appointed so that the academy could also teach female students. The 1995 memorial (above) mentions particularly the Boularderie Academy calling it the \\"Boularderie (Munro) Academy\\".

The 2020 United States Postal Service crisis is a series of events that have caused backlogs and delays in the delivery of mail by the United States Postal Service (USPS). The crisis stems primarily from changes implemented by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy shortly after taking office in June 2020. The delays have had substantial legal, political, economic, and health repercussions. There is controversy and speculation about whether the delays are unintended consequences of restructuring operations, or if they were intentionally created for political and/or financial gain. DeJoy has supported and donated to President Donald Trump, who has publicly linked his opposition to emergency funding for the Postal Service to his desire to restrict voting by mail in the 2020 elections. On August 18, 2020, under heavy political and legal pressure, DeJoy announced that he would be \\"suspending\\" the policy changes until after the November 2020 election. He testified to the Senate on August 21, and to the House of Representatives on August 24, concerning the changes and their effects.  Background  The USPS has had a history of budget deficits dating back to a 2006 law requiring it to prepay retiree health benefits 75 years in advance, a provision to which no other government agency or private corporation is subject. This law, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, was passed during a lame-duck session, and shepherded through the Senate by Senator Susan Collins of Maine. According to Tom Davis (the bill's sponsor), the Bush administration threatened to veto the legislation unless they added the provision regarding funding the employee benefits in advance with the objective of using that money to reduce the federal deficit. The agency's struggles were compounded by the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and subsequent recession, which caused overall mail volume to fall by one-third, and again by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effects. Changes Businessman and Trump campaign megadonor Louis DeJoy was sworn in as postmaster general on June 15, 2020; he is the first person since 1992 to assume the position without any prior experience in the United States Postal Service. Upon taking office DeJoy immediately began taking measures to reduce costs, such as banning the use of overtime and extra trips to deliver mail. After criticism, DeJoy admitted that these measures were causing delays in mail delivery, but said they would eventually improve service. DeJoy also reorganized USPS leadership and staffing. The changes were described in a memo DeJoy released on August 7, 2020. Hundreds of high-speed mail sorting machines were dismantled and removed from postal facilities, raising concerns that mailed ballots for the November 3 election might not reach election offices on time. It was later explained that such machines are taken offline every year in response to diminishing volumes of letter mail, and that 671 of the machines (about 10 percent of the total) in 49 states had been slated for removal this year, 618 of them by August 1. After DeJoy's announcement that he would suspend his changes, the Postal Service's director of maintenance instructed employees that \\"they are not to reconnect/reinstall machines that have previously been disconnected without approval from HQ Maintenance, no matter what direction they are getting from their plant manager.\\" Mail collection boxes were removed from the streets in many cities. However, the Postal Service has been removing mail collection boxes as a cost-cutting measure for years ‚Äî between 1985 and 2011, the number of mail collection boxes was reduced by 60% ‚Äî so it remains unclear if the removals are connected to DeJoy's changes. After photos of boxes being removed were spread on social media, a Postal Service spokesman said they were being moved to higher-traffic areas but that the removals would stop until after the election. On August 18, after weeks of heavy criticism and the day after lawsuits against the Postal Service and DeJoy personally were filed in federal court by several individuals, DeJoy announced that he would suspend all the changes until after the November election, \\"to avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail.\\" He said he would reinstate overtime hours, roll back service reductions, and halt the removal of mail sorting machines and collection boxes. However, 95 percent of the mail sorting machines that were planned for removal had already been removed, and in testimony to the Senate, DeJoy expressed that he had no intention of replacing them.  Legal issues  Federal law prohibits any employee of the Postal Service from delaying mail. The Postal Service inspector general has opened an investigation into the changes made by DeJoy, including any possible conflicts of interest stemming from his $30 million ownership stake in XPO Logistics, which processes mail for the USPS. Several state attorneys general are also beginning investigations to determine if DeJoy violated state election laws and are coordinating their efforts. As of August 18, 2020, attorneys general from at least twenty states have filed federal lawsuits against the USPS and DeJoy. One lawsuit is being led by Washington state, joined by Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin; a second is being led by Pennsylvania, joined by California, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, and North Carolina. All of the participating attorneys general are Democrats. The state lawsuits were filed in spite of DeJoy's announcement that he would be suspending the changes. On September 17, 2020, federal judge Stanley A. Bastian, in response to the lawsuit led by Washington state, issued a temporary injunction barring the Postal Service from proceeding with the planned changes, describing them as \\"a politically motivated attack on the efficiency of the postal service.\\" U.S. representative Bill Pascrell requested the New Jersey attorney general to empanel a grand jury to investigate whether any state election laws were violated; the AG declined comment. Arizona secretary of state Katie Hobbs said, \\"In Arizona, it's against the law to 'delay the delivery of a ballot.' I've asked Attorney General Brnovich to investigate recent changes at USPS, and whether or not the Trump administration has committed a crime.\\" A number of individuals, including candidates for public office, have filed lawsuits in federal court against the Postal Service, DeJoy and Trump in response to the crisis, and many more are expected. Questions have been raised about a possible conflict of interest involving DeJoy's connections to XPO Logistics. The company received $14 million in contracts in ten weeks between June and September 2020. The figure for the corresponding period in 2019 was $3.4 million.  Political issues  Voting by mail has become an increasingly common practice in the United States. The share of voters nationwide who submit their ballots by mail has grown from about 8 percent in 1996 to about 21 percent in 2016. Members of the military, their families, and military contractors are able to vote by mail if they are not currently stationed in their permanent home location; more than 600,000 such ballots were cast in the 2016 election. The coronavirus pandemic of 2020 is predicted to cause a large increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of congregating at polling places. For the 2020 election, a state-by-state analysis concluded that 76 percent of Americans are eligible to vote by mail in 2020, a record number. The analysis predicted that 80 million ballots could be cast by mail in 2020, more than double the number in 2016. Because of the operational changes causing delays in mail delivery, the Postal Service sent a letter to 46 U.S. states in July 2020, warning each state that the service might not be able to meet that state's deadlines for requesting and casting absentee ballots.  Donald Trump's involvement Starting in April 2020, President Donald Trump began to speak out against voting by mail, claiming without evidence that it is subject to massive fraud, and threatening to take steps to prevent states from sending absentee ballots to voters. Despite his false claims of fraud, Trump himself voted by mail in recent elections, as did First Lady Melania Trump and many senior administration officials. On August 13, 2020, in an interview with Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo, Trump said he was blocking emergency funding for the USPS because of his opposition to mail-in voting. Trump later defended the changes being made by DeJoy, saying that DeJoy wanted to \\"make the Post Office great again\\", a reference to Trump's own political slogan, \\"Make America Great Again\\". Former U.S. president Barack Obama accused Trump of deliberately \\"kneecapping\\" the Postal Service in order to discourage people from voting. Contrary to Trump's stated belief that vote by mail harms Republicans, there is no evidence that it benefits one party or the other, and both parties have incorporated it into their get-out-the-vote strategies for years. However, nonpartisan experts have warned that delays in the delivery of mail-in ballots could be used by Trump to \\"steal the election\\" in the event that more Democrats than Republicans choose to vote by mail in the November 2020 elections. Public polling indicates that more Democrats plan to vote by mail in the elections than Republicans, possibly due to Trump's false claims of vote by mail being riddled with fraud. In addition, there is a recurring phenomenon in U.S. elections called the \\"blue shift\\", whereby in-person votes tallied on election night favor Republicans, then later-tallied ballots (including mailed ballots) shift the final result toward the Democrats. Longtime Republican elections lawyer and former Federal Election Commission chairman Trevor Potter stated that under such a scenario, Trump could build up a lead among ballots cast on Election Day, claim victory, and then say, \\"stop counting ballots because all those absentee ballots are illegitimate.\\" DeJoy denied accusations from members of Congress and voting rights advocates that the delivery delays were designed to sabotage election mail on Trump's behalf. Trump met with DeJoy at the White House on August 3, but when initially asked on August 9, Trump denied that he had spoken to DeJoy. After reports emerged on August 14 of the August 3 meeting, White House spokesman Judd Deere described it as \\"congratulatory\\", and Trump on August 17 denied having instructed DeJoy to slow mail delivery, saying he \\"wouldn't do that.\\" Economic issues Some companies have complained that the delays are hurting their business, since their reputation is dependent on being able to deliver their wares reliably and promptly. A Wisconsin businessman said that with the recent changes, some shipments that might once have been no more than a day late now go missing for weeks, and Priority Mail and Express Mail can now take a week or more. The problems are especially severe for small businesses. Individuals are also reporting serious economic problems due to delayed or missing mail: not receiving checks or important papers that they are expecting, or having their bill payments arrive at the company late so that they get charged a penalty. In some cities people report getting no mail at all for two or three weeks, and standing in line at the post office to see if it is there. Health issues Most prescribed medications from the Veterans Administration are sent by mail. Those medications are supposed to arrive within three to five days of being mailed. Since the operational changes imposed by DeJoy, veterans complain that such prescription deliveries have been delayed, often by weeks. Other health essentials such as oxygen tubes are also reportedly being delayed for weeks. A letter to DeJoy from 31 U.S. senators asked him to reassess the effect of his changes on veterans.  Animal deaths and food spoilage  Maine farmers reported that thousands of baby chicks had died in the mail after delays at the processing center in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. After overtime was cut at a South Los Angeles sorting facility, packages piled up and blocked machines, rodents were swarming around containers of rotted fruit and meat, baby chicks were found dead inside their boxes, and the building filled with gnats.  Postal workers' reactions  Workers in at least two plants in Washington state reassembled their letter-sorting machines in the week that DeJoy announced he would suspend his changes, despite the Postal Service's national order not to reinstall the machines.  Protests  The crisis precipitated protests against the changes made by DeJoy, with protesters calling for the postmaster general's resignation. One protest took place on August 15 outside of DeJoy's home in Washington, D.C.; a second took place on August 16 at his home in Greensboro, North Carolina. Congressional response On August 16, 2020, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ended a recess of the House of Representatives that had been scheduled to last until the week of September 14, calling lawmakers back to Washington to address the crisis. She proposed an early vote on a bill to roll back the changes introduced by DeJoy, which Democrats have described as \\"a grave threat to the integrity of the election.\\" Pelosi said that \\"Lives, livelihoods and the life of our American democracy are under threat from the president.\\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell bring the Senate back into session also, to consider ways to \\"undo the extensive damage Mr. DeJoy has done at the Postal Service,\\" but there was no indication McConnell would do so. Some Republican senators have also called for reversing the changes, pointing out the importance of the Postal Service to rural residents; they include both senators from Montana and Senator Susan Collins of Maine. On August 17, 2020, DeJoy agreed to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on August 24, and the next day he agreed to testify before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs on August 21. USPS Board of Governors chairman Mike Duncan also agreed to testify at the House hearing. Despite DeJoy's announcement that he would be suspending the operational changes until after the election, Pelosi stated that she did not trust DeJoy, and called the suspension \\"a necessary but insufficient step in ending the president‚Äôs election sabotage campaign.\\" On August 21, 2020, DeJoy testified before the U.S. Senate that he votes by mail. He committed to senators at the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that voters should be \\"extremely highly confident\\" that even mail-in ballots sent close to Election Day would be delivered on time, and promised that the USPS would respect its \\"sacred duty\\" to deliver election mail in the fall of 2020. Senator Jacky Rosen asked DeJoy to provide the sources of data collected, data analyses, and considerations of consequences‚Äîspecifically on veterans dependent on the mail for their prescriptions‚Äîthat DeJoy had undertaken before implementing the removal of mail sorting machines, \\"reduction, elimination of overtime and late trips\\". He said he was unable to do so. On August 22, 2020, the House passed a bill approving $25 billion in emergency funding for the USPS that would reverse DeJoy's changes and ban mail delays before the election. The vote was 257-150 as Democrats approved it unanimously and 26 Republicans joined them. The White House threatened a veto. Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, was denied access to two post offices in Florida when she tried to conduct an inspection on September 3.

He was briefly married to a Thai woman and took a Thai name, Pakpong Kriangsak. A long-time devotee of the sport of bodybuilding, Latchford became a patron of the sport in Thailand and was the honorary president of the Thai Bodybuilding Association from 2016 until his death. Antiquities trade A controversial figure, Latchford was best known as a collector of Cambodian antiquities. According to his obituary in The Diplomat due to his leading position in the illegal antiquities trade of the Khmer Rouge \\"no single figure looms as large over a nation‚Äôs wholesale pillage.\\" Nonetheless, the Cambodian government awarded Latchford a Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Monisaraphon in 2008. He co-authored three books on Khmer antiquities with academic Emma Bunker. In the 1970s, Latchford became one of the leading suppliers of Cambodian art, selling to museums and private collections in Europe and North America, including the Metropolitan. He kept the best pieces for himself and his personal collection is rumored to rival that of the National Museum of Cambodia. Latchford liked to see himself as saving works of art that had been abandoned and were at risk during Cambodia's turbulent civil wars, although this viewpoint was contrasted by academics who alleged that several of Latchford's antiquities lacked a clear provenance. Latchford denied any wrongdoing, and gathered his collection long before legislation barring Latchford's practice of buying directly from farmers and dealers in Thailand. In November 2019, Latchford, by then comatose, was charged by prosecutors in New York, but the case is unlikely to continue due to his death.

A charge of indecency against her and Sir Leo Chiozza Money was dismissed by magistrates, but she was later detained again and subjected to a five-hour interrogation by male officers. Her complaints led to a public inquiry concerning police procedures and later a royal commission. Life Savidge was born in Tottenham in 1905. She became a radio valve- tester in New Southgate and was engaged to Frank Gentle.William Donaldson (2002) Brewer's Rogues, Villains & Eccentrics In November 1927, she was introduced to the 57 year old Sir Leo Chiozza Money who was married and had been a government minister. Over the next few months they would go out together to the theatre or for dinner. Savidge's parents, Alice and John Savidge were aware of their friendship. On 23 April 1928, they went for a meal together and afterwards they went to Hyde Park. Officers arrested Metropolitan Police them, claiming that they were engaged in mutual masturbation and that Money's genitals were in view. Money claimed that he had been offering Savidge advice on her career.Taylor, A.J.P. (1965) The Oxford History of England: English History 1914‚Äì1945 They were both arrested and charged with indecent behaviour, but the case was dismissed by the Marlborough Street magistrate, who awarded costs of ¬£10 against the police.Time, 14 May 1928 At the time of his arrest, Money protested to the police that he was \\"a man of substance\\" and, once in custody, was permitted to telephone the Home Secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks. The two were released and then the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Archibald Bodkin suspected police perjury and asked for further investigation. Bodkin appointed an experienced officer Chief Inspector Alfred C. Collins to investigate. Inspector of Women Police Lilian Wyles helped escort Savidge for questioning but she was dismissed On 15 May, Savidge was collected from work by two officers, one being Lilian Wyles, and taken for interrogation, which lasted some five hours. It was conducted without a female officer being present, since Wyles was told to leave by Collins. Savidge was required to show the police her petticoat, whose colour and brevity they duly noted and at a certain point Collins caressed her knee. Time, 8 August 1928; House of Commons debate (Hansard, 17 May 1928). Some later writers (such as Julia Ann Laite in Women's History Review, Vol. 17, No. 2, April 2008, pp. 207‚Äì223) have described Savidge as a prostitute, but although she later admitted that, by going to restaurants and cinemas with Money, she was deceiving her boyfriend, there seems to be no obvious contemporaneous evidence to confirm this. Savidge complained about her treatment and there followed an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on 17 May 1928, initiated by Labour MP, Tom Johnston. Joynson-Hicks established a public inquiry under Sir John Eldon Bankes (a retired Lord Justice of Appeal), which quickly became known as the Savidge Inquiry and the press was clear that it was the police who were on trial for their behaviour. The inquiry criticised the excessive zeal of the police, but also exonerated Savidge's interrogators of improper conduct. However, the Royal Commission on Police Powers and Procedure was then set up between September 1928 and March 1929, and this led to reforms in the way that the police dealt with female suspects. It also enabled a number of public figures to articulate their view that the police should primarily enforce law and order, rather than \\"trying to be censors of public morals\\".Lord Balfour of Burleigh, quoted in Pugh, 2008 In August 1928 it was reported that Savidge was considering offers to appear on the stage. Savidge married Frank Gentle in 1929. He had stood by her through the scandal. She died in the hospital in Minehead in 1985.

SSVF has been led since its inception by John Kuhn, the previous VA National Director of Homeless Evaluation. Female veteran and child after receiving SSVF services to find affordable housing in Miami. In 2010, President Obama and VA announced the federal government‚Äôs goal to end Veteran homelessness. Published by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), this goal was announced as part of the nation‚Äôs first plan to prevent and end homelessness, titled Opening Doors. Under this mandate, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki announced the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program would begin providing targeted housing assistance and services on October 1, 2011. SSVF grants are awarded through a competitive application process to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives to provide eligible Veteran families with outreach, case management, and assistance in obtaining VA and other mainstream benefits that promote housing stability and community integration. SSVF grantees can also make time-limited temporary payments on behalf of Veterans to cover rent, utilities, security deposits and moving costs. SSVF is the first homelessness prevention and rapid re-housing program administered by VA and the first homeless program designed to serve Veterans with families. The program has received strong support from national Veterans organizations, including the American Legion: \\"The American Legion applauds and supports President Trump‚Äôs continued support of the SSVF program and the veterans it assists.\\" Operation Sacred Trust Supportive Services for Veteran Families Outreach in Miami, Florida. In August 2020, President Trump announced an expansion of SSVF, authorizing $400 million in awards to support 266 grantees in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Eligibility and Services To be eligible for SSVF, a Veteran must have served at least one day of active duty, received a Military discharge other than dishonorable, have total household income that doesn't exceed 30% of the Area Median Income based on HUD guidelines for their local community, and be experiencing or at imminent risk for homelessness. SSVF services available to eligible Veterans include: * Community outreach and identification of those who are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness. * Rapidly re-house homeless Veteran families in safe, affordable permanent housing. * Resolve housing crises for those at imminent risk of homelessness. * Increase income of participants through employment and access to benefits, so they can maintain their housing once the immediate crisis has passed. * Help participants resolve barriers to housing placement and retention, addressing needs involving legal, health, transportation, child care, or other concerns that contribute to housing instability. Accreditation In 2014, the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities announced new standards for accreditation of rapid rehousing and homelessness prevention (RRHP) programs to support grantees of the Department of Veterans Affairs' SSVF program. . VA's National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans (NCHAV) Director said, \\"The NCHAV has worked closely with CARF in crafting these pioneering standards. Thanks to CARF's national standing as a leading accreditation organization for mental health and rehabilitation, the Center's work to develop research-informed standards for SSVF can now be accessed by other providers of homeless prevention and rapid rehousing services.\\" By 2018, 105 SSVF grantees had received CARF or COA Accreditation. Results Despite six years of initial success, in 2017, VA Secretary David Shulkin proposed reducing funding for the program after reports showed larger numbers of Veterans becoming homeless from January 2016 to January 2017, the first reported national increase since the launch of the SSVF program. A bi-partisan response from Congress in support of the program led Secretary Shulkin to reverse his decision. That year, NBC News featured the story of Patrick Adams, a formerly homeless Veteran who received permanent housing as a result of SSVF. NBC reported overall Veteran homelessness decreased from 2010 to 2016 by 47 percent. HUD Secretary Ben Carson announced in November 2019 that Veteran homelessness was again declining, reporting a 2.1 percent decrease during the fiscal year. \\"This year‚Äôs estimate finds 37,085 veterans experienced homelessness in January 2019, compared to 37,878 reported in January 2018,\\" Secretary Carson reported. By 2020, the SSVF program was largely credited with ending Veteran homelessness in 78 communities and three states. From SSVF's inception in 2011 to 2019, 14 states reduced Veteran homelessness by more than 50 percent. During that period, New York reported reducing Veteran homelessness by 78 percent. Response to 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic In July 2020, VA announced it would provide $400 million in additional funding to SSVF grantees for emergency assistance to Veterans impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Funds were awarded from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which allocated $17.2 billion for the Veterans Health Administration. VA highlighted five priorities during the COVID-19 crisis to enable the program to evolve into an emergency response and permanent housing program combined: * Connect all Veterans to permanent housing, whenever possible, either via SSVF or other resources * Maintain enrollment for eligible Veterans so SSVF can continue to provide assistance, and re-introduce assistance should the Veteran family become at risk of housing loss * End unsheltered homelessness for all Veterans and ensure Veterans at risk of serious illness or death from COVD-19 are not living in congregate shelter or transitional housing settings. Veterans should not be in settings where the risk of contracting COVID-19 are high or otherwise more likely than in the general population. * Prevent homelessness for those Veterans at risk of losing their housing due to the COVID-19 crisis or otherwise * Support HUD- VASH placements for veterans needing Housing Search Support or financial assistance. SSVF grantees in communities that had ended chronic Veteran homelessness in preceding years reported significant increases in the numbers of homeless and at-risk Veterans requesting help as a result of the pandemic. At the same time, federal lawmakers were seeking more rigorous oversight of services to Veterans housed at state-run care facilities.

They would be the only school-related football team in 1886 after the Varsity of Columbia was on hiatus from 1885 to 1888. Very little is known about the Union Club, its relation to Columbia College, and its reason for establishment and dissolution. 1886 season In 1886, the Unions of Columbia football club joining the fledgling American Football Union for their inaugural 1886 season. The Unions would compile a 1‚Äì3 record, all against AFU opponents, and outscored their opponents by a total of 28 to 23. The AFU ruled that the November 6th forfeit loss between Brooklyn Hill and the Unions would not count towards the league record. The 1886 team was composed mostly of Columbia College alumni, particularly from the 1883 and 1884 varsity squads. 1887 season The 1887 Unions of Columbia College football team compiled a 0‚Äì3 record (all in the AFU) and were outscored by their opponents by a total of 63 to 2. Sometime in the middle of October, the team was able to secure new players when the Crickets of Stevens Institute (who had won the 1886 AFU championship) decided to consolidate their team with the Unions. On November 13, the Unions resigned from the AFU for an unstated reason, and disbanded their student alumni football team. Speculation at the time for the team's disbandment was blamed on the club \\"not being able to stand defeat\\". Another possibility was the alumni simply lost interest in the game, which was a common reason for dropping football at the time (this was the reason for Columbia's Varsity hiatus' in the 1880s and 1890s), or perhaps the most viable, the student sect of the Unions team was consolidated into the 1887 Columbia interclass teams, and there were two few alumni remaining to continue the season. 1888 season The Union Club football team was reformed for the 1888 season as an independent, compiled a 2‚Äì1 record (approximately), and were outscored by their opponents by a total of 38 to 6. The return of the Union Club is not well documented, but they seemed to now be mostly made up of Columbia students as opposed to alumni. With the Varsity of Columbia returning from hiatus in 1889, there was no longer a need for separate football clubs and interclass teams, and the Unions were disbanded permanenty. Team rosters In 1886, nearly all of the players in the Union Club were alumni or students of Columbia College. For the 1887 season however, the Unions of Columbia roster would also include the Crickets of Stevens, which were another alumni football team that represented the Stevens Institute of Technology. Various members of other athletic clubs in the AFU also played a small part on the Union team. The following players were a member of the Unions of Columbia football team between 1886 and 1888. In 1888, restrictions from the new AFU constitution regarding fixed rosters slowed the influx or shifting of players of any club in the New York metropolitan area, and as such many of the Crickets or other players not affiliated with the college left the team. Any additional information regarding the player's history will follow their years and position with the Unions. *C. Aldridge- 1887 Unions quarterback *H. Anderson- 1888 Unions rusher *J.

These C*-algebras were created in order to simultaneously generalize the classes of graph C*-algebras and Exel‚ÄìLaca algebras, giving a unified framework for studying these objects.A unified approach to Exel‚ÄìLaca algebras and C*-algebras associated to graphs, Mark Tomforde, J. Operator Theory 50 (2003), no. 2, 345‚Äì368. This is because every graph can be encoded as an ultragraph, and similarly, every infinite graph giving an Exel-Laca algebras can also be encoded as an ultragraph.  Definitions = Ultragraphs  An ultragraph \\\\mathcal{G} = (G^0, \\\\mathcal{G}^1, r, s) consists of a set of vertices G^0, a set of edges \\\\mathcal{G}^1, a source map s:\\\\mathcal{G}^1 \\\\to G^0, and a range map r : \\\\mathcal{G}^1 \\\\to P(G^0) \\\\setminus { \\\\emptyset } taking values in the power set collection P(G^0) \\\\setminus { \\\\emptyset } of nonempty subsets of the vertex set. A directed graph is the special case of an ultragraph in which the range of each edge is a singleton, and ultragraphs may be thought of as generalized directed graph in which each edges starts at a single vertex and points to a nonempty subset of vertices. = Example = Ultragraph ({v,w,x},{e,f,g},s,r) An easy way to visualize an ultragraph is to consider a directed graph with a set of labelled vertices, where each label corresponds to a subset in the image of an element of the range map. For example, given an ultragraph with vertices and edge labels > \\\\mathcal{G}^0 = {v,w,x }, \\\\mathcal{G}^1 = {e,f,g } with source an range maps > \\\\begin{matrix} s(e) = v & s(f) = w & s(g) = x \\\\ r(e) = {v,w,x } & r(f) > = {x } & r(g) = {v,w } \\\\end{matrix} can be visualized as the image on the right.  Ultragraph algebras  Given an ultragraph \\\\mathcal{G} = (G^0, \\\\mathcal{G}^1, r, s), we define \\\\mathcal{G}^0 to be the smallest subset of P(G^0) containing the singleton sets { { v } : v \\\\in G^0 }, containing the range sets { r(e) : e \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}^1 }, and closed under intersections, unions, and relative complements. A Cuntz‚ÄìKrieger \\\\mathcal{G}-family is a collection of projections { p_A : A \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}^0 } together with a collection of partial isometries { s_e : e \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}^1 } with mutually orthogonal ranges satisfying # p_{\\\\emptyset}, p_A p_B = p_{A \\\\cap B}, p_A + p_B - p_{A \\\\cap B} = p_{A \\\\cup B} for all A \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}^0, # s_e^*s_e = p_{r(e)} for all e \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}^1, # p_v = \\\\sum_{s(e)=v} s_e s_e^* whenever v \\\\in G^0 is a vertex that emits a finite number of edges, and # s_e s_e^* \\\\le p_{s(e)} for all e \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}^1. The ultragraph C*-algebra C^*(\\\\mathcal{G}) is the universal C*-algebra generated by a Cuntz‚ÄìKrieger \\\\mathcal{G}-family.  Properties  Every graph C*-algebra is seen to be an ultragraph algebra by simply considering the graph as a special case of an ultragraph, and realizing that \\\\mathcal{G}^0 is the collection of all finite subsets of G^0 and p_A = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in A} p_v for each A \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}^0. Every Exel‚ÄìLaca algebras is also an ultragraph C*-algebra: If A is an infinite square matrix with index set I and entries in { 0, 1 }, one can define an ultragraph by G^0 :=, G^1 := I, s(i) = i, and r(i) = { j \\\\in I : A(i,j)=1 }. It can be shown that C^*(\\\\mathcal{G}) is isomorphic to the Exel‚ÄìLaca algebra \\\\mathcal{O}_A. Ultragraph C*-algebras are useful tools for studying both graph C*-algebras and Exel‚ÄìLaca algebras. Among other benefits, modeling an Exel‚ÄìLaca algebra as ultragraph C*-algebra allows one to use the ultragraph as a tool to study the associated C*-algebras, thereby providing the option to use graph-theoretic techniques, rather than matrix techniques, when studying the Exel‚ÄìLaca algebra. Ultragraph C*-algebras have been used to show that every simple AF- algebra is isomorphic to either a graph C*-algebra or an Exel‚ÄìLaca algebra.Realization of AF-algebras as graph algebras, Exel‚ÄìLaca algebras, and ultragraph algebras, Takeshi Katsura, Aidan Sims, and Mark Tomforde, J. Funct. Anal. 257 (2009), no. 5, 1589‚Äì1620. They have also been used to prove that every AF-algebra with no (nonzero) finite-dimensional quotient is isomorphic to an Exel‚ÄìLaca algebra. While the classes of graph C*-algebras, Exel‚ÄìLaca algebras, and ultragraph C*-algebras each contain C*-algebras not isomorphic to any C*-algebra in the other two classes, the three classes have been shown to coincide up to Morita equivalence.Graph algebras, Exel‚ÄìLaca algebras, and ultragraph algebras coincide up to Morita equivalence, Takeshi Katsura, Paul Muhly, Aidan Sims, and Mark Tomforde, J.

It belongs to the family Viverravidae of the Carnivoramorpha.  Fossil founds  Fossils of Protictis are found in the United States and Canada and date mainly from the North American Land Mammal Ages Torrejonian en Tiffanian. The holotype - part of the upper and lowe jaw - were described in 1882 by Edward Drinker Cope based on finds in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and classified as Didymictis haydenianus. William Diller Matthew described Protictis as a subgenus of Didymictis in 1937 and in 1966 MacIntyre classified it as a separate genus.Genera and species of Paleocene mammals. Paleocene-mammals.de Protictis means \\"early weasel\\" and consists of proto and ictis. The San Juan Basin is the main location for fossil founds of Protictis.

Parts of the skeleton of P. haydenianus are known and this species was about 75 cm long, comparable to the related Didymictis and the modern day Asian civets.Postcranial anatomy of Viverravus (Mammalia, Carnivora) and implications for substrate use in basal Carnivora. RE Heinrich & P Houde. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology (2006). The skull of P. simpsoni shows that this species was larger than P. haydenianus. P. minor on the other hand was smaller than P. haydenianus. The morphology of the limb bones of P haydenianus points at a scansorial lifestyle. Protictis had two times as many teeth as modern carnivores. The characteristic carnassials of carnivores were already clearly developed in Protictis, but the long and pointy teeth show that insects were still a major component of this diet. Endocasts of the skull shows that both vision and hearing were important senses, but the position of the eye sockets shows that threedimensional vision was not a good developed as in modern carnivores.Carnivores, creodonts and carnivorous ungulates: Mammals become predators  References  Category:Viverravids Category:Paleocene mammals of North America Category:Prehistoric mammal genera ","title":"Protictis"},{"id":"64958977","text":"Helen Rickerby is a New Zealand poet, writer, editor and publisher.

She was attracted to Marxism by her husband Kuppusamy, who was a functionary of the state unit of Communist Party of India (Marxist). She turned into an activist and social worker in Villapuram area in Madurai. Leelavthi contested successfully to the civic body elections in 1996 in Ward 59 in Villapuram. In the councilor election for the Madurai Corporation during October 1996, she defeated Valli, the wife of DMK party functionary Annadurai, who represented ward 59. The Madurai councilor post was reserved for women based on 33% reservation for women in local bodies. Annadurai fought against the election officer against declaring the result and issuing the winning certificate to Leelavathi quoting the margin of defeat. Leelavathi was successful in getting the certificate from the officer. During the same night, Annadurai came to Leelavathi's house along with his supporter for another fight. As soon as she assumed office, her single mission was to bring piped water to her elected ward, which was a backward community bereft of water supply. The community also suffered as they had to buy water from lorry supplied water sold at a higher price. She was successful in bringing piped water to her ward six months from the time of her election. She was murdered two days before the formal inauguration of water supply. Her work in bringing water to the community threatend the business of the water mafia of water tank owners who plotted her murder. Court proceedings Leelavathi (40) was murdered on day light in Villapuram area in Madurai during broad day light by five armed men on 23 April 1997. She was going to a local provision stores at around 8:30 am when the gang of six equipped with sickle (aruval) started attacking her. She died on the spot in a pool of blood. The victim's husband filed a police complaint at around 10 am. Since Leelavathi was popular in her area, there were protests from public to arrest the killers and bring them to justice. The police arrested Muthuramalingam, Karimalayan alias Annadurai, Murugan, Murugan alias Soongu Murugan, Meenakshisundaram and Marudhu alias Nallamarudhu on 24th and 27th April 1997. The police also recovered the weapons from the accused. Nallamarthu (41) was brother of DMK party functionary Essar Gopi who was close to M.K. Azhagiri. The case was conducted in the Madurai Additional Sessions court. The prosecution accused Muthuramalingam (A-2) armed with aruval cut the victim on the right side of the neck, Karimalayan alias Annadurai (A-1) with aruval cut the deceased on the right side of the neck, Murugan (A-3) with aruval cut the deceased on the cheek, right ear, right shoulder & right hand, Murugan alias Soongu Murugan (A-4) with aruval repeatedly cut the deceased on the right and left hands, Meenakshisundaram (A-5) and Marudhu alias Nallamarudhu (A-6). After multiple hearings, the court sentenced Nallamarudhu, the brother of DMK functionary Essar Gopi, and five others accused in the case during 2000. Their life sentence was confirmed by the Madras High Court in 2003. The court dismissed multiple bail pleas from the accused on the grounds of close political connection with the ruling party. In popular culture Acadamecians are divided on the view of political parties contesting in local body elections. As per Dr. G. Palanithurai, who heads the Pre election Voter Awareness Campaign of Tamil Nadu, involvement of political parties at grassroot levels would avoid the phenomenon of auctioning of the village president posts as done in many village panchayats. He showcased the contrast in Melavalavu incident where six people were killed without much of media notice compared to Leelavathi Murder case, which was taken up at a very high level since she was from a registered party. Other academicians are of the view that the elections would be conducted on time for the local bodies as in the case of general elections, if it is left to the local parties. Swaraj was an award winning movie which was based on the real life story of Leelavathi, though under a different context setting outside Madurai. In the movie, the protagonist is portrayed fighting the cause of the backward community to bring piped water to them. Aftermath M. Karunanidhi, the ruling Chief minister of Tamil Nadu, released Nallamarudhu and four others who were convicted and ordered life in the case. One of the sentenced died in prison during 2004. The release was ordered during the birth century of Annadurai on the grounds of good conduct from the convicted. As per another guideline, the life sentence should have been 10 years, but the DMK government reduced it to seven years during 2008. The release drew strong opposition from the CPI (M) party and other opposition parties in the state. The CPI (M) state secretary N. Varadarajan wrote to the chief minister opposing the release. As per the guidelines of the government, the people getting prematurely released during special occasions should not have any criminal proceedings for the next three years. Nallamarudu was involved in multiple criminal proceedings after his release in 2009 along with his brother Essar Gopi. As per the police statement, V. Balakrishnan, the Superindent of Police, Madurai, sent a recommendation to the Government of Tamil Nadu to cancel the order of release of Nallamarudu during 2013 quoting continued criminal involvement. But the Madurai District Police received orders to cancel his release only on 20 August 2015. He was arrested on 23 August 2015 from his house in Avaniapuram area and was sent to Madurai jail. Her murder is also quoted as the first assault on a woman leader after the introduction of 33% reservation of women in local bodies. It was a case study quoted in other cases where convicts were released prematurely during the life sentence on political grounds.

Origin The Persian term Kaman stands for Bow and one theory of etymology refers to the earliest painters of the art belonging to a category of Bow makers who were primarily Muslims and had migrated to the Kutch region in 18th century, the period which is contemporaneous to the emergence of this art form. According to this theory, the Bow makers though Muslim were well aware of the Hindu as well as Jain tradition and were patronised by the local Bhatia and Jain community who assigned them the duty to perform the art for them. However there are other tradition as well and according to one such tradition the word \\"Kamangiri\\" has roots in the word Kaam, in kutchi dialect which stands for work. This tradition describes the Kamangars as the class performing any kind of art work and most probably the painting. The class of painters initially remained Muslims by faith but later absorbed Hindu artists from 'Gujjar Sutar' and 'Rupgada Salat' communities as well. The Kamangars are said to be proficient in the architectural works apart from their proficiency in Bow making and Shield making. The work of the Kamangirs influenced other communities in the region as well. Some of these include the \\"Soni\\" community, who worked on gold and silver and were associated with making of ornaments while the other being \\" Mochi\\" community of the leather workers, and ivory carvers. There were two kinds of Kamangars. One worked with the masons to paint on the walls while the another category of Kamangars produced scrolls and painting on paper for the ruling class. Apart from Jain and Bhatias of Gujarat the other communities who patronised them were Jadeja Rajputs and \\"Mistry\\" community. The Kamangars despite their artistic excellence, were not given proper importance in the society and once the contract was over they resorted to the traditional works like \\"toy making\\". Features The most common theme of painting remained religious motifs based primarily upon the folk tales of Ramayana and Life of Krishna.But, the themes varied according to the period, place as well as choice of the patron. The Kamangiri art work is though found across various region of Kutch but the notable one are at Anjar, Mundra, Bharpar, Tera, Lala, Faradi, Bibber and Varapadhhar. Some of these sites weredamaged due to the earthquake of the year 2001 resulting in to the loss of many of these paintings. The painting of inner and outer wall was a most recurrent theme of the art though later the figures like those of British soldiers with their Dogs and of Aeroplanes, Railway engines, domestic animals and events from Jain mythology were also painted. One of the notable painting still preserved today is of the house of Captain MacMurdo at \\"Anjar\\", which depicts the royal procession, Hindu god and goddesses and flora and fauna in the Kutchi background. At Hajapar village in Kutchh the train is painted with a railway station in the background while at Tera, a small principality in kutchh have the four walls of a bedroom on the upper floor of castle decorated with the themes of epic Ramayana.In India no other place has the depiction of complete story of Ramayana at a single place in such a continuous manner. The depiction of royal procession at MacMurdo's Bungalow. The Ram Mandir at Bibber village features the combination of the style of Rajasthan and Gujarat. The places like Deshalpar village near Mundra has the paintings depicting \\"Rasa mandala\\", a circle dance performed mainly by the worshippers of Krishna.The Kamangars were illiterate but they showed the extent of their knowledge at the palace of \\"Kalubhai Waghela\\" in Muntra town where the depiction of royal procession, European Captain, the scene of \\"Gopi Vastra Haran\\" from Bhagavata Purana and Ramayana are found. Kamangars have also painted on paper, wood, glass and hide. The famous scrolls from Aina Mahal and Kachchh Museum at Bhuj are painted by the Kamangars. One of the Scroll depicts the Tajia procession which is taken out during Muharram while another one depicts the process carried out during Nag Panchami, to commemorate the victory of Kachh army over Gujarat army. Decline The Kamangiri art was popular till 20th century but after the great depression, the patrons moved out of the Kutch and the houses were locked down turning the Kamangirs to other means of livelihood.The another fatal blow to the art was 2001 earthquake, which devastated some of the notable works.Now, only three places in Gujarat has well preserved Kamangiri murals.These are \\"Tera fort\\", MacMurdo bungalow at Anjar and the house of Kalubhai Waghela in \\"Mundra\\".

It is closely related to its principal, foreign policy, and to overall national security, specifically energy security. Energy diplomacy began in the first half of the twentieth century and emerged as a term during the second oil crisis as a means of describing OPEC's actions. It has since mainly focused on the securitization of energy supplies, primarily fossil fuels, but also nuclear energy and increasingly sustainable energy, on a country or bloc basis.  Background  Energy diplomacy emerged as a term during the second oil crisis as a means of describing OPEC's actions and of characterizing the quest for the United States to secure energy independence and the Cold War relationship between Russia and satellite states regarding oil and gas exports. Since the oil crises, energy diplomacy has mainly focused on the securitization of energy supplies on a country or bloc basis and on the foreign policy to obtain that energy security.  Ontological relationship with national security, foreign policy, and energy security  Foreign politics has been around for thousands of years of our civilization, while energy has only entered in the last 150 years. However, in that period foreign policy and energy have had an increasing number of overlapping and interconnected elements. Foreign policy in its own part is closely linked and dependent on the concept of national security. National security is a principle of actions governing relations of one state with others based on geography, external threats and other national security challenges, of which energy is one. The three concepts, national security, foreign policy and energy security are ontologically structured, where national security is the most general concept, foreign policy is one level lower covering the international aspect of national security risks, and the lowest on the scale is energy diplomacy. Foreign policy is linked to national security as it is the tool which implements overall national security. National security also has a direct link to energy diplomacy. National security denotes the capability of a nation to overcome its internal and external multi-dimensional threats by balancing all instruments of state policy through governance. It aims to protect national independence, security and territorial, political and economic integrity, dealing with a large number of national security risks. Energy is one of the fundamental items on the national security agenda. National security that deals with such external issues and risks is applied and implemented by government departments for external relations. Implementation of the national security strategy involving external factors and international issues is carried out through foreign policy instruments, namely international relations and diplomacy. Energy diplomacy specifically focuses on external energy relations. Despite the ontological hierarchy of the three concepts, it is a recurring theme for them to continuously intersect in practical diplomatic life and the geopolitical reality.  History  The beginning of the 20th century was the early era of energy diplomacy, which was largely marked by corporate players. Such diplomacy was dominated by the corporations that produced and distributed fossil fuel, rather than sovereign governments, as in the case of Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil. National security on a national level as a concept in its own right has not yet been formulated, but the energy issues were increasing in importance. Carving up the global oil reserves and markets was carried out persistently, alike during the 1908 negotiations between Royal Dutch Shell legendary head Mr. Deterding and the US Standard Oil director Mr. Teagle; or on the occasion of signing the US ‚ÄúAs-Is‚Äù Pool Association agreement in 1928. The corporations were competing and racing over privileges, quotas and allocations. The governments were not too far behind, supporting them and often facilitating the race, but the influential corporations dominantly shaped the industry and foreign policy. Post World War II era experienced fall of empires, rise of colonies, global shifts in geopolitical influence of UK, US, Russia and others. It is the OPEC that has succeeded in the 1960s and 1970s to gain ground in relation to the international oil corporations, nationalizing and regaining control over the national fossil fuel resources in several large producing countries. The oil shocks after WWII were the ones that greatly contributed to the growth of security concerns and diplomatic efforts in the energy sphere. The most important occurrences were the Suez Crisis of 1956-1957 and the OPEC oil embargo of 1973‚Äì1974. Whole economies were brought near to a standstill, escalating energy issues as top security concerns. Soon came other disruptions, albeit smaller, caused by the Iranian revolution of 1979, the Iran-Iraq War of 1980 followed by the first Persian Gulf War in 1990‚Äì1991. Turbulences on the oil market that disturbed and endangered economies were also caused by the 2003 Iraq invasion, oil price spike of 2007-2008, Russian Ukrainian gas dispute in 2009, and others including smaller disruptions. Oil passages are still a global security concern as 40% of all oil transits via four conduits of the straits of Hormuz, Malacca, Rab-el-Mandeb and the Suez Canal. International Energy Agency (IEA) expects that these quantities will rise from 40% to 60% by 2030. Any longer interruption would cause another large-scale economic downfall. Therefore, energy diplomacy has entered the domain of foreign policy through the national security passageway. Numerous grave national and international risks associated with energy security and energy diplomacy have paved this way and assured that energy is viewed and judged as a security concern, so it acquired all the features of a security issue, and is constantly monitored for level of risk, potential prevention or intervention in the diplomatic field. Next to the security path, energy concerns have entered foreign policy considerations via another path, the economy. A valid example is Australia, which has in 2018 decided to form a new policy body titled energy diplomacy. Australia, being by far the largest global exporter of coal, has only been mildly affected by the shifts on the market and geopolitics of energy, so its security risk concerning energy has not been very high.  The rise of energy risks and main issues  Energy diplomacy is a growing diplomatic field, aimed at providing energy security. Energy has entered the sphere of diplomacy and foreign policy as a result of its rising impact on national security and economy. Energy, the ability to do any work, powers the economy. Its uninterrupted flow, inward for importing countries, and outward for exporting, must be secured at all times. Until the last few decades of the 20th century the question of energy was not treated as a matter of such urgency nor geopolitics. The availability, affordability and supply were not a security issue. The industrial production and consumption capacities were smaller, and movement of energy was generally safe and dependable. Throughout the industrial revolution the increasing need for energy grew at a remarkable pace, spiraling in the 20th century. Only in the last 50 years, between 1971 and 2017 world total primary energy supply grew by more than 250% from 5, 519 Mtoe to 13, 972 Mtoe. Energy use worldwide is yet to grow by one-third until 2040. The changed situation generated a series of factors that required energy security and energy diplomacy to be elevated onto the national security agenda. National security departments worldwide closely monitor the severe escalation of energy use. The modern consumer and the contemporary economy have gradually grown to critically depend on energy. Hence, economy and energy have become inseparable concepts. Energy has become a synonym for the economy and power, and not having enough of it became a concern of the utmost national security. Access to energy resources has decided on war outcomes, security of supply shaped national and international agendas, oil and gas producing countries organized together into coalitions, tapping into the newly discovered energy resources to back their political and geopolitical goals. Oil and gas companies became some of the most influential organizations in the global business and power-influencing arena. Oil price volatility caused by oil shocks spelled economic fortunes or disasters for many participants in the international arena affecting national and geopolitical strategies. The economic consequences were considerable, so energy had to be included on the list of security and foreign policy issues of states.  Nature of energy diplomacy  Energy diplomacy refers to diplomatic activities designed to enhance access to energy resources and markets. It is a system of influencing the policies, resolutions and conduct of foreign governments and other international factors by means of diplomatic dialogue, negotiation, lobbying, advocacy and other peaceful methods. The general relationship between foreign policy and energy diplomacy is conceptually one of principal and agent. Foreign policy sets the goals and overall political strategy while energy diplomacy is a mechanism for achieving the goals. Energy diplomacy is an instrument of foreign policy. The purpose of energy diplomacy is to safeguard economic and energy security. Energy diplomacy channels economic and trade relations of a state with other states and organizations safeguarding Energy security through availability, reliability and affordability. Diplomatic efforts aimed at providing energy security grew in importance and complexity. It matured and spun off from general foreign policy and public diplomacy into a separate diplomatic niche field, energy diplomacy, mostly after the 1970s oil crises. This diplomatic activity has several other popular names like \\"geopetroleum politics\\", or \\"petro‚Äìpolitics\\" (Dorraj and Currier, 2011), or pipeline diplomacy (Aalto, 2008), but it mostly covers the same field. Energy diplomacy has developed its own programs, goals, instruments, tactics and action plans, such as the European Union Energy Diplomacy Action Plan. Thus, at the institutional level, energy diplomacy typically focuses on such topics as targets and guidelines; regulations and energy saving; the development of nuclear energy; research and development and demonstration; oil sharing; energy transportation; energy exploration; energy early warning and response; and, in the context of global warming, energy sustainability and energy transition for hydrocarbon exporting states. Commercial energy diplomacy, a hybrid of commercial diplomacy and energy diplomacy, involves political support for foreign-investing energy businesses. Energy diplomacy employs foreign policy methods to ensure a steady flow of energy and security of energy supplies. Energy producing and energy consuming countries apply them differently. Energy producing states mostly focus on using energy diplomacy to expand their exports and presence on the global markets. The example is the energy diplomacy of an exporting state, Russia, who aims to secure access to buyers for oil and gas. It is similar with the energy diplomacy of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), whose focus is similarly export and keeping external demand. Energy consuming and importing states apply energy diplomacy to secure energy supplies and steady inflow, like China's oil diplomacy in Africa or more recently, with Iran. There are also hybrid strategies, which are retained by states that are both large consumers and producers; such are India and the United States.  Energy diplomacy and the energy transition  Although the integration of energy diplomacy into foreign policy for some states has been security and the others economy, the energy transition is reshaping those dynamics so that questions of security and economy will follow a new geopolitical reality. The dynamics of the relationship with foreign policy and national security is thus undergoing a fundamental change‚Äîenergy transition. Providing energy security has traditionally included several key notions: availability, reliability and affordability, but in the past two decades another crucial aspect is added ‚Äì environmental sustainability and transition to low carbon energy. This has initiated a huge shift in how energy is perceived, its toll on the environment and it prompted policies to curb climate change. It was spearheaded by policy makers in the EU. With the proliferation of more renewable energy in the energy mix, like solar, tidal, energy efficiency, wind or water, the geography of resources will not be limited to only a few resource rich countries, but much more evenly spread throughout the world. The way national energy risks are perceived is gradually changing, as energy availability will be significantly improved and more prevalent all over the planet. The energy transition into low carbon energy is already shaping the dynamic relationship of geopolitics, national security strategies, foreign policies and energy diplomacy. Various scholars argue that renewable energy is likely to have pacifying effects on energy diplomacy compared to fossil fuels because renewables may reduce the risk of large inter-state conflicts.  Energy diplomacy by country or bloc = Arab states of the Persian Gulf  Hydrocarbon exporting states in the Persian Gulf, such as those of the Gulf Cooperation Council, traditionally reliant on oil export and often members of OPEC, are increasingly seeking bilateral relations which enable their ability to conduct an energy transition from fossil fuels to energy sustainability, including renewable energy and nuclear power.  Australia  Australia is considered an energy superpower. Its energy diplomacy focuses primarily on promoting fossil fuels, primarily coal, and securing export markets for them.  European Union  While the European Union's internal energy policy may be seen as an example of energy diplomacy between the member states, the European Union has been developing external energy policy over the past two decades, via its EU Energy Diplomacy Action Plan, most notably with regard to Russia, Africa, and Eurasia, including across the Caspian basin.  People's Republic of China  The country on which much of the energy diplomacy literature has focused is China, due to its management of its fundamental energy insecurity, for instance in the relationship between national and corporate interests, as in its gas supply and infrastructure. China faces an energy supply deficit by 2030, and its energy diplomacy is guided by the strategic need to secure sufficient gas and oil supplies by this time. Given this situation, it first aggressively attempted application of the 'Beijing Consensus' to other countries via energy diplomacy, such as the BRICS bloc countries. China's energy diplomacy has covered a plethora of countries, such as, in the early years, Turkey, and in later years the Middle East and North Africa, with special regard to the Iran and Saudi Arabia conflict, where China's role in peace-building came under scrutiny. China's energy diplomacy with South American countries such as Brazil is an issue, as is its relationship with Russia, which can be examined at the levels of personalism and institutionalism. At the heart of China's energy diplomacy as regards the West and indeed the world is the issue of whether China's struggle for energy security will result in energy diplomacy behavior normalization through economic interdependence or whether China will continue to practice resource neo-mercantilism and power politics. Global energy governance institutions such as the International Energy Agency continue to look for responsible domestic energy governance from China, while China has switched attention from trying to impose its leadership on BRICS to developing its own \\"Silk Road Economic Belt\\", in part via the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, as a means to obtain energy imports.  Russia  Russian energy diplomacy is mainly focused on its relationship with Europe, especially over natural gas supply, including across Eurasia, and Russia has combined energy supply with cyber and maritime power as policy instruments. Russia also pursues nuclear energy diplomacy, for instance with Finland and Hungary, via Rosatom.  United States  United States (US) energy diplomacy has consistently focused on oil, and more recently on the oil and gas boom, and is coordinated by the Bureau of Energy Resources at the Department of State. Its commercial energy diplomacy interests extend widely, beyond the traditional Middle East oil exporters to Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan. Historically, the US has exported nuclear energy reactors, by building on its Atoms for Peace program exporting research reactors.

Life Born in Stettin, Puchelt studied from 1931 to 1935 at the Akademie f√ºr Kirchen- und Schulmusik with Else C. Kraus and Eduard Erdmann and at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Afterwards, he worked as a concert pianist and accompanist for well-known singers, instrumentalists and chamber music ensembles. After the Second World War, he continued his career as a piano virtuoso and gave his first concert with the Berliner Philharmoniker as early as September 1945, Schumann, piano concerto op. 54. In 1949, he was appointed professor for piano at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Berlin- Charlottenburg and remained in this position until 1978. Puchelt performed in both parts of Germany, Western Europe, the Soviet Union - where he was the first West German pianist to be invited as early as 1956 -, South America, Japan and the USA. In 1962, when he gave five concerts in the Soviet Union, he was not allowed to take part in the concerts of the Philharmonic Orchestra in that year as planned, following a decision by the West Berlin cultural administration and the artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic. The intention was to \\"counteract complaints in public\\". Puchelt was a juror at numerous international piano competitions, including several times at the Robert Schumann International Competition for Pianists and Singers in Zwickau. In the 1970s, he was a member of the Broadcasting Council of the Sender Freies Berlin and deputy chairman of the programme committee there. In the 1960s and 1970s Puchelt also toured with his daughter Christiane Edinger. He has been honoured several times for his outstanding work as a music teacher and concert pianist.

She was the first Italian to join the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung (DMV), in 1905, and in 1908 became the first woman invited to deliver a lecture at International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM). Pisati was born in Ancona, and worked as a teacher at a secondary school for girls in Rome beginning in 1897. She graduated from Sapienza University of Rome in 1905. She died young a few days before the 1908 Congress in Rome, and a few days before her wedding to Italian physicist and electrical engineer Giovanni Giorgi, who had mentored her as a master's student. Her work for the Congress was titled \\"Saggio di una teoria sintetica delle funzioni di variabile complessa\\" [\\"An Essay on a Synthetic Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable\\"], and was presented by Roberto Marcolongo. Her geometry textbook Elementi di geometria ad uso delle scuole medie inferiori, published in 1907, was part of a movement in Italian teaching of the time reacting against a presentation of the material focusing on intuition and hands-on experimentation, as had become popular beginning in the 1880s, and returning to a style of teaching geometry that included more rigorous proofs. In her preface, Pisati wrote that it would be a mistake to omit formal proofs and that it is any more difficult to include this material.

Sayers starring Ian Carmichael broadcast on BBC One between 1972 and 1975, beginning with Clouds of Witness in April 1972. Production and Cast The adaptations star Ian Carmichael as aristocratic sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey, the second son of the Duke of Denver. Not wanting for money, charm or intelligence, Wimsey takes up detective work as an amateur pursuit, using his connections and social status to assist the police in their investigations. Carmichael played the role concurrently in a series of BBC Radio 4 adaptations from 1973, which eventually completed the whole sequence of Sayers's novels. In The Radio Detectives (1999), Carmichael recalls that he had hoped to continue with further television adaptations, but acknowledged that by 1975 he was too old to play the part onscreen for the sequence of more romantic novels featuring crime writer Harriet Vane. He felt that as a result of a technician strike, production of the fifth adaptation under a new producer, Bill Sellars, was not as successful, after which the series was not renewed. (Three later television adaptations of the Harriet Vane stories were produced as A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery with Edward Petherbridge as Wimsey in 1987.) Glyn Houston played Wimsey's loyal valet and assistant Mervyn Bunter in three adaptations and Derek Newark in The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club (the character does not appear in Murder Must Advertise). Mark Eden played Inspector Charles Parker, Lord Peter's friend and contact at Scotland Yard in three adaptations. The series was recorded in the then-standard format of videotape for studio sequences (recorded at Television Centre, London and Pebble Mill Birmingham from the second serial) and 16mm film for exterior location scenes. Locations included St Peter's Church, Walpole St Peter and Terrington St John, Norfolk for The Nine Tailors and Kirkcudbright, Galloway in Scotland for The Five Red Herrings, the latter almost entirely shot on film due to a technician strike, with only a few studio sequences taped in studios in Glasgow.

The Supreme Court‚Äôs rulings on the Marcoses‚Äô ill-gotten wealth. https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/626576/the-supreme-court- s-rulings-on-the-marcoses-ill-gotten-wealth/story/ These assets are referred to using several terms, including \\"ill-gotten wealth\\" and \\"unexplained wealth,\\" while some authors such as Philippine Senator Jovito Salonga and Belinda Aquino more bluntly refer to it as the \\"Marcos Plunder.\\" Legally, the Philippine Supreme Court defines this \\"ill-gotten wealth\\" as the assets the Marcoses acquired beyond the amount legally declared by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in the president's statements of assets and liabilities \\\\- only about US$13,500.00 worth from his salary as President. The court also deems such wealth to have been forfeited in favor of the government or of the human rights victims of Marcos' authoritarian regime. Estimates of the amount the Marcoses reportedly acquired in the last few years of the Marcos administration range from US$5‚Äì13 billion. No exact figures can be determined for the amount acquired through the entire 21 years of the Marcos regime. But prominent Marcos-era economist Jesus Estanislao has suggested that the amount could go up to as high as US$30 billion. Among the sources of the Marcos wealth are alleged to be: diverted foreign economic aid, US Government military aid (including huge discretionary funds at Marcos disposal as a \\"reward\\" for sending some Filipino troops to Vietnam) and kickbacks from public works contracts over a 2-decades-long rule. This wealth includes: real estate assets both within the Philippines and in several other countries, notably the United States; collections of jewelry and artwork; shares and other financial instruments; bank accounts, both in the Philippines and overseas, notably Switzerland, the United States, Singapore, and the British Virgin Islands.; and in some instances, actual cash assets. Some of this wealth has been recovered as the result of various court cases, either as funds or properties returned to the Philippine government, or by being awarded as reparations to the victims of human rights abuses under Marcos' presidency. Some of it has also been recovered by the Philippine government through settlements and compromise deals, either with the Marcoses themselves or with cronies who said that certain properties had been entrusted to them by the Marcoses. Some of the recovery cases have been dismissed by the courts for reasons including improper case filing procedures and technical issues with documentary evidence. An unknown amount is not recoverable because the full extent of the Marcos wealth is unknown.  Estimates  Estimates of the ill- gotten wealth of the Marcos family vary, with most sources accepting a figure of about US$5‚Äì10 billion for wealth acquired in the last years of the Marcos administration, but with rough extreme estimates of wealth acquired since the 1950s going as high as US$30 billion. In a 1985 report to the United States Congress House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Stephen Bosworth estimated that the Marcoses had stolen an accumulated wealth of US$10 billion \\"in recent years\\", in the context of the rapid decline of the Philppine economy in the early 1980s. The same figure was cited by the Philippines' Office of the Solicitor General soon after Marcos was deposed by the EDSA Revolution in 1986. Bosworth's source, Dr. Bernardo Villegas of the Philippine think tank the Center for Research and Communication, noted that the figure ultimately cited by Bosworth was a conservative estimate, and that the amount probably came closer to $13 billion. The PCGG's first chairperson, Jovito Salonga later said that he estimated figure of US$5‚Äì10 billion, based on the documentary trail left behind by the Marcoses in 1986. Internationally, Salonga's estimate has become the popularly cited estimate of the Marcoses' unexplained wealth, and it is this amount for which the Marcoses were cited by Guinness World Records as having perpetrated the \\"largest-ever theft from a government\\" in 1989 \\\\- a record they are still holding in 2020. Hoewever Dr. Jesus Estanislao, another noted economist from the Center for Research and Communication, pointed out that this figure reflected amounts taken out of the country in the years immediately prior to the ouster of the Marcos administration, and that there was no way to accurately estimate the wealth acquired by the Marcoses since the 1950s. He suggested that the figure could be as much as $30 billion.  Means of acquisition  Among the sources of the Marcos wealth are alleged to be diverted foreign economic aid, US Government military aid (including huge discretionary funds at Marcos disposal as a \\"reward\\" for sending some Filipino troops to Vietnam) and kickbacks from public works contracts over a 2-decades-long rule. According to Jovito Salonga in his book \\"Presidential Plunder\\", which details Salonga's time as head of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, these cronies helped the Marcoses amass his wealth by aiding him in one or more of what Salonga called \\"Marcos' Techniques of Plunder\\". These techniques, says Salonga, were: > # Creating monopolies and putting them under the control of cronies; # > Awarding behest loans to cronies from Government banking or financing > institutions; # Forced takeovers of various public or private enterprises, > with a nominal amount as payment; # Direct raiding of the public treasury > and Government Financing Institutions; # Issuance of Presidential Decrees or > orders, enabling cronies to amass wealth; # Kickbacks and commissions from > enterprises doing business in the Philippines; # Use of shell corporations > and dummy companies to launder money overseas; # Skimming off of Foreign Aid > and other forms of International Assistance; and # Hiding wealth in overseas > bank accounts using pseudonyms or code names.  Agency in charge of recovery  Shortly after Marcos was removed through the 1986 People Power revolution, an quasi-judicial government agency named the Presidential Commission on Good Government was created, with the primary mandate of recovering ill-gotten wealth accumulated by the Marcoses, their relatives, subordinates and close associates, whether located in the Philippines or abroad. It was also tasked with investigating other cases of graft and corruption; and instituting of corruption prevention measures. Two years later in 1998, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law mandated that the funds recovered by the PCGG be automatically appropriated to fund the Philippines' agrarian reform programs. Since then, assets recovered from the Marcoses by the PCGG has funded more than 80 percent of the Philippines' budget for agrarian reform.  Overseas real estate properties  Crown Building, one of four Manhattan buildings purchased by the Marcoses in the early 1980s.left Some of the most tangible examples of the unexplained wealth of the Marcos family are the various overseas real estate properties that the Marcoses acquired while they were in power. The best known of these properties are the Marcoses' multi-million dollar real estate investments in the United States, particularly Imelda's purchases of buildings and real estate in New York, the estates purchased in New Jersey for the use of the Marcos children, Jose Yao Campos's investments in Seattle, various properties in Hawaii including the Makiki Heights estate where they lived during their exile, and their ownership of the California Overseas Bank in Los Angeles. According to Ricardo Manapat's book \\"Some Are Smarter Than Others\\", which was one of the earliest to document details of the Marcos wealth, lesser-know properties include gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel, and various landholdings in Austria, London, and Rome. Many of these properties are to have been acquired under the name of several Marcos Cronies. One of them, Jose Yao Campos, cooperated with the Philippine Government and made an immunity deal, revealing how he fronted Marcos‚Äô investments both locally and abroad via numerous interlocking shell corporations.  Marcos mansions in the Philippines  Aside from the overseas properties, there are fifty-or-so \\"Marcos mansions\\" acquired by the Marcos family within the Philippines itself. Locations of these \\"Marcos mansions\\" include properties in Philippines' \\"Summer Capital\\" of Baguio City, in the Ilocos region where the Marcoses trace their ancestry, Leyte where Imelda Marcos' family came from, and throughout the Greater Manila Area and its outskirts. Some of these properties are titled in the name of Marcos family members, but others are titled in the name of identified ‚ÄúMarcos cronies,‚Äù but reserved for the use of the Marcos family. In some cases, several such mansions were located close together, with specific mansions meant for individual members of the family, as was the case of the Marcos mansions on Outlook Drive in Baguio. Many of the Marcos mansions were sequestered by the Philippine government when the Marcoses were expelled from the country as a result of the 1986 EDSA Revolution. The Marcos jewels  Also sequestered by the PCGG in 1986 were three sets of Imelda Marcos' jewelry, which have collectively come to be known as the \\"Marcos jewels\\" or \\"Imelda jewels.\\" Individually, the three collections of jewels sequestered by the PCGG have been come to be called the \\"Hawaii collection,\\" the \\"Malacanang collection\\", and the \\"Roumeliotes collection\\", respectively. The \\"Hawaii collection\\" refers to a group of jewels seized by the US Bureau of Customs from the Marcoses when went into exile in Hawaii in 1986. The \\"Malacanang collection\\" refers to a group of jewels which were discovered in Malacanang Palace after the Marcoses fled the Philippines. The \\"Roumeliotes collection\\" refers to a group of jewels which were confiscated from Demetriou Roumeliotes, said to have been a close associate of Imelda Marcos, after he was caught trying to smuggle them out of the Philippines at Manila International Airport. In February 2016, the government of the Philippines announced that the three collections had been appraised as valuing , and that they would eventually be auctioned off after having been kept unsold by the government for three decades.  Overseas bank accounts  Much of the Marcos wealth that the PCGG has been trying to recover is kept in various overseas bank accounts, which the PCGG was able to identify based on documents left by the Marcoses in Malacanang in February 1986 Marcos had started opening such accounts even before he was President, opening his first bank account by depositing US$215,000.00 in Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City on July 7, 1960.  The William Saunders and Jane Ryan accounts The most famous of these overseas accounts of the Marcoses are the four so- called William Saunders and Jane Ryan accounts, opened with Credit Suisse in Zurich in March 1968.

Status of recovery efforts  By 2019, the PCGG had recovered more than P171 billion of ill-gotten wealth from the Marcoses and from Marcos cronies since its creation in 1986. Some of this came from money sequestered by the PCGG or surrendered under various compromise agreements, and some of it came from the sale of various surrendered or sequestered properties.

Formation  The NIHP reports directly to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. It was established on 18 August 2020 as a single leadership structure bringing together Public Health England, NHS Test and Trace and the analytical capability of the Joint Biosecurity Centre. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the statutory formalisation and operation of the new organisation is expected from spring 2021. Baroness Dido Harding is the interim executive chair of the new organisation. Harding has been serving as chairwoman of NHS Improvement since 2017 and is head of the NHS Test and Trace programme, established in May 2020. She is a former chief executive of the TalkTalk Group. She sits in the House of Lords as a member of the Conservative Party and is married to Conservative Party Member of Parliament John Penrose. During questioning by the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Commons, Harding said she held the interim leadership while a full application process was carried out. The health secretary, Matt Hancock said that the NIHP would learn from South Korea and from Germany's Robert Koch Institute \\"where their health protection agencies have a huge, primary, focus on pandemic response\\". The Telegraph first leaked news of the plans for the new agency on 16 August 2020. They claimed that Public Health England was to be \\"scrapped\\" and replaced by a single body combining it with NHS Test and Trace, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A leaked memo to staff written by the head of Public Health England, Duncan Selbie, said that the aim of the new body was to boost expertise with \\"much needed new investment\\". Selbie apologised to staff that the news of the organisation's demise was briefed to The Telegraph before they were told.  Response  A BMJ editorial described the move as \\"extremely foolhardy\\". It characterised the National Institute for Health Protection as \\"seem[ing] remarkably similar to the Health Protection Agency abolished in 2013.\\" An editorial in The Spectator welcomed the return to an organisation similar in remit to the that agency; it criticised Public Health England's focus on health improvement topics such as obesity and binge drinking, arguing that these should now be tackled by local NHS health teams. The Telegraph welcomed the change, characterising PHE as the quango \\"responsible for many critical failures over the course of this [COVID-19] pandemic\\" that had to be scrapped. More than 70 health organisations wrote to the government on 2 September 2020 to express concern about the future of health improvement work under these changes.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/02/health-leaders-warn- boris-johnson-over-axing-of-public-health-england The appointment of Harding as interim executive chair of the new body was criticised by health experts as she did not have a background in health, and because of her political position. The Guardian quoted allies of hers who, in response, said that she had quickly learned after being appointed chair of NHS Improvement in 2017 and that she had a record of \\"getting things done\\" while working in business. The timing of the reorganisation, during the ongoing pandemic response, was criticised by various health experts and other bodies, including the editorial in the BMJ, the Institute for Government, the King's Fund, and Christina Marriott, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health. An editorial in The Guardian compared it to \\"reorganising a fire brigade as it tries to put out a blaze\\" and said the decision had been made without proper consultation or scrutiny.

Life  He was born in Dessau as the son of a cellist from a family of musicians with a long tradition. Thus, he received his first musical education from his father. From 1812, Bischoff studied philology in Berlin. But already in 1813 he joined the Prussian Cavalry Regiment and took part in the Battle of Leipzig. In 1814, he resumed his studies in Berlin and finished them in 1817. In spring 1818, he moved to Switzerland, where he found employment as a pedagogue. After his return, he became a teacher at a grammar school in Berlin in 1821 and in 1823 director of the grammar school in Wesel, where Konrad Duden took his Abitur with him. Bischoff actively participated in the musical life in Wesel and founded a singing and orchestra association. Because of his liberal attitude and his behaviour during the 1848 revolution he had to say goodbye and moved to Bonn in 1849. There, he founded the Rheinische Musikzeitung (1850-59, later Niederrheinische Musikzeitung), which was published in Cologne and whose declared aim was to defend the traditions of classical art against the unreasonable demands of contemporaries. In 1850 he founded the music society \\"Beethoven Verein\\" together with others. Only a short time later, this association, consisting of professional musicians and dilettantes, gave subscription concerts.Briefe und Texte on Berliner-intellektuelle Bischoff spent the last years in Cologne, where he died of a stroke in 1867 at the age of 72.

It is an important part of the repair mechanism of double-stranded breaks (DSB) of the DNA molecule: two of the three main mechanisms for repair of DSBs, microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) and homologous recombination (HRR) rely on end resection. The presence of a section of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) allows the broken end of the DNA to line up accurately with a matching sequence, so that it can be accurately repaired.  Background  A double-strand break is a kind of DNA damage in which both strands in the double helix are severed. They are particularly dangerous, because they can lead to genome rearrangements. Cases where the two strands are linked at the point of the double-strand break are even worse, because then the cell will not be able to complete mitosis when it next divides, and will either die or, in rare cases, undergo a mutation. Three mechanisms exist to repair double-strand breaks (DSBs): non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), MMEJ, and HRR. Of these, only NHEJ does not rely on end resection. Resection ensures that DSBs are not repaired by NHEJ (which joins broken DNA ends together without ensuring that they match), but rather by methods based on homology (matching DNA sequences). Because homologous recombination needs an intact copy of the DNA sequence (a sister chromatid) to be readily available, it can only take place during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. This control is exerted by cyclin-dependent kinases, which phosphorylate parts of the resection machinery.  Mechanism  Before resection can take place, the break needs to be detected. In animals, this detection is done by PARP1; similar systems exist in other eukaryotes: in plants, PARP2 seems to play this role. PARP binding then recruits the MRN complex to the breakage site. This is a highly conserved complex consisting of Mre11, Rad50 and NBS1 (known as Nibrin in mammals, or Xrs2 in yeast, where this complex is called the MRX complex). Before resection can start, CtBP1-interacting protein (CtIP) needs to bind to the MRN complex so that the first phase of resection can begin, namely short-range end resection. After phosphorylated CtIP binds, the Mre11 subunit is able to cut the 5'-terminated strand endonucleolytically, probably about 300 base pairs from the end, and then acts as a 3'‚Üí5' exonuclease to strip away the end of the 5' strand. After this short-range resection, other protein complexes can bind, namely the long-range resection machinery, which uses 5'‚Üí3' exonuclease activity to extend the single-stranded DNA region. Like all single-stranded DNA in the nucleus, the resected region is first coated by Replication protein A (RPA) complex,p235 but RPA is then replaced with RAD51 to form a nucleoprotein filament which can take part in the search for a matching region, allowing HRR to take place.

Location The 132 kilo Volt power line starts at the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) 132kV substation at Mirama Hills, Ntungamo District, in Uganda's Western Region. The power line travels in a general easterly direction to Kikagati Hydroelectric Power Station, in Kikagati, Isingiro District, a road distance of approximately . From there, the power line takes a general northeasterly direction to end at Nshungyezi Hydroelectric Power Station, a distance of about , as the crow flies, but is approximately by road from Kikagati. Due to the steep terrain, the power line does not always follow the winding road. The line measures only , from Mirama Hills to Nshungyezi. Overview The power line is being developed to evacuate the 16 megawatts of electricity generated at Kikagati Hydroelectric Power Station and the 39 megawatts generated at Nshungyezi Power Station and transmit it to Mirama Hills, for integration into Uganda's national electricity grid. Associated power infrastructure As of August 2020, Kikagati Power Station is under construction at a contract price of US$88 million and an anticipated completion date of 2021. The project received US$12.3 million partial funding from the Uganda GET Fit Program.

Arguments for this are based on various biblical passages, especially \\"thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour\\", one of the Ten Commandments. Christian theologians disagree as to the exact definition of \\"lie\\" and whether it is ever acceptable. Biblical passages One of the Ten Commandments is \\"thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour\\"; for this reason, lying is generally considered a sin in Christianity. The story of Naboth in 1 Kings 21 provides an example where false witness leads to an unjust outcome. The exact interpretation of the commandment is disputed: \\"Does the commandment pertain only to court or does it prohibit lying in general? Is it only a prohibition (not to lie in court, not ever to lie) or does it imply a positive injunction (truth-telling in court, truth-telling in general)? If positive, is one enjoined only to truth- telling or to veracity and honesty also?\\" Other statements in the Bible express a negative view of lying, such as \\"You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another\\" (Leviticus 19:11) and \\"Cursed is he who does the work of the Lord deceitfully\\" (Jeremiah 48:10). In the Hebrew Bible, those who practice lying and deceit are seemingly rewarded for their actions, posing problems for an exegesis that upholds a categorical prohibition. Examples include the Hebrew midwives who lie after Pharaoh commands them to kill all newborn boys (Exodus 1:17‚Äì21), and Rahab (Joshua 2:1‚Äì7; cf. Hebrews 11:31), an innkeeper who lies to soldiers while hiding spies in her inn. The midwives appear to be rewarded for their actions (God \\"dealt well with the midwives‚Äù and ‚Äúgave them families\\"). James 2:25 appears to praise Rahab as an example of good works: \\"And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?\\" In the Book of Judith, Judith deceives Holofernes in order to assassinate him. Both Abraham and Isaac claimed that their wives were their sisters. Patristic views Augustine devoted much attention to lying, which he contended was always wrong. He discussed the topic in four works (De magistro, De doctrina christiana, De trinitate, and Enchiridion) and wrote two treatises, De mendacio and Contra mendacium, specifically on the subject of lies. According to Augustine, only four types of falsehood were not lies, because there was no desire to deceive: explanation of someone else's viewpoint, repetition of memorized words, a slip of the tongue, or misspeaking. Augustine distinguished different situations of lying by blameworthiness, but argued that every lie was a sin. The consensus among scholars is that Augustine did not accept any lies as necessary or justified, even to save an innocent life. However, there was an equally strong patristic tradition that defended lying for a worthwhile cause and considered it necessary or even righteous in some cases. Exponents of this view include Pseudo-Maximus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Hilary of Poitiers, John Cassian, John Chrysostom, Dorotheus of Gaza, Palladius of Antioch, John Climacus, and Paulinus of Nola. This second patristic tradition was summarized by Ambrose of Milan, whose argument, based on scripture, held that Judith's action was meritorious because \\"she undertook for religion, not love... she served religion... and the fatherland\\". Later views Notable Christian theologians who argued that lying was never permissible for Christians include Thomas Aquinas and John Calvin. Both Augustine and Aquinas held that it was always possible to take a correct and blameless action in any circumstance. Defenders of lying in some cases, such as Cassian and H. Tristram Engelhardt, tended to hold the opposite view: that sometimes true moral dilemmas arise. In the twentieth century, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Reinhold Niebuhr also took a non-absolutist position. In Ethics, Bonhoeffer discusses Kantian ethics and contests the Kantian view of lying, because \\"Treating truthfulness as a principle leads Kant to the grotesque conclusion that if asked by a murderer whether my friend, whom he was pursuing, had sought refuge in my house, I would have to answer honestly in the affirmative.\\" Although he maintained that one should lie to save his friend in that situation, Bonhoeffer argued that either option incurred guilt. In a later essay, ‚ÄúWhat Does It Mean to Tell the Truth?‚Äù, Bonhoeffer argued that \\"Lying ‚Ä¶ is and ought to be understood as something plainly condemnable\\" and that it did not always incur guilt. Professor Allen Verhey argued that lying is not always wrong, because \\"We live the truth not for its own sake, but for God's sake and for the neighbor's sake.\\" The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that lying is always wrong. Different definitions of lying exist, such that Christians do not agree that all deception counts as \\"lying\\". Catholic writer and new natural law philosopher Christopher Tollefsen has also argued that lying is never permissible for Christians. In a review of Tollefsen's book, John Skalko stated that this is an unpopular and widely criticized view. Public opinion According to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey, 67% of Christians in the United States, including 81% of those who defined themselves as \\"highly religious\\", agreed that \\"Being honest at all times\\" was \\"essential\\" to their Christian identity.

In 1541, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it was granted as part of the endowment of the newly established See of Gloucester, the new Bishops of Gloucester using the old Abbey Church as their Cathedral.

A Republican who would later embrace monarchism, he went on to assume the ministerial portfolios of Overseas and Development during the Sexenio Democr√°tico, returning for two additional spells as Overseas minister during the regency of Maria Christina of Austria.  Biography = Early life and revolutionary activity  Born in Santa Mar√≠a del Otero, Castro de Rey, province of Lugo, on 20 October 1820. Son to a math teacher, he did not complete studies in Engineering. He received however substantial teaching in Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy from and founded a reputed Academy of Mathematics in Madrid. A defender of Republicanism in his early life, he took part in the , One of the founders of the Democratic‚ÄìProgressive Party (best known as Democratic Party) in 1849, he also took part in the 1854 revolts, battling in the streets of Madrid, being arrested and imprisoned at El Saladero. Following the 1856 counter- revolutionary involution by O'Donnell, Becerra entered in combat in the Plaza de Santo Domingo at the helm of a light battalion of the National Militia trying to defend the Constitutional liberties side by side against a battalion of J√§gers sent by O'Donnell, and was forced to exile. He would endorse the (for which he was sentenced to death by garrote for rebellion). Forced again to exile, he was one of the endorsers of the 16 August 1866 becoming (as representative of the democrats) one of the three legs of the coordination of the revolutionary action along Juan Prim and (representative of the progressives), that aimed towards the overthrow of Isabella II and the call of Constituent Cortes elected by universal suffrage.  Sexenio democr√°tico  After the 1868 Glorious Revolution, Becerra became a member of the Junta Superior Revolucionaria. Along and Cristino Martos he would become one of the leaders of the so-called , the monarchist democrats part of the 1868‚Äì1871 Provisional Government. In July 1869, during the Regency of Marshal Serrano, he was appointed as Minister of Overseas. A founding member of the Spanish Abolitionist Society back in 1864, he took measures during his first ministerial tenure towards the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico, presenting two projects in 1869, which were not welcomed either by his cabinet peers or from the parliament. After months of fierce resistance to the ministerial initiatives from pro-slavery legislators such as Antonio C√°novas del Castillo or , Becerra was forced to resign in March 1870 amid intense pressure. Already entered the reign of Amadeo, during the premiership of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla, Becerra was appointed as Minister of Development in December 1872, replacing Jos√© Echegaray. On 11 February 1873, in a vote at the Cortes during the same session in which the declaration of the First Republic was proclaimed, he was confirmed as Minister of Development (with 266 votes in favour). He would however leave the ministry by late February.

Following the Bourbon Restoration, Becerra joined the Liberal Fusionist Party led by Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta as part of its left-leaning faction. He left the fusionists in 1881 to create along Segismundo Moret, Eugenio Montero R√≠os and Jos√© L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez the Dynastic Left. An initiated Freemason (symbol: Fortaleza; grade: 33), Becerra was chosen as Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Spain in 1884; after his departure from the post in 1886, the organization was thrown into chaos and divided into factions.

He died on 19 December 1896 at his address in the in Madrid; he was apparently drinking a glass of milk, and, as it slipped out of his hand, after a sigh, he died.

This means that if a given event occurs, then this is the result of a previous, related event.\\"Law of universal causation\\", Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (editor Noah Porter, Springfield, MA: C. & G. Merriam Co., 1913) If an object is in a certain state, then it is in that state as a result of another object interacting with it previously. The idea of universal causation is formulated in western philosophy similarly for ages, however the formulations contain some profound differences in methodology and philosophical assumptions. Examples: In contrast, Bertrand Russell argued (in 1912) that the law of causation as usually stated by philosophers is false and is not used in sciences (maybe with exception of their infancy).Russell, B. (1912). On the Notion of Cause. Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 13, new series, 1-26. However his position on universal causation evolved and \\"was not as naive as it may have appeared\\".Griffin, N. (1979). Bertrand Russell and Causality. Biometrics, 35(4), 909-911 In 1927 Russell writes that the notion of universal causation marks the beginnings of science and philosophy.Russell B. (1927). The analysis of matter. p. 150. Philosophers who do believe in exception-less, universal, fundamental laws of nature are in recent times more often referred to as \\"fundamentalists\\", however these who present \\"anti-laws\\" efforts (for instance showing that in many cases laws of sciences are ceteris paribus laws) \\"pluralists\\" are in the minority.Hoefer, Carl, \\"Causal Determinism\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) As axioms of causality According to William Whewell (hypothetico- deductivist view) the concept of universal causation depends on three axioms: # Nothing takes place without a cause # The magnitude of an effect is proportional to the magnitude of its cause # To every action there is an equal and opposed reaction. Whewell writes that the first axiom is so clear that it requires no proof if only the idea of cause is understood.William Whewell, (1840). The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences Founded Upon Their History, p. 171. Example Example for the axiom: if a baseball is moving through the air, it must be moving this way because of a previous interaction with another object, such as being hit by a baseball bat. Criticism An epistemological axiom is a self-evident truth. Thus the \\"Axiom of Causality\\" claims to be a universal rule that is so obvious that it does not need to be proved to be accepted. Even among epistemologists, the existence of such a rule is controversial. See the full article on Epistemology. As Law of Universal Causation or Principle of Universal Causation (PUC) John Stuart Mill describes the Law of Universal Causation in following way: Contrary to hypothetico-deductivists Mill focuses on inductive reasoning and senses in framing of the Law of Universal Causation i.e. uses basic features of experimental methods and convinces, after critical analysis, that this law is proved by induction better then any other of subordinate generalizations.System of Logic 1872, Book III, Chapter V, Of The Law Of Universal Causation., pp. 373-426, Chapter XXI, Of The Evidence Of The Law Of Universal Causation, pp. 95-111 Also popular proof and answer to skepticism (for instance that of David Hume) is that PUC has been true in so many cases, that (using basic scientific method enumerative inductive reasoning)Andersen, Hanne and Brian Hepburn, \\"Scientific Method\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) it is reasonable to say that it is true in every case, moreover counter-example i.e. event that does not have a cause is hard to conceive.Castell, A. (1972). The Status of the Principle of Universal Causation. Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 32(3), 403-407. doi:10.2307/2105573  Criticism  Modern version of law of universal causation is connected with Newtonian physics, but is also criticized for instance by David Hume who presents skeptical reductionist view on causality.James Baillie, \\"Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Hume on Morality\\" Since then his view on the concept of causality is often predominating (see Causality, After the Middle Ages). Kant answered to Hume in many aspects, defending the a priority of universal causation.De Pierris, Graciela and Michael Friedman, \\"Kant and Hume on Causality\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2018 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) In 2017 book Robert C. Koons & Timothy Pickavance point out four objections to Universal Causation:Robert C. Koons & Timothy Pickavance, (2017). The Atlas of Reality: A Comprehensive Guide to Metaphysics pp. 583-586 #if we additionally assume mereological universalism, universal causation doesn't exclude self- causation, which is controversial #pluralized causal principle - there are pluralized versions of universal causation, that allow exceptions to the principle #Robert K. Meyer's causal chain principleMeyer, R. (1987). God Exists!, Nous, 21(3), pp. 345-361. doi:10.2307/2215186, uses set theory axioms, assumes that something must cause itself in set of causes and so universal causation doesn't exclude self-causation #against infinite regress Spontaneity One implication of Universal Causation is that if a phenomenon appears to occur without any observable external cause, the cause must be internal. See Compatibilism. Variation Another implication of the Universal Causation is that all change in the universe is a result of the continual application of physical laws. Determinism If all events are cause and effect relationships that follow universal rules, then all events‚Äîpast, present and future‚Äîare theoretically determinate. See Causal determinism. Exceptions: uncaused cause, First Cause If all effects are the result of previous causes, then the cause of a given effect must itself be the effect of a previous cause, which itself is the effect of a previous cause, and so on, forming an infinite logical chain of events that can have no beginning. Exception for the Universal Causation - First Cause is sometimes pointed out to be logically necessary for it to not contradict itself. Infinite chain of events is hard to conceive in finite world. The answer is looped chain of events. But this is also questioned as the whole loop would have no cause. However it can not be ruled out that the Universe is infinite in time. Other exceptions are pointed out - every: * contingent and unnecessary * causable * that have beginning * finite things are caused.

According to the authorities, Cohen, a former rackets collector, was a member of the criminal organization Murder, Inc., led by Louis Buchalter and, like the gang leader and other members of the organization, was involved in international drug trafficking . International drug trafficking  According to the findings of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), the international drug trade intended for the USA in the 1920s and 1930s was largely controlled by the Kosher Nostra member Jacob Katzenberg, who was based in New York City. This supplied a large number of criminal gangs, including the organization around Louis Buchalter, to which Philip Cohen also belonged, with opium, which was initially obtained from Europe and later directly from China and then sold on nationally in the USA. The many murders carried out by Cohen's organization, which the press dubbed Murder, Inc., were largely based on enabling and covering up crimes of the criminal organization and the National Crime Syndicate, such as the drug trafficking organized by Katzenberg. This was actively supported by Murder, Inc. and can be seen as one of the main sources of income for the criminal organization in addition to the infiltration of unions and related industries - such as in particular the clothing industry in the Garment District (Manhattan) . Philip Cohen and his accomplice Emanuel Weiss were heavily involved in the criminal organization's drug deals. The FBN first became aware of the group's machinations in 1935 when the remains of an opium processing plant were discovered by authorities after an explosion in a residential building on Seymour Avenue in New York City. In 1937, the FBN believed it had secured evidence of a violation of the US Narcotics Act by Cohen and Weiss when they managed to find Jacob Gottlieb at Rouses Point in New York State with a suitcase full of heroin. When he was arrested, he told the authorities that he had smuggled drugs from France through Canada to the USA for Cohen and Weiss and that the two were his clients. Shortly afterwards, while still in custody, Gottlieb committed suicide by hanging himself in his cell for fear of retaliation by Murder, Inc. against him or his family. No charges could be brought against Cohen and Weiss due to the death of the only witness . In 1939, the two Murder, Inc. members, who had long been the focus of the FBN, were finally indicted for violations of the US Narcotics Act. During a house search, FBN investigators discovered a chemical plant used to stretch morphine and had secured evidence of the involvement of Weiss, Cohen and three other people named Samuel Bernstein, Abe \\"Little Yiddel\\" Lorber and Al Angelson. After the fugitives were arrested in 1939, the trial was scheduled for 1940. Emanuel Weiss and Philip Cohen were released after paying bail, but did not appear at the trial because they had also been charged with the murder of Joseph Rosen, a former haulage owner, since May 1940 and wanted to evade the trial.Lepke trial opens; jury-picking lags; Blue-Ribbon Talesmen Prove Reluctant to Serve in Brooklyn Murder Case, The New York Times, 5 August 1941, p. 40 After several months of manhunt, New York police officers managed to arrest Cohen in a Brooklyn apartment during a nightly house search on November 30 1940, and found the wanted man exhausted and under the influence of drugs.Norton Mockridge, Robert H. Prall: The Big Fix, Holt, 1954, p. 71. There was no sign of his accomplice Weiss. In February 1941, Philip Cohen and the three remaining defendants were sentenced to three to ten years in prison. Cohen was sentenced to ten years. Murder of Joseph Rosen In the mid-1930s, prosecutor William O'Dwyer, who had set himself the goal of taking action against organized crime, put the focus of his investigation on Louis Buchalter, the boss of Cohen. This resulted in particular in driving potential witnesses out of town or their being murdered. Buchalter saw danger in a businessman named Joseph Rosen, who had been informed of the gang leader's involvement in the infiltration of the unions and had returned to the city against his will. On September 13 1936, on Buchalter's orders, Rosen was shot in his shop in Brownsville, New York City .Lepke trial opens; jury-picking lags; Blue-Ribbon Talesmen Prove Reluctant to Serve in Brooklyn Murder Case, The New York Times, 5 August 1941, p. 40 Harry Strauss was supposedly commissioned with the planning and execution of the crime along with James Ferraco, Emanuel Weiss, Sholem Bernstein and Louis Capone. Along with Sholem Bernstein, Philip Cohen was seen as an escape driver and is said to have transported the perpetrators, who initially used a stolen escape vehicle, in his car after leaving the vehicle and helped them escape from the crime scene. When the public prosecutor's office was able to prosecute those involved on the basis of the testimony of the contract killer Abe Reles, who had become an informant, Philip Cohen was initially included in the murder charge in 1940, but was later struck off the list of accused due to lack of evidence. Instead, he had already been convicted of drug smuggling. Cohen's accomplices Emanuel Weiss, Louis Capone and gang leader Louis Buchalter were sentenced to death for the murder of Rosen and in 1944, after two years of vehement but unsuccessful attempts to enforce a retrial, were executed in the electric chair in Sing Sing Prison. Murder of Danny Fields and Louis Cohen  Philip Cohen was also linked by investigators with the FBN to the double homicide of Danny Fields aka Isadore Friedman and Louis Cohen on January 28 1939, and is believed to have been one of the shooters. However, in the absence of sufficient evidence, no charges could be brought against Cohen. Assassination  Philip Cohen was found dead on a Long Island road a few months after his release on September 15, 1949 . He had been shot in the head four times. Lepke aide slain; gang war is seen; Body of Philip Cohen Is Found on Valley Stream Road, 4 Bullets in His Head New York Times, 17 September 1949 The authorities ruled out robbery and rather classified the act as a classic underworld-style execution; the perpetrators had no interest in various valuables that Cohen was carrying. Police officers later found Cohen's car with traces of blood on the passenger seat. Allegedly, Cohen was murdered in a manner similar to that of several Murder, Inc. victims who were shot dead by a perpetrator sitting behind them during a final drive. However, prosecutor Burton Turkus, who served in the Joseph Rosen murder case, contradicted claims in the press that Cohen may have been murdered in retaliation for the conviction and execution of Louis Buchalter, Emanuel Weiss and Louis Capone to avoid the electric chair himself. In fact, Cohen never cooperated with the authorities, said Turkus. In typical underworld fashion, the accused kept silent about any offers made by the public prosecutor. The day Cohen was released from the dock for lack of evidence, he turned to Buchalter in the courtroom and assured him that he had not cooperated nor would cooperate. The police failed to solve Cohen's murder. It was assumed, however, that after his release from prison, Cohen wanted to gain a foothold in the criminal milieu again and thereby pushed competitors out of their niche. In particular, Cohen, as the head of a criminal group, is said to have tried to blackmail betting shops and accountants.

Previous events and plans of the parties Having suffered a heavy defeat in the Donbass Defensive Operation in October 1941, the troops of the Soviet Southern Front (commanded by Colonel General Yakov Cherevichenko) withdrew to the Debaltsevo‚ÄìBolshekrepinskaya‚ÄìKhapry line by the beginning of November 1941. At this line, the heavily weakened armies of the front were hastily consolidated: the 12th Army (Major General Konstantin Koroteev), the 18th Army (Major General Vladimir Kolpakchi), the 9th Army (Major General Fyodor Kharitonov). All armies had a large shortage of personnel, and especially in military equipment. After a heavy defeat in the Donbass operation, they demanded a significant replenishment, but all Soviet reserves were sent to Moscow and to form Reserve Armies. Since Rostov-on-Don remained the main target of the German offensive, the 56th Separate Army (Lieutenant General Fyodor Remezov) was deployed on the approaches to the city, which hastily created the Rostov‚ÄìNovocherkassk fortified region and was responsible for the immediate defense of Rostov.Directive of the Headquarters of the Supreme Command No. 003017 of October 15, 1941 to the Commander‚Äìin‚ÄìChief of the South‚ÄìWestern Direction, Commander of the Kharkov and North Caucasian Military Districts, Head of the Main Directorate of Formation and Manning of Troops, Marshal of the Soviet Union Semyon Budyonny on the Reassignment of the Kharkov Military District to the Commander of the South‚ÄìWest Western Direction and the Formation of the 56th Separate Army // Russian Archive: Great Patriotic War: Headquarters of the Supreme High Command. Documents and Materials. 1941 Year. Volume 16 (5‚Äì1) ‚Äì Moscow, 1996 ‚Äì Pages 245‚Äì246 The command of Army Group South (General Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt), after a short pause to pull up the rear, was preparing to resume the operation to capture Rostov. However, having received intelligence information about the strengthening of the Soviet defense on the shortest route to Rostov along the Taganrog‚ÄìRostov-on-Don railway along the Azov Sea coast, it decided to change the direction of the main attack and carry out a deep enveloping maneuver from the north and northeast, through Dyakovo, Shakhty, Novocherkassk. If successful, the troops of the 9th and 56th Separate Armies would fall into the encirclement northwest of Rostov. Then it was planned to turn part of the forces of the 1st Tank Army to the north and, together with the troops of the 17th Army, close a new encirclement ring in the Voroshilovgrad area for complete encirclement and elimination of the entire Southern Front in the eastern part of Donbass. In addition, the 1st Panzer Army (Colonel General Ewald von Kleist) was to seize a bridgehead on the southern bank of the Don. After that, it was supposed to develop an offensive to the south and, first of all, to capture Maykop and Tuapse in order to send oil through the pipeline and further by sea for refining to Romania. In March ‚Äì April 1942, German troops expected to completely occupy the Caucasus up to the border with Iran. To carry out the operation, the 14th Motorized Corps (General of the Infantry Gustav von Wietersheim of the 1st Panzer Army (14th and 16th Panzer Divisions, SS Viking Motorized Division) was deployed to the eastern part of Donbass. From the south, he was assisted by the 3rd Motorized Corps (60th Motorized Division and SS Adolf Hitler Motorized Division), from the north by the 49th Mountain Corps (1st and 4th Mountain Divisions). In the south, the 13th Panzer Division delivered a diversionary blow to Rostov along the shortest route. The offensive of the strike group was supported by the troops of the 17th German Army and the Italian Expeditionary Corps (General Giovanni Messe). The Soviet command was able to timely reveal the transfer of the strike forces of the 1st Tank Army to the north, accurately determine the direction of the main attack (in the zone of the 9th Soviet Army) and unravel the German plans. Not having in their reserve tank forces to parry a German strike and not counting on replenishing their significantly weakened troops, the Commander‚Äìin‚ÄìChief of the South‚ÄìWest Direction, Marshal of the Soviet Union Semyon Timoshenko and Cherevichenko focused on exhausting the enemy with stubborn defense. In the defense zone of the 9th Army, a system of anti‚Äìtank strong points and anti‚Äìtank areas was built in the Dyakovo area, which became one of the first experiments with a powerful anti-tank defense in the Great Patriotic War. These points mutually covered each other with fire, were echeloned in depth and provided crossfire from several artillery positions on each target. The infantry personnel allocated for the defense of these points were tested with tanks and were trained in actions when repelling tank attacks. Operation progress On November 5, the German 1st Panzer Army launched an offensive in the 9th Army's defense zone. The German command did not succeed in achieving a surprise; the battle immediately took on an extremely fierce character. On the 9th Army's right flank, relying on the anti‚Äìtank areas at Dyakovo, two Soviet rifle divisions pinned down three 1st Panzer Army divisions and inflicted heavy losses on them. German tanks, with great difficulty, slowly moved forward, storming one Soviet position after another. Parts of the 9th Army of General Fyodor Kharitonov combined stubborn defense with active actions, inflicted three powerful counterattacks on the wedged enemy. By the end of November 8, in four days of fighting, the enemy, at the cost of heavy losses, had managed to push the 9th Army 30‚Äì35 kilometers away. From November 11 to 16, German troops advanced another 25 kilometers in the Novocherkassk direction. The advance on the main direction to Shakhty was only 15 kilometers, on the auxiliary one (to Krasny Sulin) ‚Äì a little more than 10 kilometers, and in a diversionary attack on Rostov, the German 13th Panzer Division did not advance at all. To the north, in the zone of the 18th Army, the advance of the German infantry divisions in 12 days of fighting ranged from 2 to 10 kilometers. During the entire battle, the enemy never managed to break through the Soviet defenses. The penetration of German troops into the line of the Soviet defense forced them to stretch out their northern flank. A front line configuration favorable for the Soviet side was formed, convenient for striking the flank and rear of the 1st German Tank Army. On November 8, the Commander‚Äìin‚ÄìChief of the troops of the South‚ÄìWestern direction, Semyon Timoshenko, reported to the Supreme Commander‚Äìin‚ÄìChief Joseph Stalin the plan of an offensive operation with the aim of defeating the 1st German Tank Army.Report of the Commander‚Äìin‚ÄìChief of the South‚ÄìWestern Direction to the Supreme Commander‚Äìin‚ÄìChief No. 3098 to the Supreme Commander‚Äìin‚ÄìChief of the Decision on the Defense of the North Caucasus // Russian Archives: Great Patriotic War: Headquarters of the Supreme High Command.

Results of the operation Both sides suffered significant losses in manpower, and the German side in tanks. As a result of losses, the command of Army Group South had to make adjustments to the plan for a further offensive, which again led to a regrouping of troops and a suspension of the offensive. The plan for a new encirclement of the troops of the Southern Front was thwarted by the Red Army at the very beginning. Under cover of the stubborn heroic defense of the armies of the Southern Front, and above all the troops of the 9th Army, the Soviet command regrouped its forces. On November 15‚Äì16, troops of the 37th Army moved out of the concentration area to the front line and occupied the starting lines for the launch of a counteroffensive on the Rovenki‚ÄìPavlovka line. Without the slightest operational pause, on November 17, Soviet troops went on the offensive ‚Äì the Rostov Offensive Operation began. In the course of it, the course of the battle on the entire southern flank of the Soviet‚ÄìGerman front was turned around and the largest defeat was inflicted on German troops in the entire history of World War II.

Synopsis The film portrays six indigenous Maya in Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico, showing their daily and ceremonial lives - and their determination to resist the destruction of their culture and environment, their rainforests and their native corn. The Maya believe that they are guardians of the earth. In the film, the young indigenous fight against Central Americas largest open-pit goldmine in Guatemala and the environmental cost of gold exploration, demanding social and environmental justice. Their cosmovision, in which all life is sacred and interconnected, is portrayed as a compelling alternative to the prevailing short-sighted and thoughtless exploitation and destruction of our planet.  Release and reception  Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth had its international premiere at the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (Masters Section) after its German premiere at DokLeipzig, was screened at over a hundred international film festivals and was awarded numerous awards, including first prize at Canada's largest environmental film Festival, Planet in Focus, Toronto , the Audience Award at the German Nature Film Prize and all three top awards in Montreal's First Peoples Festival. It won awards or opened every human rights festival in both Central and South America. The film had a theatrical release in Germany and Japan and was the opening film of the 2012 Human Rights Film Festival at the National Theater of Guatemala.  Critical response  Aesthetically and in terms of content, the film has been positively reviewed after its theatrical release in Germany. Above all, the universal struggle of Indigenous peoples for their rights is brought into sharp focus. Thomas Assheuer writes in Die Zeit: ‚ÄûIt is quite possible our great corporations will succeed in finishing Nature off and plant genetically modified corn over its burnt out remains. It is quite possible they will intimidate and expel the Indigenous from their lands. On the other hand, resistance is growing... If one is searching for impressive evidence of this tenacious determination, Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth is it.‚Äú Peter von Becker writes in the Tagesspiegel: ‚ÄûA great, quiet, disturbing film‚Äú. Peter Gutting in Kino-Zeit above all praises the visual language:‚ÄûThis different relationship to nature is better described with pictures than with words. Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth does exactly this, with clouds that glow from within, rivers with power one can sense, or mountains, which exude an inner peace.

A biologist and zoologist, Embleton developed work on pesticides to improve crop production. She was also a noted suffragist.  Education and early life  Embleton was born in Epsom, Surrey, and attended Sutton High School for Girls. She enrolled at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, now Cardiff University, in 1895, and graduated in 1899 with a Baccalaureus Scientia, first class.  Career and research  In 1900, she won the 1851 Exhibition Memorial Scholarship, which annually awards a three-year research scholarship to '\\"young scientists or engineers of exceptional promise\\". She used the ¬£150 scholarship to work at the Balfour Laboratory at Newnham College, Cambridge, followed by a further period of study at the Sorbonne in Paris. She is considered the second woman to publish on the topic of copepodology, after Edith Mary Pratt. In 1903, she was appointed honorary zoologist to the Board of Agriculture, and won the Royal Society's Mackinnon studentship for research into Biological Sciences. She was one of the first woman to speak at the Linnean Society, Burlington House, London. Her paper, delivered on 4 Jun 1903, was entitled: \\"Anatomy and Development of a Hymeropterous Parasite of a Scaly Insect (Lecanium Hemisphoericum)\\". Among with fifteen other women, she was made a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1905. The Linnean Society archives hold Embleton‚Äôs correspondence with the Society, of which she remained a Fellow until 1917. In 1906 she co-published the papers, \\"On the synapsis in amphibia\\" and \\"On the origin of the sertoli\\". Alice Embleton‚Äôs entry in Sutton High School‚Äôs admissions register In later life she conducted cancer research at the Royal College of Science in South Kensington.  Personal and non- academic life  Embleton was connected with a number of noted suffragists, including Evelina Haverfield, Vera Holme, and Celia Wray. The 1911 census shows that Embleton was visiting Wray at Fairfield House, Barnsley on the day of the census. Like many suffragists, the two women defaced the census paper by recording their occupation as \\"Getting votes for women\\". The four women set up the private 'Foosack League' between themselves, the membership of which was restricted to women and suffragists. Evidence suggests the Foosack League was a lesbian secret society. The Women's Library holds correspondence between the women during World War I, in which Embleton is referred to as 'Alick', and Wray as 'Mr Wary'. In her later years, Embleton lived with Wray at The Elms in Saxmundham in Suffolk.

Ngulu Execution by Edward James Glave  Uses  It resembles the Khopesh, the sickle-sword of ancient Egypt, except that it has a much more massive blade, made of iron, with a non-cutting back and a semi-circular concavity. The handle, often surrounded by metal wire, ended with two large wooden buttons and a smaller one. It could be one or two blades and was used for capital executions by beheading (the condemned was kept seated, head extended and attached to a branch).Fischer, Werner (1978) et Zirngibl, Manfred A., Afrikanische Waffen: Messer, Dolche, Schwerter, Beile, Wurfwaffen=African weapons: knives, daggers, swords, axes, throwing knives, Prinz-Verlag : This design was selected for cult and execution knives. A knife was created which symbolized the inexorableness on the judgment and execution. This execution knife became a symbol of power and, in a few variations became a ceremonial knife for tribal chieftains. At executions, the condemned man was tied to the ground with ropes and poles. His head was fastened with leather straps to a bent tree branch. In this way it was ensured that the man's neck would remain stretched. After the decapitation, the head would be automatically catapulted far away.  History  The Ngulu beheading was forbidden by the Belgians during the Free State of Congo period (1885-1908). The weapon, deprived of its function, took an even stronger symbolic and ceremonial value. From the 20th century, the Ngulu was worn during the ritual dance known as Likbeti, at the end of which the weapon was used to decapitate a goat whose flesh was then consumed by the whole tribe.Wolfe, Alvin William (1961), In the Ngombe tradition : continuity and change in the Congo, Evanston, Northwestern University Press, pp.  Gallery  File:Ngulu couteau d'ex√©cution Ngombe.jpgthumbNgulu of the Ngombe people File:Brooklyn Museum 22.414 Executioners Sword.jpgthumbNgulu in the Brooklyn Museum File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1502 Executioners Sword (2).jpgthumbDouble bladed Ngulu, ceremonial use File:Ngulu double lame Ngombe Doko.jpgthumbNgulu, blade detail File:Ngulu lame d√©tail.jpgthumbNgulu, d√©tail de la lame File:Congo execution.jpgminiEuropean illustrations were not necessarily realistic.

The oldest part of the church has been dated to the early 15th century, with a partial rebuild and additions later made in the 19th century. The church is a Grade I listed building. History A church serving Swyre is known to have existed since the 13th century, with the earliest record of a rector there dating to 1297. The oldest parts of the existing church date to c. 1400, which includes the chancel arch and west tower. The clergyman and county historian John Hutchins was rector at Swyre from 1729 to 1733, and he had the chancel repaired at his own expense during that time. In 1843‚Äì44, the rebuilding of the nave was carried out at the sole expense of the Duke of Bedford and the chancel at the cost of the rector, Rev. John Wickens. The church reopened on 25 August 1844. A vestry and organ chamber was added to the church in 1885 at the sole expense of the rector, Rev. Orlando Spencer Smith. Architecture Holy Trinity is built of local stone, with slate-covered roofs. It is made up of a nave, chancel, north porch, west tower and vestry/organ chamber. In the north wall of the nave is a reset doorway which partially dates to the late 14th century. The tower has a plain parapet and contains two bells believed to be of 15th century origin. Internal features include the Royal Arms of Charles II above the chancel arch. The arch is flanked by two painted panels of late 18th century origin which list the Ten Commandments. On the north wall of the nave is a brass memorial, with shield- of-arms, to John Russell and his wife Elizabeth (Frocksmer), dated 1505, and another to James Russell and his wife Alys (Wise), dated 1509. The west wall has an undated memorial to George Gollope and seven of his children, two sons- in-law and a grandchild, spanning from 1745 to 1787. On the north wall of the chancel is a monument erected to James Napier and family by Sir Robert Napier, dated 1692. The octagonal font is of 15th century date. The church's organ was installed in 1890. It was built by Alfred Kirkland of London and restored in 1976 by George Osmond & Co of Taunton.

An additive quasitrace is called a trace. It is a major open problem if every quasitrace is a trace. Definition A quasitrace on a C*-algebra A is a map \\\\tau\\\\colon A_+\\\\to[0,\\\\infty] such that: * \\\\tau is homogeneous: ::\\\\tau(\\\\lambda a)=\\\\lambda\\\\tau(a) for every a\\\\in A_+ and \\\\lambda\\\\in[0,\\\\infty). * \\\\tau is tracial: ::\\\\tau(xx^*)=\\\\tau(x^*x) for every x\\\\in A. * \\\\tau is additive on commuting elements: \\\\tau(a+b)=\\\\tau(a)+\\\\tau(b) for every a,b\\\\in A_+ that satisfy ab=ba. * and such that for each n\\\\geq 1 the induced map ::\\\\tau_n\\\\colon M_n(A)_+\\\\to[0,\\\\infty], (a_{j,k})_{j,k=1,...,n}\\\\mapsto\\\\tau(a_{11})+...\\\\tau(a_{nn}) has the same properties. A quasitrace \\\\tau is: * bounded if ::\\\\sup{\\\\tau(a):a\\\\in A_+, \\\\aleq 1} < \\\\infty. * normalized if ::\\\\sup{\\\\tau(a):a\\\\in A_+, \\\\aleq 1} = 1. * lower semicontinuous if ::{a\\\\in A_+ : \\\\tau(a)\\\\leq t} is closed for each t\\\\in[0,\\\\infty). Variants * A 1-quasitrace is a map A_+\\\\to[0,\\\\infty] that is just homogeneous, tracial and additive on commuting elements, but does not necessarily extend to such a map on matrix algebras over A. If a 1-quasitrace extends to the matrix algebra M_n(A), then it is called a n-quasitrace. There are examples of 1-quasitraces that are not 2-quasitraces. One can show that every 2-quasitrace is automatically a n-quasitrace for every n\\\\geq 1. Sometimes in the literature, a quasitrace means a 1-quasitrace and a 2-quasitrace means a quasitrace. Properties * A quasitrace that is additive on all elements is called a trace. * Uffe Haagerup showed that every quasitrace on a unital, exact C*-algebra is additive and thus a trace. The article of Haagerup was circulated as handwritten notes in 1991 and remained unpublished until 2014. Blanchard and Kirchberg removed the assumption of unitality in Haagerup's result.Blanchard, Kirchberg, 2004, Remarks 2.29(i) As of today (August 2020) it remains an open problem if every quasitrace is additive. * Joachim Cuntz showed that a simple, unital C*-algebra is stably finite if and only if it admits a dimension function. A simple, unital C*-algebra is stably finite if and only if it admits a normalized quasitrace. An important consequence is that every simple, unital, stably finite, exact C*-algebra admits a tracial state. * Every quasitrace on a von Neumann algebra is a trace.
