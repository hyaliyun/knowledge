Grossman attended Cleveland public schools and graduated from the old Central High School and from the Euclid Avenue Business College. She worked in the law office of a cousin, Louis J. Grossman, from 1896 to 1912. She decided that a career as a lawyer was preferable to that of a stenographer and bookkeeper and enrolled in 1909 in the evening program of Cleveland Law School (now a part of Cleveland State University), the first law school in Ohio to accept women. She was awarded her LL.B. in 1912 and passed the Ohio bar examination that same year. After practicing law in her cousin‚Äôs office for two years, she established her own law office and engaged in the solo practice of law through 1923.  Abstract  Mary Belle Grossmanwas the first female lawyer to practice in Cleveland District Federal Court, and one of the first two women admitted to the American Bar Association. In 1923 she was elected Cleveland Municipal Judge and served on the traffic bench and the Morals Court until 1960.

The original cast included Robert Wilks as Sir Harry Wildair, George Powell as Standard, John Mills as Vizard, Benjamin Johnson as Smugler, William Pinkethman as Clincher Senior, William Bullock as Clincher Junior, Henry Norris as Dicky, Joseph Haines as Tom Errand, Susanna Verbruggen as Lurewell, Jane Rogers as Angelica, Mary Powell as Lady Darling and Henrietta Moore as Parly. The hero and most popular character, the rakish Sir Harry Wildair was revived for a sequel Sir Harry Wildair in 1701.Morash p.36 For several decades the part of Sir Harry was strongly identified with the actor Robert Wilks, and became his signature role. It was later taken over by the Irish actress Peg Woffington, who performed it as a breeches role.Morash p.37 Dorothea Jordan also played the part as did Samuel Foote. Actresses who have played the role of Lady Lurewell included Anne Oldfield and Hannah Pritchard. William Bullock appeared in the original run as Clincher.

Her father agreed to allow her to become a nun, on the condition that Patrick \\"promised him eternal life without compelling him to be baptized\\". Patrick agreed, and Cinnia entered the Monastery of Druimduchan, a large community of virgins, under the care of Abbess Cathuberis, where Cinnia lived until her death.

Haines is the namesake of Haines Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania. In 1771, he funded the construction of a road (now Pennsylvania Route 45) from Sunbury through the \\"Woodward Narrows\\", to the modern site of Spring Mill ‚Äî the first road in what is now Centre County. The modern boundaries of Penn Township (formed 1844) and a portion of Gregg Township (formed 1826) were annexed from a larger Haines Township (now only 148.6 km2) that was established before Centre County was officially declared in 1800. Haines was a proprietor of the historic Wyck House in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Biography = Family and Marriage  Haines was the son of Josiah Haines and Martha Burr, both of Burlington County, New Jersey. After the death of Josiah, his mother married Timothy Matlack Sr. (1695‚Äì1752), with whom she had more children. One of these children was Timothy Matlack, the brewer and politician, who was Haines's younger half-brother. Haines was also the first cousin of the Quaker abolitionist John Woolman. On April 4, 1760, Haines married Margaret Wistar (1729‚Äì1793), daughter of the wealthy glass- maker Caspar Wistar. They had five children: * Catherine Haines (1761‚Äì1808), who married Richard Hartshorne * Caspar Wistar Haines (1762‚Äì1803), who married Hannah Marshall and inherited the Wyck House estate. They were the parents of Reuben Haines III, scientist and farmer. * Josiah Haines (1764‚Äì?), who married Susan Harriett Bull * Reuben Haines, Jr. (1765‚Äì1793) * Martha Haines (1769‚Äì1781)  Firefighting  Haines and his stepfather Timothy Matlack Sr. were members of the Fellowship Fire Company, the second organized fire company in the British colonies.  Brewery  After his stepfather's death in 1752, Haines inherited his brewery, multiple properties, and a considerable amount of debt. Haines continued this business with the help of his sons, Caspar Haines and Reuben Haines Jr. From 1784‚Äì1793, \\"Reuben Haines and Sons\\" brewery was located at No. 145 Market Street in Philadelphia. A few months before his death, Haines led a parade of more than 75 brewers through the streets of Philadelphia, with banners reading \\"Home brew'd is best\\" and \\"Proper drink for Americans\\". Haines's clients included many notable figures including Benjamin Franklin and George Washington.  Death  Haines and his wife Margaret died in Philadelphia during the yellow fever epidemic of 1793.

Early life  He was born in 1766 to Ibrahim Khalil Khan of Karabakh and Rugan Khanum, an Armenian girl from Nakhichevanik village in Shusha. Had an excellent palace education and involved in affairs government since early age. Ibrahim Khalil Khan sent him to the Russian camp upon arrival of Valerian Zubov in 1796. This event was described by Mirza Jamal Javanshir, the vizier of the Karabakh Khanate and historian: He was sent as an hostage to Fath Ali Shah upon death of Agha Muhammad alongside his half-sister Aghabeyim agha Javanshir. He was later placed under Abbas Mirza, given the titular title of khan.  Struggle for heirship  He was called to Karabakh sometime in 1804 by his father when he had a fall out with his elder son and heir Mammad Hasan agha Javanshir. Since he was born of a \\"temporary wife\\" but had a royal favor, Mammad Hasan felt threatened and secretly allied with his other 'legitimate' half-brothers Khanlar agha Javanshir and Mehdigulu agha. Meanwhile, Abulfat agha occupied southwestern part of the khanate - Kapan, G√ºney, Chulundur and Bargushad provinces (modern Syunik Province, Armenia and Qubadlƒ± District, Azerbaijan) and set up his camp on banks of Vorotan river. He marched on Togh, where his Mammad Hasan was supposedly stationed, however didn't expect his half-brothers joining him. Mammad Hasan, who commanded horse cavalry, battled 5,000 men led by Abulfat in Dizak, in December 1804 and captured 1,000 people alongside prominent Iranian commanders. He invaded Karabakh again in 1806 with 5,000 strong army accompanied by Amanullah Khan Afshar and Hossein Khan Sardar. However he found out that his father was killed and was resisted by Jabrailli tribe, after which retreated to Syunik where he met Armenian and Azerbaijani nobility. However he was later pursued by Jafargulu agha, his nephew in 1806 for which he was promoted directly to colonel by a supreme order. Abulfat left for Iran and made governor of Dizmar - Iranian part of Karabakh after Treaty of Gulistan. His area of influence was limited with Syunik Province. He was considered as heir to Karabakh sometime in 1820 by his half-brother Mehdigulu. After breakout of new Russo-Persian War he joined Qajar army in hopes of regaining Karabakh with no luck. Treaty of Turkmenchay deprived him of his remaining lands and he had go back to Iran in 1828, resigning from army in 1833. He died in 1839, Tabriz and was buried in Qom. Most of his family were given estates in modern Eastern Azerbaijan in Iran.

The National Girls Baseball League started a year after the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL), which was featured in the film A League of Their Own. The National Girls Baseball League differed from the AAGPLB in that the NGBL kept and allowed the traditional underhand softball pitching format. Football legend Red Grange served as commissioner of the National Girls Baseball League. History The National Girls baseball League was founded by Forest Park, Illinois contractor Emery Parichy, Charles Bidwill, who was owner of the Chicago Cardinals football team and politician Ed Kolski. Pirachy had built Piarchy Stadium in Forest Park in 1934 and owned a softball league, the Metropolitan League. Parichy and Bidwell hired Red Grange to preside over the league.https://sabr.org/journal/article/the-international- girls-baseball-league/ The National Girls Baseball League was formed in 1944 and played 11 seasons. It was formed as a result of scouts for the Chicago‚Äìbased All‚ÄìAmerican Girls Professional Baseball League scouting and recruiting talent from the Chicago softball Metropolitan League, run by Parichy. It was decided to then turn the Metropolitan League to a professional league. The National Girls Baseball League consisted of teams from the greater Chicago, Illinois area and regularly drew over 500,000 fans annually. Unlike the All American Girls Professional Baseball League, the National Girls Baseball League kept the traditional underhand softball pitching format. \\"For two seasons our league outdrew the White Sox in attendance,\\" noted player Freda Savona, in reference to the Chicago White Sox of MLB. ‚ÄúThey packed the place,‚Äù said Al Maag, of the NGBL attendance. Maag was the founder of the Chicago 16-inch Softball Hall of Fame, which posthumously inducted and honored Charles Bidwill with the Richard J. Daley Friend of Softball Award in 2013 for his contributions to women's baseball and softball. The National Girls Baseball League had six teams, all owned by Emery Parichy: the Bloomer Girls, Blue Birds, Chicks, Queens, Cardinals, and Music Maids. The Forest Park based Bloomer Girls were moved by Parichy to Chicago from Boston in 1937 and used the \\"Parichy Bloomer Girls\\" moniker, playing home games at Parichy Stadium. The league played at ballparks throughout Chicago, including Soldier Field and Wrigley Field. The National Girls Baseball League was in competition with the All‚ÄìAmerican Girls Professional Baseball League. The integrated National Girls Baseball League offered higher salaries and emphasized closer road game schedules in an attempt to secure the best players. League rosters included an African‚ÄìAmerican, Betty Chapman; a Chinese‚ÄìAmerican, Gwen Wong; and Nancy Ito, a Japanese‚ÄìAmerican. One player, Freda Savona, was rumored to earn $500 a week. Connie Wisniewski jumped to the NGBL when the AAGPBL switched to overhand throwing and Audrey Wagner was a notable AAGPBL player who switched to the NGBL. Pro Football Hall of Fame member Red Grange served as league president. Retired major league baseball players Buck Weaver (Black Sox Scandal) and Woody English were team managers. In 1946, after two years of conflict over players, the administrators in the two leagues reached a non‚Äìraiding agreement. In the winter of 1952‚Äì1953, players from both the AAGPL and National Girls Baseball League played together in the four‚Äìteam International Girls Baseball League (IGBL) based in Miami, Florida. The league was formed by Frank Darling, the owner of the NGBL‚Äôs Music Maids. Darling served as the president, while Harry D. Wilson, also from the NGBL, served as league secretary. Darling recruited players from both leagues and created the team rosters and schedule. Connie Wisniewski, a former AAGPBL player of the year, played in the 1950 National Girls Baseball League. Wisniewski played for the 1950 Music Maids, winning 30 games as a pitcher. Wisniewski returned to the Grand Rapids Chicks of the AAGPL in 1951. Freda Savona was called the ‚ÄúBabe Ruth‚Äù of the NGBL, setting home run records and batting over .400 in 1951. Audrey Wagner joined the Parichy Bloomer Girls and the National Girls Baseball League in 1950 from the AAGPL. Offered a higher salary, a signing bonus, with no extensive travel, Wagner valued being home every night, being closer to school and her studies. With a salary of 125 dollars a week, Wagner put herself through school at Elmhurst College and then the University of Illinois-Chicago, where Wagner earned her MD in 1955. Wagner helped her team to the Championship in 1950 and made the All‚ÄìStar Team in each of her four seasons in the National Girls Baseball League. In 1952, Wagner led the league in doubles, triples, home runs and total bases, and was second in the batting, with a .364 average.The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record BookNo Girls in the Clubhouse: The Exclusion of Women from Baseball ‚Äì Marilyn Cohen.

Kurys played three seasons in the National Girls Baseball League.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/sophie-kurys/ Lois Roberts Strenkowski played barefoot for the duration of her time in the National Girls Baseball League and throughout her career. Playing for the Cardinals team in the NGBL, she made $65 per week playing for two seasons through 1951. In June, 2010, on her 90th birthday, celebrated at Dodger Stadium, Strenkowski was given the honor to announce the Dodgers' opening words, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Dodger baseball.‚Äù After the 1952 National Girls Baseball League season, Jesse Owens was on hand to present Dolores Moore with the league's Most Valuable Player Award at a ceremony. Moore's manager Woody English, became the manager of the AAGPBL's Grand Rapids Chicks and added Moore to his roster.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League After the 1954 season, the National Girls Baseball League folded amid declining attendance. Increased TV viewing of Major League Baseball was a factor. In 2013, in a women's professional softball league game, the Chicago Bandits of the National Pro Fastpitch Softball played tribute to the Parichy Bloomer Girls and the National Girls Baseball League by wearing replica Bloomer Girls' uniforms. Rules of play The league allowed underhand pitching and used a 12\\" ball. Uniforms generally consisted of long knee socks, jerseys over long-sleeves and shorts.

She protested when her former minister tried to pressurise her after she attended another church. Her former minister said she was excommunicated and this was all documented in six pamphlets by Parr. Life Parr's birth date, birthplace and birth name are unknown. One estimate is that was born in 1630 or before, as it is known that she married a Mr Parr and she had one child. She attended church services in Exeter Cathedral in 1650. This was an independent group that was not associated with the cathedral's hierarchy. The group employed its own minister, Lewis Stucley, in 1650 after it was decided that he would be better than Mr Hanmer. The church and her attendance proceeded for the next four years but in 1654 Parr became discontented. She decided that this group were not the \\"true church\\" and she decided to attend Presbyterian services organised by another minister Thomas Ford. Lewis Stucley became concerned and he sent people to ask Parr if she would return to his church. She would not, and Stucley accused her of \\"contention\\" and he held public meetings to highlight her behaviour. In 1657 her non attendance at her former church was highlighted again by the case of Mary Allein. Allein was a member of Stucley's church and she objected when a petition was circulated at the church. The petition concerned an objection to Oliver Cromwell and Allein's objection was not about the detail of the petition, but she felt that a petition concerning secular affairs should not be circulated during a religious meeting. Allein and her husband decided to leave Stucley's church. Stucley and the church decided to threaten to excommunicate Allein and they added Parr's name into their action. They were asked to answer these charges. Allein's husband, Toby, non attendance was not raised, so it was Parr and Allein who wrote a reply to the congregation. Stucley refused to read the reply and moved to proclaim their excommunication. Parr's reply was theological and rational and it ran to 114 pages. Toby Allein also published a defence and Stucley also published a reply. Parr's life after this is not known.

Built in 1913, it served as an organizing and station point for volunteer forces in World War I, and for state militia units into the 1960s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. Description and history The Orange Armory is located east of the town's central business district, on the north side of East Main Street opposite Mill Street. It is a large brick building, with a two-story headhouse in front, and a large drill shed behind. The headhouse is a basically rectangular block, with a slightly elevated basement level separated from the upper floors by a cast concrete water table. A broad stair rises to the main entrance in the center of its street-facing facade, with the arched entrance flanked by projecting elements. The drill shed is covered by a gabled roof. The interior of the building is utilitarian, with few decorative elements; much of this finish appears to be original to the building's 1913 construction period. The armory was built in 1912-1913 for $60,000. It was occupied by Company E of the 2nd Massachusetts Volunteer Militia, a unit which served on the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1913, and as part of the American Expeditionary Forces sent to Europe in World War I. The building was turned over to the town in 1963 or 1973, by which time it had ceased its original function. The town now uses the building as a multifunction space.

The Chairman of the Duma was Mikhail Rodzianko. Elected on November 15, 1912. ElectionsSessions The State Duma was elected for five years. The Duma worked with annual sessions, within each session, as a rule, two breaks were arranged, at Christmas and at Easter. Each time the Duma was convened and dissolved by the Highest Decrees; in addition, the Duma itself was empowered to arrange breaks in its work. With the outbreak of the First World War, the regular character of the Duma's work was disrupted. The first session lasted from November 15, 1912 to June 25, 1913, 81 sessions of the General Meeting of the Duma took place. The second session lasted from October 15, 1913 to June 14, 1914, 111 meetings of the General Meeting of the Duma took place. On July 26, 1914, an extraordinary one‚Äìday session of the Duma took place, dedicated to the allocation of war loans associated with the acute political crisis that preceded the outbreak of the First World War. The third session began on January 27, 1915; 2 days later, on January 29, immediately after the adoption of the budget, the session of the Duma was declared closed by the emperor. The fourth session lasted from July 19 to September 3, 1915, after which the Duma was prematurely dissolved by the emperor for vacations, the session then lasted from February 9 to June 20, 1916, 60 meetings of the General Meeting of the Duma were held. The fifth session began on November 1, 1916. On December 16, the Duma was again dissolved for the holidays. The early dissolution of the Duma turned out to be one of the events that increased the general political tension in the country before the February Revolution. It was widely believed at the time that it was expected that the government would not allow the Duma to convene after the prolonged New Year holidays and would announce its dissolution. However, on February 14, 1917, the emperor announced the continuation of the Duma. At the height of the events of the February Revolution, on February 25, the emperor again suspended the activities of the Duma. The Duma never met again for formal meetings. On February 27, during a private meeting of members of the Duma, the Provisional Committee of the State Duma was created, which took part in the formation of the Provisional Government, and until the start of its work, that is, February 27 ‚Äì March 2, it was the self‚Äìproclaimed government of Russia. On May 12 ‚Äì July 19, 1917, eight more private meetings of the Duma were held, which no longer had any legal or political significance. The Duma was officially dissolved by a decree of the Provisional Government on October 6, 1917 in connection with the appointment of elections to the All‚ÄìRussian Constituent Assembly.

He was director of research emeritus at Center for International Studies and Research and at the Paris Institute of Political Studies. He has also taught at the European Center at Johns Hopkins University in Bologna. In 2003, he received the Alexis de Tocqueville award.  Biography  Of Romanian Jewish origin, Pierre Hassner moved to France in 1948 at the age of fifteen with his parents who were fleeing the communist regime. The same year, he read The Great Schism by Raymond Aron, a book that left a deep impression upon him. He joined the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, obtaining the agr√©gation in philosophy in 1955. He became one of the students of Raymond Aron and Leo Strauss. In his Memoirs published in 1983, Raymond Aron wrote: \\"In I do not know what circumstances, Pierre Hassner, who sometimes attended my classes, gave a brilliant, dizzying presentation on Thucydides ... I told him that never, from a student or teacher, had I heard a speech of comparable quality.\\" Under the direction of Aaron, he had begun a thesis, that was never completed. In 1957, he acquired French nationality. From 1992, he assumed the presidency of the Kosovo Committee..  Theories  Pierre Hassner devoted himself to the study of international relations and geopolitical problems, which he wishes to shed light on with philosophy. In his numerous articles and books, he offers informed and original analyses of the evolution of international conflicts during the Cold War era, and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He thus became involved in the political debate at the time of the war which divided the peoples of the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1995. His research focuses on war, violence and totalitarianism, international relations notably in the history of political thought and in Europe after the Cold War. In his theories on totalitarianism and post-Cold War] world political evolution, he analyzes Chinese and Russian political regimes and, to qualify them, coined the neologism of \\"democrature\\", to denote States which are no longer under totalitarian regime but are not yet democracies and therefore hide their authoritarian nature under a democratic facade (parliamentary and constitutional democracy in Russia or in China). In a famous article, Hassner shows that we have gone from the world of Locke (\\"Liberty as property, post- Cold War liberalism\\"), with openings on Kant (\\"project of perpetual peace\\" to be compared with the emergence of international organizations such as the United Nations, in the world of Hobbes, that is to say the war of all against all, and the search for maximum security, with overtures on Nietzsche (war as an agent of identity reaffirmation) and Marx (socio-economic disparities as a still a valid reading grid for international relations). Thus he sees in the event of September 11 and the policies which followed (preventive wars, laws on terrorism which reinforce the powers of the State, to the detriment of freedoms) as a victory of the security conceptions of Hobbes, Nietzsche and Marx over conceptions imprinted with freedom from thinkers such as Kant and Locke).

Few details are known of his origin: his father was called Ibrahim, and according to Ya'qubi he was a mawla of the Banu Thaqif tribe in Bukhara. Yusuf's own religious beliefs are left unmentioned; likewise the meaning of the sobriquet \\"al-Barm\\" is unknown. Yusuf's uprising was one of a series of revolts in Khurasan during the early Abbasid period, such as the roughly contemporaneous rebellion of al-Muqanna. The revolt's motivations are somewhat obscure. Medieval sources give religious grounds, including the traditional call to \\"command good and forbid wrong\\", but they are contradictory: some call him a Kharijite, while others accuse him of unbelief (kafir) and of claiming to be a prophet. According to C. E. Bosworth, \\"it appears that the revolt was basically political and directed against the arbitrary power of the caliph and his governors\\". It is unknown when exactly the revolt broke out, except that it was during the governorship in Khurasan of Humayd ibn Qahtaba, which began in 768. It spread across southern Khurasan (what is now northern Afghanistan), namely the regions of Badhghis, Marw al-Rudh, Juzjan, and Talaqan. He spurred offers of a pardon (aman) from Caliph al-Mahdi (), but was finally defeated and captured in 776/7 by either Yazid ibn Mazyad or Sa'id ibn Salm. Yusuf was brought to Baghdad, where he was executed through crucifixion by Harthama ibn A'yan, who had lost a brother to Yusuf's rebellion. A grandson of Yusuf, Mansur ibn Abdallah, led an unsuccessful revolt in Khurasan during the caliphate of al-Ma'mun (). He was defeated and killed. Another grandson, Yusuf ibn Mansur, is attested along with a son of Yusuf, al-Husayn, during the Abbasid civil war of 865‚Äì866.

His life and career were much affected by the French wars which impacted Savoy directly between 1792 and 1815. He spent the most dangerous years of that period exiled in Lausanne, from where he was able to direct and undertake various missionary projects designed to combat the false doctrines that had arrived with the revolutionary armies from the west. His principle weapon in these endeavours was the pen.  Biography = Provenance and early years  Fran√ßois-Marie Bigex was born at La Balme-de- Thuy, a small town, even then, in the Genevois province, set high in the mountains east of Annecy. The family was closely involved with the church. One of his uncles was a priest, as was one of his great uncles, and the two of them took care of his early schooling. He moved on to attend college at √âvian on the southern shore of the lake. He had been a little older than was considered normal when he started his studies at √âvian, but completed the basic Latin course very rapidly, and was still only sixteen when he completed the required courses in Humanities and Philosophy. He was then sent to college at Thonon where he studied Dogmatic theology. In parallel, he studied Religious text and Greek with a Barnabite brother, whose lessons one commentator describes as \\"assiduous\\". His studies at √âvian and Thonon would have provided a conventional preparation for a career as a scholar-churchman. However, in Thonon he was also talent spotted by a celebrated local lawyer called Louis Dubouloz who gave him a solid foundation course in civil law. For a time he seems to have been tempted by the urgings of Dubouloz that he should become a lawyer. In the end, however, after three years of Theology at the college Thonon, he seems to have been firmly convinced that his vocation for the priesthood was not to be resisted. He now presented himself for the (presumably oral) examination necessary for admission to the Seminary at Annecy. His principal examiner was Mgr. Biord. Father Biord was the Bishop of Geneva. In the wake of the Calvinist reformation Geneva had become a centre of fervent Protestantism and Annecy, safely across the frontier in Savoy, had become the permanent seat for the Bishops of Geneva. Biord and his co- examiners were evidently impressed by Bigex, who was welcomed into the seminary by unanimous vote.  Paris  As a young seminarian Bigex continued to impress. By the end of his first year it had been determined that he deserved to receive his education \\"in a larger theatre\\", and he was sent on to the seminary attached to Saint-Sulpice, Paris in France, where he continued his studies for the priesthood. Starting during the second year of what was designed as a five year course, he combined his studies with work as a lecturer, which was followed by an appointment to a professorship first in Theology and then also in Philosophy at the little Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet seminary. He received his licence to minister after three of the five years assigned to his course, which came with a useful \\"pension\\". He also received, from the Sorbonne university, a doctorate in Theology in 1783 or 1785. By this time he was building up a personal network of influential French churchmen. He was on the receiving end of various tempting job offers, notably from Archbishop de Conzi√© of Tours and the scholarly Bishop of Arras. There was every indication that he was on the brink of a stellar career, but there was also every indication that his future lay in France rather than in Savoy.  Vicar general  That Bigex should stay in France had never been part of Mgr. Biord's plan, however. He had plans in his own diocese for his prot√©g√©. Summoned back to Annecy, Fran√ßois-Marie Bigex was immediately appointed to membership of the Cathedral chapter. He quickly set about re-establishing his contacts, visiting Bishop Conseil at Chamb√©ry for discussions about the future. He also travelled to Turin to pay his respects to the Princess of Piedmont, who seems to have been an enthusiastic admirer, having already arranged a second \\"pension\\" for him, possibly at the prompting of Mgr. Biord. She received him warmly. Bishop Biord's death in March 1785 did nothing to derail Bigex's career, and at around about the same time he took up an important diocesan appointment as vicar general. When the formal eulogy for Bishop Biord was proclaimed on 14 June 1785 in the cathedral at Annecy in the presence of the Assembly General of the Clergy, the sad honour of delivering it went to vicar general Fran√ßois-Marie Bigex.Jean-Louis Grillet, Dictionnaire historique, litt√©raire et statistique des d√©partements du Mont-Blanc et du L√©man, contenant l'histoire ancienne et moderne de la Savoie, et sp√©cialement celle des personnes qui y √©tant n√©es ou domicili√©es, se sont distingu√©es par des actions dignes de m√©moire, ou par leurs succ√®s dans les lettres, les sciences et les arts, t. III, Puthod, 1807, pp. 366-374. In due course, in 1787, Joseph-Marie Paget was consecrated to succeed Mgr. Biord. Paget would be the last bishop to retain the geographically misleading title, Bishop of Geneva. He lost little time in reappointing Bigex to the leading administrative position of diocesan vicar general.  Revolution years  Although most of the diocese was within the Duchy of Savoy, approximately 20% of it was not. Part of it was even inside France, which during the early 1790s fell into in a state of widespread and increasingly violent turmoil following the 1789 revolution. Bishop Paget and his vicar general were accordingly to try and maintain diocesan control over the church in a part of Eastern France, which meant continuing to publish pastoral letters and instructions in contravention of innovations introduced by the revolutionary National Constituent Assembly and the National Legislative Assembly which replaced it during 1791. However, the real crisis arrived only in September 1792 when the French citizen armies, without having bothered to issue any formal declaration of war, arrived to export their revolution under the leadership of Anne-Pierre de Montesquiou-F√©zensac, a slightly unexpected military commander under the circumstances, who fell out with the increasingly radical and intolerant revolutionary government in Paris at around the same time that Savoy was formally annexed, in November 1792. Bishop Paget hastened across to Piedmont before winter blocked the mountain passes, to continue his ecclesiastical duties from Turin, while Vicar-general Bigex relocated to Lausanne, which at this stage was still a (reluctant) bailiwick of Bern. From Lausanne Bigex was able to watch over his \\"flock\\" of church members back in the occupied former Duchy of Savoy who found themselves in very great danger. He supported them with frequent exhortations and through the zeal of evangelising priests who risked their own lives by secretly distribution the practical tools for practicing the faith, whose difficult and dangerous missions he directed and co-ordinated, providing them with instruction appropriate to the terrible times through which the church and its congregations were passing. Very few weeks passed by when the diocesan clergy did not receive advices and communications of comfort and consolation, helping them in the vital matter of keeping The Faith. The political and military situation in Lausanne was very far from stable between his arrival in 1792 and the Concordat of 1801. There were times when Bigex was obliged to leave the city. At one point, when the French invaded Switzerland under General Buonaparte during the first part of 1798, Bigex lived for a time high up on the Great St Bernard, from where he returned to Lausanne and then had to move on again, this time to Geneva. Throughout this period he was nevertheless able to sustain effective communications links sufficient to enable him to provide the necessary spiritual support to the congregations in the diocese.  Authorship  During his years of exile beyond the far shore of the lake Bigex also found time to produce and arrange publication of several substantive books intended to address the evils that had befallen the church from the French revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary Wars. These included \\"Instruction √† l'usage des fid√®les du dioc√®se de Gen√®ve\\", \\"Le Catholique du Jura\\" and \\"le Missionnaire catholique, ou Instructions famili√®res sur la religion\\". The last of these was expressly intended to reduce the influence among the people of revolutionary doctrines which, in his view, \\"were misleading people everywhere\\". The book ran to 344 pages and was highly effective in the judgement of at least one commentator. Several editions were produced by various printer-publishers over just a few years. Copies turned up in virtually every diocese in France. The French government felt bound to react. The loose knit confederacy was re- invented as the Helvetic Republic following the 1798 invasion. The responsible French government minister applied pressure on the Helvetic Republic to communicate his complaints to the authorities in Bern that they had permitted an emigrant to publish in the Lausanne bailiwick, and from there to introduce into France, a work which they held to be seditious. The author, called upon to defend himself in the face of the French government complaints, defended himself with \\"as much prudence as dignity\\", and was thereby able to ensure that the Swiss authorities made an entirely appropriate response to the complaint. Interestingly, while the Paris government launched a minor diplomatic incident over the book with the Swiss authorities, in Paris itself two widely-distributed newspapers were extolling its virtues in lavish terms. It was while he was still based in Lausanne that Bigex conceived and launched his \\"√âtrennes catholiques / √âtrennes religieuses pour l'an de gr√¢ce ...\\" project, which involved producing a compilation twice yearly - later, possibly, annually - of simple but cogently argued essays and judiciously adapted extracts, according to the Catholic viewpoint of the author-compiler, whose own objective was simply to \\"combat the false doctrines of the times and the unholy maxims of unbelief\\". Eventually, after twelve years, the French police suppressed \\"√âtrennes catholiqueses\\" in 1810. The author now made a direct appeal to F√©lix-Julien-Jean Bigot de Pr√©ameneu, the \\"Minister of Cults\\" and succeeded in having the suppression of \\"√âtrennes ...\\" referred for arbitration to Bishop Duvoisin of Nantes. General Buonaparte had in 1804 appointed himself Emperor of the French. Bishop Duvoisin, a pragmatic scholar and who was one of the very few Christian leaders who enjoyed the emperor's confidence, undertook the arbitration as requested and found in favour of Bigex's \\"√âtrennes catholiqueses\\". Despite this, the suppression of the publication persisted because, it was stated, existing editions \\"contained some articles touching upon the supremacy of the sovereign pontiff\\". (As it happened the sovereign pontiff was in Savona as a prisoner of the French at this point.) Concordat Pope Pius VI having died at Valence as a prisoner of the French in August 1799, it became necessary to elect a replacement. Pius VII was crowned on 21 March 1800, in the San Giorgio monastery church in Venice, by means of a rather unusual ceremony, which involved a papier-m√¢ch√© papal tiara. (Rome remained at this stage out of bounds.) The new pope's first priority was a return to Rome, but in order to gain that objective a comprehensive agreement was needed with the new government in Paris. The result was a complex set of reforms embodied in the Concordat of July 1801 which guaranteed religious freedom for Catholics living in France. (France, between 1792 and 1815, included the duchy previously and subsequently known as Savoy). In many ways the 1801 concordat mirrored changes implemented 260 years earlier in England, although the subordinate role assigned to the church in its dealings with the state was less absolute. One rapid outcome was a \\"more rational\\" set of diocesan boundaries, conforming more closely to contemporary secular borders. The Diocese of Geneva in respect of which Bigex still served as vicar general, had for centuries straddled the borders of Savoy, France and the Swiss Confederacy. It was now reconfigured, and Bishop Paget, who had been living in Turin since 1792, was retired. A new larger Diocese of Chamb√©ry and Geneva was created, and on 4 May 1802 Ren√© des Monstiers de M√©rinville was confirmed as its first bishop. In view of the extent of the new diocese, the new bishop determined that he needed two vicars general. The appointment of Fran√ßois-Marie Bigex as one of these was an obvious one. The other was Claude- Fran√ßois de Thiollaz, a former provost at Annecy, whom Bigex had known ever since the two of them had studied in Paris in the 1770s. They had worked closely together for many years before the arrival of the revolution in Savoy in 1792, since when de Thiollaz had led a life no less eventful that of Bigex in devotional service to the church. In the short term, however, Bigex's immediate priority became helping his bishop with the reconfiguration of the important and since 1801 greatly enlarged metropolitan diocese of Lyon. The task had been entrusted to Bishop de M√©rinville, and the administrative micro- organisation involved seems to have been well suited to the talents of the energetic Fran√ßois-Marie Bigex. He completed the work with great success.  A change of bishop  Bishop de M√©rinville retired in 1805 and was succeeded by Ir√©n√©e-Yves Dessolle, hitherto Bishop of Digne. Bigex continued in his functions as diocesan vicar general. He also retained the rank of arch deacon which had been conferred on him in 1802 with the creation of the newly enlarged cathedral chapter for the new Diocese of Chamb√©ry. Viewed from the perspectives of London of Vienna the Napoleonic Wars continued till 1815, but within the department of Mont-Blanc (as Savoy had been known since 1792) the revolutionary period had ended by 1801, while the Concordat of 1801 put an end to the savage government assault on the church. The international armies stayed away, and the period between 1802 and 1815 was one of relative calm and stability, inside the consulate/empire. Characteristically, Bigex engaged fully with the administration and development of the new diocese. The diocesan seminary was re-established at Annecy, and a number of smaller seminaries were set up. Several major convents were established (or, in some cases, re- established following more than a decade of militant secularism on the part of government). Church retreats and regular conferences of senior prelates became routine under the administration of Fran√ßois-Marie Bigex, long before they became the norm elsewhere in France.  Restoration years  In June 1815, as the emperor abdicated and the Treaty of Paris was being finalised, Victor Emmanuel returned from his exile in Cagliari to claim his throne in Turin. (Both Piedmont and the Duchy of Savoy were again part of what anglophone sources tend to identify simply as the Kingdom of Sardinia.) Deeply conservative, there was much about the revolutionary changes of the previous quarter century that he sought to undo. For the church administration beyond the high mountains, in Savoy, this held out the prospect of more changes. By a bull dated 17 July 1817 the Diocese of Chamb√©ry became an archdiocese, with four (and after 1825 six) Suffragan dioceses coming under its gubernatorial oversight. Both the existing vicars general of the superseded Dioc√®se of Chamb√©ry found themselves nominated as future bishops. Bigex was nominated as Bishop of Aire in Gascony, in the far south-west of France. However, when the nomination was submitted to the court it was blocked because of royal determination that the \\"great merits\\" of Fran√ßois-Marie Bigex should not be lost to Savoy. On 1 October 1817 Bigex was confirmed in office as Bishop of Pinerolo, an hour's drive to the west of Turin. Bishop of Pinerolo During a seven year episcopal incumbency, Fran√ßois-Marie Bigex proved himself an activist bishop, implementing a plethora of practical and judicious reforms and addressing admonitions to his priests that were at once deeply thought through and of luminous simplicity, pointing out errors and encouraging obedience to the strictures of the true church. He re-instated the diocesan synod which had been established in 1775 but had subsequently lapsed. He established one major seminary and one small one. Through his pastoral visits he shared his ardent inner zeal for the greater progress of religion. He engaged in several major litigations in defence of the interests of the bishopric, appearing as his own (highly effective) advocate. Bigex also became known for his charitable exploits. Intriguingly, he obtained a pardon from the king on behalf of a convict from Vaud who had been sentenced to death, but had also recently converted to Catholicism. Archbishop of Chamb√©ry Archbishop Dessolle, who had suffered from poor health for many years, announced his retirement in November 1823. The king selected Fran√ßois-Marie Bigex to succeed him as Archbishop of Chamb√©ry, and although the old king had died by the time the appointment took effect, the new king followed through on the decision. The appointment took Bigex back to the north side of the Mont Blanc massif, and thereby represented a return to the region in which he had grown up. Confirmed in office on 24 May 1824, he seized his new responsibilities with his usual energy. In this respect, sources indicate that his approach contrasted starkly with the more reactive attitude of his predecessor. There now emerged a flood of written advices and admonitions, issued in parallel with a hectic schedule of pastoral visit. After the two decades of revolutionary \\"modernising\\" secularism that had formally come to an end in 1815, there was still much to be done to restore the church to its former central role in the communities of the predominantly rural archdiocese. Nor did he neglect basic spiritual support. In this connection, a significant move was the publication of, \\"Instruction pour le Jubil√©\\", a little book that many of his brother bishops commended to priests and people in their own dioceses. Two actions of enduring impact were the creation of two new Suffragan dioceses, established during 1824/25, one of them to look after the towns and villages of the Tarentaise valley and the other at Saint-Jean-de- Maurienne. He was in addition able, formally on 21 September 1825, to welcome back to Chamb√©ry the Carmelites, who had been expelled in 1792 by the secularist armies of the revolution.Jean-Pierre Leguay (sous la dir.)

At the start of 1827 Archbishop Bigex was still full of plans and projects for advancing the work of the church in his archdiocese, but with little warning his incumbency was cut short. At the end of a pastoral mission to Bourget, during which the weather was exceptionally cold, he caught a chill. The condition was bad enough to force him to take to his bed, and after a few days it became clear that he was seriously ill. On 15 February 1827 he drafted and issued a final \\"mandement\\" (set of written instructions) filled with wise and loving advice, addressed to those under his care. Still preoccupied with his episcopal work, and still fervent in his piety, he received the last rites and died at around 10 in the morning on 17 February 1827, widely mourned. One source refers to the \\"universal regrets\\" which followed his death.  Membership  On 7 July 1822 Mgr. Bigex became a member of the Acad√©mie de Savoie, which had been founded in Chamb√©ry just two years earlier.

She serves as President of the Southeastern Entomological Society of America. In 2020 Samuel-Foo became the first African-American person to win a major award for entomology when she was awarded the Entomological Society of America Founders' Memorial Recognition.  Early life and education  Samuel-Foo is from Sangre Grande, Trinidad and Tobago. Her parents were cash crop growers, and she helped them to sell vegetables in markets. Samuel-Foo started college determined to study biology, but became fascinated by the world of entomology. She earned her undergraduate degree at Brewton‚ÄìParker College, where she was awarded a scholarship. She decided to stay in academic research after a conversation with the school's head of science, David McMillin, who encouraged her to look for graduate schools. She was a graduate student at the University of Georgia, where she studied the resistance of Triticum aestivatum (common wheat) to mayetiola destructor (hessian fly). At the time, she was one of only two minority students in the department. Her dissertation committee was chaired by H. Roger Boerma, who was well known for the Soybean Improvement Programme. After graduating Samuel-Foo joined the programme, which is where she first experienced DNA sequencing and molecular breeding.  Research and career  In 2009 Samuel-Foo joined the faculty at the University of Florida. Here she worked to support the registration of speciality crops in the Southern States and Puerto Rico. She was made regional field coordinator of the United States Department of Agriculture Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4) Project. From 2015 to 2017 Samuel-Foo served as President of the International Association of Black Entomologists and on the Board of Directors of the Caribbean Food Crops Society. Samuel-Foo joined the faculty of Alabama State University in 2018, where she leads the programme on industrial hemp research. When she arrived at Alabama State University she established an urban teaching garden that looks to introduce students to sustainable agriculture. In 2020 Samuel-Foo was named President-Elect of the Southeastern Entomological Society of America. She provided expert guidance to the United States congress on the Murder Hornet Eradication Act, which looks to eliminate the Asian giant hornet (so-called murder hornet), an invasive species that is predatory to honey bees. In her testimony, Samuel-Foo spoke about the devastating impact of the murder hornets on the United States honey bee population, as well as their potential threat to critical agriculture. In May 2020 Samuel-Foo was awarded the Entomological Society of America Founders' Memorial prize, and dedicated her award lecture to the research of Ernest J. Harris. Harris was the first Black entomologist to the be subject of the Founders' lecture.

Unraced as a juvenile she began her racing career in 1984 and showed high class form to win the Oak Tree Stakes and the Challenge Stakes as well as finishing second in the Prix Quincey. After struggling to recapture her best form as a four-year-old she ended her racing career with a win in the Prix de la For√™t. She was highly successful as a broodmare, producing several winners including Barathea and Gossamer. Background Brocade was a \\"robust, good-quartered\\" bay mare bred in England by her owner, Gerald Leigh's Cayton Park Stud. He was sent into training with Guy Harwood at Pulborough, West Sussex. Harwood was noted for his modern approach to training, introducing Britain to features such as artificial gallops and barn-style stabling. She was from the eleventh crop of foals sired by Habitat, an American-bred, British-raced miler who became one of the leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Flying Water, Marwell, Rose Bowl and Steinlen and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. Brocade's dam Canton Silk was a sprinter who won four races over the minimum distance of five furlongs. As a descendant of the broodmare French Kiss, she was a distant relative of Shangamuzo. Racing career=1984: three-year-old season Brocade was unraced as a juvenile but made a successful racecourse debut in April 1984 when she won a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse when her beaten opponents included the highly rated Babacoote. In the following month she won the Autobar Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse. She was expected to contest the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in June but like many of Harwood's horses, she contacted a viral infection and was off the course for almost three months. At the end of July at Goodwood Racecourse Brocade returned in the Oak Tree Stakes and won in good style by one and a half lengths from Capricorn Belle. She was then matched against male opposition when she was sent to France for the Prix Quincey over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse and ran well in defeat, going down by a neck to the four-year-old gelding Teleprompter. At Newmarket Racecourse in October she was ridden by Greville Starkey when she started the 5/4 favourite for the Group 2 Challenge Stakes, in which the best of her opponents appeared to be Prego (Hungerford Stakes) and Forzando (Sandy Lane Stakes). Brocade accelerated into the lead a furlong from the finish and won very easily by three lengths. The filly ended her season in the Prix de la For√™t, run over 1400 metres on very soft ground at Longchamp Racecourse later that month and came home fifth of the ten runners, beaten less than two lengths by the winner Procida. In the official International Classification for 1984, Brocade was rated the fifth-best three-year-old filly trained in England behind Katies, Circus Plume, Pebbles and Meis-El-Reem. 1985: four- year-old season Brocade began her second campaign with a drop back in distance for the Cork and Orrery Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot in June and finished fourth behind the three-year-old filly Dafayna. She then ran sixth to Al Bahathri in the Child Stakes at Newmarket and ninth to Efisio in the Harroways Stakes at Goodwood. After the latter race, when she had looked light and sweaty before the start, Timeform's reporter commented that she had apparently \\"failed to train on\\", meaning that she had not made the expected progress from three to four. When attempting to repeat her 1984 success in the Challenge Stakes, Brocade ran fourth behind Efisio, Chapel Cottage and Powder Keg in a blanket finish. On 27 October the filly made her second attempt to win the Prix de la For√™t at Longchamp and started a 23/1 outsider in a fourteen-runner field. She was ridden by Pat Eddery as Greville Starkey opted to ride her more fancied stablemate Young Runaway who started co-favourite alongside Procida and River Drummer (Prix du Pin). The other contenders included Bairn (St James's Palace Stakes), Dafayna, Efisio, Nikos (Prix Edmond Blanc) and Sarab (Park Stakes). Brocade belied her odds as she took the lead 400 metres from the finish and kept on well to win by a length from the fast- finishing Nikos. In the official International Classification for 1985, Brocade was rated the third-best older female horse trained in England behind Pebbles and Free Guest. Breeding record Brocade was retired from racing at the end of her second season to become a broodmare at her owner's stud. She produced at least thirteen foals and seven winners between 1987 and 2001. *Free At Last, a bay filly, foaled in 1987, sired by Shirley Heights.

Considered as an icon in Sri Lankan cuisine, Silva has the honor of taking Sri Lankan Sinhala food to the international arena. Silva started as a coal miner in the hotel, later he became the Chief Chef of the Mount Lavinia Hotel and is currently a member of the Board of Directors. Personal life He was born on 24 April 1936 in Gammeddegoda, Rathgama as the second child of the family with five. His love name was Kirimahatthaya. His father Appu Singho was a social worker. His mother Kumarasinghe Podihami also did few works. He went to school only in fourth grade. According to him, he went to the market with his mother and sold vegetables to make a living. Some days he ate rotten pumpkins and lived without anything to eat. Both father and mother have no education. Some days Pabilis went to work at several homes. Went to Pindapatha with the Buddhist Thero. He has two brothers and two sisters. He first attended to Rajgama Devapathiraja. He did not have to study there for more than a month and was later admitted to a missionary school in the same area due to onset of World War II. He did not attend the missionary school for more than two years and later attended to Sirisumana Vidyalaya. He was a rebellious boy who had to be constantly punished at school and showed no ability or interest in education by nature. Even at a young age he had no desire to do a job. Later, at the age of 20, he married girlfriend Wimalawathi Rajakaruna. They went to the same school when we were little. At first there were a few minor issues with their relationship but then there was no reluctance. Finally they married in 1956. The desire to get a job came when he was married and had a child. The couple has three daughters including Nishani Maheshika and two sons. They came to live in Colombo in 1978. When he was a kid, he used to pull nets. Then he pushed dry carts and as well as a shoplifter, a narrator and an abbot. Culinary career In 1952, Pabilis came to Colombo after running away from home. He tried to do one job at a time in Pettah and later tried to make a living by selling things one by one. He also acted a comedy character in a stage play done in the village. On the day of the Great Eclipse on June 20, 1955, he was working at a hotel in the Ibbanwala Junction area. After working at the hotel for a short time, he left for another job and eventually ended up as a tourist dealer in Pettah. However, he had to return to the village because of the 1956 communal riots. In 1956, Pabilis got a job as a coal miner in kitchen at the Mount Lavinia Hotel through wife's elder brother. The first salary is forty rupees. At the hotel he met a chef named Uncle John. He made a curry dish from temple tree leaves. Seeing this, Pabilis walked all over Sri Lanka and found different types of food resources and culinary methods. As a result, more than 365 vegetables have been found in the country so far by Pabilis Silva. He also found 76 fruits, including carrots, beetroot, kohlrabi, and pepper. He got his first promotion to the position of a third grade chef. After fifteen years, he was the chief chef of Mount Lavinia. He always researched and searched for old food recipes. Later he made new dishes. That's his secret. Pabilis currently holds two Guinness World Records. That is, the world's largest milk rice and the world's smallest recipe book. The world's largest milk rice made by using 1,000 kilos, is 62 feet long, 5 feet wide and 1.5 inches high. Also the length and breadth of the world's smallest recipe book is 1 cm. It weighs 5 milligrams and is titled \\"Sri Lankawe Raja Bojana\\" in Sinhala and English. The idea of adding Sri Lankan medicinal foods to make a culinary encyclopedia came at his young age. A few of colleagues and Pabilis Silva used to go to other people's estates and pick coconuts and eat them. One day he broke a coconut and took it to the sea and washed it with seawater. It tastes really good and then continued to do so. It was a starting point to try new things. With that idea for more than 40 years ago, Silva published a culinary book Mahasupavanshaya. In the book, 90% of the edible plants in Sri Lanka are published with photos. This includes 56 endemic potato varieties, 76 endemic fruits and 1450 endemic plants. The book is designed to be changed every two years. The book consists of a thousand pages. It was launched on 24 April 2017 at the BMICH. In May 2016, he was felicitated for 60 years of dedicated service to Mount Lavinia Hotel at the Annual Staff Day. Beyond culinary He also involved for a biographical documentary \\"Supika Siritha\\" directed by film director Bertram Nihal. Silva was the one who spent the money. Filming was done in Negombo, Chilaw, Pettah and Rathgama. On 22 March 2017, he was honored with Deshabandu award by president Maithripala Sirisena. On 23 January 2019, he was invited as the chief resource person for the fourth phase of the Sarthakarthwaye Sewaneli workshop organized by the Career Guidance Unit of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.

He began his theatrical career in 1872, becoming a much sought-after costume designer in the West End. By 1875 he began to write comic plays, which were successfully staged. Persuaded to take a role in one of his own pieces in 1876 he also began an acting career in which he specialised in playing comic, eccentric and usually elderly characters, for which portrayals he also earned enthusiastic reviews. Maltby had a long and fruitful association with the actor-manager Charles Wyndham, becoming a regular member of his company at the Criterion Theatre in London. Outside the West End, Maltby toured in the British provinces and in Australia and New Zealand, maintaining simultaneous acting, designing and writing careers, and sometimes directing. He appeared in several of the first British productions of French farces by Alfred Hennequin and towards the end of his career he played in one of the first plays by Georges Feydeau to be seen in London. He also contributed columns to the humour magazines Judy and Fun. Life and career=Early years Maltby studied costume design in Paris at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and began his theatrical career as a costume designer, starting with an 1872 Christmas production of The Black Crook at the Alhambra Theatre, London. The piece received poor reviews, but the costumes were warmly praised: The Morning Post observed, \\"Anything more perfect as to design and colour ‚Äì so perfect, it may possibly be said ‚Äì has never been seen on the stage\\".\\"The Alhambra Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 24 December 1872, p. 6 Maltby was then engaged by F. B. Chatterton at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where he worked on Shakespeare productions together with the scene painter, William Roxby Beverly. Maltby's designs continued to impress reviewers. In 1875 The Era praised \\"the genius he has displayed in the designs for grotesque, gorgeous and elaborate costumes\\".\\"Provincial Theatricals\\", The Era, 17 January 1875, p. 6 A later reviewer praised his \\"wonderful originality and the most exquisite taste ‚Ä¶ almost literally enchanting\\".\\"The Christmas Novelties\\", The Era, 2 January 1876, p. 12 Maltby became much sought after, and recalled that in one Christmas season he designed the costumes for shows at twelve different theatres. Maltby also wrote, and a comic play of his, Make Yourself at Home, was staged at the Holborn Empire in 1875 as the last item in a triple bill.\\"The Death of Alfred Maltby\\", The Era, 16 February 1901, p. 15\\"Theatres\\", The Morning Post, 14 May 1875, p. 4 In 1876 the actor Charles Collette invited Maltby to write him a one-act farce, suggesting it should be based on the 18th-century comedy A Bold Stroke for a Wife.\\"Original Correspondence\\", The Era, 19 November 1876, p. 3 The result, Bounce, was successfully played on tour and then at the Opera Comique in a double-bill with Collette's play Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata.\\"Mr Charles Collette at Cardiff Theatre\\", The Western Mail, 7 September 1876, p. 8 Collette persuaded the author to take a part in his own piece and to take over the role of the querulous eccentric Toddleposh in Collette's play. After this, Maltby divided his time between acting, writing and costume design. Wyndham and The Criterion alt=black and white photograph of middle aged white man, clean- shaven, with a strange fringe of hair around a bald crown In 1877 the actor- manager Charles Wyndham was starring at the Criterion Theatre in The Great Divorce Case, an adaptation of Hennequin and Delacour's farce Le Proc√®s Veauradieux. The success of the piece in the West End prompted a provincial tour, managed by Richard D'Oyly Carte. Wyndham had seen Maltby as Toddleposh and thought him ideal for the role of the eccentric and somnolent Wetherby Grandison. Maltby was reluctant to take the part, but Carte, together with Maltby's friend the theatre manager John Gunn, persuaded him.\\"A Talk With Mr Alfred Maltby\\", South Australian Weekly Chronicle, 27 November 1886, p. 6 This began a long association between Wyndham and Maltby. The former's next London production, The Pink Dominos (1877), was also a box-office success, and he sent out a touring company with Maltby again cast as an eccentric old gentleman. The Era ranked his performances in the two plays as \\"among the most remarkable in modern comedy\\".\\"Provincial Theatricals\\", The Era. 2 September 1877, p. 8 When Wyndham was preparing the London production of a third farce ‚Äì Betsy (1879), F. C. Burnand's adaptation of B√©b√© ‚Äì he cast Maltby as the eccentric tutor. The play was a success, and Maltby was highly praised in the press. He played the part in several revivals of the piece, and in 1896 The Sketch said of him, \\"No playgoer will ever call to mind the name of Mr. Alfred Maltby without thinking of his wonderful performance of Samuel Dawson, B.A., the private tutor in Betsy\\".\\"Mr Alfred Maltby\\", The Sketch, 2 September 1896, p. 242 For the first production, Maltby contributed further by writing a two- act curtain raiser, a \\"comic drama\\" called Jilted, Pemberton, p. 27 which The Era later described as one of his cleverest achievements as a writer\\". At the Criterion and later, Maltby played his eccentric old gentlemen characters in such plays as Truth, The Candidate, The Man with Three Wives, My Artful Valet and others \\"too numerous to mention\\". The Sketch reviewer also noted that Maltby had \\"severe epidemics as regards the various kinds of old gentlemen he is called upon to portray ... at one time he had a very violent attack of fiery old colonels; at another, it was plausible scoundrels; at another, Members of Parliament.\\" Playwright; Australasia Maltby combined his membership of Wyndham's Criterion company with his continuing career as a writer and designer. He provided a libretto for Herv√©'s music for the Alhambra Theatre's 1880 Christmas piece, Mefistofele II,\\"The London Theatres\\", The Era 26 December 1880, p. 4 and co-wrote and appeared in La Belle Normande, an op√©ra bouffe adapted from L√©on Vasseur's La Famille Trouillat.\\"Globe Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 27 January 1881, p. 5 He was co-author of The Three Hats (1883), an adaptation of Hennequin's Les Trois chapeaux,\\"The Three Hats\\", The Era, 21 July 1883, p. 7 and author of Old Flames (1884), an English version of 115 Rue Pigalle by Alexandre Bisson.\\"Theatrical and Musical Intelligence\\", The Morning Post, 28 January 1884, p. 2 Another well-received piece was his farce Borrowed Plumes (Adelphi Theatre, 1885).\\"Alfred Maltby\\", Australian Variety Theatre Archive, 24 March 2013, accessed 30 August 2020 When Wyndham revived the 18th-century comedy Wild Oats in 1886 Maltby played Lamp, the oily theatrical manager. A Criterion colleague, the actor Harry Saint Maur, described Maltby as an instinctive actor, getting straight to the essence of a character without painstaking analysis, and commented: \\"But then, he, Selina Dolaro, and a few other people of a like calibre I have met with are geniuses\\".\\"Mr Saint Maur on Actors and Acting\\", Adelaide Observer, 4 December 1886, p. 38 Later in 1886 Wyndham sent a company to Australia and New Zealand. Maltby was known to playgoers there as the author of The Three Hats, which proved popular with audiences in both countries,\\"The Three Hats\\", The Lorgnette, 8 September 1885, p. 2\\"Abbotts Opera House\\", New Zealand Herald, 1 November 1886, p. 5 and he was well received as a performer. During his stay, in addition to playing several of his regular parts, he designed costumes for, and co-wrote, the Theatre Royal, Melbourne's Christmas pantomime, played his first non-comic role, Captain Redwood in Jim the Penman, and directed several plays. Later years Maltby and Ellis Jeffreys in His Little Dodge (1896) Throughout the late 1880s and 1990s Maltby continued his tripartite career as actor, writer and designer. In addition to plays, his writing included regular contributions to Judy and Fun. Having made his name as an actor in the plays of the \\"father of French farce\\",Charney, p. 620 Alfred Hennequin, he starred in 1896 in one of the first farces of Hennequin's successor Georges Feydeau to be given in London. Maltby appeared with Fred Terry, Weedon Grossmith and Ellis Jeffreys in His Little Dodge (1896), an adaptation of Le Syst√®me Ribadier by Feydeau and Hennequin's son Maurice.\\"His Little Dodge\\", The Graphic, 31 October 1896, p. 17 The Era described Maltby and the play as \\"making a big hit\\". Maltby's last play, in which he made his final stage appearance, was the farce My Soldier Boy, co-written with Frank Lindo, given at the Criterion in 1899. Maltby's co-stars were Grossmith and Jeffreys. The Morning Post praised it for having \\"all the ingenuity, without any of the impropriety, of the best French farce.\\"Criterion Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 4 January 1899, p. 3 Maltby died at his home in Chipperfield, Hertfordshire, on 12 February 1901, aged 59.

Loam (pronounced 'loom') is a mixture of sand and clay with water, sometimes with horse dung (valuable for its straw content),John Campbell, Complete Casting Handbook: Metal Casting Processes, Techniques and Design (2011), 929. W.K.V. Gale, The iron and steel industry: a dictionary of terms (1971), 126. animal hair or coke. The object of including dung or hair was to make the mould permeable and allow gas (such as steam) to escape during casting.R.F. Tylecote, 'Inron in the industrial revolution' in L. Day and R.F. Tylecote, Industrial Revolution in metals (Institute of Materials, London, 1991), 243-4. The mold for a cylindrically symmetrical object, such as a cannon, is built up in stages around a spindle, to which is fixed a strickle board with the shape of the eventual casting. The mold also has provision for the casting of a gunhead, beyond the muzzle of the cannon, into which slag can float during casting. If the object is to be hollow, a straw rope is wound around the spindle and covered in a friable material to the dimensions of the exterior of the cannon, the strickle board being turned on the spindle to ensure it is cylindrical. Decorative elements and models of the trunnions are then attached. This is then covered in a thick layer of loam. The mold is then fired. After this the straw rope is then pulled out with the rest of the material used to form the shape of the cannon. The mould is then mounted vertically in a casting put in front of the furnace. If the cannon is to be cast hollow, a core is mounted in the mould. The furnace was then tapped and metal run into the mold. The mold is then broken off the casting. The gunhead is cut off, and the bore of the cannon reamed out using a boring mill. The process for the cylinder for a steam engine would be similar. The process for casting a bell is of the same nature, but the procedure is necessarily different.Taylors of Loughborough, bellfounders.

Mac Carthy was in correspondence with a large circle of archaeologists, antiquarians and early pioneers of Irish scholarship during the Irish historical awakening of the 19th century, as evidenced in letters found in collections such as the Royal Irish Academy and Cork City and County Archives.  Life  Mac Carthy was born into an Irish shipping and coal merchant family of Wellclose Square, East London. After receiving his education at the Roman Catholic school, St. Edmund's College, he resided a number of years on the continent; where in Naples, at the age of 25, he married the daughter of Admiral Sir Home Popham. Together they had a daughter and two sons, of which only one outlived Mac Carthy. Being of independent means, Mac Carthy initially focused his interest in producing historic novels, which included The Siege of Florence, Massaniello and The Free Lance. In 1867, Mac Carthy published his first scholarly work, The Life and Letters of Florence MacCarthy Reagh, which details the biography of kinsman Florence Mac Carthy Reagh (1560 ‚Äì 1640). This was followed by a second work in 1875, A Historical Pedigree of the Sliochd Feidhlimidh, the Mac Carthys of Gleannacroim, which documents the genealogy of numerous members of a west Cork sept of the Mac Carthy Clan, from whom he claimed ancestral descent. In the course of his genealogical research, Mac Carthy established links to his paternal family's homeplace of Dunmanway. He gave generously to many causes in the district, including the education of children. However, the failure of the Overend and Gurney Bank in 1866 reduced Mac Carthy's income. His scheme to buy out his ancestral property in the neighbourhood of Dunmanway, including the castle at Togher was never fulfilled.  Genealogy  Daniel's paternal grand- uncle Denis emigrated from Dunmanway in the mid-1700s, and became a prosperous shipowner and coal merchant in London. Mac Carthy's first cousin was Sir Charles Justin MacCarthy, Governor of Ceylon, and son-in-law of Sir Benjamin Hawes. Mac Carthy traced his ancestry to the Lords of Gleannacroim, cousins of the Mac Carthy Reagh sept, and adopted the \\"Glas\\" agnomen earlier associated with that sept to his name. However, as a result of a direct male descendant of Mac Carthy partaking in a Y-DNA study, Mac Carthy's paternal genetic origins have been shown to differ from those described in his genealogical work.  Daniel Mac Carthy (Glas) Archive  In 2017, approximately 2,000 documents assembled from Mac Carthy's research and family memorabilia were donated to the Cork City and County Archive by his descendants based in the USA. These include a 1784 family pedigree compiled by John Collins of Myross, which has been described as of ‚Äúimmense cultural and historical significance‚Äù, as well as a rare copy of a 1567 map of ‚ÄòHibernia‚Äô by John Goghe.

At that time the monastery was transferred to its current location near the confluence of the Molokhta and Teza Rivers. The new location was so advantageous for trade that an annual fair sprang up near the monastery, attracting merchants from all over Zalesye and Upper Volga regions.

He authored many scholarly monographs and journal articles, along with several novels.  Biography  Buckley was born in New York City in 1937 and grew up in Queens. His mother, Elaine, was from Trinidad with Cuban and South Asian heritage. His father, Ralph Buckley, was from Jamaica with Irish heritage. In 1940, his father worked as a shipping clerk and his mother as a factory worker. Buckley earned his bachelor's degree from St. John's University, his master's degree from Hunter College, and his doctorate in history from McGill University in 1975. Prior to pursuing his doctorate, he taught high school and community college and ran summer youth enrichment programs in New York. After earning his doctorate, he remained in Canada to become a professor and chair of the social studies program at Vanier College in Montreal. In 1980, Buckley returned to the United States, joining the University of Hartford as director of the African American Studies program. In 1984, Buckley joined the University of Connecticut to lead the Center for Academic Programs and teach in the history department. From 1993 to 2008, Buckley served as founding director of the Asian American Studies Institute. During his tenure, the Institute achieved a national profile and \\"pioneered the creation of an anti-racist, transnational, and interdisciplinary curriculum.\\" Under his leadership, the Asian American Institute offered specialized courses in Asian American studies, including history, literature and the arts, and politicial science. It hosted seminars and conferences, including a high-profile Filipino American studies conference and a pivotal gathering of the East of California group of Asian Americanists. The Institute co-founded the Nazrul Endowment Program to fund lectures, arts programs, and human rights initiatives in honor of Kazi Nazrul Islam. The Roger N. Buckley Award Endowment Fund provides scholarships to undergraduates interested in Asian history or Asian American studies. Buckley also facilitated the acquisition of Fred Ho's papers, held in the University of Connecticut's Archives and Special Collections. Buckley described himself as a historian of war and society. Rather than focusing on battlefield conflict, his works explored social, cultural, and racial dimensions of war and military service. Between 1997 and 2016, he wrote a historical fiction trilogy, \\"Accommodation and Resistance: Three Who Chose Rebellion,\\" in which he unpacked issues of race, culture, nationality, and politics in the British Army of the nineteenth century through fictionalized portrayals of three British soldiers, each a real-life historical figure: a Black African, an Indian Hindu, and an Irish Catholic. Buckley also penned mystery-thriller novels featuring fictional McGill University history professor and ladies' man Relph Coggins. Kirkus Reviews reviewed and praised one of these novels. Buckley received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, American Council of Learned Societies, John Carter Brown Library at Brown University, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Sir William Osler Medical Library at McGill, and the University of Connecticut. Buckley was a resident of Coventry, Connecticut. He was a frequent guest speaker at Windham High School. He died on July 25, 2020.

Upon arrival in the United States, he lived in New York.  Murder  Balbo murdered his wife by cutting her throat at his residence. After the murder, Balbo removed earrings and a necklace from his wife's corpse. He was arrested in Wheeling, West Virginia after fleeing. On December 11 1879, Balbo was convicted of the murder of his wife Maria Diebaco Balbo. The death sentence was prescribed by Judge Daniels. At his sentencing, Balbo claimed self-defense. https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/428200818/?terms=pietro%2Bbalbo  Sentence  Originally sentenced for execution on January 19, 1880, Balbo resided at The Tombs until his actual execution on 6 August 1880. During his time imprisoned Balbo studied English and kept a neat cell. Balbo's appeal was argued in the court of appeals in Albany on 26 February 1880https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/428522396/?terms=pietro%2Bbal On 21 May 1880, Balbo was given respite by New York State Governor Alonzo B.

At the request of the Italian Minister Alberto Blanc, Governor Cornell personally reviewed the conviction but due to the corpse robbery and attempt to flee, declined to interfere https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/430693198/?terms=pietro%2Bbalbo On August 2, 1880, Balbo wrote a farewell letter to his mother in which he mentions a sister Carmela and a brother Giovanni.  Execution  Balbo was accompanied by Father Anacletus the night before his execution; Warden Finn was also present. Balbo slept little and was restless the entire time, weeping and praying, reciting the stations of the cross. At 530 AM his lawyer, Mr. Kintzing arrived. Shortly after 6 am Balbo accompanied by Father Anacletus, the deputy warden and two deputy sheriffs attended a catholic mass at the prison chapel where he also was given the rites of the church. Balbo was served a final bowl of coffee at 0750 am, once the coffee was consumed Balbo asked his lawyer for the sheriff, saying he was ready. The drop was not performed correctly and Balbo convulsed on the rope. After three minutes of hanging, Balbo still had a pulse of 100, indicating death thru strangulation and not a broken neck. After 16 minutes Balbo was lowered and his body was inspected by the city coroner who returned a verdict of death. Upon instruction of his lawyer, Balbos body was transferred to the undertakers Whalen And Farretti at the intersection of Worth and Baxter Streets. The execution was a significant event to the Italian immigrant population of New York City at the time as he was the first Italian executed in New York City.https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/430693563/?terms=pietro%2Bbalbo References Category:19th-century executions by New York (state) Category:American murderers Category:Italian emigrants to the United States ","title":"Pietro Balbo"},{"id":"65153029","title":"Flag football at the 2022 World Games"},{"id":"65153033","text":"J√∂rg Ewald D√§hler (16 March 1933 ‚Äì 3 November 2018,Der Bund is a Swiss conductor, harpsichordist, forte piano player and composer.

Biography Dieter Timpe was born in Halle, Germany on 3 November 1931. Since 1950, Timpe studied classical philology at the universities of Berlin, Basel and Freiburg. He received his PhD at the University of Freiburg in 1956. His dissertion on the Principate was supervised by Herbert Nesselhauf. In 1963, Timpe completed his habilitation on the relationship between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire. In 1964, Timpe became Professor at the University of Kiel. Since 1964, Timpe was Professor in Ancient History at the University of W√ºrzburg. He retired Professor Emeritus in 1997. Timpe is a full member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (since 1996), a corresponding member of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities (1990), and a full member of the German Archaeological Institute. Theories Timpe researched Germanic-Roman contacts during the time of the Principate. He is well known for his theories on Germanic peoples, Arminius and the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Timpe argues that the early Germanic peoples were not related and had no collective identity, and can only be treated as a artificial Roman construct dating from the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD. Similar theories have later been mirrored by Walter Pohl. Timpe argues that the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest was an insignificant event in history, and that the battle was won not because of the military skill of Arminius, but rather due to Roman incompetence. Timpe disagrees with Tacitus' account of Arminius as a Germanic freedom fighter. Instead, Timpe suggests that the Arminius was an opportunistic Roman soldier who fought for his own selfish interests. According to Timpe, the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest should not be considered a battle between Romans and Germanic peoples, but rather as an internal Roman affair. Timpe calls Arminius a \\"successful traitor and political criminal\\". He suggests that descriptions of Arminius as a Germanic freedom fighter was fabricated by the Romans in order to conceal Arminius' treason and Rome's failure. Timpe's theories on Arminius have later been mirrored by Walter Pohl.; ; CitationsSources  * Category:1931 births Category:Free University of Berlin alumni Category:German Archaeological Institute Category:German classical philologists Category:German historians Category:Living people Category:People from Halle (Saale) Category:University of Basel alumni Category:University of Freiburg alumni Category:University of Kiel faculty Category:University of W√ºrzburg faculty ","title":"Dieter Timpe"},{"id":"65153079","text":"The Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores - Investiga√ß√£o e Desenvolvimento is a non-profit, privately owned institution of public interest, in Lisbon, Portugal, dedicated to advanced research and development in the domains of electronics, energy, telecommunications and information technologies.

Recorded in 2011 and leaked in summer 2013, the song was initially believed to have been recorded as an outtake of Born to Die (2012). The track features a Bollywood sample in its instrumental. The song was originally rumored to have been a leaked single. Upon its leak, the song was being illegally played in clothing stores, shopping malls, and other public spaces, due to its popularity.  Background and composition  Produced by Chris Braide, the song is noted for being more upbeat than traditional Del Rey releases. Thematically, it is about being in a troublesome romance with someone who makes Del Rey feel alive. While Del Rey has referred to herself as the \\"Queen of New York City\\" and \\"Queen of Saigon\\" in previous songs, \\"Queen of Disaster\\" follows a more symbolic note, with Del Rey suggesting she herself is the ultimate havoc reeker. Michael Biggs of Gigwise called the song a \\"sixties-influenced track\\" that is \\"unlike the gloomy Americana sounds she has pioneered\\" and called it her \\"most up tempo track heard from the star to date\\". Further, the song was likened to the releases of pop girl groups in the early 1960s.https://www.factmag.com/2013/05/17/listen-to-lana-del-reys-upbeat- queen-of-disaster/  Critical reception  Dan Weiss of Billboard called the track one of her best leaked demos, commenting that \\"Since Del Rey uses chamber orchestras so much, why not make some chamber-pop out of them? On this glockenspiel-flecked, one-woman girl-group jam she fancies herself a ballerina over a Motown chord progression, with backing soulettes echoing the phrase ‚Äúso far gone‚Äù and bragging how she celebrates ‚Äúby twisting fate.‚Äù Her ability to turn a phrase, melodically or lexically, is often overshadowed by her auteur's mask, but as a bandleader she certainly sounds a lot more disciplined than, say, Kanye West these days.\\" Legacy= Viral status  In January 2020, the song regained popularity as thousands of videos were uploaded using the song on TikTok. With a spike in streams, the song gained a collective 300 million plays across all uploads on Soundcloud, YouTube, and TikTok, with the most popular YouTube upload with 20 million plays being removed shortly afterwards. Since, various unofficial uploads have achieved a combined 23 million views.https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=queen+of+disaster&sp;=CAM%253Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX1EgcDW_aY Various cover versions of the song have been officially released, with the most popular being a rendition by Lo La, which has received 3 million plays on Spotify as of August 2020.

The village is located on the Atlantic coast. Its population was 619 in 2012. The village was known for its sugar estate and later for its rice production. History The village began as the largest sugar plantation on the Essequibo Coast. In its glory days, the village had a hospital, market, and a distillery. In 1934, H.P. Brasington, the owner, closed the estate. Even though 400 people lived on the grounds, their houses were destroyed, and they were forced off the land. In the late 1940s, the estate was bought by McDoom who rented out the land to East Indian farmers for rice production. In 1966, Kayman Sankar purchased the grounds and used the land to grow rice using modern technology. His business was very successful, producing and exporting to the Caribbean and Europe. Sankar sublet ground to farmers, built a community centre, sold lots for housing, and built an airstrip. The Kayman Sankar Cricket Ground is located in Hampton Court. Notable people who have worked or resided in Hampton Court include Kayman Sankar, his son Beni Sankar, an athlete and businessman, and Isahak Basir, a former member of the National Assembly of Guyana.

It was produced by the U.S. army on Broadway in 1942, with a cast of U.S. soldiers, for the benefit of the Army Emergency Relief Fund. Production The revue ran on Broadway, at the Broadway Theatre from July 4, 1942, to September 26, 1942, for 113 performances. This Is the Army, Internet Broadway Database. Retrieved August 29, 2020.

Chester O'Brien.Mantle, pp. 421-422 However, the opening night program states that the orchestra was under the direction of Cpl. Milton Rosenstock. Background In May 1941, ex-Sergeant Irving Berlin was on tour at Camp Upton, his old Army base in Yaphank, New York, before America joined the fighting in World War II. There he spoke with the commanding officers, including Capt. Doc Rankin of Special Services, about restaging Berlin's 1917 Army play Yip Yip Yaphank. Middle Island Mail, May 28, 1941. Retrieved on September 17, 2006 Gen. George Marshall approved a Broadway production of a wartime musical for the army, allowing Berlin to make the arrangements and hold rehearsals at Camp Upton much like he had done during World War I. Sgt. Ezra Stone was selected as director for the new version of the play, and the two set up on base during the weekdays to put together the story and crew.Bergreen, Laurence. \\"Irving Berlin: This Is the Army\\", Prologue magazine, Summer 1996, Vol. 28, No. 2 Insisting on racial integration, Berlin was permitted to add African Americans into this play, which he was not allowed to do in Yip, Yip Yaphank. This was unconventional for the United States Army. Still, whites and African Americans did not appear on stage simultaneously. According to the opening night program, the show opened with a military minstrel show. Prologue Magazine reports that ‚ÄúInitially, [Berlin] expected the first half hour of This Is the Army to recreate a minstrel show, which was the way he had kicked off Yip! Yip! Yaphank ‚Äì 110 men sitting on bleachers, and everyone in blackface. Ezra Stone, the director, was indignant. 'Mr. Berlin,' he said, 'I know the heritage of the minstrel show. Those days are gone. People don't do that anymore.' 'No, no, that's nonsense,' the songwriter replied. After considerable discussion, Stone adopted another approach to convince Berlin to skip the minstrel segment: 'How can we have 110 guys in blackface and then get them out of blackface for the rest of the show?' So Berlin devised a song for the Black soldiers, based on \\"Puttin' on the Ritz\\", calling it \\"What the Well-Dressed Man in Harlem Will Wear\\". Production and reception The opening night cast consisted of 300 actors including Berlin, Burl Ives, and Stone (the director).Mantle, pp. 421‚Äì422 The show was a great success, with an opening night gross of $45,000, which, according to The New York Times, \\"probably is a world‚Äôs record for an opening night.\\"The New York Times, July 6, 1942, p. 28 It was supposed to run for four weeks (to August 4, 1942) and instead ran for 12 weeks (to September 26, 1942).

For Mr. Berlin's taste is perfect ... he has contributed another memorable show to the genius of America.\\"The New York Times, August 16, 1942, p. 170 Touring company Because the show was such a success, it went on the road.

Early life Raddysh was born on February 28, 1996, in Caledon, Ontario to warehouse manager Dwayne and accountant Gwen Raddysh. Growing up in Toronto with his brother Taylor, their father bought them rollerblades to practice shooting and skating at home. As the two were a few years apart, they played competitive lacrosse on the same teams and golfed together at the Caledon Country Club. Career=Youth Raddysh began his minor hockey career with the Toronto Marlboros Minor Midget AAA team, with whom he won the 2009 Silver Stick tournament in Michigan. During his tenure with the team, Raddysh was drafted in the fifth round, 84th overall, by the Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). At the time of his selection, he stood at 5-foot-11 and weighed 165 pounds. He remained with the Marlboros for the 2012‚Äì13 season, during which he earned a call up to the Georgetown Raiders of the Ontario Junior Hockey League for seven games. Raddysh made his OHL debut with the Otters to complete their 2012-13 season, playing in 24 games and recording two assists. Once Taylor was drafted by the Otters, Raddysh requested that his brother lives with him since he had already completed high school. However, the tram refused for they wished for Taylor to \\"not rely solely on his brother for direction.\\" Raddysh remained undrafted during his tenure with the Otters but received invitations to training camps from the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks. Raddysh re-joined the Otters for his fifth and final year in major juniors and recorded a comeback season, gaining attention from various NHL teams. Following a game against the Kitchener Rangers in January, Raddysh became the new franchise leader for points by a defenceman with 151. The following month, he set a new franchise single-season record for points by a defenceman with his 68th of the season. With his assistance, the Otters won the J. Ross Robertson Cup as the playoff champion of the Ontario Hockey League and qualified for the 2017 Memorial Cup. Alongside his brother Taylor, they became the first pair of brothers to compete against another pair of brothers (the McLeod's) in an OHL Final since 2012. As a result of his play, Raddysh became the first player in OHL history to simultaneously win the Max Kaminsky Trophy as OHL Defenceman of the Year and the Leo Lalonde Memorial Trophy as Overage Player of the Year. The Otters competed against the Windsor Spitfires in the Memorial Cup, losing in seven games. At the end of the tournament, Raddysh was named to the 2017 Mastercard Memorial Cup All-Star Team alongside his brother. Raddysh concluded his major junior career on June 20, 2017, by signing a one-year American Hockey League (AHL) contract with the Rockford IceHogs. Professional Raddysh began his professional career with the IceHogs after making their opening night roster prior to the 2017‚Äì18 season. He recorded his first professional goal on October 15, during a 5‚Äì3 loss to the Milwaukee Admirals. On May 21, 2018, Raddysh signed a two-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks that ran through the 2019‚Äì20 season. On February 18, 2019, Raddysh was traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for Peter Holland. After 22 games with the team, he recorded his first goal in their final regular season game against the Hershey Bears. He attended the Rangers' training camp prior to the 2019‚Äì20 season but was reassigned to their AHL affiliate. Once the NHL began their Return to Play initiative, Raddysh was named to the Rangers' Phase 3 training camp roster.

The depot was built as a satellite depot of South Gosforth depot, which is being refurbished between 2020 and 2024. The original intention was for Howdon to be a temporary depot, but future upgrades to the South Shields line, may mean the depot becomes permanent. History Howdon depot was built on a former landfill site in Howdon, North Tyneside. The new depot was built as part of a ¬£362 million package which includes a new fleet of metrocars which will be partly commissioned at Howdon. The new depot has the capacity to house 25% of the current metrocar fleet, which allows for a continuing service whilst the main depot at South Gosforth is upgraded. Work on the facility was started in late 2019, with opening expected in July 2020, though this slipped until November 2020, when work at Gosforth depot starts. The intent is for the depot to have ten storage roads, and be capable of accepting, and assembling, the new fleet (to be built by Stadler), although this work could also be concentrated at South Gosforth, or shared between the two sites. The depot at Howdon was conceived as a temporary solution whilst South Gosforth is upgraded. However, Nexus received ¬£100 million from the UK Government as part of its Transforming Cities Fund in 2020, which will go to the Metro Flow project. If approved, this will mean the doubling of many single sections of track on the South Shields line and at Pelaw, Hebburn, Bede and Jarrow stations. If this does occur, then the depot at Howdon will become permanent.

Early life Frederick Crist \\"Freddy\\" Trump Jr. was born on October 14, 1938 as the first son of wealthy real estate developer Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump in Queens, New York. In 1956 Fred Jr. graduated from St. Paul's School. In that same year his father Fred Sr. donated money to have the playing fields redone and in his honor were renamed Trump Field. Fred Jr. attended Lehigh University and joined a historically Jewish fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu, even though he was not Jewish. He became president of the fraternity and graduated with a B.A. in business, also completing ROTC and entering the Air National Guard as a second lieutenant. Pilot career In 1958, he met Linda Clapp while vacationing in the Bahamas. She later became a stewardess and asked Fred Jr. for help finding an apartment near Idlewild Airport; they soon began dating. He proposed to her in 1961. In early 1962, they were married in Florida, and she resigned from the airline, which did not allow its stewardesses to be married. They settled in Manhattan and had their first child, Frederick Crist Trump III, in November 1962. The next year, they moved into one of Fred Sr.'s apartments in Jamaica, Queens. During this time, he did maintenance jobs on his father's properties. Fred Sr. wanted his oldest son to be \\"invulnerable\\" so he could take over E. Trump & Son, but Fred Jr. was the opposite in personality. In 1966 Fred Jr. was listed in newspapers as vice president for E. Trump & Son but had a difficult time working with his father. Fred Jr. left E. Trump & Son to pursue his dream of being a pilot, quickly being accepted at Trans World Airlines, which created tension with his father. According to Fred Jr.'s daughter, Mary L. Trump (born 1965), her grandfather \\"dismantled him by devaluing and degrading every aspect of his personality.\\" Both he and Donald mocked him for his decision to become an airline pilot, comparing it to driving a bus. Alcoholism and death By 1970, after a series of domestic incidents, Clapp asked Fred Jr. to leave and arranged for Fred Sr. to change the locks. When his alcoholism prevented him from continuing to function as a pilot, he returned to work for his father's business. He eventually moved into the unfurnished attic of his parents' house, and once again did maintenance on Trump properties. On September 26, 1981, at the age of 42, he died from a heart attack caused by his alcoholism. Donald Trump later said watching his brother descend into alcoholism motivated him to avoid alcohol and cigarettes; in August 2019, he expressed regret over how he treated FredJr. and his struggle. Trump said Fred's memory still shaped his life to that day, and had a huge impact on the trajectory of his own business career and life, saying, \\"He was so handsome, and I saw what alcohol did to him even physically... and that had an impact on me, too.\\" In 1999, just after Fred Sr.'s funeral, Fred III's son was born with cerebral palsy. The Trump family agreed to pay for the child's medical expenses. FredSr.'s will was revealed, which Donald Trump helped write. The will mandated that FredJr., and by extension his children, FredIII and Mary, would be left out from receiving most of the inheritance, which amounted to over $20million. FredIII and Mary filed a lawsuit, alleging that FredJr.'s siblings, including Donald, used \\"undue influence\\" on a dementia-addled FredSr. to cut them out of the inheritance. Donald Trump, who later said he \\"was angry because they sued,\\" suspended the medical benefits for FredJr.'s children, as well as FredIII's infant son. According to Mary, she and FredIII sued to have the benefits reinstated, but only her infant nephew received \\"some accommodations\\" as a result.

Despite being formally banned in 1776, the law was not evenly enforced for the next half a century even after the witch trials had ended or became a rarity in rest of Europe. It is estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 people have been executed for sorcery in Poland. History=Early history The first known witchcraft case in Poland is the one included in a heresy trial against Damian of Bork√≥w by Bishop Jakub von P≈Çock (r. 1396‚Äì1425), but the exact date is unknown. In 1476 a woman, Dorota of Zakrzew was sentenced to be burned for sorcery in Pozna≈Ñ but the verdict was repealed, and the first confirmed execution for witchcraft in Poland took place when a woman whose name is lost was executed in Waliszew in 1511. Jacek Wijaczka (5 February 2008), Hexenprozesse in Polen vom 16. bis zum 18. Jahrhundert Chronology During the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, 49 women and 19 men were condemned for witchcraft in Poland, mostly in the areas close to the Holy Roman Empire, particularly Pozna≈Ñ. The biggest witchcraft persecution, however, did not reach Poland until the second half of the 17th-century, and the most intense period of witch hunt in Poland took place in the period between 1670 and 1730. The witch hunt in Poland lasted to a later period than most other countries in Europe and continued during the entire 18th century, despite several law reforms to first limit and then ban them. The witch trials Witch trials in Poland could be conducted by three different authorities: by the secular city courts, by the clerical courts of the church, and in the private courts of the noble landlords' estates. Initially, witch trials was reserved for the clerical courts in accordance with a law from 1543, but in the following century, secular city courts handled them as well. On 17 July 1672, in accordance with a decree issued from Miko≈Çaj Pra≈ºmowski (1663‚Äì1673) and archbishop Micha≈Ç Radziejowski (1688‚Äì1705), local courts could manage witch trials only if they had been transformed to them by the church or a high court, and death sentenced were banned unless confirmed by a high court. This law was issued after a local court in K≈Çodawa had burned a group of women after severe torture and a trial with dubious legality. However, this law was commonly ignored, and local courts continued to arrest, trial and execute people for sorcery so much that the law had to be repeated without effect several times until 1713. The Central High Court interrupted witch trials in local courts and stopped executions on several occasions, such as in ≈Åƒôczyca 1702 and Przemy≈õl 1756. The most intense period of the Polish witch hunt took place in a period in which Poland was pillaged and devastated by war, rebellions, famine and plague, and the public was in search of explanations for what was commonly viewed as an apocalyptic time for Poland. The typical Polish witch trial was conducted in a rural village or a small town against a woman accused by her neighbors for having used magic to cause suffering and harm to humans, animals, property and entire villages in a period of some catastrophe. The peasantry seldom included accusations about a Pact with Satan and participation in a Witches' Sabbath, but their accusation was transformed to this interpretation by the authorities by the Catholic church and local courts, in order to make the case fit the description of Christian demonology witchcraft handbooks. In Poland, the majority of those executed for sorcery were women: of 116 executed in Wielkopolska and Kujawy between 1624 and 1700, only five were men. An example of a rural trial which culminated in a conviction for witchcraft was the one in Kasina Wielka, in 1634. The end The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was one of the first countries in which persecution for sorcery became illegal. In 1768, a law reform mandated that all witchcraft cases were to be transformed to the national high court, which was followed by the abolition of the torture and death penalty for witchcraft by the Sejm on 23 October 1776. However, these laws were also commonly ignored by the local courts who continued to conduct witch trials, and the ban against witch trials could not be enforced in Poland. A number of witch trials attracted attention in Poland during the second half of the 18th century when witch trials were formally banned. One trial that attracted attention was the one against Franciszka Go≈Çƒôbiewska of Gosty≈Ñ in 1773, where the accused was tortured to death; in 1786 a combined witch- and murder trial took place in Ulanow, and in 1790, a married couple, Maciej and Katarzyna Beret, were put on trial in Sch√∂ffengericht von Nowy Wi≈õnicz accused by the Krzywda family for having enchanted their cows. The likely last witch trial in independent Poland prior to the final partition was conducted toward two women in an unspecified village outside Poznan in 1793, who were accused of having caused illness on live stock by use of witchcraft. The final Partition of Poland in 1795 did not immediately stop the witch trials despite the fact that witch trials were banned also by Russia, Prussia and Austria, as the Polish local courts had ignored also the Polish ban against witch trials. There is little documentation preserved of the witch trials of the 1790s, but a witch trial is known to have taken place in ≈ªaszk√≥w in Polish Ukraine (then Russian partition) as late as 1799. Barbara Zdunk, who were executed in a part of Poland then belonging to Prussia in 1811, has been described as the last person executed for sorcery in Poland (in the German partition) and also have sometimes been referred to as the last person officially executed for sorcery in Europe. (That claim has been disputed, however, as witchcraft was not a criminal offense in Prussia at the time. The last person know to have died in Poland after accusations of sorcery was Krystyna Ceynowa, also in the German partition, who in 1836 has been lynched by locals; those guilty of lynching would be judged and imprisoned by the German authorities).  Number of victims and local characteristics  Although older research, attributed to early research by Polish historian , initially suggested that over 40,000 women might have been executed in witch trials in Poland, modern research, including newer works by Baranowski, noted that those initial estimates have been widely exaggerated, and only between 3,000 and 4,000 people are estimated to have been executed for sorcery in Poland; 90% of them women. Approximately 50% of the accused where found guilty, a similar ratio to the rest of Europe. The witch trials in Poland, although lasting longer than in most of Europe, have been described as less intensive; the number of people executed for sorcery in Europe is estimated to be around 60,000. Unlike elsewhere in Europe, due to the privileges of Polish nobility, there are no recorded instances of a process and execution of a noble (outside of a legend of Walenty Potocki, which historians describe as a fictional story).

It flows through the north of the city of Kisangani and joins the Lindi River just before that river enters the Congo River. It gives its name to the province of Tshopo. Basin The Tshopo basin has an area of about , mostly covered by Guinean-Congolian rainforests. It is elongated, and almost entirely north of the equator. The river flows from east to west and enters the Congo River downstream from Kisangani where it joins the Lindi River. The great falls near the river mouth vary in height from depending on the height of the Congo River. About further upstream the small falls are high over a section of rapids. The location in the continental interior by the equator with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons, and the vegetation covering the basin, result in a fairly constant flow. There are low waters in February‚ÄìApril and in June‚ÄìAugust, and high waters in April‚ÄìMay and particularly in October‚ÄìDecember. Average annual flow is about . At the great falls just above the river mouth the flow is , with a velocity of . The water is pH 6.6‚Äì6.8, and has a temperature of in January and June 1987. Ecology The Lindi and Tshopo rivers form one of the three major right-bank river systems in the Cuvette Centrale, or central Congo Basin, the others being the Itimbiri River and Aruwimi River. According to a 2015 report, 184 species of fish had been found in the Lindi/Tshopo basin. The family of the elephant fish, Mormyridae, was richest in species. The river has clear water, compared to the turbid water of the Congo, making it habitable to plant species such as Inversodicraea. Schistosomiasis is a chronic parasitic disease transmitted by a freshwater mollusc. A 2018 study of people living in a camp on the banks of the Tshopo river from Kisangani on the old Buta road found 54.5% positive for Schistosoma haematobium and 7.3% positive for Schistosoma mansoni. This compared to 2.4% and 4.8% positive rates for people in a nearby village. Hydroelectric plant A hydroelectric power plant was built at the Tshopo River Falls to the north of Kisangani in the 1950s, causing the local extinction of Inversodicraea congolana at one of the two sites in the world where it was found. It was a run-of-the-river plant, so did not require a large reservoir. The river passes through the hydroelectric dam and then over a waterfall. In 2013 Belgium's Minister for Cooperation and Development Jean- Pascal Labille and the Orientale Province governor Jean Bamanisa reopened the Tshopo hydroelectric facility after it had been closed for rehabilitation. A truss bridge was built over the fall in 1968, providing a route for farmers from the northeast to access the city. It fell into disrepair, and in 2014 was replaced by a steel panel bridge with a single lane that could carry vehicles up to 41 tons. It had two external pedestrian walkways.

Beginning in 2003 with the titular first game for the GameCube, the series has predominantly been released on Nintendo gaming hardware and covers multiple genres including action role- playing. The Crystal Chronicles series takes place on an unnamed world inhabited by four tribes. Recurring themes include creating objects from memory and the importance of family. The gameplay, which has always been aimed at as wide an audience as possible within a genre, generally involves either multiple players or a large group working together. Since its inception, the series has been supervised by Akitoshi Kawazu, known for his work on both the Final Fantasy and SaGa series. Recurring staff include composer Kumi Tanioka, who created the series's distinctive medieval-influenced music; Toshiyuki Itahana, who worked on the art design and directed The Crystal Bearers; and Yasuhisa Izumisawa, lead artist for Echoes of Time and the two titles released for WiiWare. Reception of the series as a whole has been positive, with many noting its experimental nature and the first game's unconventional multiplayer mechanics. Video games *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is an action role-playing game released in 2003 in Japan and 2004 internationally for the GameCube. A remastered version with additional content was released in 2020 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Android and iOS. Taking place a millennium after a catastrophe clouds the world in a poisonous Miasma, the narrative follows a caravan travelling to collect myrrh, a substance to empower their village's protecting crystal. *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates is an action role-playing game for the Nintendo DS (DS). It released in 2007 in Japan and 2008 internationally. The narrative follows siblings Yuri and Chelinka who are forced to fight against an ancient evil that attacks their village. *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King is a city building simulation game, released in 2008 for the Wii as a launch title for the WiiWare service. Set in a distant land following the events of Crystal Chronicles, the story follows a young king rebuilding his kingdom. *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time is an action role-playing game for the DS and Wii, released worldwide in 2009. The story follows a player-created protagonist as they go beyond their village in search of a cure for a friend's \\"crystal sickness\\". *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a Darklord is a tower defense game released in 2009 for Wii through the WiiWare service. A direct sequel to My Life as a King, the story follows the new Darklord Mira, daughter of the previous game's antagonist, as she seeks to conquer the land. *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers is an action-adventure game developed for the Wii, released in 2009 in Japan and North America, and 2010 in PAL territories. Set a millennium after the events of Crystal Chronicles, the story follows Layle, a young man granted powers from a crystal embedded in his body. Common elements While distinct in terms of gameplay and narrative, all titles share the same world inhabited by four tribes; the human-like Clavats, stocky Lilties, magic-wielding Yukes and nomadic Selkies. Two recurring themes within the world of Crystal Chronicles is objects generated from memories; and the importance of family. Crystals, a recurring concept within the Final Fantasy franchise, play key roles in multiple entries. There are also recurring Final Fantasy races such as the Chocobo and Moogle, and monsters like the Malborro and Bomb. Rather than arbitrary inclusions, these recurring elements are placed based on their in-game relevance and suitability. The timeline begins with Ring of Fates, which is set thousands of years in the past when the four tribes lived together in harmony. At some point during this period, the events of Echoes of Time take place. My Life as a King is set after the clearing of the Miasma at the end of Crystal Chronicles, with the main character King Leo setting out to rebuild his kingdom. My Life as a Darklord takes place in the aftermath, with surviving monsters struggling to survive and ending up fighting against characters from both My Life as a King and Crystal Chronicles. The Crystal Bearers takes place 1000 years after the time of Crystal Chronicles, with the Yukes having vanished during a great war with the Lilties and crystal-based magic being a rarity. The gameplay of Crystal Chronicles has tended to focus either on multiplayer, or the concept of groups working towards a common goal. A notable exception is The Crystal Bearers, which follows a single protagonist. A common aim across all titles is creating games that can be enjoyed by a wide audience. The original Crystal Chronicles notably made use of multiplayer relying on the GameCube linking with the Game Boy Advance (GBA) link cable. Both Ring of Fates and Echoes of Time revolve around dungeon exploration and loot collection, comparable to the gameplay of Diablo. My Life as a King focuses on city building and construction, with the protagonist sending adventurers out on quests to gather materials and spread influence. My Life as a Darklord again focuses on a group, but this time within the tower defense genre and subverting narrative and stylistic tropes within the series. The Crystal Bearers broke away from many of the series' established gameplay mechanics; in addition to a focus on action-adventure and physics-based combat, there were also numerous minigames. Development The first Crystal Chronicles title originated when Final Fantasy developer Square‚Äîwho had previously parted on bad terms with Nintendo when they developed Final Fantasy VII for Sony's PlayStation console‚Äîwere in a poor condition following the box office failure of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. They decided to make video games for Nintendo consoles again, founding a shell company of Square's Product Development Division 2 dubbed \\"The Game Designers Studio\\" so production could go ahead without interfering with other projects for Sony platforms. The shell company was co-owned by Square and Akitoshi Kawazu, creator of the SaGa series. Due to the strong reception of Crystal Chronicles, Square Enix continued it as its own series, beginning work on Ring of Fates and The Crystal Bearers in early 2006. The two games were announced that year. Due to his commitment to the Crystal Chronicles series among other projects, Kawazu did not continue work on the SaGa franchise. From the original Crystal Chronicles to The Crystal Bearers, the series remained exclusive to Nintendo consoles. Kawazu explained this as being an act of loyalty to Nintendo, who had first requested a game for their consoles. The remastered version of Crystal Chronicles was spearheaded by later staff member Ryoma Araki, who had joined Square Enix after playing the game and wanted to revive it for a modern gaming audience. The remaster was done with Kawazu's imput, and featured enough changes that half of the game had to be remade. Many of the series staff were veterans of Final Fantasy IX, and the core team remained through the series' run. Kawazu had a creative role in each entry, mainly filling the role of executive producer. Kawazu also wrote the scenario for The Crystal Bearers. Both Ring of Fates and Echoes of Time were directed by Mitsuru Kamiyama and designed by Hiroyuki Saegusa. Crystal Chronicles and Ring of Fates had character designs by Toshiyuki Itahana, who had previously worked on Final Fantasy IX; he would go on to direct The Crystal Bearers. For Echoes of Time, My Life as a King and My Life as a Darklord, the characters were designed by Yasuhisa Izumisawa. Music The majority of series music has been composed by Kumi Tanioka, who had previously worked on the music of Final Fantasy XI. She returned to work on Ring of Fates, My Life as a King, then simultaneously on Echoes of Time and My Life as a Darklord. Because of the latter commitment, Tanioka was not greatly involved in the music of The Crystal Bearers, which was instead composed by Hidenori Iwasaki and Ryo Yamazaki. Tanioka returned for the Crystal Chronicles remaster alongside Iwasaki to both remix the original music and compose new tracks. The music of the series is distinct from other Final Fantasy entries, making extensive use of medieval and Renaissance musical instruments. Those used for the first game include the recorder, the crumhorn and the lute. Her work on Echoes of Time was described by her as the most challenging project she had worked on at the time. Iwasaki and Yamazaki originally wanted to emulate Tanioka's style with their work on The Crystal Bearers, but Kawazu and Itahana persuaded them to change into an acoustic style inspired by American music. Reception The original Crystal Chronicles reached high positions in sales charts upon release, going on to sell 1.3 million units worldwide. Ring of Fates sold nearly 700,000 units worldwide, while Echoes of Time sold 570,000. The Crystal Bearers met with low sales in Japan and North America, and was not mentioned in Square Enix's fiscal report for the year ending in 2010. In a Final Fantasy series retrospective, Digital Spy noted it as one of the more successful spin- offs within the Final Fantasy franchise alongside Final Fantasy Tactics. Eurogamers Rob Haines, in a retrospective on the first game, noted its unique multiplayer mechanics despite them not ageing well. He also felt that the series had lost some of its identity as it went on and aimed itself at mainstream gaming audiences. In a 2007 retrospective video series on the Final Fantasy franchise, GameTrailers noted that Crystal Chronicles stood out from the likes of SaGa and Mana, being a branch of the series while retaining a unique identity as opposed to spinning off into its own separate universe. In the preface to an interview with Kawazu, Imran Khan of Game Informer grouped the Crystal Chronicles series alongside Kawazu's other work as examples of his experimental approach to game design.

He served as president of the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association (MAHA) from 1927 to 1934, and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) from 1934 to 1936. In Manitoba, he sought to expand senior ice hockey and establish co-operation between teams and owners of the Winnipeg Amphitheatre on schedules and reducing travel costs. He wanted all players aged 21 and younger to remain in junior ice hockey and began to negotiate with professional teams to refrain from signing them to contracts. His seven years as leader of the MAHA was the longest tenure for a president at the time, during which he oversaw continued growth of the association and improvement of finances. Gilroy sat on the rules committee while he was CAHA vice-president and sought to implement consistent ice hockey rules across the country. He advocated for stricter enforcement of rules for player safety and for adopting a delayed penalty rule. As president, he wanted to stop the migration of hockey players across the country as men sought to make a living by playing hockey during the Great Depression in Canada. He warned against the stacking of teams to win an Allan Cup championship and wanted to resolve the situation before selecting the Canada men's national ice hockey team to play at the 1936 Winter Olympics. His efforts were supported by most of Canada but led to multiple disagreements with the Maritime Amateur Hockey Association, where it was common knowledge that players were being paid for amateur hockey games. The relationship with the Maritimes worsened when the Halifax Wolverines were chosen to represent Canada at the Olympics but subsequently disbanded and their players removed from the national team after reports of demanding money. Gilroy and the CAHA reached an agreement with the British Ice Hockey Association to halt the transfer of players from Canada to Great Britain until permission was granted. The Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace ruled that Jimmy Foster and Alex Archer were ineligible to compete for the Great Britain men's national ice hockey team since they were suspended by the CAHA for not seeking permission to transfer internationally. On the eve of the Olympics, Gilroy allowed the two players to participate as a gesture of sportsmanship towards Great Britain, and objected to other countries portraying Canada as protesting the use of Foster and Archer. Great Britain defeated Canada by a 2‚Äì1 score, and the resulting silver medal was the first time in which Canada did not win the gold medal in ice hockey at the Olympic Games. Gilroy and the CAHA were subsequently scrutinized heavily by media and players in Canada for the failure at the Olympics. He was posthumously inducted into the builder category of the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame in 1987. Early life and business career Edward Albert Gilroy was born on October 10, 1879, in Smiths Falls, Ontario. He completed his schooling in Smiths Falls. He played minor ice hockey in both Smiths Falls and Ottawa, and later became an ice hockey referee and a team executive. alt=Collage of individual player photos circled around a photo of Gilroy and the team's crest Gilroy first arrived in Portage la Prairie to play hockey in 1905, then spent a season playing lacrosse in Nelson, British Columbia in 1906. He returned to coach the Portage la Prairie Cities team in the Manitoba Professional Hockey League from 1906 until the team disbanded in 1909. He also served on the executive of the Manitoba & Northwestern Hockey Association at the same time. Notable players on his team included Ernie Dubeau, Jack Fraser, Newsy Lalonde, Skinner Poulin, Don Smith, and Cyclone Taylor. In 1913, Gilroy was elected vice-president of the Senior Independent Hockey League based at the Winnipeg Amphitheatre. The league included the Winnipeg Falcons, the Winnipeg Strathcona, a team from Selkirk and a team from Portage la Prairie. He refereed games in the league, and was re-elected twice as vice-president, serving in the role until 1916. The league grew during his tenure and added the Winnipeg Monarchs who won the 1915 Allan Cup, and the Winnipeg 61st Battalion who won the 1916 Allan Cup. Gilroy worked as a court clerk for several years, then worked in the clothing business, then became the first commissioner of the Manitoba Liquor Commission at Portage la Prairie. He was in charge of the government warehouse for the distribution of alcohol in Manitoba during prohibition in Canada. He was the purchasing manager for the Government of Manitoba for two years based in Winnipeg, then returned to Portage la Prairie operating a wholesale business from 1922 onwards. Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association Gilroy served as president of the Portage Hockey Club from 1924 to 1927. He also served as a representative of the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association (MAHA), and sat on the executive committee of the Portage la Prairie minor ice hockey league. As Portage Hockey Club president, he was appointed by the MAHA to committee to oversee the Manitoba Senior Hockey League. He noted the team had strong support from Portage la Prairie which allowed it to grow and prosper, and advocated to find non-hockey employment for players to keep them local instead of transferring elsewhere. alt=Black and white photo of arena exterior Gilroy was elected president of the MAHA in November 1927, to succeed newspaper executive A. E. H. Coo. A letter from Gilroy was published in the Winnipeg Free Press in December, in which he reiterated his commitment to expanding senior ice hockey in Manitoba, and restoring it to the prominence it had before rosters were depleted by professional teams. He was open to university teams participating in the Manitoba Senior Hockey League, wanted to work with owners of the Winnipeg Amphitheatre on schedules, and address concerns of attendance figures and travel costs to games outside of Winnipeg. He also sought to keep teams based in the MAHA as opposed to playing in neighbouring districts such as the Thunder Bay Amateur Hockey Association (TBAHA). The 1927‚Äì28 season had the greatest number of hockey teams in Manitoba at the time, with the most growth in rural areas. Gilroy advocated for support of leagues based in rural areas to grow interest in the game, and since those teams could not raise funds to travel long distances to play in larger cities. He wanted to shorten the provincial playoffs system which extended play into poor ice conditions later in the season. As growth increased, he sought to educate teams and players in Manitoba that registration requirements including transfers between clubs would be enforced in the 1928‚Äì29 season, and published letters in newspapers advising of changes to consistent with new amateur regulations across Canada. The MAHA implemented upper and lower divisions in the Manitoba Senior Hockey League for the 1929‚Äì30 season, and received more applications from teams in Winnipeg than ice availability could support. The MAHA arranged for all of the upper division teams to play in Winnipeg to reduce travel costs, and expanded the lower division with teams from Brandon, Elkhorn, Souris, and Virden. Gilroy's desire to shorten the playoffs was realized when national deadlines were imposed. The MAHA sought for all players aged 21 and younger to remain in junior hockey, but no agreement was reached with professional teams to refrain from signing players under an age limit to a contract. The MAHA approved an application from the Kenora Thistles based in Northwestern Ontario to play in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League for the 1930‚Äì31 season. Gilroy named a committee to explore revisions to the MAHA constitution, and approved the University of Manitoba Grads to represent Canada at the 1931 Ice Hockey World Championships and a tour of Europe. The MAHA declined applications from unaffiliated teams with commercial sponsors to enter the Allan Cup and Memorial Cup playoffs, and Gilroy continued a campaign to educate teams on amateur regulations for national playoffs. The MAHA faced a revolt from teams in the Manitoba Senior Hockey League before the 1932‚Äì33 season, when the Winnipeg Hockey Club, the Winnipeg Falcons and the Selkirk Hockey Club withdrew and formed a commercial league in protest of the Brandon Hockey Club being admitted. Gilroy announced that any player taking part in the new commercial league would be suspended from the MAHA, and be ineligible for the Allan Cup playoffs. After a week of negotiations, an agreement was reached where the Winnipeg Monarchs and Winnipeg Hockey Club merged, and the Manitoba Senior Hockey League operated with four teams including Brandon. When an amateur international hockey league was proposed to include teams from Winnipeg, the TBAHA and Minneapolis for the 1933‚Äì34 season, Gilroy stated it would not be approved since there was no existing international agreement for amateur leagues at the time. Gilroy retired as MAHA president after the season and A. E. H. Coo returned to the position. Gilroy's seven years was the longest tenure for an MAHA president at the time, during which he oversaw continued growth of the association and improvement of finances. Canadian Amateur Hockey Association Gilroy was first appointed to a Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) committee in 1928, when he was named to oversee Allan Cup playoffs for Western Canada, and was named an Allan Cup trustee along with Silver Quilty. Gilroy also sought to implement consistent ice hockey rules across the country as a member of the CAHA rules committee. Vice-president alt=Diagram of an ice hockey rink Gilroy became the first person to be elected second vice-president of the CAHA in March 1930, when he was acclaimed to the newly created position under Jack Hamilton as president. The CAHA continued to discuss consistent application of the rules of play, and considered a proposal from the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association (QAHA) to allow the forward pass in the neutral zone of the ice hockey rink instead of it being an offside infraction. Gilroy proposed to allow body checking by players of either team in either defensive zone to meet demands of modern spectators, but the rule change was defeated. Gilroy was re-elected second vice-president in April 1931. The CAHA confirmed complete authority of the referee over any match and interpretation of the rules of play. Gilroy travelled to Lake Placid as a representative of the CAHA, when the Winnipeg Hockey Club won the gold medal representing Canada in ice hockey at the 1932 Winter Olympics. Gilroy was elected first vice-president of the CAHA in April 1932. The CAHA rules committee proposed multiple changes for the upcoming season, which revisited allowing the forward passes between the blue lines. In November 1932, Gilroy arranged for public meetings for the benefit of hockey players, coaches and referees, to clarify the rule change which now allowed the forward pass in the neutral zone. Gilroy was re-elected first vice- president of the CAHA in April 1933. He oversaw arrangements for senior and junior division playoffs in Western Canada. He also sat on the CAHA rules committee which decided to implement some of the changes made by the NHL, which included allowing the forward pass in all three zones, and body checking only to the puck carrier. He also advocated for stricter enforcement of rules by referees for player safety, specifically junior ice hockey. President, first term Gilroy was elected president of the CAHA on April 4, 1934, to succeed Frank Greenleaf, and was the third Manitoban to become president of the CAHA following W. F. Taylor in 1914, and Toby Sexsmith in 1922. Gilroy was also a governor of the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada (AAU of C) in his role as CAHA president, and was named to the legislation committee of the AAU of C. alt=Black and white photo of many men in queue for food at the Yonge Street Mission In May 1934, Gilroy decreed that the CAHA would halt the migration of hockey players between clubs and branches. He sought to educate on the regulations, and stated that it was unfair for clubs to stack rosters with the best players from outside of their area. The decision by players to migrate around the country looking for work was a result of the Great Depression in Canada, since more men sought to make a living by playing hockey. By sticking to the constitution and enforcing the rules, it meant many players would be ruled ineligible for hockey. In October 1934, the CAHA gave permission for players to attend tryouts for professional teams, with the expectation that any player who did not sign a professional contract would return to amateur hockey in Canada. After those players remained in the United States on amateur teams, Gilroy suspended them from the CAHA for not obtaining a proper transfer or release. Gilroy issued communication to all CAHA branch presidents that the registration and transfer rule would be strictly enforced, and did not want players being misled by team managers circumventing the rules. Gilroy expected little difficulty in enforcing the regulations, since he received assurance of co-operation from presidents of all CAHA branches except for the Maritimes. He warned against the stacking of teams to win a championship, and wanted the situation to be resolved this season, since the next Allan Cup champions would be the presumptive choice to become the Canada men's national ice hockey team at the 1936 Winter Olympics. Gilroy stated that he had no intent to appoint anyone to investigate the status of amateur players within the Maritime Amateur Hockey Association, despite reports of players and teams not following proper transfer procedures. The Winnipeg Tribune reported it was common knowledge that players in the Maritimes were being paid to play, but that there was little the CAHA could do to prove it. Gilroy asked the Maritime Amateur Hockey Association to \\"declare itself on the matter\\", with regards to operating a commercial league which was considered professionalism and not allowed under CAHA regulations or AAU of C by-laws. Gilroy declined to reconsider any transfer requests for player who had gone to the Maritimes without approval. He also declared that any team playing commercial hockey after January 2, 1935, would be suspended from the CAHA and ineligible for the Allan Cup, which included the Moncton Hawks who were the defending 1934 Allan Cup champions. The alt=Exterior of building Gilroy declared that only teams playing in an inter-city league would be eligible to compete for the Allan Cup. A three-team league was agreed upon in January, which included teams from Moncton, Halifax and Charlottetown operating under CAHA jurisdiction and excluding players who had not completed proper transfers. Gilroy warned all teams under the CAHA that the players who were ruled ineligible in the Maritimes could not play elsewhere in Canada. The Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) also sought to operate a commercial league for the 1934‚Äì35 season, and permission was granted by the CAHA with the stipulation that such teams followed proper registration and transfers regulations and would be ineligible for the for Allan Cup playoffs. Despite the experiment with commercial hockey, Gilroy predicted it had little future within the CAHA, and noted the unwillingness by commercial teams to develop younger players. The OHA was late in deciding its junior ice hockey champion due to the use of an ineligible player. Gilroy stated the matter would be dealt with at the next CAHA general meeting to avoid a repeat, as it was unfair to teams in Western Canada to sit idle waiting to play an Eastern Canada team for the 1935 Memorial Cup. Registrations with the CAHA had increased by 13,949 players since 1925, despite the CAHA operating at a deficit of C$30,000 in the previous three seasons. The CAHA considered expanding its registration committee to include representation by all branches of the CAHA, and Gilroy cast a tie-breaking vote for further discussion by the resolution committee. He wanted to keep players under age 21 in junior hockey and was opposed to them trying-out for professional teams. He submitted a resolution to limit try-outs by age, but it was defeated. The CAHA then approved setting up a committee to improve co- operation with the National Hockey League. President, second term Gilroy was re-elected president of the CAHA on April 13, 1935. He appointed a committee to discuss several issues with the AAU of C, which included the definition of amateur, the desire by CAHA branches to pay a consistent price for registration cards across Canada, and the possibility for the CAHA to issue its own registration cards. He also asked the CAHA registration committee to formally write up the common exceptions to the residence rule for junior-aged ice hockey players, or any player enlisted in the Canadian Armed Forces or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He reiterated that the residency rule would be strictly enforced subject to the allowed exceptions. He also advocated for adopting a delayed penalty rule when teams already had two players in the penalty box, and explained that the current situation of more than two penalties being served at once was demoralizing to the offending team, and a negative experience for spectators. In August 1935, Gilroy warned that hockey players that participating in professional leagues without permission from the CAHA would be suspended. He specifically mentioned new leagues established in England and Scotland, but that permission for tryouts would be granted if properly requested. In September 1935, the CAHA and the British Ice Hockey Association (BIHA) agreed to halt the migration of players from Canada to Great Britain until the amateur status of each player was investigated and that permission was granted to transfer. =National team selection= alt=Photo of trophy At the general meeting in 1935, the CAHA approved expenses to cover travel and equipment to send a team to Germany to represent Canada in ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics. The CAHA reserved the right to choose the best senior team within Canada, and strengthen it with additional players from other teams in Canada up to a maximum of 12 players according to Olympic rules. In July 1935, the Halifax Wolverines were chosen to represent Canada. Gilroy denied a report in The Gazette that the CAHA would stage a series in Montreal to determine the national representative. In November 1935, reports circulated in The Canadian Press that the Halifax Wolverines may not be able to go to the Olympics, and Gilroy expected that the 1935 Allan Cup finalists would be invited instead. He stated the final decision would be made later in the month at the AAU of C annual meeting in Halifax. The Halifax Wolverines subsequently disbanded before the 1935‚Äì36 season. Gilroy announced that the Canadian representative would be the Port Arthur Bearcats who promptly accepted. They had lost only one player from the previous season and were given the possibility of adding up to four players from the Wolverines. Gilroy said efforts made to reassemble the Halifax Wolverines were unsuccessful, and reiterated that the decision to send the Bearcats was final. He elaborated that if the CAHA had considered the Montreal Royals team, they would also have had to consider the other semi-finalists from North Battleford. On January 7, 1936, the four members of the Halifax Wolverines that had been added to the national team, were removed after an emergency meeting in Toronto to deal with reports of them demanding money to take care of their families while they were overseas at the Olympics. Gilroy stated that the CAHA would not give preferential treatment to any player on the team, and denied that nothing beyond travel expenses were offered to the players in order to meet amateur eligibility requirements for the Olympic Games. The next day, Walter Kitchen, Hugh Farquharson, Dinty Moore and James Haggarty were added to the national team. According to CAHA secretary Fred Marples, the Halifax Wolverines players approached the Port Arthur Bearcats manager about taking care of their families while overseas, and the manager in turn relayed the question to Gilroy who stated he would deal with it upon arriving in Port Arthur on route to Halifax. The four players felt they were unjustly removed from the team, denied that they had asked for money, and stated that Gilroy had approached them first on the train from Port Arthur to Toronto and suggested they appeal for money from the Government of Nova Scotia. The Maritime Amateur Hockey Association requested an official explanation of the dismissals from Gilroy and AAU of C president W. A. Fry, with suspensions forthcoming if the allegations were proven true. Gilroy stated no suspension was issued against the players at the time, but the Maritime Amateur Hockey Association called his explanation unsatisfactory that the players had requested money for their families while overseas. Gilroy sailed to Europe on January 18 aboard the RMS Duchess of Atholl along with the members of the Canadian national hockey team. =1936 Winter Olympics= alt=Outdoor photo of the Port Arthur Bearcats in hockey equipment wearing the Canadian national team uniform The Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) which oversaw ice hockey at the Olympics, met before the games started and ruled that Jimmy Foster and Alex Archer were ineligible to compete for the Great Britain men's national ice hockey team since the players were under suspension by the CAHA for not seeking permission to transfer internationally. Great Britain's manager Bunny Ahearne contested that international rules stated a player could leave a country without seeking permission, and the CAHA suspensions should not apply. Gilroy noted that Canada had lodged a complaint with the LIHG in September 1935, regarding the Canadians who went to play abroad without permission of the CAHA. He found it unfortunate that the question of eligibility was raised on the eve of the Olympics, since the LIHG had not held a meeting until then. He denied making a last-minute protest for fear of Canada losing to Great Britain. Gilroy also denied that Canada had agreed to lift the ban on the two players, stating that all players who had not received international transfers were still suspended. He chose not to object on the eve of the Olympics to the two players participating as a gesture of sportsmanship towards Great Britain. Before the second round of games began, other participating hockey nations threatened to protest the victories by Great Britain due to the use of CAHA players. The Winnipeg Tribune reported that three LIHG delegates had approached Gilroy to become president and called for an emergency meeting of the LIHG. On February 10, Gilroy was quoted as saying that, \\"hockey in Great Britain, as conducted by the British Ice Hockey Association, is a racket\\". He felt that it was unsportsmanlike for Great Britain to import as many Canadian players as it did to its domestic league. He also felt that LIHG president Paul Loicq had put Canada \\"on the spot\\" by not making a decision, and objected to Canada being portrayed as in protest. Gilroy also stated, \\"Canada is willing to play any team here. If we can't produce a team good enough to win the Olympics, we should be ashamed, since Canada is the birthplace of hockey\\". The next day, Great Britain defeated Canada by a 2‚Äì1 score. Gilroy stated he had no complaint over the inclusion of Foster and Archer the game and felt Canada lost due to \\"tough breaks\\". Before the final round began, Canada threatened to withdraw from Olympic hockey when it learned that the playoffs format would carry over the loss to Great Britain past the second round-robin series, since the tournament format stated that teams did not have to play one another more than once. Canada was faced with going into the final round of four versus the United States, Czechoslovakia and Great Britain national teams, and was only able to play two games with a loss against them. Gilroy was unaware of the playoff format in advance of the Olympics, and took objection to the sportsmanship of Canadian officials being questioned, after a special meeting decided not to alter the format. Gilroy was criticized by Canadian politician Tommy Church for fostering ill will against Canada due to the February 10 comments. Church called for an investigation and for the Government of Canada to decide on whether to abandon the Olympics in favour of the British Empire Games. Great Britain went on to capture the gold medal and Canada received the silver medal. The 1936 tournament was the first time in which Canada did not win the gold medal in ice hockey at the Olympic Games, which led to the CAHA and Gilroy being heavily scrutinized by media in Canada. In remarks after the Olympics on February 18, Gilroy insisted that the CAHA had not wished to bring up the suspended Canadian players, and that it was made an issue against his wishes and gave Canada a reputation for poor sportsmanship. He was quoted as saying that Canada was given a \\"raw deal\\" by the playoffs format used, and considered cancellation of scheduled exhibition games for the national team except for those against Germany and France who supported Canada's disagreement with the playoffs format. The next day, Gilroy denied that he said Canada was given a \\"raw deal\\", and held further remarks until he returned home to meet with the CAHA. The Winnipeg Tribune sports editor Johnny Buss wondered if Gilroy was being made the scapegoat for the CAHA's woes at the Olympics. He admired Gilroy for his sportsmanship, but noted the choice to let Foster and Archer play did not make any friends, nor did the comment that senior amateur hockey in England was a \\"racket\\". Buss described Gilroy as outspoken but sincere in his efforts, but speculated that Gilroy's statements were made at the urging of other CAHA officers. =Post-Olympics reaction in Canada= alt=Black and white photo of Paul Loicq in a white shirt Upon his arrival in Halifax aboard the RMS Montclare on March 2, 1936, Gilroy spoke with Canadian media who had not been in attendance at the Olympics. He reiterated that the CAHA did not protest the use of Archer and Foster by Great Britain, and voted with the majority of LIHG members to allow them to play. Gilroy felt the playoffs format was changed to Great Britain's advantage in the middle of competition by parties who stood to gain from the change. He defended the choice of the national team and declared no CAHA officers would resign due to not winning the gold medal. He also stated, \\"I have been misrepresented and misunderstood so many times. I am becoming hardened to it\\". Neither Gilroy nor Canadian Olympic Committee president Patrick J. Mulqueen elaborated on the comment that English hockey was a \\"racket\\". The Canadian Press reported the Gilroy appeared nervous in response to what Mulqueen termed \\"misrepresentation of his actions\\". Gilroy arrived in Winnipeg the next day and was quoted as saying, \\"No matter how you add it up, Canada should have won the Olympic hockey championship\\". Canada had won seven of eight games played and had a better ratio of goals for against compared to Great Britain which won five of seven games with two draws. Gilroy said, \\"There is no question that the fact that the rules were changed immediately following England's victory over Canada. Loicq denied that rules to decide the standings and said that Gilroy and Mulqueen did not understand the playoffs system in place. The Port Arthur Bearcats returned from Europe three weeks later than CAHA officials, since the team played an extended tour of exhibition games in Europe after the Olympics. The Bearcats were declined a spot in the 1936 Allan Cup playoffs because it was too late to rearrange the schedule. Gilroy upheld the decision by his vice-president and denied that a playoff berth was promised to the team. Canadian national teams players spoke with the media in Montreal later in March, and were critical of the Canadian leadership. Kenneth Farmer stated that none of Canada's officials knew what playoff system was being used and that Gilroy and Marples \\"were blissfully unaware of what it was all about\\". Ralph St. Germain said that if Canada was a seen as poor sports, \\"It was largely due to the incessant blustering and bickering of our officials\\". OHA executive J. Percy Bond stated that Gilroy did not deserve most of the criticism. Bond stated that Gilroy should have known the playoff system in place, but that Gilroy had twice threatened to return from Germany because of the lack of co-operation from other Canadian officials. =1936 CAHA general meeting= Gilroy told delegates at the 1936 CAHA general meeting that in September 1935, officials of the BIHA agreed that no Canadians would play in Great Britain without CAHA permission, but failed to keep the agreement. He also stated that Loicq declared the players ineligible in November 1935 but later rescinded. Gilroy felt it would be unfair to suspend Foster and Archer on the eve of the Olympics, and that Loicq should not have let the BIHA believe the players were eligible. Gilroy stated it was solely his doing to have the suspensions lifted. The focus of the general meeting moved towards regulating players and updating amateur regulations. Gilroy appointed a committee to meet with the Amateur Athletic Union and discuss restrictions on player movements between Canada and the United States. He wanted to see an end to amateurs entering the United States under a professional bond due to immigration laws. The CAHA banned the migration of Canadian players to the United Kingdom until a new working agreement was reached, after Gilroy explained that the BIHA had made no effort to enforce an existing player transfer agreement from 1935. W. G. Hardy and George Dudley proposed new definition of amateur including \\"four points\\" in an attempt to eliminate \\"shamateurism\\", which if approved would semi-professionalize the game. Gilroy stated that if the new definition was adopted, it would automatically sever relations with the AAU of C, and lose the privilege to participate in hockey at the Olympics. The \\"four points\\" approved at the meeting were: # Hockey players may capitalize on their ability as hockey players for the purpose of obtaining legitimate employment. # Hockey players may accept from their clubs or employers payment for time lost, from work while competing on behalf of their clubs. They will not however, be allowed to hold \\"shadow\\" jobs under the clause. # Amateur hockey teams may play exhibition games against professional teams under such conditions as may be laid down by the individual branches of the CAHA. # Professionals in another sport will be allowed to play under the CAHA jurisdiction as amateurs. Gilroy supported three of the changes, but was against players receiving payments from work while competing in hockey. At the conclusion general meeting, he was succeeded as CAHA president by Cecil Duncan on April 14, 1936. Political career alt=Building exterior Gilroy served as an alderman for the east ward of the Portage la Prairie municipal government for six years during the 1930s, and was an executive member of the local Board of Trade. On October 30, Gilroy became an independent candidate in the November 1933 by-election for the Portage la Prairie electoral district in the Manitoba Legislature. He ran against Toby Sexsmith of the Progressive Conservative Party who was a former president of both the MAHA and the CAHA. The Winnipeg Free Press reported that the campaign for the seat vacated by Fawcett Taylor had few public meetings, no noticeable political issues being discussed, and appeared to be a popularity contest between Gilroy and Sexsmith. A third candidate from the Co- operative Commonwealth Federation was reported to be a long shot. Gilroy had previously been aligned as a conservative, but felt that as an independent candidate he could appeal to both liberal and conservative voters. Sexsmith won the by-election by 238 votes over Gilroy. On June 25, Gilroy was nominated as the Liberal-Progressive Party candidate in the Portage la Prairie electoral district for the July 1936 Manitoba general election. The election was a rematch versus the incumbent Toby Sexsmith. Gilroy had since completed his terms as president of the CAHA, and the Medicine Hat News described the election as a \\"Battle of the Sports Moguls\\", compared to the Winnipeg Free Press which called it a \\"Battle of Hockey Moguls\\". Gilroy received 1279 votes and was defeated again by Sexsmith who received 1727 votes. Later hockey career alt=Photo of trophy Gilroy was named to the MAHA executive in the past-president role, in October 1936. He was among the dignitaries which attended the opening of the new concrete and steel hockey rink in Portage la Prairie in January 1937. Portage la Prairie was the only Canadian city at the time to have two former CAHA presidents as residents, in Gilroy and Sexsmith, who both participated in the ceremonial first puck at the new rink. As the past-president of the CAHA in May 1937, Gilroy was given the honour of presenting the Memorial Cup trophy to the Winnipeg Monarchs for a second time. The first was for the 1935 Memorial Cup championship and then again for the 1937 Memorial Cup championship. Gilroy was appointed chairman of the rules committee to examine changes at the CAHA general meeting in April 1938. He submitted a motion to ban commercial teams from competing for the Memorial Cup or Allan Cup, but it was defeated without debate. He also recommended to allow strengthening of teams from within their own branch, once the team won its branch championship and advanced into the national playoffs. Gilroy was named manager of the Portage Terriers junior hockey team in May 1938. He felt that he had assembled the best Portage team of the 1930s, in preparation for the 1938‚Äì39 season. He later became team president and a director of the Portage Rink Company. Gilroy was a guest of the MAHA silver jubilee held in Winnipeg in October 1938, with five of the six past-presidents in attendance. The CAHA held its own silver jubilee in April 1939, at the Royal Alexandra Hotel in Winnipeg. Gilroy was a guest where eleven of the thirteen past-presidents were in attendance. Gilroy was critical of the MAHA for allowing wholesale transfer of players between north and south divisions in the junior league in the 1939‚Äì40 season. He felt that a rink company should not be dictating to the league, and stated that the MAHA should enforce the rules strictly and have \\"backbone\\". Personal life and death Gilroy resided in Portage la Prairie from 1906 onwards, except for two years while working in Winnipeg. He maintained a summer home on the shores of Lake Manitoba, and served as president of the Delta Beach Association for 15 years. He had two sons with his wife Gertrude Gaunce, who died in January 1942. Gilroy died on August 8, 1942, at his summer home in Delta Beach due to heart problems. He was interred with his wife in Hillside Cemetery in Portage la Prairie. Legacy and honours Gilroy was named an honorary president of the MAHA in 1937. He was also named an honorary patron of the Portage la Prairie Baseball Club. Journalist Ralph Allen credited Gilroy with being progressive early in his presidency of the CAHA, for enforcing the rules and upholding the constitution to protect amateur hockey in Canada. Gilroy had felt it necessary to prevent regional disparities in talent due to players migrating around the country in numbers never seen before. After Gilroy's death, Frank Sargent who was the CAHA president at the time, stated that \\"His term of office was a very difficult one and he discharged his duties in a most able manner\\". Cecil Duncan described Gilroy's presidency as \\"transitory and troublous\\" for the CAHA, and International Ice Hockey Association president W. G. Hardy felt that Gilroy acted fairly and in the best interests of hockey in Canada. In 1946, the MAHA was presented with a memorial cup to commemorate Gilroy by his son Jack. The cup became the E. A. Gilroy Memorial Trophy awarded to the Manitoba champion of the juvenile B-level division. Gilroy was posthumously inducted into the builder category of the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame in 1987.

It is located south-east of Sundridge, west of Bickley, north of Bromley Common, and east of Bromley. History Widmore derives from 'Withmere', a placename first mentioned in 1226 and thought to mean 'pool where the withy grows'. Wythemere, Widmere and Wigmore were variant spellings. The area remained a tiny hamlet, save for a brick-works, as late as the 19th century. The pool that gave the area its name was still extant in 1819,however it was later built over; it was located just west of Lewes Road and to the south the Oak pub. The local landowner John Wells sold part of the land lying north of Widmore Road to housing developers in 1845, and by the late 1850s the area contained some 40 large properties, plus a number of smaller cottages. Further building work occurred in this area in 1888. The lands south of Widmore Road were historically part of Bromley Palace, but were built over with further housing in the 1920s-30s. Widmore today has merged completely with the surrounding suburbs and is often seen as part of Bickley. Amenities The area contains a small row of shops at Widmore Green (a rather small triangle of grass), at the junction of Widmore Road and Plaistow Lane. There is one pub here (The Oak) and four more located very close to each other along Palace Road/North Road/Freelands Road (The Red Lion, The White Horse, The Anglesey Arms, Freelands Tavern, and the Crown and Anchor).

History In 1400, Timur's forces invaded Armenia and Georgia, then they took Sivas, Malatya and Aintab. Later on, Timur's forces advanced towards Aleppo with caution, where they tended to construct a fortified camp each night as they approach the city. The Mamluks decided to fight an open battle outside the city walls. After two days of skirmishing, Timur's cavalry moved swiftly in arc shapes to attack the flanks of their enemy lines, while his center including elephants from India held firm. Fierce cavalry attacks forced the Mamluks led by Tamardash, governor of Aleppo, to break and flee towards the city gates. Afterwards, Timur took Aleppo, then he massacred many of the inhabitants, ordering the building of a tower of 20,000 skulls outside the city. Aftermath After the sack of Aleppo, Timur's forces went south where they took Hama, along with nearby Homs and Baalbek, until they reached Damascus which was also sacked after defeating Mamluk forces led by Nasir-ad-Din Faraj.

Both countries were founding member states of the Non-Aligned Movement. Two countries established formal diplomatic relations in 1954. First diplomatic documents were exchanged as early as 1947. Breakup of Yugoslavia, one of the founding and core members of the Non-Aligned Movement, brought into question the very existence of the Movement which was preserved only by politically pragmatic chairmanship of Indonesia. History Sukarno's visit to Postojna Cave, SR Slovenia (1960). President of Indonesia Ahmed Sukarno visited Yugoslavia on multiple occasions in 1956,1958,1960,1963 and 1964 while President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito visited Indonesia in 1958 and 1967. During Sukarno's first visit in 1958 Yugoslav diplomacy perceived its guest (earlier host of the Bandung Conference) as an invaluable dialogue partner in the context of the Pozna≈Ñ protests of 1956, Suez Crisis, President Tito meeting with Nikita Khrushchev and the meeteng between Tito, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser on Brijuni Islands. During the 1964 visit to Belgrade Yugoslav side voiced its concerns over the Indonesia's support of what Belgrade perceived the militant Chinese Communist views on how to settle world problems contrary to Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Contrary to some other non-aligned countries which during the breakup of Yugoslavia provided diplomatic support to Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Indonesia provided its primary support to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslav successor state with significant Muslim population affected by the Bosnian War. During the May 1998 riots of Indonesia which led to Fall of Suharto and subsequent end of Indonesian occupation of East Timor some analysts raised concerns that events may lead to dissolution of the country similar to violent breakup of Yugoslavia.

The earthquake sequence caused widespread damage in the Corinth‚ÄìAthens area, destroying nearly 8,000 houses and causing 20‚Äì22 deaths. Tectonic setting The Gulf of Corinth is an area of active extensional tectonics. The underlying cause of this extension has been attributed to rollback of the African Plate as it subducts northwards beneath the Aegean Plate. Other possible mechanisms include gravitational collapse of crust overthickened during the Paleogene to early Neogene or the affects of the continuing propagation of the North Anatolian Fault towards the southwest. The rift that formed the Gulf of Corinth is bounded by large normal faults that vary in their polarity (dip direction) along its length. The eastern end of the rift, which forms the Alkyonides Gulf, is dominated by north-dipping faults, including the Perachora, Straya, Skinos, Pisia, West Alkyonides and East Alkyonides faults. Immediately to the east the large south-dipping Kaparelli Fault forms the northern boundary to the onshore continuation of the rift zone. Earthquake sequence The first earthquake in the sequence occurred at 20:53 UTC on 24 February. It had a magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum felt intensity of IX (violent) on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale (MMI). The epicentre was at the western end of the Alkyonides Gulf and involved rupture of the Pisia Fault and possibly the Skinos Fault. The assignment of the observed surface ruptures to the first two earthquakes in the sequence remains uncertain as they occurred over the same night. The maximum measured offset on the Pisia Fault was 150 cm, while that on the Skinos Fault was 100 cm. The second earthquake occurred less than 6 hours later at 02:35 UTC on 25 February, with a magnitude of 6.4 , also with a maximum felt intensity of IX (MMI). The epicentre was in the central part of the Alkyonides Gulf and involved the rupture of the Skinos Fault and possibly the Pisia Fault. The final earthquake in the sequence occurred over ten days later at 21:58 UTC on 4 March, also with a magnitude of 6.4 and a maximum felt intensity of IX (MMI). The epicentre was just to the east of the Alkyonides Gulf and involved the rupture of the Kaparelli Fault, with a maximum observed displacement of 100 cm. Analysis of stress changes associated with the February 24 earthquake show increases on the fault segments that ruptured during the other two events. Damage The effects of the first two earthquakes are treated together due to their close spacing, with a single isoseismal map being produced. The area of violent shaking (level IX MMI) was along the southern coast of the Akyonides Gulf, with a much larger area experiencing severe shaking (level VIII MMI) extending from Xylokastro in the west to beyond Megara in the east, including the city of Corinth. The area of very strong shaking (level VII MMI) included Athens, with some parts of the city experiencing shaking of VIII to IX depending on ground conditions. The final earthquake also produced an area that experienced shaking of IX MMI, including the villages of Kalamaki and Plataies. The area of level VIII shaking included the city of Thebes. In total the earthquake sequence caused the destruction of 7,701 buildings (of which 1,175 were in Athens) with a further 20,954 being seriously affected (7,824 in Athens). Three administrative areas were affected, Attica, Beotia and Corinthia. The number of fatalities was in the range 20‚Äì22, with between a further 400 and 500 people injured. Both onshore and offshore areas were affected by landslides with one large underwater slump possibly the cause of the observed local tsunami. Liquefaction and ground fissures were reported from several areas.

The painting is representative for the new phase in Stoskopff's work, after he had settled again in his hometown after many years in Paris and demonstrated the extent of his art in his masterpiece from 1641, The Great Vanity. Stoskopff then concentrated on the pictorial rendition of the transparency and the fragility of glass, the reflections of light and contrasts in thickness among and between glasses, etc. These paintings were highly praised and sought after by collectors; Cardinal Richelieu himself owned one, although it is not known if it was MBA 1281. Still lifes depicting glassware had been pioneered by the painter Georg Flegel, but Stoskopff perfected the genre by concentrating essentially on the transparency and translucency. While MBA 1281 depicts luxury glassware, other paintings (examples below) sometimes depict ordinary drinking glasses.

It was probably caused by infected materials from a major epidemic in 1592‚Äì1593, and it was successfully contained after causing 40 to 45 deaths. Background At the time of the outbreak, Malta was ruled by the Order of St John. Between 1592 and 1593, a plague epidemic had killed about 3,000 people on the island. Outbreak The first cases of plague in this outbreak were detected in the capital Valletta, among family members of Paulus Emilius Ramadus, the Port Chief Sanitary Officer. It is suspected that the latter had handled refuse material from the 1592‚Äì1593 epidemic which might have been infected, causing the 1623 outbreak. The disease subsequently spread to a number of other households. Containment measures The Lazzaretto of Manoel Island (formerly Bishop's Island), a quarantine facility which was established in 1643 on the site where patients were isolated in the 1623 plague In the 1623 outbreak health authorities implemented strict measures which managed to successfully contain the spread of the disease. Sanitary Commissioners isolated people who had been infected and those who came in contact with them on Bishop's Island in Marsamxett Harbour. Houses of infected people were guarded, and restrictions were imposed on movement between Valletta and the rest of the island. Congregations were prohibited, and other containment measures included the banning of cloaks, which were believed to facilitate contact between people. Impact The outbreak caused the deaths of either 40 or 45 people.

He was inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame in 1999.  Early life and education  Harris was born in North Little Rock, Arkansas. He was the youngest of six children, and grew up on a 45-acre cotton farm without access to electricity. Every year he missed school during the harvest to pick cotton, and would have to study by candlelight. He became interested in insects as a child. He was a student at Pulaski County Training School, which was segregated at the time, and graduated wanting to become a airplane mechanic. Harris attended the Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, which was also segregated, where he was only given menial tasks. Harris was one of the first African-Americans to serve in the United States Marine Corps, enlisted under Executive Order 8802. Harris served as a Montford Point Marine. As the United States Army began to decrease its enrolment, a newly established G.I. Bill offered Harris and his sister the opportunity to attend college. Harris attended the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (then Arkansas A&M;), where he focussed on chemistry and zoology. When he graduated he could only find work as a janitor, so instead he left Arkansas on a cross-country Harley- Davidson adventure. He eventually found a job in Milwaukee, working in a foundry and studying the chemical composition of ores.  Research and career  Harris eventually moved to Minnesota, where he joined the United States Forest Service. Here he worked toward a graduate degree in entomology at the University of Minnesota, where he studied Cryptorhynchus weevils. He eventually returned to the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, where he was appointed a lecturer in science. In 1962 Harris moved to Hawaii, where he was recruited by Loren Steiner to join the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). He was one of the first African-American research scientists to work for the USDA. He spent almost four decades at the USDA, where he led the Biology and Ecology Research Unit. A few years after moving to Oahu Harris began a doctoral research programme, during which he studied population trends of Ceratitis capitata (Mediterranean fruit fly) at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa. Harris extensively studied Biosteres arisanus, a species of wasp that is parasitic for fruit fly eggs. Several nations adopted the use of the Harris strain of this wasp to eradicate fruit flies, including Chile, who have been fruit fly free since 1975. This success resulted in Harris being awarded a commendation from the government of Chile. His research formed the basis of California's Mediterranean fruit fly exclusion programme. Harris developed ways to rear Fopius arisanus, a parasite that was designed to attack Mediterranean fruit flies and melon fly. Despite retiring in 2006, Harris continued to work for the USDA in Honolulu until it closed in 2009.

The outbreak appeared in Kalkara and some cases were reported in ≈ªabbar and the urban area around the Grand Harbour. Restrictive measures were imposed and the outbreak was contained after causing 20 deaths. Background At the time of the outbreak, Malta was ruled by the Order of St John. In 1592‚Äì1593 a plague epidemic had killed about 3,000 people on the island and there was a small outbreak in 1623. Outbreak the eponymous village, where the first cases were reported In 1655 the plague was introduced to Malta through ships which had travelled from the Eastern Mediterranean to the island. They were anchored in Kalkara Creek, and the disease was first detected in a man from the village of Kalkara who had contact with them. The plague spread to other family members in ≈ªabbar, and physicians were informed of the possibility of a contagious disease. Some cases later appeared in the urban area around the Grand Harbour: in Valletta, Birgu, Senglea and Bormla. Containment measures A medical commission was set up to investigate when the outbreak was detected, and it concluded that the disease was contagious and recommended the setting up of containment measures. Those who were infected were isolated at the Lazzaretto on Bishop's Island and those who had been in contact with them were quarantined. Their house and its contents were burnt down, and a cordon sanitaire was imposed on the town of ≈ªabbar. When the disease appeared in the other Grand Harbour settlements, similar restrictions on movement were imposed and through these measures the outbreak was successfully contained. During the 1655 outbreak, contact between Malta and Sicily was limited due to restrictions imposed by the Viceroy of Sicily. Impact The outbreak caused the deaths of 20 people over a period of three months.

Biography  Terrane was the grandson of the French writer Georges Feydeau, and spent his childhood between the United Kingdom and France, before moving to the United States and obtaining American citizenship following his father's marriage with an American. At the age of 18 he returned to France to carry out his national service where he was promoted to the rank of sergeant, in 1935 he was discharged for medical reasons. He set up home in the town of Barbizon (Seine-et-Marne, France) 60 km from Paris where he became a chicken farmer. In 1937, during a trip to New York he met the actress Drue Leyton whom he married in 1938 in London. In 1939, Terrane and Leyton returned to live in Barbizon and with the help of the French director and producer Roland Tual he became an actor and starred in Jacques Feyder's film La Loi du Nord alongside Mich√®le Morgan.  World War II  The couple were vacationing in the town of Cassis in the south of France when the Second World War broke out. They returned to Paris where Terrane tried in vain to join the French armed forces. Owing to bronchial problems he was declared unfit for service three times for the French army. However his English language skills allowed him to serve as a liaison officer with the British army's Coldstream Guards. Terrane wished to take an active part in the war and managed to convince the French army that he was a Norwegian translator despite not speaking a word of the language and was sent to join the French Foreign Legion as part of expeditionary corps commanded by General B√©thouart. He was promoted to sergeant major and distinguished himself by organising the unloading of ammunition from a small boat under enemy fire. He was mentioned in dispatches for this act of bravery. After this operation he was stationed in England when the armistice between France and Germany was announced on 22 June 1940. Terrane immediately signed up to the Free French Forces and was sent to the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion with a promotion to adjudant. He boarded the Westernland along with Charles de Gaulle to participate in Battle of Dakar where it is reported he fought in a boxing match on deck against the European champion Francis Jacques. He participated in the East African campaign fighting with the 1st Free French Division as a motorcycle reconnaissance notably during the battles to take the towns of Keren and Massawa in Eritrea in April 1941. At the end of April the division sailed on the cruise-liner Paul Doumer, to join a camp in Qastina, Palestine in preparation for the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign. On the June 8 he became one of the first to cross the Syrian border, on June 18 he obtained the surrender of a Vichy military unit which was carrying a white flag of truce and whilst returning to his motorcycle was shot in the back. He was taken to hospital in Damascus where he died two days later, and was buried in Ramleh, Syria. The telegram signed by de Gaulle on 2 August 1941 informing of his death reads \\"Adjutant Legion Jacques Tarti√®re bless√© neuf [sic] juin au cours mission p√©rilleuse reconnaissance ex√©cut√©e avec bravoure d√©c√©d√© h√¥pital Sarafand Palestine suite blessure STOP a gagn√© admiration de tous par courage et r√©signation sort fatal\\" ().  Family  His half-brother, Philippe Keun, also joined the French Foreign Legion at the outset of the war and then went on to become an agent for the Secret Intelligence Service. He was betrayed and captured by the Gestapo and hung at the concentration camp of Buchenwald. His wife Drue Leyton was also a member of the French Resistance and assisted allied airmen shot down in France to escape. She was captured and sent to a concentration camp but managed to escape by feigning cancer. His uncle Thierry de Martel who was the chief surgeon at the American Hospital in Neuilly on the outskirts of Paris committed suicide on June 14 1940 as he could not stand the idea of living under nazi occupation.

Seized by the Red Army and taken to Leningrad as war reparations, his collection is still housed at the Hermitage Museum in that city. Life Born to a physics teacher (later a professor) in Wiesbaden, he studied at Berlin's Polytechnikum before studying philosophy in Zurich, where he completed his thesis in 1897. He then became commercial director of Rudolf Otto Meyer's firm in Hamburg, before in 1906 setting u pa new business (Strebelwerke) in Mannheim which in time became among the best boiler manufacturers in Germany, particularly of steam boilers Andrea Pophanken, Felix Billeter, Die Moderne und ihre Sammler, Akademie-Verlag, 2001, p. 288. His business success was due to engineer Joseph Strebel's 1903 discovery of building backward-flow steam boilers (Gegenstromgliederkessel-D.R.P. Nr. 76582). He became wealthy enough to start collecting in the 1920s, mainly buying works in Paris, especially from the art dealers Durand-Ruel and Bernheim-Jeune. In 1917 he bought an estate in Holzdorf, a small village to the south of Weimar which he had got to know en route between his main factory in Mannheim and others in Bohemia and German Silesia. Building a holiday home there, he moved there permanently around 1930, using its reception rooms to house his art collection as well as Gobelins tapesteries. He died of cancer at Holzdorf, leaving much of his estate to a foundation for cancer research which is now part of the University of Heidelberg's medical faculty and the house and grounds to his mistress and wife, the pianist Frieda Kwast-Hodapp. It was occupied by the Soviet Army staff after the Allied victory and the building's collections were taken to Leningrad as war reparations in 1947 Brosch√ºre: Landgut Holzdorf - Bildung, Erholung, Betreuung.

Watkins founded the company N.T. Technology in the 1990s to support a Japanese pornography website he created while he was enlisted in the United States Army. After leaving the Army to focus on the company, Watkins moved to the Philippines. He began providing domain and hosting services to 8chan in 2014, and became the site's official owner and operator the same year. Watkins became the operator of 2channel after he seized it in 2014 from its creator and original owner, Hiroyuki Nishimura. Some journalists and conspiracy theory researchers believe that Watkins knows the identity of, or that he himself is, \\"Q\\", the person or group of people behind the QAnon conspiracy theory. In 2020, Watkins created the \\"Disarm the Deep State\\" super PAC to support political candidates who promote QAnon.  Early life  James Arthur Watkins was born in Dayton, Washington, and grew up on a family farm in Mukilteo, Washington. His mother worked for Boeing and his father worked for a phone company. Watkins joined the United States Army in 1982 when he was 18 years old, and served until 1998 or 1999. Over his time in the Army he worked as a helicopter mechanic and recruiter; he reached the rank of sergeant first class in 1994. The Army sent him to a technology school in Virginia in 1987, where he learned about computers and the early Internet.  Career  In 1998, while still enlisted, Watkins created a website for Japanese pornography called \\"Asian Bikini Bar\\". By hosting it in the United States, he was able to circumvent strict Japanese censorship of pornography. He later renamed the venture \\"N.T. Technology\\", which according to Watkins was a meaningless acronym meant to make pornography purchases less conspicuous on credit card statements. N.T. Technology, which is based in Reno, Nevada, initially sold advertising, and later also sold web hosting services to other Japanese adult entertainment websites that couldn't be hosted in Japan. In 1998 or 1999, during the dot-com boom, Watkins left the army to focus on N.T. Technology. Watkins has owned or been involved with many business ventures. He owned an organic food restaurant in Manila, Philippines, which is now closed. In 2005, Watkins opened a Manila-based software business called Race Queen, which has subsequently been listed as the employer on Philippine work visas for several employees of Watkins'. Watkins also runs the Manila-based business Loki Technology. He has been involved with a book narration company called books.audio. He has also created a news organization called The Goldwater, whose content has been described by The Washington Post as \\"notably conspiratorial and amateurish\\". He is listed as the chairman of the board of a company called Emerald Pedistal, which sells piglets.  Online anonymous communities = 8chan  8chan is an imageboard website known for hosting extreme alt-right and racist content, for being a forum for child pornography, for its role in the Gamergate controversy, and for its links to multiple mass shootings. The site was founded in October 2013 by Fredrick Brennan. After 4chan's founder, Christopher \\"moot\\" Poole, banned discussion related to Gamergate in September 14, Brennan began advertising 8chan as a \\"free speech friendly 4chan alternative\\". The site took off‚ÄîBrennan said in an interview with Ars Technica that the site experienced over 4,000 posts an hour that month, a major increase from around 100 posts per hour prior to the 4chan rule change. Brennan found it increasingly difficult to keep up with the server costs of the growing site, and the site experienced frequent downtime as multiple internet service providers denied service due to the site's objectionable content. Watkins' son, Ron Watkins, told his father about the website after learning of it from an Al Jazeera America documentary about Brennan. The elder Watkins contacted Brennan to offer a partnership, under the condition that Brennan come to the Philippines to work for him. Brennan trusted Watkins because he knew he operated 2channel, though at the time he was unaware of the claim that Watkins had stolen the site from its founder. Brennan agreed to work for Jim Watkins, and in 2014 moved to Manila in the Philippines to join him. Watkins, via N.T. Technology, began offering domain name services and hardware to host 8chan in 2014 into 2015, and Brennan continued to be responsible for the site's software development and community management. In 2014, Watkins became the official owner and operator of 8chan. Brennan remained the site administrator until 2016, at which time he relinquished the role. Wired magazine reported he left the position due to stress, others have attributed his departure to Brennan growing disgusted with the site and its contents, and asking to be reassigned to work elsewhere. Brennan stopped working on and posting at 8chan, continuing instead to work for Watkins on the 2channel project. Ron Watkins took up the site administrator role following Brennan's resignation. In 2018, Brennan cut ties with the Watkins family, alleging that Jim Watkins had shown up at his home and berated him for asking to take time off. Brennan has since become an outspoken critic of 8chan and of Watkins, and has actively battled to try to keep the site offline. In 2019, the perpetrators of the March Christchurch mosque shootings, the April Poway synagogue shooting, and the August El Paso shooting both used 8chan to disseminate their respective manifestos. The site was removed from the clearnet shortly after the August shooting due to suspensions of service from multiple providers, and did not return until November 2019. In August 2019, the United States House Committee on Homeland Security called Watkins to testify about 8chan's efforts to address \\"the proliferation of extremist content, including white supremacist content\\". The next month, Watkins traveled to Washington, D.C. for congressional questioning. The Philippines National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and National Police (PNP) also launched investigations into Watkins and 8chan in August 2019 in relation to the shootings. , the NBI's investigation was closed and their findings were turned over to the PNP; the PNP's investigation was still open but had not resulted in charges against Watkins. Watkins has attempted to earn money through 8chan, although the website has never been profitable. Posters on the website can pay, using a cryptocurrency created by Ron Watkins, to have their posts listed prominently through a program called \\"King of the Shekel\\". In a 2019 interview, The Washington Post asked if the name was antisemitic; Watkins hung up on them. In October 2019, Watkins filed a cyberlibel case against Brennan for tweeting that Watkins was \\"senile\\" and that 8chan's moderators were \\"incompetent\\". Cyberlibel is a crime in the Philippines that can be punished with time in prison. Brennan has said that Watkins filed the suit to try to intimidate and punish him. On February 26, 2020, a Philippines court issued an arrest warrant for Brennan based on the complaint. Brennan, who has brittle bone disease, has said that because of his medical condition and the notoriously poor conditions in the Bureau of Immigration Bicutan Detention Center, arrest by the Philippine authorities would likely result in his death. Brennan fled the Philippines hours before the warrant was issued, taking a different flight to avoid authorities who were looking for him at the airport. He has been fighting the warrant from the United States. In March 2020, the court suspended the case pending the outcome of an appeal by Brennan to the Philippines Department of Justice.  2channel  2channel is a textboard website that is extremely popular in Japan, particularly among the very right-wing netto-uyoku. It was created in 1999 by Hiroyuki Nishimura, and is the predecessor to all other \\"chan\\" sites including 4chan and 8chan. Nishimura was believed to be making $1million a year from advertising and premium memberships to 2channel in 2008. He hosted the site on N.T. Technology's servers. After a 2013 data breach exposed user credit card data, Watkins seized the 2channel domain in 2014, and took full control of the website and assumed the role of site administrator. He has continued to run the website since, renaming it to 5channel in October 2017 to avoid potential trademark litigation from Nishimura, who owns the \\"2channel\\" trademark. Watkins has claimed he seized the 2channel domain because the loss of revenue from the data breach made Nishimura unable to pay hosting costs. Nishimura has claimed that he paid Watkins in full, and that Watkins' seizure of the domain constitutes domain hijacking.  QAnon  QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles running a global child sex-trafficking ring is plotting against President Donald Trump, who is battling them. The theory has been promulgated by a mysterious person or group of people called \\"Q\\", who originally posted on 4chan but later moved to posting on 8chan. Q has said they will never post outside of 8chan. Numerous journalists and conspiracy theory researchers believe that Watkins is working with Q, knows Q's identity, or that Watkins himself is Q. When 8chan was taken off the internet in August 2019 following three mass shootings, Q stopped posting; when it came back online in November, Q reappeared. Some researchers believe that Q's choice to wait for 8chan to come back online rather than posting elsewhere demonstrates that Watkins is behind the Q account. QAnon researcher Marc-Andre Argentino said in March 2020 that based on an analysis of Q's posts, he believes Watkins has been posting as Q since autumn 2019. Also in March 2020, QAnon researcher Mike Rothschild said, \\"It would be very easy for the Q poster to use another forum or provide a cryptographic key to prove his authenticity on some other site, but instead they wait to post on this rickety version of 8chan. The only reason to keep Q on 8chan is because Watkins is personally connected to him.\\" Fredrick Brennan quoted in The Atlantic in June 2020 said, \\"I definitely, definitely, 100 percent believe that Q either knows Jim or Ron Watkins, or was hired by Jim or Ron Watkins.\\" In an interview on a September 2020 episode of the podcast Reply All, Brennan explained that he believes the Q account was originally operated by someone else, but that Watkins and his son took control of the persona, most likely around December 2017. PJ Vogt of Reply All has said he discussed Brennan's theory with other journalists who write about Q, and that \\"some of them think it's likely, everyone agrees it's more than plausible\\". Watkins has denied knowledge of Q's identity, as has his son, Ron Watkins. When Watkins testified before the United States House Committee on Homeland Security in September 2019, he wore a QAnon pin. In February 2020, Watkins formed a super PAC called \\"Disarm the Deep State\\", which backs political candidates who support the QAnon conspiracy theory. Watkins is listed as the group's treasurer. Benjamin Barr, an attorney who has represented Watkins in the past and who is known for his involvement with the American right-wing activist group Project Veritas, is also helping with the super PAC. , the super PAC had raised less than $4,000 and spent less than $500. Media Matters for America noted in April 2020 that the super PAC was buying advertisements from Watkins to place on the 8chan website, and that it was one of the only groups advertising on the site. A QAnon researcher named Mike Rains said of Watkins and Q, \\"Watkins always made it seem like there was distance between him and Q, that Q was just this guy posting on his forums, that he let Q post because he's a free speech absolutist. By launching this PAC he is fully admitting that he is working with whoever is posting as Q and he is now part of the grift that is QAnon.\\"  Personal life  In October 2001, Watkins traveled to Manila in the Philippines and married his wife, Liezel, three weeks after arriving. Watkins began moving to the Philippines in 2004, and started living there permanently in 2007. Watkins splits his time between a pig farm outside of Manila and a condominium in the city. In January 2020, the Investigations Division of the Philippines Bureau of Immigration (BI) designated Watkins an \\"undesirable alien\\". According to ABC News, this is an administrative (not criminal) determination that a person is a \\"risk to the public interest\\", and although it indicates a person is able to be deported, it is up to the commissioner of the bureau whether to pursue deportation. The immigration records obtained by ABC News noted that Watkins \\"is the owner and operator of 8chan, a hate filled forum/website which hosts trolling and serves as go-to resource for violent extremists and white supremacists\\". According to Watkins' brother-in-law, Watkins sold his pig farm and in August 2020 he returned to the United States. If he does not return to the Philippines by January 31, 2021 to appeal the BI's designation, he will be denied reentry to the country. Watkins has a son, Ronald \\"Ron\\" Watkins, who serves as 8chan's site administrator. Watkins' interests include yoga and fountain pens, and he has recorded videos on YouTube under the name \\"Watkins Xerxes\\" about these subjects. He also uses his YouTube channel to sing hymns, read Bible verses, commend President Donald Trump, and allude to QAnon conspiracy theories by warning against the \\"deep state\\".

There seems to be a debate among some religious scholars in the Russosphere on whether ALLATRA is a religious organization, with some researchers classify ALLATRA as a new religious movement with characteristics of syncreticism, Apocalypticism, Pan-Slavism, New Thought and New Age.  History  In the 2000s, a series of books of spiritual and esoteric nature by a self-published author under the pseudonym Anastasia Novykh (Russian: –ê–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∞—Å–∏—è –ù–æ–≤—ã—Ö) appeared in Ukraine, written in the Russian language. In 2011, in Kyiv, members of a public organization, who promoted a movement of readers of these books, founded the Lagoda International Public Organization. In 2013, AllatRa, the main book of Novykh, was self-published by the ALLATRA publishing house. The ALLATRA International Public Movement was formally registered in July 2014 by the Lagoda organization, the ALLATRA publishing house and active participants in the movement.  Teachings  Nikolas Roerich, a Russian Imperial-era theosophist inspired by Tibetan mythology, introduced a mythical character named Rigden Djappo to the Russosphere and attributed to it the title of King of Shambhala. He considered him the savior who would appear at the end time. The Rigden Djappo character was invoked by Anastasia Novykh in the 2000s to co-narrate the book \\"ALLATRA \\", the main source of spiritual knowledge of the ALLATRA organization. Igor Mikhailovich Danilov, a chiropractor whose office was close to Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, is considered by the ALLATRA organization to be the spiritual leader of the movement and the embodiment of Rigden Djappo. ALLATRA emphasizes a Pan-Slavic ideal that the unification of the world on a single spiritual basis would begin with the unification of the Slavic peoples, and that the leadership of Moscow would play an important role in the future battle of good and evil. Because of this, in the media there were opposite speculations about the involvement of the movement with Russian and Ukrainian secret services.  Notability  Since ALLATRA's re-registration in Ukraine in 2014, Ukrainian sources, critical of the movement, reported extensive online and billboard advertisement campaigns in Ukrainian cities. These included forging agreements with Ukrainian mayors and city officials and were successful in gaining growing groups of followers. A 2016 article on –†–µ–ª—ñ–≥—ñ—è –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ (Ukrainian: Religion in Ukraine), a Ukrainian-language website that specializes in religions in Ukraine, described ALLATRA as a \\"pro-Russian sect of Putin's supporters\\", a view shared by Jan Cemper, editor-in-chief of the Manipul√°to≈ôi.cz. ALLATRA books, fliers, advertisements and conferences have been reported across the United States, Germany, Czechia, Turkey, and different parts of the world. Citations to ALLATRA works were found in academic publications of universities in Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Poland and Iraq. In 2017, the Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ‚Äì Kiev Patriarchate had \\"condemned the activities\\" of ALLATRA, alleging that its activities were facilitated by the Kiyv Pechersk Lavra run by the rival Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate. Marina Tsvigun, a rival Ukrainian religious leader, as well as other rival Slavic Native Faith movements, also criticized ALLATRA's teachings. In 2019, the Russian Federal Security Service reported that it had thwarted what it described as Anti-Semite terrorism plans in Taganrog, Russia by a group allegedly associated with ALLATRA and named Union of the World Liberation Movement for People's Brotherhood and Union of the peoples of the sun and the peoples of the crescent. The group was described as an extremist Ukrainian nationalist group. The Chelyabinsk Eparchy of the Russian Orthodox Church condemned these alleged activities. In 2019, Robby Wells of the United States' Democratic Party announced in a 2019 ALLATRA conference that he was running for president of the United States inspired by ALLATRA principles. He eventually did not meet the minimum criteria to be a major candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

The group will represent singles players in the top 500 and doubles players in the top 200 of the ATP Rankings. It was founded by players who had previously been members of the Association of Tennis Professionals Players Council. Members of the PTPA include Novak Djokovic, the outgoing president of the Council, and Vasek Pospisil, the pair will initially serve as co-presidents of the PTPA for a two-year period. The Association will be governed by a board of trustees of nine members, to be elected annually.  Response  Milos Raonic stated his intention to join the group. Raonic has expressed his displeasure with Andrea Gaudenzi, the chairman of the ATP on the body's handling of the COVID crisis. Speaking after his semi-final win at the Cincinnati Western & Southern Open held in New York due to the pandemic, Raonic is quoted as saying: > ‚ÄúPlayers have had plenty of time to think and reflect and take a look at > certain parts which they may not be happy with and discuss...A lot of us > were kept in the dark by our leadership for six months. We were disappointed > with many things. I voiced my opinion on many things, such as ... executives > in other sports taking pay cuts to support us. As tennis players, we weren‚Äôt > making a dime for months and months. ... Lower guys weren‚Äôt making a dime,\\" > Raonic said. \\"But our executives were staying home and didn‚Äôt feel it > necessary to take any pay cuts. I pushed for that on every single phone call > we had‚Äù. Gaudenzi was critical of the PTPA and said that \\"You have what other athletes in other sports would strive for ‚Äî a seat at the boardroom table. That is what players fought for in the creation of the ATP Tour...It makes no sense why you would be better served by shifting your role from the inside to the outside of the governance structure\\". Pospisil said in a statement that it was \\"very difficult, if not impossible, to have any significant impact on any major decisions made by our tour\\" and that \\"Our voices will finally be heard and we will soon have an impact on decisions that affect our lives and livelihoods\\". In response the ATP and the WTA, the four Grand Slam tournaments and the International Tennis Federation released a statement in support of the ATP and said that \\"It is a time for even greater collaboration, not division; a time to consider and act in the best interests of the sport, now and for the future...When we work together, we are a stronger sport\\". The PTPA has drawn the opposition of players including Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the former writing on Twitter: \\"It is time for unity, not for separation. These are moments where big things can be achieved as long as the world of tennis is united\\". Andy Murray meanwhile argued that while he is \\"not totally against a player union\\", the WTA should be on its board and the current ATP management \\"should be given some time to implement their vision\\". As the ATP is the representative of both players and tournaments, a greater degree of autonomy for players is sought by the members of the PTPA. According to proponents of the new association, the current structure makes having decisions in the best interests of the players difficult, given the conflicting and complex interests of tournaments, Grand Slam bodies and the International Tennis Federation. The PTPA said in a document that the goal of their organisation was \\"not to replace\\" the ATP but to \\"provide players with a self-governance structure that is independent from the ATP and is directly responsive to player-members needs and concerns\\". This is not the first time that professional tennis players have called for a players' only union or body. Former world number 1, Andy Roddick, tweeted on 29 August in response to the news, \\"It‚Äôs almost like someone should have said something a decade ago\\" https://twitter.com/andyroddick/status/1299718069863022592?s=20.

In modern usage it refers to an oil, garlic and cheese sauce served with eggplant casserole. Almadrote may have pre-Inquisition Sephardic origins and served with eggplant has become widespread in modern Turkish cuisine. Earlier recipes for almodrote may date recipes for a type of green sauce called moretum (believed to be the etymological origin of almodrote) in the Apicius, or it may be of Arabic etymology. Concerning the latter, the evidence is based on modern lexicographical studies; it's not used for any of the sauces found in the 13th-century Andalusian cookbook, but may be derived from the Arabic term alma·π≠r√∫q meaning to pound. During the Inquisition in the late 15th-century Fray Gon√ßalo Bringuylla was reported to have eaten \\"eggplant with almadrote\\".

The beds are tabular and locally cross-stratified and include occasional thinly bedded mudstone. Sandstone grains are subrounded and frosted. The formation also contains numerous white to light greenish gray volcanic ash beds. The total thickness is .

It was named for exposures along Arroyo Ojito near Cerro Conejo, a small hill northwest of Albuquerque. Arroyo Ojito was also designated as the type locality (no type section defined). Tedford and Barghoon recommended that the Cerro Conejo Member be reassigned to the Arroyo Ojito Formation, since there was a significant unconformity (corresponding to a hiatus in sediment deposition of 1 to 1.6 Ma) separating the Cerro Conejo from the rest of the Zia Formation. In 2007, Williams and Cole recommended that the Arroyo Ojito Formation be abandoned, because the name was being used inconsistently and because the formation straddled a significant region unconformityWilliams and Cole 2007, p.11 since named the Rincones paleosurface.Connell 2008, p.15 They promoted the Ceja Member, which lay above the Rincones paleosurface, to formation rank, and moved the remaining members of the Arroyo Ojito into an informal \\"Middle Red\\" formation, recalling the earliest subdivisions of the Santa Fe Group.

Teixeira was part of a development team that also included Urban Creek Partners and Pollack Shores Real Estate Group, which announced that they would be responsible for the development's residential portions. Initial plans for the development saw it covering approximately of land near Bellwood Quarry, and would include 850 residences, a 300 room hotel, and over of office space. Construction was expected to start by the end of 2018. However, by September 2018, the expected start for construction had been moved back to the second quarter of 2019. That same month, it was announced that the first phase of construction would cover at a cost of $400 million and would see the adaptive reuse of two preexisting buildings at the site. The first phase would see the creation of of office space and of retail. By August 2019, the expected groundbreaking had again been pushed back to November of that year. In July 2019, the developers elicited some controversy over a brochure created for the project that showed a group of only white Americans in a conference room with \\"A Community Created For The New Atlanta\\" overlaid. The ad was criticized as a depiction of gentrification, with Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms stating that the brochure was \\"poorly executed.\\" Following the controversy, the developers revised the brochure. On September 1, 2020, Teixeira and the developers sold the development for $127 million, with Teixeira announcing that the new developers would likely incorporate more affordable housing into the project. While the identity of the buyers was initially kept undisclosed, the buyers were eventually revealed to be affiliated with Microsoft, though not affiliated with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Speaking to Atlanta's NPR affiliate, residents in the neighborhood expressed some surprise and concern over the sale and the intent of the new buyers with the property.

Finland differed from most of Europe in that an uncommonly large part of the accused were men, which was it had in common with the witch trials in Iceland.Ankarloo, Bengt & Henningsen, Gustav (ed.), Skrifter. Bd 13, H√§xornas Europa 1400-1700: historiska och antropologiska studier. Stockholm: Nerenius & Sant√©rus, 1987 History Much material is missing from the documentation of the local courts as well as from Turku, and the numbers for witch trials are therefore unknown. Preserved documentation states that 710 witch trials took place in Finland between 1520 and 1699, resulting in 115 death sentences. During this period, Finland was a part of Sweden and under Swedish law. Sorcery was criminalized in Sweden‚ÄìFinland in the County Law of 1350, which stated death penalty for sorcery only if it had been combined with murder (maleficium), and until the mid 17th century, the sorcery cases were only one or two annually and very rarely resulted in a death penalty. During the 17th- century, however, the interpretation of the law became more severe under the influence of Biblical law, and the definition of sorcery as witchcraft and a Pact with Satan became more common. The witch trials In contrast to most other European countries except Iceland, the majority of those executed for sorcery in Finland was male: of 641 people accused for sorcery in Finland, 325 was women, but of the 277 executed for witchcraft, 133 was men. A reason for this was the fact that in Finland, the traditional profession of a folk healer or cunning folk and the practice of magic were attributed to men more often than women, and that this category was the most common target of the witch trials. The typical Finnish witch trial was that of a well known cunning man accused by a private person of having harmed livestock or food by use of magic. The largest witch trials in Finland were those of √Öland in the 1660s, and those in √ñsterbotten in 1674‚Äì1678, when between 157 and 200 people were charged, of which at least 41 were executed. This witch hunt was heavily influenced by the witch hunt conducted in Sweden at the time and differed from ordinary Finnish witch trials as they involved the Pact with Satan, the Witches' Sabbath and the child witnesses who claimed to have been abducted by the witches, and the majority of executed was female, none of which was otherwise common in Finland. Discontinuation Similarly to Sweden, persecutions and death sentences for witchcraft next to died out after the big witch hunt of the 1670s. While the accusations and the witch trials as such were common in Finland also after this‚Äî22 people were in fact charged in 1693‚Äì1697‚Äîthe legal courts were unwilling to issue a death sentence for sorcery after 1678 and a confession of sorcery was often interpreted as a sign of insanity.

He was responsible for initiating the internal Adam style decor and 18th century furnishing of a rare example of an early 17th century mock Jacobean castellated hunting lodge and extensive grounds he had inherited from his father. Weld also came to prominence due to his exposure in two separate legal cases which could have terminated his good standing by challenging his manhood in an ecclesiastical impotency trial and in the latter case, risked his liberty, if not his life, on account of an alleged involvement in the Jacobite rising of 1745. Both cases against him were dismissed. Background Weld was descended from Sir Humphrey Weld, a merchant whose family were seated in Shropshire, and Sheriff of London in 1599, who was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1608. Edward was the third and first surviving son of Humphrey Weld (died 1722) of Lulworth, (grandnephew of MP, Humphrey Weld, purchaser in 1641 of the vast Lulworth Estate who died without a male heir), and of his wife Margaret Simeons, daughter of Sir James Simeons of Chilworth nr. Oxford. Weld succeeded to his father in 1722. On coming of age he was the fourth generation of Welds to take charge of the vast estate with its portion of the magnificent Jurassic Coast (today a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Architectural designer Turner's view of Lulworth Castle, Dorset Edward Weld ensured, through a project lasting thirty years, that Lulworth Castle (today a Scheduled monument and Grade I listed building), attributed to Inigo Jones, and its interiors were decorated and furnished to the highest taste and standards by engaging the reputable Dorset firm of architects, Bastard brothers of Blandford Forum.'Lulworth, East', in An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in Dorset, Volume 2, South east (London, 1970), pp. 144-151. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/rchme/dorset/vol2/pp144-151 [accessed 31 August 2020].Legg, Polly. 'The Bastards of Blandford: an inventory of their losses in the fire of 1731‚Äô, Furniture History, Vol. 30 (1994), 15‚Äì42 (p. 21 & n. 24). Weld also continued laying out the extensive grounds, begun by his father, extending the castle's southern balustraded terrace and erecting a walled garden. Impotency trial Albeit a practising Roman Catholic, as a member of the gentry Weld took care to maintain good relations with his peers and was esteemed in the county and beyond for his \\"amiable character\\". His performance as a landowner laid the foundations of an apparently lasting legacy. In 1727 young Weld married nineteen year old Catherine Elizabeth Aston (1708-1739), daughter of Walter Aston, 4th Lord Aston of Forfar and Lady Mary Howard, daughter of Lord Thomas Howard and Mary Savile, sister of Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk. After three years there was no issue. Weld became the subject of a sensational lawsuit taken out by his wife, Catherine, in the ecclesiastical Arches Court at Canterbury on the grounds of non-consummation of their marriage, in effect accusing him of impotence. Having consulted a range of surgeons in London, and undergone a simple surgical procedure, Weld successful countersued. The couple resolved to live apart, until her death in 1739. The report of the lawsuit published quickly in 1732 by the pseudonymous Crawfurd was itself an early form of cashing in on sensationalising the detail of a distressing intimate situation for at least one of the parties. Family life In 1740 he married secondly Dame Mary Theresa Vaughan of Courtfield in Monmouthshire, with whom he had a daughter and four sons, the eldest of whom was Edward Weld, future husband of Maria Fitzherbert, and the youngest, Thomas Weld (of Lulworth), with his wife Mary Stanley, father of fifteen children, a noted philanthropist and personal friend of George III whom he entertained at Lulworth.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, Volume 2. H. Colburn, 1847. pp. 1545-6 view on line Their eldest grandson was Cardinal Thomas Weld.Pollen, John Hungerford. \\"Weld.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 18 January 2019 \\"Treason trial\\" In 1745 Weld was accused of being associated, possibly on account of his then unpopular faith, with the then Jacobite rising raging in Scotland and northern counties of England where he had kin, in a letter allegedly found on the road to Poole. He was taken into custody and hauled before the magistrates who, on examination, deemed the letter to be a hoax. The case against him was dismissed, but he was obliged to surrender his coach horses, on account of their strength and size, as potentially useful equipment to rebels. Such was the hostility and risk to Catholics at that time, however influential and well connected they might be, to clear his name Weld also had to have a personal interview in London with the Duke of Newcastle, older brother and minister of the then Prime Minister, Henry Pelham, after which the matter was apparently dropped. Upon his death at the age of 56, Weld, by then widowed a second time, received many tributes including eulogies in verse. Legacy As Catholic members of the English gentry in the Age of Enlightenment, Edward and his second wife, Mary, chose to have their three surviving sons educated by exiled English Jesuits who ran a network of colleges in Catholic Europe. Accordingly, Edward, John and Thomas were despatched to the Colleges of St Omer, Bruges and Li√®ge in the Spanish Netherlands, where their relatives, the Simeon Welds had settled, and which aside from providing a good education, prepared them for the Grand Tour with social openings in the power centres of Paris and Rome. These connections would later feature prominently in the life of their son Thomas and his descendants' lives, by enabling the repatriation, after over two hundred years, of the English Jesuits to Stonyhurst College donated to them by Thomas, and the Welds' continuous connections with French religious and surviving members of the French royal family. Thomas' subtle influence may have eased the passage of the Catholic Relief Act 1791, (Thomas was a supporter of bishop John Milner), eventually leading to Catholic emancipation. While their sons were being schooled abroad, first Mary died in 1754 followed by the middle son, John in 1759 and finally by Edward himself late in 1761. Lulworth Castle in 2013 Edward's grandfather, William Weld, reclaiming Lulworth after its forcible occupation by Roundheads in the English Civil War, came close to insolvency. It was saved mainly through the dowry brought in by Edward's mother, Margaret Simeons, and later by Edward's own skills, which set it on a course to prosper for two centuries in the hands of the Weld family. In 1929, however, during the tenure of Herbert Weld Blundell, Lulworth castle was completely gutted by fire. Edward's and all subsequent improvements to the eighteenth century Adam style interiors, furnishings and pictures, including the magnificent library, were lost, except for a quantity of valuable pictures, books and furniture which were rescued with the help of two teams of Girl Guides who happened to be camping in the park. Fortuitously, a photographic and documentary record of the castle had been made in 1926 by the publication, Country Life. The castle lay a derelict ruin for seventy years until one of Edward's descendants, Wilfrid Weld, undertook a painstaking restoration in partnership with Historic England to bring it to its current status as a museum.Newth, John. \\"One of Dorset‚Äôs grandest and most interesting country houses - The history of Lulworth Castle is bound up with the stories of the Weld family and of one of the most important estates in South Dorset.

Completed and commissioned in 1942, she served in World War II, operating in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean and supporting Japanese forces in the New Guinea campaign and the Guadalcanal campaign before she was sunk in March 1944. Construction and commissioning I-32 was laid down on 20 January 1940 by at the Sasebo Navy Yard at Sasebo, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 145. She had been renamed I-39 by the time she was launched on 17 December 1940. Renamed I-32 on 1 November 1941, she was completed and commissioned on 26 April 1942. Service history Upon commissioning, I-32 was attached to the Kure Naval District. On 30 May 1942, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in Submarine Squadron 1 in the 6th Fleet. She departed Kure on 16 June 1942 and proceeded to Truk. First war patrol On 30 June 1942, I-32 set out from Truk on her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area off Australia. She conducted a reconnaissance of Port Vila on Efate in the New Hebrides on 9 July 1942 and of New Caledonia between 13 and 15 July 1942. She then passed around the south of Australia. She was in the Indian Ocean south-southeast of Esperance, Western Australia, on 4 August 1942 when she surfaced at around 19:10 and attacked the Australian armed troop transport Katoomba with gunfire. Katoomba, which was on a voyage from Fremantle, Western Australia, to Adelaide, South Australia, transmitted a distress signal and returned fire while attempting to escape at flank speed. I-32 pursued her for thee hours before giving up the chase, having scored no hits on Katoomba. I-32 concluded her patrol with her arrival on 28 August 1942 at George Town on Penang Island in Japanese-occupied British Malaya. She left Penang on 6 September 1942 and proceeded to Truk, which she reached on 18 September 1942. Second war patrol With a Yokosuka E14Y1 (Allied reporting name \\"Glen\\") floatplane embarked, I-32 got underway from Truk on 30 September 1942 to begin her second war patrol nd was reassigned to the 2nd Picket Unit day. Her patrol area was in the vicinity of New Caledonia, and she was tasked to launch her plane on 17 October 1942 to make a reconnaissance flight over Noum√©a. On 3 October 1942, she was reassigned to the 1st Picket Unit, but she developed a diesel fuel leak soon afterward and received orders to abort her patrol and return to Truk, where she called from 6 to 7 October 1942 before getting back underway bound for Kure, which she reached on 13 October 1942. She underwent repairs at Kure. New Guinea campaign, December 1942‚ÄìJanuary 1943 With her repairs complete, I-32 left Kure on 4 December 1942 bound for Truk, then got underway from Truk on 14 December 1942 making for Rabaul on New Britain. During her voyage, she was submerged in the Bismarck Sea off the Admiralty Islands on 16 December 1942 when she detected a surfaced Allied submarine at 22:00 and began an approach, but the submarine dived before she could attack. She arrived at Rabaul on 17 December 1942. Upon arrival at Rabaul, I-32 was assigned to Submarine Group B, and she began a series of supply runs to New Guinea to support Japanese forces fighting in the New Guinea campaign. Carrying a cargo of 22 tons of food and ammunition, she departed Rabaul on her first run on 19 December 1942, arrived off the Mambare River estuary at Buna on the coast of New Guinea on 24 december 1942, got back underway the same day after unloading her cargo, and returned to Rabaul on 26 December 1942. Her second supply run was unsuccessful: She departed Rabaul on 27 December and arrived at the Mambare River on 29 December, but after failing to contact any Japanese forces ashore she headed back to Rabaul, arriving there with her cargo still aboard on 31 December 1942. I-32 made two more supply runs in January 1943, departing Rabaul on 7 January, arriving off the Mambare River estuary to unload her cargo and embark 43 passengers on 9 January, calling at Rabaul from 11 to 12 January, and returning to the Mambare River on 14 January, where she unloaded 22 tons of food and ammunition. She then headed for Truk, where she arrived on 18 January 1943. Third and fourth war patrols On 24 January 1943, I-32 departed Truk to begin her third war patrol, assigned to a submarine patrol line south of Guadalcanal, where the six-month Guadalcanal campaign was in its final stages. It concluded while I-32 was on patrol, when the Japanese completed Operation Ke, the evacuation of their forces from the island, on 8 February 1943. On 11 February, I-32 sighted a U.S. aircraft carrier steaming eastward, but otherwise her patrol was quiet. She returned to Truk on 22 February 1943. Assigned to Submarine Group B on 25 March 1943, I-32 departed Truk that day for her fourth war patrol, in which she operated in the vicinity of Fiji and the Samoan Islands. After an uneventful patrol, she returned to Truk on 1 June, then got underway on 3 June bound for Kure, which she reached on 10 June 1943. July‚ÄìDecember 1943 Towing an Unkato supply container ‚Äî a submersible cargo container that could carry up to 377 tons of supplies, designed for a one-way trip in which the cargo‚Ä≤s recipients released, recovered, and unloaded it ‚Äî I-32 departed Kure on 30 July 1943 and set course for Rabaul, arriving there in early August 1943. While at Rabaul, she was reassigned to the Southeast Area Fleet on 9 August 1943. On 5 September 1943, she set out for New Guinea, towing an Unkato container, and she made her first visit to Lae, New Guinea, to deliver supplies. After that, she proceeded to the New Caledonia area, where she attempted to launch her embarked Yokosuka E14Y1 floatplane off Noum√©a for a reconnaissance mission on 25 September 1943, but a catapult malfunction forced cancellation of the flight. She next made her way to the waters off Australia‚Ä≤s east coast, and she was off Coffs Harbour on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales on 7 October 1943 when she attacked Convoy PG.72, an Australian convoy on a voyage from Sydney in New South Wales to Brisbane in Queensland. All of her torpedoes missed. After sighting one of them surfacing several times between herself and the convoy, one of the convoy‚Ä≤s escorts, the Royal Australian Navy corvette , achieved an asdic contact on I-32, but then lost it before she could mount a counterattack against the submarine. Reassigned to Submarine Group B on 19 October 1943, I-32 received an order on 20 October to attempt another reconnaissance flight over Noum√©a, but this order later was cancelled. Instead, she was detached from Submarine Group B on 26 October 1943 and ordered to join other submarines in intercepting a convoy of six U.S. Navy fleet oilers that the submarine had sighted, but the interception effort was unsuccessful. She next received orders to reconnoiter Pago Pago on Tutuila in American Samoa and conducted a periscope reconnaissance of the anchorage there on 7 November 1943. She suffered a diesel engine breakdown on 12 November and on 13 November 1943 was ordered back to Truk, which she reached safely. Departing Truk on 24 November 1943, I-32 called at Kwajalein from 27 November to 5 December 1943. She returned to Truk on 8 December 1943, took aboard torpedoes from the auxiliary submarine tender on 10 December, then put to sea on 14 December 1943 bound for Japan, where she arrived at Kure on 20 December 1943 for an overhaul. February‚ÄìMarch 1944 With her overhaul complete, I-32 departed Kure on 28 February 1944 bound for Truk, which she reached on 8 March 1944. During her stay in Japan, American forces had captured Kwajalein, Majuro, and Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands, leaving some bypassed Japanese garrisons in the islands isolated. On 15 March 1944, I-32 departed Truk on a run to carry supplies to the isolated garrison on Wotje Atoll, with orders to follow delivery of the supplies with an anti-shipping patrol in the Pacific Ocean east of the Marshalls. During her voyage to Wotje, she reported sighting an American carrier plane south-southwest of Kusaie at 14:30 Japan Standard Time on 17 March 1944, and on 23 March 1944 at 22:21 Japan Time she reported sighting an Allied task force. It was the last time that the Japanese ever heard from I-32. Loss Fleet Radio Unit Pacific, a U.S. Navy signals intelligence and cryptanalysis organization in Hawaii, intercepted and decrypted I-32‚Ä≤s 23 March 1944 message. Based on the information, a U.S. Navy hunter-killer group made up of the destroyer , the destroyer escort , and the submarine chaser rendezvoused at Erikub Atoll and set out to intercept I-32. At 04:22 on 24 March 1944, Manlove detected a surfaced submarine south of Wotje on radar at a range of . Manlove closed with the submarine, which submerged when she was away, causing Manlove to lose radar contact. Manlove quickly gained sonar contact on the submarine, however, and Halsey Powell moved in, expending all of her depth charges in a series of attacks. Manlove and PC-1135 then attacked, Manlove dropping depth charges and firing Hedgehog salvos and PC-1135 attacking with Mousetrap projectiles. The submarine sank at . The submarine Halsey Powell, Manlove, and PC-1135 sank probably was I-32. On 24 March 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared her to be presumed lost with all hands. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 June 1944. NotesSources * Hackett, Bob & Kingsepp, Sander. IJN Submarine I-32: Tabular Record of Movement. Retrieved on August 29, 2020.

She was inducted into the Quilters Hall of Fame as of September 29, 1984, for greatly contributing \\"through her collecting, researching and sharing of information.\\" In 1999, her work as a quilter was recognized when her \\"Heritage Quilt\\" was chosen as one of the 100 Best American Quilts of the 20th century. Barton was one of the first people who collected women's magazines and clothing, using them to date quilts by the fabrics they contained. She created \\"one of the most comprehensive collections of quilts, costumes, and fashion plates ever assembled and donated to public institutions.\\" Her collection was eventually divided among a number of Iowa institutions, donated for use in research and teaching as well as exhibition. Biography Mary Alice Pemble was born on June 9, 1917, one of six children of Harold H. Pemble (1889‚Äì1970) and Edith Lisle Pemble (1886‚Äì1968) of Indianola, Iowa. Her family lived in town, where they had a large garden, cattle, horses, and chickens. They later started an orchard outside of town. Mary's father helped run a hardware store, and her mother sold cheese and produce with the children's help. Both of her grandmothers were quilters who made quilts for her. Mary learned to sew and embroider at a young age, and won awards at the Iowa State Fair for her dresses, suits and coats. She was also an outstanding student athlete. She graduated from Indianola High School in 1936. She attended Simpson College, and then completed a B.S. degree in landscape architecture at Iowa State University. In 1942, she married a classmate, Thomas Arthur Barton (1918‚Äì1989). They moved to Washington, D.C.. During World War II they worked as engineering draftsmen at the Hydrographic Office of the U.S. Navy, making maps for air navigation. Mary Barton was the only woman in her department. In 1946, with the arrival of her first child, Barton gave up her job to become a full-time homemaker. The couple eventually had 4 sons. Following her husband's career, they moved from Washington to Iowa, to Michigan, and finally back to Ames, Iowa. There Thomas Barton became the head of the department of Landscape Architecture. Collecting In 1949, Barton inherited several family quilts made by her grandmothers. She first purchased a quilt at a farm auction in 1967. In 1968, she organized a program on quilts for the Heritage Division of the Faculty Women's Club at Iowa State University. As part of the program she wrote a play on the history of quilting. Aunt Mary's Quilting Party was performed around a quilt frame for the Faculty Women's Club on January 8, 1969. The lack of collected and published resources on fabrics and quilts impelled Barton towards collecting. Morning walking dress (1810), Fashion plate from La Belle Assembl√©e, Included in Barton's collection Barton collected far more than just finished quilts. She created extensive notebooks to document a collection that also included fabric scraps, patterns, magazines, photographs, family letters and diaries, newspaper clippings, fashion illustrations and catalogs. She studied the manufacture of fabrics and their use in clothing, quilts and household textiles. By researching the companies that had produced dated materials, and comparing fabrics to other dated materials and garments in her quilt and clothing collections, she was able to create references that showed what fabrics looked like and how they were used at different times. As a result it became possible to use the references to date quilt pieces and determine not only when they were individually made, but also when they were combined into quilts. Barton was invited to lecture at major events, including the Kansas Quilt Symposium (1978) and the Missouri Quilt Symposium (1980). She served on the planning committee of Iowa's first statewide quilting event, the Heirloom to Heirloom Quilt Conference (1983). There, and again at the Continental Quilting Congress in Arlington, Virginia in 1984, she set up innovative Study Centers. There, people could use items from her collection, arranged by decade, to comparatively date other works. Interviewed in 1984, she described herself as an \\"independent researcher\\" and a \\"conservator\\" who was \\"just trying to save things for future historians.\\" At the Continental Quilting Congress in Arlington, Virginia, on September 29, 1984, Mary Barton was inducted into the Quilters Hall of Fame. Quilting Barton created many quilt study panels comparing fabrics and patterns from her collections. She also made a number of complete quilt tops, often reproducing antique quilts that she particularly liked. Barton may have begun working on her \\"Heritage Quilt\\" as early as 1966, although some sources suggest 1968. In this quilt, she created a historically accurate visual record of the tools, activities, places, people and quilt patterns involved in her pioneer family's migration across America. The fabrics \\"worn\\" by the women and children in the quilt are heirloom materials. Completed in time for the 1976 bicentennial, the quilt won a blue ribbon at the 1976 Iowa State Fair. It was entered in the National Bicentennial Quilt Contest in Warren, Michigan, where it won an honorable mention. In 1999, Barton's work as a quilter was nationally recognized when her \\"Heritage Quilt\\" was chosen as one of the 100 Best American Quilts of the 20th century. The choice of quilts was adjudicated by the Quilter's Newsletter Magazine, the International Quilt Festival, Quiltmaker magazine and McCall's Quilting. This resulted in publication of a book, an exhibition at the 2000 International Quilt Festival, and a PBS documentary film. Philanthropy Mary Barton's activities as a collector and philanthropist were inspired in part by her concern that the crafts heritage of Iowa should be preserved in Iowa. As early as the 1970s, she began donating quilts from her collection to organizations in Iowa. Barton donated hundreds of quilts to the Living History Farms in Urbandale, Iowa; Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa; the State Historical Society of Iowa; and the Farm House Museum on the campus of Iowa State University. Her \\"Heritage Quilt\\", along with 67 quilts and quilt tops and 1500 other items, was donated to the State Historical Museum of Iowa between 1987 and 2001. This donation became the basis of the exhibit Patterns for learning: Selections from the Mary Barton Collection in 1993. A similarly named exhibit was presented in 2007-2008. As of 2009, many items from her collections were included in the Quilt Index. Mary Barton left her extensive collection of fashion illustrations and related materials, organized by year from 1776-2008, to the Iowa State University Archives. Part of her collection was donated in 1988, the rest in 1995.

Domitius Philippus\\", pp. 428f Military officials sometimes were forced to assume civilian tasks by the populace, so it is possible Philippus was never appointed governor. The historical facts of his life after he left Egypt are unknown.  Legend  In the version of the life of St. Eugenia presented in the Golden Legend, when Philippus was appointed governor of Egypt, he brought with him to Egypt his wife Claudia and his children Avitus, Sergius, and Eugenia. While there, Eugenia converted to Christianity and, disguising herself as a an, entered a monastery. While as a monk a noble woman propositioned her, and upon being rejected the noble woman accused Eugenia of propositioning her and had her haled before Philippus the governor. In the course of the trial, Eugenia revealed her identity, found innocent, and the noblewoman punished. Afterwards she converted her family, and Philippus left his posting to become bishop of Egypt. There are a number of implausible facts in this story, chief amongst them the fact Philippus was never \\"bishop of Egypt\\" -- Heraclas is attested Patriarch of Alexandria from 232 to 248 -- as well as elements of M√§rchen (e.g. AT 883 B ‚Äî The seducer punished).

The post was outnumbered, having between 600 and 800 men under the command of militia Colonel John D. Crawford and 33 cavalrymen under Captain Oscar B. Queen, compared to about 1,200 led by Brigadier-General M. Jeff Thompson. By 1864, it was becoming obvious that the Confederacy was likely to lose the war. General Edmund Kirby Smith, Confederate commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department was ordered to send troops from his department to other theaters of war east of the Mississippi River after the conclusion of the Red River campaign in the spring of 1864. However, Smith deemed this impossible due to Union control of the Mississippi River. Believing that drawing Union troops away from the primary theaters of war would have the same overall effect as sending his own troops there, Smith approved an expedition into Union-held Missouri. Major- General Sterling Price commanded the expedition, which entered Missouri in September. Price had originally hoped to capture St. Louis, but changed his plans after being defeated at the Battle of Pilot Knob in late September. Price then moved westwards into the pro-Confederate Little Dixie region, and authorized raids commanded by Brigadier-Generals John B. Clark Jr. and M. Jeff Thompson, with targets of Glasgow and Sedalia, respectively. Thompson, commanding Shelby's Iron Brigade, attacked Sedalia on October 15. After a brief fight, the Union garrison of the town, two militia regiments, was routed by fire from Confederate artillery. Thompson's command then looted the town before rejoining Price. On October 23, Price was defeated at the Battle of Westport near Kansas City. The Confederates then retreated into Texas, but not before suffering defeats at the battles of Mine Creek and Second Newtonia later in October. Prelude At the outset of the American Civil War in 1861, the state of Missouri was a slave state. Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson supported secession, and activated the pro-secession state militia. The militia were sent to the vicinity of St. Louis, Missouri, where Brigadier- General Nathaniel Lyon dispersed the group using Union Army troops in the Camp Jackson affair on May 10. A pro-secession riot in St. Louis followed, in which several military personnel and civilians were killed or wounded. On May 12, Jackson formed a pro-secession militia unit known as the Missouri State Guard and placed Major-General Sterling Price in command. In June, Lyon moved against the state capital of Jefferson City and evicted Jackson and the pro- secession group of state legislators. Jackson's party moved to Boonville, although Lyon captured that city after the Battle of Boonville on June 17. In July, anti-secession state legislators held a vote rejecting secession. Brigadier General Ben McCulloch of the Confederate States Army joined Price's militia forces; the combined group defeated Lyon at the Battle of Wilson's Creek in southwestern Missouri on August 10. After Wilson's Creek, Price drove northwards, capturing the city of Lexington. However, the Missouri State Guard retreated in the face of Union reinforcements, falling back to southwestern Missouri. In November, while at Neosho, Jackson and the pro-secession legislators voted to secede, and joined the Confederate States of America as a government-in-exile. In February 1862, Price abandoned Missouri for Arkansas in the face of Union pressure, joining forces commanded by Major General Earl Van Dorn. In March, Price officially joined the Confederate States Army, receiving a commission as a major general. That same month, Van Dorn was defeated at the Battle of Pea Ridge, giving the Union control of Missouri. By July 1862, most of the men of the Missouri State Guard had left to join Confederate States Army units. Missouri was then plagued by guerrilla warfare throughout 1862 and 1863. Background National Park Service map of Price's Missouri Raid By the beginning of September 1864, events in the eastern United States, especially the Confederate defeat in the Atlanta campaign, gave Abraham Lincoln, who supported continuing the war, an edge in the 1864 United States Presidential Election over George B. McClellan, who promoted ending the war. At this point, the Confederacy had very little chance of winning the war. Meanwhile, in the Trans-Mississippi Theater, the Confederates had defeated Union attackers in the Red River campaign in Louisiana in March through May. As events east of the Mississippi River turned against the Confederates, General Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, was ordered to transfer the infantry under his command to the fighting in the Eastern and Western Theaters. However, this proved to be impossible, as the Union Navy controlled the Mississippi River, preventing a large scale crossing. Despite having limited resources for an offensive, Smith decided that an attack designed to divert Union troops from the principal theaters of combat would have the same effect as the proposed transfer of troops. Price and the Confederate Governor of Missouri Thomas Caute Reynolds suggested that an invasion of Missouri would be an effective offensive; Smith approved the plan and appointed Price to command the offensive. Price expected that the offensive would create a popular uprising against Union control of Missouri, divert Union troops away from principal theaters of combat (many of the Union troops previously defending Missouri had been transferred out of the state, leaving the Missouri State Militia to be the state's primary defensive force), and aid McClellan's chance of defeating Lincoln; on September 19, Price's column entered the state. By September 24, Price's column had reached Fredericktown, where he learned that Pilot Knob and the St. Louis & Iron Mountain Railroad were held by Union forces under the command of Brigadier General Thomas Ewing Jr. Price had no interest in allowing an enemy force to operate in his rear while he advanced to St. Louis, so he sent two of his three divisions, under Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke and Major General James F. Fagan to Pilot Knob; the third division, under Brigadier General Joseph O. Shelby, operated north of the town. On September 26, Ewing fought off Fagan at Arcadia before withdrawing to the defenses of Fort Davidson. The next day, Price moved against the fort and offered Ewing surrender terms; the latter refused, as he was afraid of being executed for his unpopular issuance of General Order No. 11 the previous year. Holding out, the Union defenders repulsed multiple assaults, before slipping out of the fort at 03:00 on September 28. The Confederates suffered at least 800 casualties during the engagement and had their morale depressed, leading Price to abandon the attempt against St. Louis. After abandoning the St. Louis thrust, Price's army headed for Jefferson City, although the Confederates were slowed by bringing along a large supply train. On October 7, the Confederates approached Jefferson City, which was held by about 7,000 men, mostly inexperienced militia, commanded by Brigadier General Egbert Brown. Faulty Confederate intelligence placed Brown's strength at 15,000, and Price, fearing another defeat like Pilot Knob, decided not to attack the city, and began moving his army toward Boonville the next day. Boonville was in the pro-Confederate region of Little Dixie, and Price was able to recruit between 1,200 and 2,000 men. Price, needing weapons, then authorized two raids away from his main body of troops: Brigadier General John B. Clark Jr. was sent to Glasgow, and Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson's brigade of Shelby's division to Sedalia. Battle Thompson's command consisted of Shelby's Iron Brigade of Slayback's Missouri Cavalry Battalion, Elliott's Missouri Cavalry Regiment, the 5th Missouri Cavalry Regiment, and Collins' Missouri Battery; the force totaled around 1,200 or 1,500 men. Two redoubts and some rifle pits defended the town. The Union garrison of Sedalia consisted of two militia regiments: the 1st Missouri State Militia Cavalry and the 7th Missouri State Militia Cavalry. Before daylight on October 15, Thompson's brigade, with Elliott's regiment in the lead, attacked the Union barricades. Elliott quickly drove off Union pickets, although his regiment was unsupported and the Union garrison was able to form a line of battle. Collins' Battery soon began firing at the Union position, and the defenders fled in panic. Initially, the Confederates were unaware that the defenders had fled, as they had left their flags flying above the fortifications. After the fighting ended, Thompson's men looted Sedalia, with government property being particular targets for destruction, although a modern historian states that Thompson attempted to limit the plundering to military-related supplies. However, some eyewitnesses reported seeing Confederates plundering supplies of whiskey by riding barefoot and keeping the liquor in their boots. Most of the Confederate units that had participated in the fighting became disorganized, and Slayback's Battalion, which was in the best state of organization, performed guard duty after the battle. Aftermath Price's Missouri Raid in October 1864 Price reported capturing a number of weapons and some military goods, as well as 200 prisoners. The Union garrison is also reported to have suffered one man killed and 23 wounded. Thompson then moved north to rejoin Price's main body, as it moved towards Marshall. Clark's raid on Glasgow was also successful. By October 19, the Confederates had reached Lexington, where they fought against a Union force in the Second Battle of Lexington. Two days later, Union Major General James G. Blunt attempted to stop Price at the crossing of the Little Blue River, but was defeated in the ensuing Battle of Little Blue River. After fighting several more actions, Price encountered nearly 20,000 Union soldiers near Kansas City on October 23. The Battle of Westport followed, and Price's 9,000 soldiers were soundly defeated. Price then fell back into Kansas but was defeated in the Battle of Mine Creek on October 25. About 600 Confederate soldiers were captured at Mine Creek, including Marmaduke. Later that day, Price ordered the destruction of almost all of the cumbersome wagon train. The final major action of the campaign occurred on October 28 near Newtonia, Missouri. In the Second Battle of Newtonia Price was defeated by Blunt; by this point, the Confederate army was disintegrating. Union troops continued pursuing Price until the Confederates reached the Arkansas River on November 8; the Confederates did not stop retreating until they reached Texas towards the end of the month.

Ghermandi's writing focuses on the intersection of African (specifically Ethiopian) and Italian identity. Early life Ghermandi was born in Addis Ababa to an Italian father from Bologna and an Italo-Ethiopian mother. Ghermandi's mother was originally born to an Italian military officer and Eritrean mother who were separated due to racial policies of the then Fascist- controlled colony Italian East Africa before marrying Ghermandi's Italian father following the end of the Fascist Italian government. Ghermandi states that she was brought up \\"white\\" by her mother, stating that her mom had faced exclusion from the Ethiopian community when she was being raised in an Italian convent due to her mixed-race status. Following the death of her father, Ghermandi moved to Bologna at the age of 14. In her adolescence in Bologna, Ghermandi has stated feeling homesick and having a longing for her community in Ethiopia. Career Ghermandi gained recognition in 1999, winning the Elks&Tra; Literary Prize for migrant writers through the publisher Fara Editore. She went on two win third place two more times in 2001 and 2003 in the same competition. In 2003, Ghermandi was one of the founders of the online literary journal El Ghibli. Gabriella's first novel, Regina di fiori e di perle (Queen of Flowers and Pearls) was published by Donzelli Editore in 2007. An English language translation was published in 2015 and earned positive reviews. In 2010, Ghermandi started the Atse Tewodros Project, a music project named for Atse Tewodros II, the first Ethiopian emperor not of Royal descent. The project's first CD was originally self-released on CD in 2013 and then was released by the label ARC Music in 2016, titled Ethiopia - Celebrating Emperor Tewodros II.

(’é’°÷Ä’§’°’∂’°’∂÷Å ‘±’Ω’∫’•’ø’∂’•÷Ä) is a non-political, non- sectarian, non-denominational fraternal organization established in 1916 in the USA that encourages its members to take leadership roles in cultural, educational, religious, and charitable organizations on the local, national and international level for the betterment of Armenians worldwide. The Knights of Vartan emphasizes patriotism, discipline, and knightly virtues, in order to strengthen the fabric of national life. The primary objectives of the Knights of Vartan are to create a spirit of brotherhood and cooperation among Armenians and to instill the principles of charity, justice, noble character and good citizenship. History of the establishment of the Knights of Vartan Inc. On May 27, 1916, a small group of Armenian community leaders established the Knights of Vartan Inc. Brotherhood. The Knights of Vartan's 12 Founding Fathers were: Bishop Papguen Guleserian, Rev. Garabed M. Manavian Rev. Khachadour G. Benneyan, Rev. Haigag H. Khazoyan, Rev. A. A. Bedikian, Rev. Mihran T. Kalajian, Prof. Mardiros Ananigian, Prof. Haroutune Dadourian, Prof. Vahan Babasinian, Mr. Karekin M. Guiragosian, Mr. Garabed Pushman, Mr. Nazareth Gumushguerdanian. In 1932, the Knights of Vartan, Inc., decided to organize an affiliated organization, known as the Daughters of Vartan, devoted to the spiritual and cultural ennoblement of Armenian womanhood. The institution of the first Chapter (Otyag) took place on December 18, 1933, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Purpose of the organization The Knights of Vartan Inc. is an Armenian organization founded after the Armenian genocide and massacre of the Armenian people in 1915. The main aims of the organization are to fight for the recognition of the Armenian genocide, to assuage the pain of the Armenian people suffering from genocide, and to train compatriot leaders to serve the religious, cultural, educational, and charitable needs of the Armenian people throughout the world. The organization is named after Commander Vartan Mamigonian, a 5th century Armenian hero. Vartan Mamigonian, an esteemed and revered nobleman and a staunch Christian, was one of the great heroes in Armenian history who was later sanctified. Vartan sacrificed his life defending the principles of Christianity and liberty at the Battle of Avarayr in AD 451. St. Vartan‚Äôs patriotism, courage, faith, devotion, and self-sacrifice in the service of his people have been a continual source of inspiration to Armenians in their struggle for freedom. Because of these qualities and virtues, he was adopted as the patron saint of the Knights of Vartan Brotherhood. The name ‚ÄúKnight‚Äù (Asbed), used to designate a member of the Knights of Vartan, signifies the rendering of unselfish and devoted service to the Armenian people and to mankind. Activities of the Knights of Vartan Inc. The Knights of Vartan is not a welfare organization or a benefit society and therefore does not usually engage directly in fund raising activities. However, it is important to know that the Knights of Vartan is a service organization to inspire and to encourage its members to assume leadership roles in cultural, educational, religious and charitable organizations and activities on a local, national and international level. On the local level, lodges present educational and cultural programs, give scholarships and distribute books on Armenian subjects as gifts to colleges and libraries, hold annual Vartanantz Programs, annual Christmas Party and Annual Picnic, make donations to Local Churches & Organizations, support Schools in Armenia and more. On the national level, members participate and take leadership roles in various social, philanthropic, compatriotic, religious and educational organizations and activities, provide scholarships to qualified students in American universities and Armenia (American University of Armenia, Yerevan State University (YSU) and National Polytechnic University of Armenia, building and renovating schools , kindergartens, homes for low income families , supporting orphans, new water pipelines for the rural communities, annually organizing Times Square Commemoration of Armenian Genocide in NYC, established the Armenian Research Center of the University Of Michigan-Dearborn, supporting Armenian churches, supporting the Armenian Eye Care Project; supporting Soup Kitchens in Armenia, and many other contributions to Churches, organizations and charities. Individual Knights are encouraged to have their own charity projects as well.

Most Puerto Rican poetry is written and published in Spanish, but work by poets of the diaspora is also written and published in Spanglish and English. The literary arts emerge on the island formally in mid 1800's but did not reach international recognition until the 20th century when Puerto Ricans intellectuals, artists, dramatists, and poets of the diaspora created the phenomena known as the Nuyorican Poetry Movement. Among the most celebrated poets who emigrated to Puerto Rico after the Spanish Civil War were Nobel laureate Juan Ramon Jim√©nez and his wife, the poet Zenobia Camprub√≠, who settled in San Juan in 1946. Jim√©nez's lyrical, philosophical poems influenced major Puerto Rican-born poets Giannina Braschi and Manuel Ramos Otero, as well as playwright Ren√© Marqu√©s.  Women poets  Puerto Rican women have made great contributions to poetry in Spanish, especially in the 20th century. Mercedes Negr√≥n Mu√±oz wrote under the name \\"Clara Lair\\" and published \\"Arras de Cristal\\" (1937), which describes the everyday struggles of the Puerto Rican people. However, it was Julia de Burgos who is considered by many as one of the greatest poets to be born in Puerto Rico. The inspiration spurred by her nostalgia of Puerto Rico is reflected in her poem \\"R√≠o Grande de Lo√≠za\\". Her lyrical poems deal with the personal, the land, and the struggle of the oppressed people. Many critics assert that her poetry anticipated the work of feminist writers. She writes: \\"I am life, strength, woman.\\" When Pablo Neruda met de Burgos in Cuba, he stated that she was one of the greatest poets of the Americas. Of renown on the island (though out of print and not available in English translation as of 2020) is the poetry of Angelamaria Davila, Olga Nolla, Rosario Ferr√©, and Mayra Santos. Outside the island, a leading voice of the Latinx vanguard is Giannina Braschi, who writes about the vitality of Puerto Rican culture in her postmodern poetry epic Empire of Dreams. Braschi's poetry has been translated into many languages and widely adapted into other art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography book, comic book and graphic novel, sculpture, experimental theater, and kinetic furniture.  Nuyorican poets  Julia de Burgos was the precursor to the Nuyorican poetry movement. In 1953, in the hospital months before her death, she wrote her two final poems in English, ‚ÄúFarewell in Welfare Island,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Sun in Welfare Island,‚Äù which are forerunners to the literature of Nuyorican and U.S. Latina/o writers of the 1970s in theme, emotional intonation, and choice of language. MIguel Pi√±ero, Miguel Algar√≠n and Pedro Pietri later cofounded the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in 1973. By the 1990s the venue was consider an epicenter of SLAM poetry movement in the United States Among the few initial women to be included in the forum were Nuyorican poets Sandra Mar√≠a Esteves, Giannina Braschi, and Nancy Mercado. Publications and performances of their works in English, Spanish, and Spanglish paved the way for the plethora of Latinx poets at large who perform poetry in English and Spanglish, including Dominican- American poet Elizabeth Acevedo, author of The Poet X. New York poets of Puerto Rican descent include Brooklyn-born Martin Espada who writes almost exclusively in English. A chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, Espada has translated other Puerto Rican poets into English, including Clemente Soto V√©lez. William Carlos Williams (1883‚Äì1963) described himself as \\"half- Spanish\\", but his mother was actually Puerto Rican and his father spoke Spanish fluently. Born in Patterson, NJ, Williams was a leading poet of the Imagist movement, and the inspiration for the Beat generation of the 1950s and 60s. He was known as an experimenter, an innovator, a revolutionary figure in American poetry.  African influences  Abelardo D√≠az Alfaro (1916‚Äì1999) and Luis Pal√©s Matos (1989-1959) who wrote Afro-Antillano lyrics and Angelamaria Davila (1944-2003) who wrote Afro-feminist verses were leading figures of Afro-Puerto Rican and Afro-Caribbean poetry. Author of \\"Fierce and Tender Animal\\", D√°vila wrote explored themes of love, relationships, womanhood, and intified her black Puerto Ricanness as a defining characteristic of her writing and identity. [Though known in Puerto Rican literary circles on the island, these Afro-Puerto Rican poets' works are out of print as of 2020 and have not been translated into other languages.] Emerging voices of the diaspora include performance poets of Afro-Boricua descent, Noel Qui√±ones and Vanessa Marco, whose works on not yet published but performed in poetry clubs in Brooklyn and Los Angeles.  Puerto Rican Poetry Classics  The following are Puerto Rican poetry classic collections that are widely taught and available in English and other languages. * William Carlos Williams's Pictures from Brueghel (1962) won the Pulitzer Prize.

It began at 8:54p.m. and lasted until 9:12p.m. the following day, for a total length of 24 hours and 18 minutes. This made the filibuster the longest single-person filibuster in U.S. Senate history, a record that still stands today. Background and goals The Civil Rights Act of 1957 was designed to federally secure and protect the right of African Americans to vote. In the Senate, the bill was supported by Republicans and many Democrats, though some Democrats from southern states opposed the bill. Filibuster Thurmond opened his filibuster by asserting that the civil rights bill was unconstitutional and \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\". He went on to read documents primarily related to the United States and its history, including the Declaration of Independence, the election laws of each state in alphabetical order, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the U.S. Bill of Rights, and George Washington's Farewell Address. In order to save his voice and stamina, Thurmond spent a significant amount of time answering questions posed by other senators. Leading up to the filibuster, Thurmond took daily steam baths in order to draw fluids out of his body. By dehydrating himself, he enabled his body to absorb fluids for a longer period of time before needing to use the bathroom. Thurmond was allowed to relieve himself only once, approximately three hours into his filibuster. Senator Barry Goldwater quietly asked Thurmond how much longer he could hold off using the bathroom, and he replied, \\"About another hour\\". Goldwater asked Thurmond to yield the floor to him for a few minutes, and while Goldwater spoke, Thurmond was able to use the bathroom. An aide had prepared a bucket in the Senate cloakroom for Thurmond to relieve himself if the need arose, but Thurmond did not end up using it. During the filibuster, Thurmond sustained himself on diced pieces of pumpernickel bread and small pieces of cooked hamburger. He also sucked on \\"throat lozenges and malted milk tablets\\" to keep himself from getting hoarse. Outcome and reception The filibuster failed to prevent the passage of the bill, and further failed to change the vote whatsoever. Thurmond's filibuster has been described as racist, as Thurmond attempted to block a law that protected the right of African-Americans to vote. Thurmond's filibuster in 1957, as well as his authorship of the Southern Manifesto the preceding year, \\"sealed Thurmond's reputation as one of the South's last Confederates, a champion of white southerners' campaign of 'massive resistance'\\" to civil rights. In 1964, Thurmond (who by that point had switched his affiliation to the Republican Party) participated in a second anti-civil rights filibuster, this time against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The 1964 filibuster was carried out by a group of Southern Senators over 57 days.A State-by-State History of Race and Racism in the United States, Vol. 2: Montana-Wyoming (ed.

It is unusual in that its exclusive economic zone, covering , is slightly smaller than its territorial waters. The latter generally extend only 12 nautical miles from the shore, but also include inland marine waters such as Hudson Bay (about across), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the internal waters of the Arctic archipelago. Geography Canada's exclusive economic zone and territorial waters Canada's EEZ is in the Pacific Ocean, Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean, Baffin Bay, Hudson Bay, Labrador Sea, Northwestern Passages, Gulf of St Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean. It borders with Alaska (US) to the west, Greenland to the east and the United States to the south. The fishing grounds in Canada's Atlantic Ocean zone are called the \\"Grand Banks\\". They extend beyond 200 nautical miles in the northern area called the \\"Nose\\" and the southern area called the \\"Tail\\" of the Grand Banks. The fish habitat outside 200 nautical miles encompasses 327,000 square nautical miles vs 673,000 square nautical miles landwards in the limited area.C. L. Mitchell, Canada's Law of the Sea Position, The Economic Implications, unpublished paper, 1974, Library of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Ottawa, pp.30. Marine life In 1973, Canada's waters within 200 nautical miles, produced over 90% of the world's marine fish catches of 66 million metric tons. There are issues with how to manage straddling and migratory fish stocks which are vulnerable for high seas fisheries that operate outside the EEZ. The increase in fish catches within the EEZ and outside cause overfishing and decline of major stock levels. Fish catches by foreign fleets outside Canada's EEZ became a significant problem during the 1980s and 1990s. International agreements were made with most fishing states which placed moratoriums on nearly all traditional fish stocks. In the mid-1990s a conflict arose about a specific stock between Canada and the European Union. Canadian authorities arrested a vessel from the European Union in the mid-1990s. There was a Canadian initiative to resolve this global problem which gained enough support from other countries for another United Nations Conference. This resulted in a United Nations Convention to straddle the highly migratory fish stocks. It was adopted in 1995, but requires 30 ratifications to be enforced. Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks adopted August 4, 1995 by the United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, United Nations Publications, New York 1995. Another problem is salmon are not protected by UNCLOS from competitive fishing while the salmon migrates through the rivers and lakes of different coastal states to their spawning grounds. In some areas the issue of foreign fleets maximizing their catches on the high sees was replaced by coastal fisheries trying to do the same. There is a need for the implementation of effective policies to manage fisheries.A. H. Hoel, Performance of Exclusive Economic Zone, Dartmouth College Hanover New Hampshire U.S.A., Institutional Dimensions of Global Environmental Change. Scoping Report No. 2, July 2000, p.i. History In 1945, there were two United States presidential proclamations called the \\"Truman Proclamations\\". One was about how to manage the continental shelf and the other about fisheries.R. D. Eckert, The Enclosure of Ocean Resources, Hoover Institution Press, 1979, p.3 and pp.128-129. This caused a fast erosion of the concept \\"freedom of the seas\\" (all countries can freely use the oceans for navigation and fishing). Thereafter, many countries claimed resource rights with a maximum of 200 nautical miles. R. D. Eckert, The Enclosure of Ocean Resources, Hoover Institution Press, 1979, p.4. The Canadian coastal areas in the Pacific and Atlantic contain among the richest fish resources in the world. In 1973 Canada's east coast territorial sea and fishing zones was . Thanks to the extension to 200 nautical miles it increased to . This encompassed 96% of the total fish catch by Canadian and foreign fishing fleets in the Atlantic zone of Canada. The marine life and natural resources in the Atlantic zone of Canada caused many foreign fishing vessels to exploit it. Since 1958 there was a dramatic increase of vessels from East Europe who joined West Europeans while the Canadian fishing fleet remained a stable size.S. Parsons, Management of Marine Fisheries in Canada, National Research Council of Canada, 1993, p.228. The Canadian and foreign fish catches were in danger due to significant stock declines since the early '70s.S. Parsons, Management of Marine Fisheries in Canada, National Research Council of Canada, 1993, p.229. The International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (ICNAF) which existed since the 1940s could not prevent the rapid decline of fish stock.S. Parsons, Management of Marine Fisheries in Canada, National Research Council of Canada, 1993, p.239. In 1973, Canada participated in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), United Nations, New York 1983. UNCLOS became effective since 16th November 1982. The Exclusive Economic Zone section of UNCLOS is described in Part V. It provides a \\"comprehensive framework for contemporary uses of the sea.\\" It is the result of 15 years of negotiations which were initiated by the United Nations Seabed Committee and then at UNCLOS III.B. Kwiatowska, The 200 Mile Exclusive Economic Zone in the New Law of the Sea, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, p.xx. Before the 200 nautical mile limit was accepted only 4% of the fish catch occurred outside the limit off Canada's Atlantic coast by Canadian and all foreign fleets.C. L.

Disputes=Active * A wedge-shaped section of the Beaufort Sea is disputed between Canada and the United States, because the area reportedly contains substantial oil reserves. * France boasts some of Canada's EEZ at Saint Pierre and Miquelon, based on a new definition of the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone between the two countries. Saint Pierre and Miquelon is entirely surrounded by Canada's EEZ. Resolved In 1992, the Canada‚ÄìFrance Maritime Boundary Case, which centered on the EEZ around the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, was decided by an arbitral tribunal which concurred on the whole with the arguments put forth by Canada.

She was the consort of Carlo Carafa, 3rd Prince of Belvedere, 6th Marquess of Anzi, and Lord of Trivigno, and the daughter of Ferdinand van den Eynde, 1st Marquess of Castelnuovo and Olimpia Piccolomini, of the House of Piccolomini. Her grandfather was Jan van den Eynde, a wealthy Flemish merchant, banker and art collector who purchased and renovated the Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano in 1653. Her father Ferdinand, the Marquess of Castelnuovo, built the Vandeneynden Palace of Belvedere between 1671 and 1673. While the Palazzo Zevallos in central Naples passed to her elder sister Giovanna, who married a Colonna heir, Elizabeth was given the monumental Palazzo Vandeneynden, alongside a smaller portion of the Marquess' assets, which included his art collection, one of the largest and most valuable in Naples and its surroundings. Upon her marriage to Carlo Carafa, the Vandeneynden Palace came to be known as Villa Carafa. Family Elizabeth was born into the Van den Eynde family, a powerful and influential Neapolitan noble family of Flemish origin, related to several prominent Flemish artists, including Brueghel, Jode, Lucas de Wael and Cornelis de Wael. Her father was Ferdinand van den Eynde, 1st Marquess of Castelnuovo, the son of Jan van den Eynde, a wealthy merchant from Antwerp, who became one of the richest and most prominent men in Naples. The Marquess Ferdinand married Olimpia Piccolomini, of the House of Piccolomini, a nephew of Cardinal Celio Piccolomini, by whom he had three daughters, Catherine, the eldest, Giovanna, the secondborn, and Elizabeth. In 1674, just few years after Jan van den Eynde's death and the Marquess' inheritance of the latter's impressive art collection, her father also inherited a sizable collection of 70 or 90 paintings from his longtime friend and business partner Gaspar Roomer. Marquess Ferdinand, however, died the same year, and his collection, together with his assets, were split between his infant daughters, Giovanna and Elizabeth (his eldest daughter, Catherine, was also included by her father, but according to some sources was later judged incapacitated). Van den Eynde's assets were frozen until each of his daughter reached adulthood and married. Luca Giordano, another longtime friend of Van den Eynde, took care himself of the inventory for Van den Eynde's inheritance. While drawing up the inventory, Giordano counted ten paintings executed by himself in Van den Eynde's collection. Marriage On April 11, 1688, just three days before her fourteenth birthday, she was married to her agemate Carlo Carafa, 3rd Prince of Belvedere, 6th Marquess of Anzi, and Lord of Trivigno. Carlo was a Carafa, one of the most powerful family in Italy. Through her marriage to Carlo, Elizabeth became part of the House of Carafa, and Princess consort of Belvedere. Carlo Carafa, on the other hand, received a huge dowry, and inherited the Palazzo Vandeneynden, which thereafter became Villa Carafa. Baroness of Gallicchio and Missanello In 1689, Princess Elizabeth acquired the fiefs of Gallicchio, Missanello and Castiglione, whose proprietor, Gian Battista Pignatelli, was in financial trouble. Upon inheriting the fiefs from his mother, Beatrice Carafa De Lannoy (mother of Elizabeth's father in law Don Francesco Maria Carafa ‚Äì Pignatelli being offspring from her third marriage) Pignatelli's brothers contested the will together with a Di Stefano, who claimed over fifteen-thousand ducats from Pignatelli, due to debts of Pignatelli's ancestors owed to his own family. Pignatelli was able to satisfy his brothers, but not Di Stefano. Four years after his commitment to pay what was due to Di Stefano, the latter seized the fiefs, as Pignatelli had not been able to repay him. The fiefs were then acquired by Princess Elizabeth, whose father in law, as mentioned, was the half brother of Pignatelli. Elizabeth governed the fiefs via delegates together with her son Francesco Maria Carafa for over thirty years. She sold the fiefs on August 26, 1736. Although some sources claim the contract was signed on August 26, 1732, possibly due to confusion over the last digit. However, there is enough circumstantial evidence to support the 1736 dating. When in 1735 the new King of Naples and Sicily Charles III of Spain undertook a journey through Calabria, Puglia, Basilicata and Sicily, in order to assess the condition of his kingdom and its people, he was shocked by the poor living conditions of the citizens and the overall cultural and economic backwardness in those lands. He therefore disposed an inquiry, requiring a detailed description of the territory, the so-called Relazione Gaudioso, completed in 1736. As regards Gallicchio, it was reported that \\"The land of Gallicchio [...] is by the illustrious Princess Belvedere possessed, with a revenue of ca. 300 ducats, which she derives from both the feudal and the allodal.\\" Further, when Niccol√≤ Parrino printed in Naples the first translation in dialetto calabrese of Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata in 1737, he dedicated it to the \\"Most excellent Lord Don Francesco Maria Carafa, Prince of Belvedere, Prince of Gallicchio, and Marquess of Anzi [...].\\" The Golden Book of Italian nobility indicates 1737 as the year of the end of Elizabeth's barony in Gallicchio. Issue Princess Elizabeth and Prince Carlo Carafa had one son and a daughter. *Francesco Maria Carafa, 4th Prince of Belvedere, 7th Marquess of Anzi and Baron of Trivigno, Bonifati, Mottafollone and San Sosti *Giovanna Carafa, Nun of the order of Santa Maria Donna Regina Vecchia References Category:1674 births Category:1743 deaths Category:Italian nobility Category:House of Carafa Category:Art collectors ","title":"Elizabeth van den Eynde, Princess of Belvedere"},{"id":"65156201","text":"Chad Horstman (born in 1978) is an American ecommerce entrepreneur who resides in Scottsdale, Arizona.

He was best known for being editor-in-chief of the Antara news agency and the Pemandangan newspaper. He also served as ambassador of Indonesia to Sri Lanka and Algeria. Early life Bafaqih was born in Tanah Abang, Batavia (now Jakarta), on 14 December 1918. He studied at the Jamiat Kheir Islamic private institution.; Career Initially working as a religious studies teacher, Bafaqih began his journalistic career by translating Arabic articles to Malay for the daily newspaper Pemandangan. He also became a freelance writer for both Pemandangan and the weekly magazine Pandji. After Pemandangan was censured by the Dutch authorities, Bafaqih moved to the Japanese D≈çmei news agency to work as an editor. He was still an editor by the time of the proclamation of Indonesian independence. Several hours before the event itself, fellow journalist Adam Malik contacted Bafaqih with a text of the proclamation, and Bafaqih passed it over for a colleague to transmit across the archipelago, without being discovered by Japanese censors. After Indonesian independence, the D≈çmei branch became Antara, and Bafaqih worked there as editor-in-chief. He ran the Jakarta office of the agency when its headquarters moved to Yogyakarta in 1946, alongside Mochtar Lubis. Antara was closed for some time after Operation Kraai in 1948, during which Bafaqih worked at the nationalist newspaper Merdeka. On 18 March 1953, Pemandangan, under Bafaqih as editor-in-chief, published an editorial that indicated a number of companies had received information regarding foreign investments. Bafaqih was then charged for leaking state secrets and was put on trial. Under journalism ethics, Bafaqih refused to disclose his informant and instead accepted full responsibility. Other journalists, organized by his former coworker at Antara Mochtar Lubis, held a demonstration that drew some 1,000 journalists and supporters, along with a fire-brigade band to stir up the crowd. Eventually, Attorney General Soeprapto dropped the charges, citing a lack of clarity on \\"state secrets\\". Bafaqih later became a member of the People's Representative Council of Mutual Assistance (DPR-GR) representing both journalists and the Nahdlatul Ulama. He was appointed as Indonesian ambassador to Sri Lanka, where he worked for four years between 1960 and 1964. He then was assigned as ambassador to Algeria for a year afterwards. During 1956, a series of writings by Bafaqih was published in a Tokyo magazine, in which he recounted a visit to the People's Republic of China in October 1954 and noted the persecution of Muslims in China. He also published a book based on that visit, titled RRT dari Luar dan Dalam (People's Republic of China from Outside and Inside).

Founding of the Ambroise-Par√© hospital and nursing school Following the end of World War I, Matter and three of her fellow nursing school graduates, Alice Bianquis, Eva Durrleman, and Madeleine Rives, joined together to launch a new nursing school and hospital in the north of France. They were assisted by Pastor Henri Nick of Fives-Lille, who recommended three suitable buildings on the Rue Saint-Maur (later √âmile Zola) in Lille. After securing the funds to purchase those buildings, Durrleman and Matter opened the Ambroise-Par√© hospital and school of nursing, and began offering training to young women on November 18, 1923. As hospital admissions and nursing school enrollments grew, the two co-founders, who had continued to manage the Protestant church-affiliated facilities after the respective marriages of Bianquis and Rives, subsequently hired L√©a M√©nard and H√©l√®ne Lavignotte to assist with administration. On November 18, 1933, the successful nursing program transitioned into a boarding school for nursing students.\\"Th√©r√®se Matter,\\" in \\"Juste parmi les Nations,\\" Anonymes, Justes et Pers√©cut√©s durant la p√©riode Nazie dans les communes de France. World War II After the early May 1940 occupation of Luxembourg and Belgium by military forces of Nazi Germany, and the subsequent bombing by German aircraft of a railroad line in Lambersart, a suburb of Lille, where Matter, Durrleman, and their colleagues were still operating the Ambroise-Par√© hospital and school of nursing, German army troops laid siege to Lille from May 27Caniot, Jean (2009).

Trying to hold out at multiple spots within and near the city, including the Rue de Solf√©rino, Rue Nationale, Haute-De√ªle, and Citadel of Lille, the resisters were eventually forced to surrender. On June 1, the defeated French soldiers were marched to he Place du G√©n√©ral-de-Gaulle (also known as the Grand'Place), where the German army was headquartered.Caniot (2009), pp. 43, 45, 48, 51.Landry (1982), p. 23. Just over two years later, on September 11, 1942, Matter and Durrleman became actively involved in rescuing Jews when French police, in concert with Nazi authorities, began rounding up Jewish men, women and children from Lille and its surrounding areas. Taken to the railroad station at Five-Lille, they were slated for deportation to concentration camps. Among those arrested were Fanny Baran, her ten-year-old son Maurice, and her four-month old infant Michel, who were taken from their home at 52 Rue de la Vignette. Baran's oldest boy was rescued shortly thereafter when Georgette Vandenabaele-Franchois, Baran's sixteen-year-old maid, was able to secure help from Lille railroad workers in removing Maurice Baran from the area where he was being detained after informing guards that she had arrived to deliver clothes to the family.\\"Th√©r√®se Matter,\\" in \\"Juste parmi les Nations,\\" Anonymes, Justes et Pers√©cut√©s durant la p√©riode Nazie dans les communes de France.\\"Matter Th√©r√®se\\", in \\"Les Justes de France,\\" in \\"Les Justes parmi les nations,\\" Comit√© Fran√ßais pour Yad Vashem.\\"Matter, Th√©r√®se,\\" in \\"The Righteous Among the Nations Database,\\" Yad Vashem. Meanwhile, Durrleman and Matter worked to rescue Michel Baran. Matter, who spoke German, was able to facilitate their access to the infant by convincing the Nazi guards that she and Durrleman were German nurses sent to check on the child. Forced to make repeated visits to Fanny Baran in order to persuade her to let them save her baby's life, they realized that the guards' growing suspicion was putting them in all in jeopardy, and ultimately sent another German-speaking nurse, France Neubert, to bring the infant out of the station.\\"Th√©r√®se Matter,\\" in \\"Juste parmi les Nations,\\" Anonymes, Justes et Pers√©cut√©s durant la p√©riode Nazie dans les communes de France.\\"Matter Th√©r√®se\\", in \\"Les Justes de France,\\" in \\"Les Justes parmi les nations,\\" Comit√© Fran√ßais pour Yad Vashem.\\"Matter, Th√©r√®se,\\" in \\"The Righteous Among the Nations Database,\\" Yad Vashem.

Others rescued by Matter and Durrleman Matter and Durrleman also helped to hide Maurice Serfati and H√©l√®ne and Perla Lipsyck. Serfati, who had jumped from a train to escape his deportation to Drancy, was hidden briefly at the hospital from the Gestapo by the two women, who had told their nursing staff that he was a nephew. Several weeks later, they helped Serfati connect with an underground resistance group. They sheltered the Lipsyck sisters after their mother was deported with their father, a ritual slaughterer in Lille's Jewish community. Telling their staff that the sixteen-year-old H√©l√®ne and eighteen-year-old Perla were nursing students, the women were subsequently forced to find a new hiding place for the girls when the mother of one of their nursing students complained.\\"Matter Th√©r√®se\\", in \\"Les Justes de France,\\" in \\"Les Justes parmi les nations,\\" Comit√© Fran√ßais pour Yad Vashem.\\"Hommage aux infirmi√®res fran√ßaises Justes des nation\\" (\\"Tribute to nurses Righteous Nations-France\\").

They are first mentioned in a document in 1233 and were represented in the inner council from the beginning of the council records in 1274 until their extinction in 1764 . This made them the oldest Nuremberg council family. They were thus even after the dance Statute of 1521 to the twenty -old rats capable sexes. In 1764 the male line died out. Throughout its history the family boasted five Reichsschulthei√ü (mayors) of NurembergOriginal coat of arms (before 1300) of the Pfinzing  History  The Pfinzing (also: Pfintzing ) came from the Reichsministerialit√§t around Nuremberg and were first mentioned in 1233 with Sifridus de Nurinberc , called Pfincinch , in a document from the Heilsbronn monastery. The family was one of the most important Nuremberg patrician families . Bronze medal with the portrait of Sebald Pfinzing (1487‚Äì1537), councilor in Nuremberg The Pfinzing had occupied the office of Reichsschultheissen several times as early as 1274 and were a power factor in the wide-ranging Nuremberg trade policy in the 14th century. Our own trading activities in Southeastern Europe, in Italy and as a partner in Stromer's trading company are also documented early on. Bertold Pfinzing (‚Ä† 1405), Ulrich Stromer's son-in-law, was King Wenzel's advisor and financier . His son, Sebald Pfinzing (‚Ä† 1431), also played a major role in politics. Together with Peter Volckamer , he was the most important Nuremberg liaison to King Sigismund in 1411/31 and then one of the richest citizens of the city. In the 16th century the Pfinzing owned a wide-ranging trading network with bases in Venice, Salzburg, Augsburg, Regensburg, Leipzig and Breslau, among others. They traded in textiles and spices, were involved in the Schlaggenwald tin trade and, above all, in the Mansfeld iron and steel trade . They did business with iron ore mining and processing in the Upper Palatinate and owned their own Seigerh√ºtte in Ludwigsstadt . The Pfinzing belonged, along with the Imhoff , Tucher and Welser, to the last patrician long-distance traders. Together with Hans Welser, Martin II Pfinzing (1521‚Äì1572) was elected as the first lord of the market to the trading board of the Nuremberg Stock Exchange Henfenfeld Castle The wealth of the Pfinzing was documented in numerous possessions in and around Nuremberg. In 1530, Martin I Pfinzing (1490‚Äì1552) bought the ancestral seat of Burg Henfenfeld from the Egloffsteins and named his line Pfinzing von Henfenfeld after the village of the same name . The addition to the name was recognized as a title of nobility and confirmed by an improvement in the coat of arms in 1554 . The Henfenfeld main line of the sex died out with the Reichsschultheissen Johann Sigmund Pfinzing von Henfenfeld (1712‚Äì1764). Heirs were the Hallers von Hallerstein . Branch lines of the family were: the Nuremberg Line (‚Ä† 1598), the Pfinzing von Weigelshof (‚Ä† 1617) and the Pfinzing von Gr√ºndlach (‚Ä† 1739)  Coat of arms  The coat of arms , originally from the Nuremberg Geuschmid family , around 1300 (formal imperial approval for this in 1465) and since then carried by the Pfinzing, shows a shield divided into gold over black. On the helmet with black and gold covers two buffalo horns marked like the shield. The original coat of arms of the Pfinzing family, however, is said to have been divided by gold and red, with a black eagle above and a silver ring below. Fritz Pfinzing , (* around 1276; ‚Ä† between 1327/1331) in Nuremberg, mentioned 1303‚Äì1327, was a jury nurse of the infirmary near St. Johann. He was married to Elsbet Geuschmid(* around 1280/1285), the daughter of Berthold Geuschmid (* around 1255/1260; ‚Ä† 1331), mentioned in Nuremberg in 1290. Fritz Pfinzing's father-in-law Berthold Geuschmid was again the son of a Pfinzing, from Elisabeth (* around 1245). Fritz Pfinzing finally dropped the old Pfinzing family coat of arms (around 1300) and adopted the Geuschmid coat of arms: \\"Gold and black divided\\". (Cf. Pfinzingsche Ahnentafel in: Der Pfinzing- Atlas von 1594, StsA N√ºrnberg 1994.) In the following centuries there was some ambiguity as to which the Pfinzing's actual family coat of arms was, so that in Siebmacher at the beginning of the 18th century The original coat of arms of the Pfinzing was wrongly ascribed to the Geuschmid.

Five singles were released in advance of the album's release: \\"Meditate\\" on June 25, 2019, \\"Something Something\\" on January 17, 2020, \\"Just Breathe\\" on May 29, 2020, \\"Back to Love\\" on June 19, 2020, and \\"Bra Off\\", on July 1, 2020.  Recording and release  For the recording of the album, Lauren worked closely with Swoope, a labelmate and music producer. Recording was done both at Lauren's home and at Parhelion Recording Studios in Atlanta. During the early stages of recording, Lauren was struggling with loss and confusion, which translated into her approaching the album as a form of therapy. On June 25, Lauren released the single \\"Meditate\\" through Rostrum Records. A second single, \\"Something Something\\", followed on January 17, 2020. A music video for \\"Something Something\\" was shot in Sims' hometown of Tulsa, and was released on February 28, 2020. A third single, \\"Just Breathe\\", was released on May 29, 2020. \\"Back to Love\\" followed on Juneteenth (June 19), 2020, about a month after being conceptualized by Lauren. On July 1, 2020, a fifth single was released from the album, entitled \\"Bra Off\\". Handle with Care was announced on July 3, 2020, and released on July 17, 2020, through Rostrum Records and Native North. A music video for \\"God Morning\\" was released on October 1, 2020.  Lyrical themes  The overall concept of the album is that of inspiration and healing while also challenging perceptions of blackness. Lauren stated in a July 23, 2020, interview that \\"There are so many communities I am a part of and love. The Black community, followers of Jesus, LGBTQ community all play a significant role in my life and I want my music to be in support and love of them all through the arts.\\" She described the album as a space where she and her listeners can simply be as they are without judgement. The song \\"White Noise\\" has been described as perhaps the most vulnerable track on the album. Lauren states that this song is \\"about God's silence towards me and how it felt like rejection and punishment for so long.\\" While she struggled with resentment, she also learned to surrender to the silence she encountered. According to Lauren, \\"Something Something\\" was written for her mother and for anyone who is \\"unseen and tired.\\" Lauren described the concept of \\"Back to Love\\" as \\"the first day of Black Summer\\" where black people can be safe in their own homes and celebrate their culture. \\"Bra Off\\" points out that women should not be subject to insult, assault, sexism, or sexualization when they do not wear a bra. It also, according to Lauren, calls on women to be content without \\"doing\\" and instead lend themselves moments to \\"remove our capes and all the superwoman roles we wear and to simply exist bare as women.\\"  Track listing  * Tracklist credits adapted from liner notes and Tidal  Credits and personnel  Adapted from liner notes and Tidal * Natalie Lauren: Primary artist, song-writing, A&R;, album artwork, recording and engineering, production on \\"Back to Love\\" * Swoope: Album production, song-writing * Carvello: Production on \\"Super Human\\" * Juice Bangers: Production on \\"Get It Right\\" * John Smythe: Production on \\"Something Something\\" and \\"Hard Part\\" * Jordan Webb: Production on \\"White Noise\\" * W.

History and description Jadran Adriatic Hotel is in the center of Mitrovica overlooking Adem Jashari Square. It was built in 1928 with funding from the wealthy local ≈Ωarkoviƒá family. Eventually, it was repurposed as an administrative building for N.T. LUX and later as a city library. Today it is privately owned and the ground floor is leased as office space. Architecture Built in the Vienna Secession style of Art Nouveau architecture, the ‚ÄúL‚Äù-shaped building includes a basement, mezzanine, and first floor. The central fa√ßade includes an archway under the dome where the two wings meet, crowning the two pillars and arched balcony that mark the entrance facing the square. The basement was designed for hotel bookkeeping, the ground floor for maintenance and reception, and the first floor for lodging. The roof is mostly clay tile with some laminated copper on the entry dome and a few other areas. Most renovations have been on the ground floor fa√ßade, mainly the number and shape of the windows, and the building remains in relatively good condition.

Founding of the Ambroise-Par√© hospital and nursing school Following the end of World War I, Durrleman and three of her fellow nursing school graduates, Alice Bianquis, Th√©r√®se Matter, and Madeleine Rives, joined together to launch a new nursing school and hospital in the north of France. They were assisted by Pastor Henri Nick of Fives-Lille, who recommended three suitable buildings on the Rue Saint-Maur (later √âmile Zola) in Lille. After securing the funds to purchase those buildings, Durrleman and Matter opened the Ambroise-Par√© hospital and school of nursing, and began offering training to young women on November 18, 1923. As hospital admissions and nursing school enrollments grew, the two co- founders, who had continued to manage the Protestant church-affiliated facilities after the respective marriages of Bianquis and Rives, subsequently hired L√©a M√©nard and H√©l√®ne Lavignotte to assist with administration.

World War II After the early May 1940 occupation of Luxembourg and Belgium by military forces of Nazi Germany, and the subsequent bombing by German aircraft of a railroad line in Lambersart, a suburb of Lille, where Durrleman, Matter, and their colleagues were still operating the Ambroise-Par√© hospital and school of nursing, German army troops laid siege to Lille from May 27Caniot, Jean (2009).

Trying to hold out at multiple spots within and near the city, including the Rue de Solf√©rino, Rue Nationale, Haute-De√ªle, and Citadel of Lille, the resisters were eventually forced to surrender. On June 1, the defeated French soldiers were marched to he Place du G√©n√©ral-de-Gaulle (also known as the Grand'Place), where the German army was headquartered.Caniot (2009), pp. 43, 45, 48, 51.Landry (1982), p. 23. Just over two years later, on September 11, 1942, Durrleman and Matter became actively involved in rescuing Jews when French police, in concert with Nazi authorities, began rounding up Jewish men, women and children from Lille and its surrounding areas. Taken to the railroad station at Five-Lille, they were slated for deportation to concentration camps. Among those arrested were Fanny Baran, her ten-year-old son Maurice, and her four-month old infant Michel, who were taken from their home at 52 Rue de la Vignette. Baran's oldest boy was rescued shortly thereafter when Georgette Vandenabaele-Franchois, Baran's sixteen-year-old maid, was able to secure help from Lille railroad workers in removing Maurice Baran from the area where he was being detained after informing guards that she had arrived to deliver clothes to the family.\\"√âva Durrleman,\\" in \\"Juste parmi les Nations,\\" Anonymes, Justes et Pers√©cut√©s durant la p√©riode Nazie dans les communes de France.\\"Durrleman, Eva\\", in \\"Les Justes de France,\\" in \\"Les Justes parmi les nations,\\" Comit√© Fran√ßais pour Yad Vashem.\\"Durrleman, Eva,\\" in \\"The Righteous Among the Nations Database,\\" Yad Vashem. Meanwhile, Durrleman and Matter worked to rescue Michel Baran. Matter, who spoke German, was able to facilitate their access to the infant by convincing the Nazi guards that she and Durrleman were German nurses sent to check on the child. Forced to make repeated visits to Fanny Baran in order to persuade her to let them save her baby's life, they realized that the guards' growing suspicion was putting them in all in jeopardy, and ultimately sent another German-speaking nurse, France Neubert, to bring the infant out of the station.\\"√âva Durrleman,\\" in \\"Juste parmi les Nations,\\" Anonymes, Justes et Pers√©cut√©s durant la p√©riode Nazie dans les communes de France.\\"Durrleman, Eva\\", in \\"Les Justes de France,\\" in \\"Les Justes parmi les nations,\\" Comit√© Fran√ßais pour Yad Vashem.\\"Durrleman, Eva,\\" in \\"The Righteous Among the Nations Database,\\" Yad Vashem.

Others rescued by Durrleman and Matter Durrleman and Matter also helped to hide Maurice Serfati and H√©l√®ne and Perla Lipsyck. Serfati, who had jumped from a train to escape his deportation to Drancy, was hidden briefly at the hospital from the Gestapo by the two women, who had told their nursing staff that he was a nephew. Several weeks later, they helped Serfati connect with an underground resistance group. They sheltered the Lipsyck sisters after their mother was deported with their father, a ritual slaughterer in Lille's Jewish community. Telling their staff that the sixteen-year-old H√©l√®ne and eighteen-year-old Perla were nursing students, the women were subsequently forced to find a new hiding place for the girls when the mother of one of their nursing students complained.\\"Durrleman, Eva\\", in \\"Les Justes de France,\\" in \\"Les Justes parmi les nations,\\" Comit√© Fran√ßais pour Yad Vashem.\\"Hommage aux infirmi√®res fran√ßaises Justes des nation\\" (\\"Tribute to nurses Righteous Nations-France\\").

Hal Horowitz from American Songwriter said of the album: \\"Burch moves further towards a looser, jazzier feel on these 11 tracks.

Molly Burch is a chanteuse, exploring the edges of noir songs with beauty, sadness, and an honest vulnerability that‚Äôs powerful yet strikingly understated\\" Abby Johnston from The Austin Chronicle stated the difference between this album and Burch's previous album by saying: \\"Burch grapples with similarly universal themes of self-doubt and anxiety, and as with her first album, the ruminations are set over beachy, sepia-washed guitar rock. Gone, however, are the more muted vocal plays.\\" Mike Vinti from Loud and Quiet admired the vocals from Burch on the album, noting: \\"It‚Äôs not that this is any less personal than that first outing, but more that Burch has embraced the parts of her craft that set her apart, most obviously her unmistakable voice. Trained in Jazz Vocal Performance, Burch is able to conjure strange and powerful pronunciations and inflections like few of her peers.\\" Lee Zimmerman from Paste said: \\"much of the album sounds almost idyllic, its ambiance seemingly more airy than effusive.

He did play-by-play commentary for five Canadian Football League teams for 22 seasons and announced at 24 Grey Cups. He also covered the 1976 Summer Olympics and 1984 Winter Olympics for CBC Sports, and later worked for radio stations in Peterborough, Ontario from 1988 to 2016. He was inducted into the media section of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1995. Early career in Saskatchewan John Badham was born on April 1, 1937, in Brock, Saskatchewan, and was the son of an Anglican priest. His family moved around to several locations in Saskatchewan, then settled in Weyburn where he finished high school. He then worked at the Weyburn Mental Hospital and met his future wife, Dorothy Issac, who was a nurse. He and his wife had four children. Badham began his sports career doing radio broadcasts for the Weyburn Beavers senior ice hockey team during the 1957‚Äì58 season. He then did play-by-play commentary for Saskatchewan Roughriders games in the Canadian Football League from 1959 to 1969, while working for CKCK-FM based in Regina, Saskatchewan. Middle career across Canada Badham moved to Toronto in 1969, and did play-by-play for the Toronto Argonauts, including three tenures on three separate radio stations. He briefly returned to Saskatchewan to do play- by-play for the Regina Pats in the Western Hockey League for the 1974 Memorial Cup. While working for CBC Sports, Badham covered the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. For his commentary at the canoe and kayak events, neither he nor the director knew anything about the sport and relied on fellow commentator Marjorie Homer-Dixon who represented Canada in kayak events at the Summer Olympic Games in 1968 and 1972. Badham became the play-by-play announcer for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on CJJD-AM in 1978. He later moved to Vancouver to be the play-by-play announcer on CFUN for the BC Lions until the 1983 season. Badham covered the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo for CBC Sports. He was in attendance when Ga√©tan Boucher won two gold medals and a bronze for Canada in speed skating at the 1984 Winter Olympics. Badham also recalled that in Sarajevo, \\"the airport was jam-packed with planes coming from all over and the military with guns were everywhere\\". Badham became the voice of the Ottawa Rough Riders to replace Ernie Calcutt who died, and worked as the sports director at CFRA 580 AM in Ottawa. His play-by-play career ended in 1988, after he had called Canadian Football League games for 22 seasons for five different teams. Badham's other work included play-by-play for at least 24 Grey Cups, the Canadian College Bowl and as a regular presenter of the Schenley Award ceremonies for the league's most value player. He also covered the Commonwealth Games, a Super Bowl, and Canadian and World Curling Championships. Later career in Peterborough Badham departed Ottawa for Peterborough after he was hired at CHEX-TV in 1988, by Wally Macht who knew him when they were competing radio news anchors in Saskatchewan during the 1960s. CHEX operated both Kruz 100.5 and The Wolf 101.5, for which Badham appeared on air until he retired from full-time work in 2011. He and his partner Mike Melnik worked together on the Kruz for more than 5,000 morning shows over a span of 20 years. Badham also briefly served as the public address announcer for Peterborough Petes home games, but resigned after a few games to remain as a journalist for the team. Badham returned to radio part- time in 2013 as host of the show The Regulars on Extra 90.5 until early in 2016, then hosted a noon-hour current events show until July 2016. He died on December 8, 2016, at the Peterborough Regional Health Centre due to liver cancer. Honours and legacy The Regina Leader-Post noted that Badham had a reputation for \\"energetic play-by-play\\" commentary of the Canadian Football League, and \\"became known for his colourful and sometimes controversial news reports and interviews\\". He was inducted into the media section of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1995. He was recognized with a career achievement award from Sports Media Canada in November 2016, accepted on his behalf by his sons while he was in hospital watching via FaceTime. The John Badham Bursary was posthumously established at Trent University, given annually to a student in journalism, with funding by donations and the annual John Badham Memorial Golf Tournament.

He received a PhD in 1918 from Utrecht University with studies on crystal formation and then went to work at Philips in Eindhoven. He also continued to work at Utrecht University and became a reader in 1927 and began to teach physics to students of medicine. After World War II he began to take an interest in electricity and the human body. He chose a triangle of points for electrical measurement which formed an asymmetric triangle, the so-called Burger's triangle, which departed from the previous idea of Willem Einthoven which was an equilateral triangle. He also pioneered the use of dyes in blood to study circulation. Burger died of a heart infarction, a year after the death of his wife. He willed his body away for science.

History The largest church in Novo Brdo was a Roman Catholic cathedral. Located northeast of the Novo Brdo Fortress, the ruins date to the 14th century. The Romanesque building was long and wide. Archaeological excavations from 1956 to 1957 revealed an older church from the 14th century and a medieval cemetery around it. Later that century, settlers from the Republic of Ragusa (now Dubrovnik) built a cathedral on the church site above the original church‚Äôs walls. For a time the cathedral was an episcopal see, and Pjet√´r Bogdani may have served here. In June 1455, the area was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, and some structures and artifacts were converted to Muslim use. In 1466, a minaret was added to the cathedral and it was thus rendered a mosque. The floor dates to later, most likely the 17th century or 18th century. The cathedral was mostly destroyed, but part of the walls was restored in 1954. There are two main components, an older west wing and a newer east wing. Fa√ßade details and frescoes are still visible on the walls, which include both carved and semi-natural stone. The cornerstones are large and light brown or brownish white. The interior collapsed onto broken round columns based on triplicate stone capitals, the latter including a square base and two round layers above. Several gravestones can be seen inside the walls, representing just some of the approximately 900 estimated to have been buried there.< Gallery Artan√´, G√´rmadhat e katedrales.JPG G√´rmadhat e katedrales n√´ Artan√´s.JPG G√´rmadhat e katedrales se Artan√´s.JPG G√´rmadhat e katedrales s√´ Artan√´s 1.JPG G√´rmadhat e katedrales s√´ Artan√´s 10.JPG G√´rmadhat e katedrales s√´ Artan√´s 11.JPG References Category:Historic sites in Kosovo Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Kosovo ","title":"Artana Cathedral"},{"id":"65157351","text":"Red Doc> is a book by classicist and poet Anne Carson, which combines poetry, prose, and drama.

His diary was published in 1853 in Germany. His travel account consisted of description, drawings and maps and thus is considered significant to understand the society of that period. Travel to Kathmandu The Prince came to Kathmandu via Birgunj, Bhimphedi, Chitlang and Chandragiri. His travel arrangements were made by British Major Lawrence. The travel was done in a caravan of elephants, ponies and number of hill palanquins. A group of Nepali soldiers also joined the group serving as a guard of honour. In Hetauda Prince Waldemar tried to hunt rhino but was not successful. In Bhimphedi he was received by Dil Bikram Thapa, the nephew of the minister Mathbar Singh Thapa. They passed Lama Dangra range, Chitlang and finally stopping at Chandragiri. On the next day, they were received by Prime Minister Mathbar Singh Thapa. Time spent in Kathmandu valley The Prince was impressed by the architecture of houses in Kathmandu and assumed it was due to the Chinese influence. He also described the temples and stone sculptures and courtyards (Bahals) in his Journal and mentioned the cobbled streets and the gutters in Kathmandu was far better than what he saw in India. Prince Waldemar also visited Pashupatinath and Nagarjun. In Lalitpur he noticed old houses, most of which was destroyed during Prithvi Narayan Shah‚Äôs invasion. When questioned why weren‚Äôt the houses repaired, he was told that ‚Äúanyone who regards himself a man of distinction constructs their own house and let that of his father decay.‚Äù Later, the Prince was taken to Swayambhunath. He also visited the barracks to see the kind of weapons manufactured in the Kingdom. On 17 February, he visited Bhaktapur where he saw houses in a poor condition. He writes in his journal that ‚Äúone of the main reasons for this was that the people here use a lot of wood when building their houses. People don‚Äôt seem to use plaster which is why the state of the houses was abysmal.‚Äù But he liked Bhaktapur because there were a lot more temples and idols. He was invited to witness a royal wedding where they displayed very good fireworks and a great procession went through the town with soldiers and marching bands. It was wedding of the King‚Äôs daughter and the son of the King of Bardiya. He also visited Kirtipur which he described as ‚Äú.. a good place, a town on top of a hill perfect for defence in battles.‚Äù He had heard stories about how the people of Kirtipur withstood the forces of Prithvi Narayan Shah for over a year and how to retaliate against that Prithvi Narayan Shah cut of the nose of everyone in the city and left it in ruins. ‚ÄúThe people still had their nose, but the place was in ruins with tumbled down walls and a castle that was barely standing.‚Äù The Prince wanted to travel around the mountain passes at Chovar but was not permitted, however, he was allowed to reach up to Nuwakot. Return On the return, Mathbar Singh Thapa bid him farewell at Chitlang. The prince left in the company of Major Lawrence and Dr. Christie. They left via Bhimphedi, Hetauda and Birgunj. In Birgunj, a tiger hunt was organised with 30 elephants carrying several Englishmen. He succeeded in shooting two tigers in eight days.

Due to the regions isolation it is relatively untouched and unexplored by humans. Over 95% of the ecoregion is covered with closed evergreen forest, and importantly for conservation, these forests exist in large contiguous blocks. As of the late 1990s, 140 mammal species were known to be in the region, and new species, such the Leaf muntjac discovered in 1997, are still being found.  Location and description  The ecoregion occupies roughly the middle third of Kachin State, the northernmost state of Myanmar. It is immediately south of the southeastern end of the greater Himalaya Mountains, but in lower mountains that range from in the valley floors to a high point of . The ecoregion features two large river valleys. The Hukawng Valley in the west is on the middle course of the Chindwin River. The eastern valley follows the parallel running of the Mali River and N'Mai River; these two rivers meet at the southern edge of the ecoregion to form the Irrawaddy River. This confluence area would have been greatly affected by the construction of the proposed Myitsone Dam, but the project has been suspended. To the north and east, the ecoregion grades in the narrow bands of the Northern Triangle temperate forests and Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests ecoregions, respectively, where higher altitudes and cooler climate create more temperate forests. To the south are the wetter Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin rain forests and Northern Indochina subtropical forests ecoregions.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Oceanic climate, subtropical highland variety (K√∂ppen climate classification (Cwb)). This climate hass cool summers and cool, but not cold, winters. It is usually associated with coastal areas in mid-latitudes, but is also experienced at higher altitudes inland. Temperatures and precipitation are relatively even throughout the year, with no month averaging below , and no month averaging above .  Flora and fauna  The ecoregion is a biodiversity hotspot, due to its location at the meeting zone of major floristic zones: Assam-Indian, Eastern Himalayan, Indo-Malayan, and Chinese. The remoteness, relatively low human population, and isolation have also contributed to the area's ecological presevation. Most of the area is covered in closed forest - 80% broadleaf evergreen and 15% needle-leaf evergreen. Altitude zonation is important: below 2,400 meters Indo-Malayan species are dominant, while Indo-Himalayan are found mostly above. Below 915 meters the forests are tropical and rainforest trees of genus Magnoliaceae, Lauraceae, and Dipterocarpaceae. Above that are trees of genus Fagaceae, and Meliaceae, plus some tree ferns and climbing palms. Trees in mature forests are typically draped in lianas. Over 140 species of mammals, and 370 species of birds are known in the ecoregion. The large un-fragmented forests are valuable for supporting large mammals, including the endangered Tiger Panthera tigris, the endangered Red panda Ailurus fulgens, then endangered Asian elephant Elephas maximus, and vulnerable Takin Budorcas taxicolor.  Protected areas  Officially protected areas cover over 35% of the ecoregion, including: * Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, covers 17,373 km2, mostly of evergreen and mixed deciduous forest. * Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary, * Bumhpa Bum Wildlife Sanctuary, a mountainous area of tropical evergreen forest and hill pine forest.

E. Verrill in 1879. It is the only genus in the family Nectonematidae described by H. B. Ward in 1892, in the order Nectonematoidea, and in the class Nectonematoida. The genus contains five species, including all marine species of horsehair worm. All species have parasitic larval stages inhabiting crustacean hosts, and free-living adult stages that swim in open water. Taxonomy Nectonematoida is one of two classes within the phylum Nematomorpha, the other being Gordioida. Gordioida is a significantly larger taxon, with over 300 known species. Nematomorpha are also known as horsehair worms or Gordian worms, and form a sister-group to the nematodes. The following classification shows the place of Nectonematoida within the protostomes according to Minelli (2008) and Tedersoo (2017): Within Nectonematoida only a single genus, Nectonema, is known, with five species so far described: * Nectonematoida ** Nectonematoidea *** Nectonematidae **** Nectonema ***** Nectonema agile ***** Nectonema melanocephalum ***** Nectonema munidae ***** Nectonema svensksundi ***** Nectonema zealandica Three species are known from the North Atlantic, including N. agile from the North American and European coasts, as well as in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. N. munidae has been recorded in fjords near Bergen, Norway in the North Sea, and N. svensksundi is known from Svalbard. Additional unconfirmed reports of possible Nectonema specimens have come from Western Greenland, Brazil and Sierra Leone. In the Pacific Ocean, N. melanocephalum was recorded off the Balabalagan Islands in the Makassar Strait of Indonesia, while N. zealandica has been recorded off the coast of New Zealand. There are also unconfirmed reports of possible Nectonema from Japan. Description Nectonema has not been extensively studied, and most of what is known about the genus is based on the two best-studied species, N. agile and N. munidae. There are several unique features that distinguish marine Nematomorphs (nectonematids) from freshwater Nematomorph species (gordiids). Studies indicate differences in muscle cell structure as well as an anterior body cavity. While gordiids possess a single longitudinal ventral nerve cord, nectonematids possess an additional dorsal nerve cord. Nectonematids also possess a blindly-ending intestine and double rows of dorsal and ventral cuticular natatory bristles. In males, sperm sacs attached to the dorsal epidermis are the gonads, while females possess a vesicle-rich tissue called a gono-parenchyne during early developmental stages. Additionally, spines are formed on nectonematid eggs after they make contact with seawater. Like all horsehair worms, there is a lack of excretory organs or blood. The digestive system does not primarily fulfil the role of nutrient uptake, which instead likely occurs through the cuticle, but rather the storage of substances that are taken up through the cuticle. Layers of cuticle have been observed, with an adult cuticle forming underneath the larval cuticle, in addition to a cellular epidermis. The nervous system consists of a circumesophageal nerve ring that functions as a simple brain along with two longitudinal nerve cords located dorsally and ventrally, though the dorsal part of the nerve ring reduces as individuals mature. The sensory system is either largely absent or poorly understood. Bristles and probable cilium have been observed on the cuticle, which appear to be connected to the nervous system in a sensory role. Additionally, giant cells with a diamater up to 400 Œºm have been observed in the anterior cavity of three species (N. agile, N. munidae and N. zealandica) which have been posited to play a role in sensory percetion by Ward (1892) and Bresciani (1991). The cells appear to be connected to the nerve chord via axons, supporting this interpretation. However, their potential sensory role remains unclear. Species exhibit sexual dimorphism in their size, with males growing to lengths from to depending on species, while females of all species are longer than males, growing to between and in length. Larval nectonematids have only been described once, with the smallest being 350 Œºm in length and possessing rings of spines as well as cuticular structures denoted \\"jaws\\" on the anterior. Ecology and life cycle Nectonematids spend the larval stage of their life cycle as parasites of decapod crustaceans. At least 28 host species have been identified, including hermit crabs, crabs, caridean shrimp and Eusergestes prawns; a single N. agile individual has also been found within an American lobster (Homarus americanus) specimen. Larvae inhabit hosts' body cavity, especially in the region of the thorax; typically, a decapod will be host to a single nectonematid, however as many as nine have been observed inhabiting a single crab. Evidence is conflicting on possible correlations between the size and sex of hosts and nectonematid infection rates and growth sizes. Conflicting observations also exist on whether the parasites cause internal damage to their hosts, with Mouchet (1931) and Leslie et al. (1981) reporting damage to male reproductive organs in host species Pagurus bernhardus, Anapagurus hyndmanni and Cancer irroratus, while Brinkmann (1930), Nouvel & Nouvel (1934) and Nielsen (1969) did not observe any tissue alteration. After emerging from their hosts, adult nematomorphs use their dorsal and ventral double rows of bristles to swim through open water. In preparation for reproduction, mature females' body cavities become filled with eggs, while males form sperm sacs. Unlike gordiids, nectonematids copulate, with males inserting their posterior end into the genital opening of the female.

It enjoyed widespread popularity throughout the English- speaking world during the nineteenth century. History Thomas Dunn English wrote the poem \\"Ben Bolt\\" in 1842 at the specific request of Nathaniel Parker Willis. While he was then an active participant in the New York City literary scene and lived much of his life in New Jersey, English is popularly believed to have written the poem while visiting Tazewell, Virginia on a hunting trip, as claimed by regional folklorists. The poem was published in the New-York Mirror, appearing in print for the first time on September 2, 1843. The most popular musical arrangement of \\"Ben Bolt\\" was composed by Nelson Kneass in 1848. A widely reported story is that Kneass produced the song as accompaniment to a play about the recent Battle of Buena Vista, borrowing the music from a German melody. However, a search through Ludwig Erk's folk song compilation Deutscher Liederschatz produced no songs with similar melodies, and it is much more likely that the tune was an original composition by Kneass.Krohn, p. 38. Lyrics The poem, which is five stanzas long, describes nostalgic scenes from the life of the anonymous narrator. The narrator, who addresses each memory to the title character, begins the first stanza by describing the life and death of a woman named Alice. Some variation occurs in the beginning of the poem's fourth stanza. In the original manuscript, the stanza begins as follows: However, when the poem was arranged to music, the lyrics of that section were changed slightly, so that the relevant lines were as follows: This mild bowdlerization met with some annoyance from the author. Thomas Dunn English, writing to Harper's Bazaar, commented: \\"I must protest against this change, because the school-masters of between sixty and seventy years since were, to my memory, 'cruel and grim'; they were neither kind nor true. They seemed to think the only way to get learning into a boy's head was by the use of the rod. There may have been exceptions, but I never met them.\\"Gilder & Gilder, p. 31. Cultural impact Shortly after being published, \\"Ben Bolt\\" vaulted to nationwide popularity, single-handedly establishing Thomas Dunn English's literary reputation and remaining relevant as a classic American song throughout the nineteenth century. It swiftly became the subject of both tribute and parody, with many sets of variant lyrics. \\"Ben Bolt\\" circulated widely in unauthorized broadside format and was selected by Rufus Wilmot Griswold for his anthology The Poets and Poetry of America. The ballad was a particular favorite of Abraham Lincoln during his lifetime. In literature \\"Ben Bolt\\" had its popularity rejuvenated in 1894 when George du Maurier published his novel Trilby, which uses the song as a plot point. The title character Trilby O'Ferrall is portrayed as incapable of skillful singing when she delivers a tone-deaf version of \\"Ben Bolt\\" near the novel's beginning. Later, the failure of Svengali's hypnotic powers are revealed when Trilby is once again incapable of singing \\"Ben Bolt\\" with any degree of skill. The success of the novel and the subsequent Trilbyana craze promoted interest in the songs of Trilby. In his old age, Thomas Dunn English contributed a manuscript copy of \\"Ben Bolt\\" to an 1895 Trilby-themed charity auction for the benefit of the New York Kindergarten Association.Gilder & Gilder, p. 20. As a widely known song of the nineteenth century, \\"Ben Bolt\\" was popularly used as a cultural reference in books set during that era, whether published in the nineteenth century or decades later. It is quoted in the novel Dr. Sevier by George Washington Cable and by Laura Ingalls Wilder in By the Shores of Silver Lake. Leopold Bloom contemplated Ben Bolt along with other stories about long-lost loves in James Joyce's Ulysses. James Thurber illustrated \\"Ben Bolt\\" as part of a poetry illustration series for The New Yorker.

He initiated and completed the first round-the-world trip using solar energy between September 2010 and May 2012 aboard the MS catamaran PlanetSolar. In 2015, he carried out the first polar solar navigation in the Arctic Ocean. He is the founder and pilot of the SolarStratos project, the first solar plane in the stratosphere. In August 2020, he made the first jump off of an electric plane and the first solar free fall. Rapha√´l Domjan is a pilot, mountaineer, diver and parachutist. He is a member of the Explorer Club of New-York as well as the Soci√©t√© des Explorateurs Fran√ßais. Biography Rapha√´l Domjan was born on January 19, 1972 in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland and raised in Lausanne. In 2001, he co-founded the company Horus Networks S√†rl, the world's first solar web server. In 2005, Domjan launched his first solar-powered round-the-world project. He founded PlanetSolar SA then, in 2007, the PlanetSolar Foundation. The PlanetSolar catamaran was built in Germany between 2008 and 2010, financed by the German entrepreneur Immo Stroeher. In 2007, he travelled between Martinique and Dominica in the expedition of the Sun 21, the first solar boat to cross the Atlantic using solar energy. On this occasion he probably made the first dive from a solar boat in history. He also participated in the crossing of the United States of America north/south with Louis Palmer aboard the SolarTaxi, a solar and electric car. Between 2010 and 2012, he made the first solar-powered round-the-world trip aboard PlanetSolar as the leader of the expedition. In 2012, Domjan became a speaker and member of the Global Speaker Association. Since then he has given lectures regarding his world tour and explaining the reasons which pushed him to go on it. In 2014, he brought together an international team and launched the SolarStratos mission, the objective of which was to reach the stratosphere with a solar plane. He plans to perform this record flight in 2022. In 2015, along with the sailor Anne Quemere, he attempted to make the first crossing of the Northwest Passage in a solar powered kayak. Unfortunately, the weather conditions were unfavorable and they had to turn back after 300 km. The expedition nevertheless constitutes the first solar polar navigation in history. On 25 August 2020, he jumped out of the SolarStratos HB-SXA solar plane in Payerne, Switzerland, with test pilot Miguel Iturmendi in command of the plane, the first jump off of an electric plane and the first free fall in solar history. He dropped several hundred meters and reached a speed of 150kmh.

After passing through the Atlantic Ocean, Panama Canal, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Suez Canal and Mediterranean, the boat reached Monaco on 4 May 2012.https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/4/2999750/planetsolar-solar-powered-boat- trip/comment/101591207 after 585 days and 60,006 km traveled. PlanetSolar crew members during the first solar world tour (2010-2012) Rapha√´l Domjan was the expedition leader of PlanetSolar during his round the world trip between 2010 and 2012. Patrick Marchesseau was the captain of PlanetSolar from Monaco to Noum√©a, and Erwann le Rouzic took over from Noum√©a until the return to the starting point, Monaco. They were accompanied by Jens Langwasser, a boatman, and Christian Oschenbein, an electrical engineer. Firsts and records During its round-the-world trip, PlanetSolar achieved a number of firsts: the first solar-powered round-the-world trip,https://www.raphaeldomjan.com/en/projects-expeditions/planetsolar/ first trip around the world by solar boat, and first crossing of the Indian Ocean and Red Sea with solar energy. In terms of records, PlanetSolar is also the largest solar boat in the world, and is the solar vehicle that traveled the longest distance (60,023 km). Stamps After the first round the world trip by solar boat, La Poste Monaco issued a postage stamp on the adventure PlanetSolar with a value of 77 centimes Euros representing PlanetSolar in Monaco. SolarStratos SolarStratos is a project officially begun in March 2014 by Rapha√´l Domjan. It is a two-seater solar plane built by Calin Gologan. Rapha√´l Domjan plans with his team to achieve an absolute altitude record. The SolarStratos mission should allow Rapha√´l Domjan to reach the stratosphere at more than 18,000 meters, an altitude never reached with a conventional propulsion aircraft. According to SolarStratos, this project would aim to demonstrate that renewable energy makes it possible to go beyond what is possible with conventional propulsion methods.https://phys.org/news/2017-05-swiss-solar-plane-flight-aims.html The SolarStratos aircraft was unveiled to the public on December 7, 2016. Ultimately, and after the record flight planned for 2022, Rapha√´l Domjan and the SolarStratos team wish to commercialize the technologies developed during the stratospheric mission, in particular by developing stratospheric solar drones.

The theorem that every polytope is uniquely determined up to translation by this information was proven by Hermann Minkowski; it has been called \\"Minkowski's theorem\\", although the same name has also been given to several unrelated results of Minkowski. The Minkowski problem for polytopes should also be distinguished from the Minkowski problem, on specifying convex shapes by their curvature. Specification and necessary conditions For any d-dimensional polytope, one can specify its collection of facet directions and measures by a finite set of d-dimensional nonzero vectors, one per facet, pointing perpendicularly outward from the facet, with length equal to the (d-1)-dimensional measure of its facet.This description of how to specify the directions and measures follows ; and uses slightly different information. To be a valid specification of a bounded polytope, these vectors must span the full d-dimensional space, and no two can be parallel with the same sign. Additionally, their sum must be zero; this requirement corresponds to the observation that, when the polytope is projected perpendicularly onto any hyperplane, the projected measure of its top facets and its bottom facets must be equal, because the top facets project to the same set as the bottom facets. Minkowski's uniqueness theorem It is a theorem of Hermann Minkowski that these necessary conditions are sufficient: every finite set of vectors that spans the whole space, has no two parallel with the same sign, and sums to zero describes the facet directions and measures of a polytope. More, the shape of this polytope is uniquely determined by this information: every two polytopes that give rise to the same set of vectors are translations of each other. Blaschke sums The sets of vectors representing two polytopes can be added by taking the union of the two sets and, when the two sets contain parallel vectors with the same sign, replacing them by their sum. The resulting operation on polytope shapes is called the Blaschke sum. It can be used to decompose arbitrary polytopes into simplices, and centrally symmetric polytopes into parallelotopes. Generalizations With certain additional information (including separating the facet direction and size into a unit vector and a real number, which may be negative, providing an additional bit of information per facet) it is possible to generalize these existence and uniqueness results to certain classes of non-convex polyhedra. It is also possible to specify three-dimensional polyhedra uniquely by the direction and perimeter of their facets. Minkowski's theorem and the uniqueness of this specification by direction and perimeter have a common generalization: whenever two three-dimensional convex polyhedra have the property that their facets have the same directions and no facet of one polyhedron can be translated into a proper subset of the facet with the same direction of the other polyhedron, the two polyhedra must be translates of each other. However, this version of the theorem does not generalize to higher dimensions. See also *Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem *Cauchy's theorem (geometry) References Category:Polytopes Category:Hermann Minkowski ","title":"Minkowski problem for polytopes"},{"id":"65158329","text":"In convex geometry and the geometry of convex polytopes, the Blaschke sum of two polytopes is a polytope that has a facet parallel to each facet of the two given polytopes, with the same measure. When both polytopes have parallel facets, the measure of the corresponding facet in the Blaschke sum is the sum of the measures from the two given polytopes. Blaschke sums exist and are unique up to translation, as can be proven using the theory of the Minkowski problem for polytopes. They can be used to decompose arbitrary polytopes into simplices, and centrally symmetric polytopes into parallelotopes. Although Blaschke sums of polytopes are used implicitly in the work of Hermann Minkowski, Blaschke sums are named for mathematician and Nazi Wilhelm Blaschke, who defined a corresponding operation for smooth convex sets. The Blaschke sum operation can be extended to arbitrary convex bodies, generalizing both the polytope and smooth cases, using measures on the Gauss map. Definition For any d-dimensional polytope, one can specify its collection of facet directions and measures by a finite set of d-dimensional nonzero vectors, one per facet, pointing perpendicularly outward from the facet, with length equal to the (d-1)-dimensional measure of its facet. As Hermann Minkowski proved, a finite set of nonzero vectors describes a polytope in this way if and only if it spans the whole d-dimensional space, no two are collinear with the same sign, and the sum of the set is the zero vector. The polytope described by this set has a unique shape, in the sense that any two polytopes described by the same set of vectors are translates of each other. The Blaschke sum X# Y of two polytopes X and Y is defined by combining the vectors describing their facet directions and measures, in the obvious way: form the union of the two sets of vectors, except that when both sets contain vectors that are parallel and have the same sign, replace each such pair of parallel vectors by its sum. This operation preserves the necessary conditions for Minkowski's theorem on the existence of a polytope described by the resulting set of vectors, and this polytope is the Blaschke sum. The two polytopes need not have the same dimension as each other, as long as they are both defined in a common space of high enough dimension to contain both: lower-dimensional polytopes in a higher-dimensional space are defined in the same way by sets of vectors that span a lower-dimensional subspace of the higher-dimensional space, and these sets of vectors can be combined without regard to the dimensions of the spaces they span. Decomposition Blaschke sums can be used to decompose polytopes into simpler polytopes. In particular, every d-dimensional convex polytope with n facets can be represented as a Blaschke sum of at most n-d simplices (not necessarily of the same dimension). Every d-dimensional centrally symmetric convex polytope can be represented as a Blaschke sum of parallelotopes. And every d-dimensional convex polytope can be represented as a Blaschke sum of d-dimensional convex polytopes, each having at most 2d facets. Generalizations The Blaschke sum can be extended from polytopes to arbitrary bounded convex sets, by representing the amount of surface in each direction using a measure on the Gauss map of the set instead of using a finite set of vectors, and adding sets by adding their measures. Kneser‚ÄìS√ºss inequality The volume V(X# Y) of the Blaschke sum of two d-dimensional polytopes or convex bodies X and Y obeys an inequality known as the Kneser‚ÄìS√ºss inequality, an analogue of the Brunn‚ÄìMinkowski theorem on volumes of Minkowski sums of convex bodies: :V(X# Y)^{(d-1)/d}\\\\ge V(X)^{(d-1)/d}+V(Y)^{(d-1)/d}.

The release marks Halsey's first EP since Room 93 (2014) that is not a live session or remix EP. Collabs was released with no prior announcement and features six songs she had previously released that were collaborations with other artists. Some of the songs are included on her third studio album Manic (2020) while others were originally non-album releases. The EP features appearances by Dominic Fike, Alanis Morissette, Suga of BTS, Juice Wrld, and Marshmello. Background On July 30, 2020 a fan pointed out on Twitter that a random extended play had appeared on Spotify under the release date of January 15, 2020. This caused speculation and prompted a response from Halsey herself. She claimed it was something the record label did, and that she herself did not really know it was going to happen. The EP was released to other streaming platforms on July 31, 2020. Songs All of the songs on the EP are collaborations between Halsey and other artists. The EP was preceded by the release two singles and one promotional single.  Singles  The first single released was \\"Be Kind\\", released on May 1, 2020, with American producer Marshmello. The song is an \\"emotional\\" EDM track song that describes trust issues in romantic relationships. The song peaked in the top 20 in 8 different countries and the top 40 in many more. The music video, directed by Hannah Lux Davis, was released nearly two months later on July 28, 2020 and currently has over 33 million views. The second single, \\"Life's a Mess\\" with late American rapper Juice Wrld, was released on July 6, 2020. The song served as the third single for Juice Wrld's posthumous third studio album, Legends Never Die (2020). The song peaked at numbers 8, 9, and 11 in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom respectively, and also charted in 16 other countries. The official song visualizer, directed by Chad Ross, was released alongside the song and features artist David Garibaldi painting a picture of Juice Wrld and Halsey together.  Promotional single  On December 6, 2019, Halsey released \\"Suga's Interlude\\" with Korean rapper Suga as the third promotional single for Manic. The song was released simultaneously with the album's second promotional single, \\"Finally // Beautiful Stranger\\". \\"Suga's Interlude\\" serves as one of three interlude tracks on Manic, all three of which are featured on Collabs, and marks the second time Halsey collaborated with a member of BTS, the first being when she featured on the group's 2019 single, \\"Boy with Luv\\". The song received minimal promotion, due to the release of the \\"Finally // Beautiful Stranger\\" music video and BTS promoting new group projects instead.  Other songs  On January 9, 2019, the Juice Wrld remix of Halsey's Manic lead single, \\"Without Me\\", was released. The song was one of two official \\"Without Me\\" remixes. Halsey said she asked Juice Wrld to do a remix because he inspired the \\"vibe\\" of the song. On January 17, 2020, Halsey released Manic. In addition to \\"Suga's Interlude\\", two other interlude tracks were featured on the album. The first, \\"Dominic's Interlude\\", featured American singer and rapper Dominic Fike. The interlude was given a mini music video used during the Manic World Tour between Halsey's performances of \\"Forever ... (Is a Long Time)\\" and \\"I Hate Everybody\\". The second interlude track, \\"Alanis' Interlude\\", featuring Canadian-American singer Alanis Morissette, is a bisexual anthem about sexual freedom.

It was later not respected by the allies, which led to the collapse of the First Hungarian Republic and its replacement by the Hungarian Soviet Republic in March 1919. Prelude After 4 years of heavy fighting, the armies of the Central Powers in Southern Europe collapsed from the second half of September 1918 when the French and Serb armies managed a breakthrough at the Battle of Dobro Pole. On 29 September 1918 , the allies signed the Armistice of Salonica with effectively ended Bulgaria's participation in World War I. This left the Balkans wide open for the French and Serb forces of the Macedonian front, which advanced almost unopposed through Serbia and liberated Belgrade on 1 November. Around the same time, the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October, the disintegrating Austro-Hungarian Army in Northern Italy signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November and Romania reentered the war on the sides of the allies on 10 November. Also on 10 November, the French Army crossed the Danube river, advancing in the direction of the heartland of Hungary. Count K√°rolyi, leading the Hungarian government, had no option but to accept the invitation of French General Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey to come to Belgrade to sign an armistice. Terms The terms of the armistice called for the reduction of the new Hungarian Army to 8 divisions. The Hungarian Army had to withdraw behind the line Beszterce - Marosv√°s√°rhely - Arad - P√©cs - Drava River. This territory remained Hungarian until a final general peace treaty was concluded, and the civil authorities were allowed to remain in place. All allied prisoners of war in Hungary were to be released. Sources *Krizman, Bogdan (1970). ¬´The Belgrade Armistice of 13 November 1918¬ª.

They originally formed a grange of Shaftesbury Abbey. The farmhouse, the inner and outer gatehouses and the barn, reputedly the largest in England, are all Grade I listed buildings. History and description Shaftesbury Abbey was founded by Alfred the Great in 888. The first religious foundation established for women in England, Alfred's daughter, √Üthelgifu was installed as abbess. By the Middle Ages, the abbey had become a very wealthy institution, and it established the grange at Place Farm as the administrative centre of its Wiltshire estates. Nikolaus Pevsner, in his Wiltshire Pevsner, dates the buildings at Place Farm to the 14th and 15th centuries. Anthony Quiney describes the \\"magnificent scale\\" of the complex. The Victoria County History notes that the ancillary features included two chapels, two larder houses, stables, houses for oxen, hay, and charcoal, and a number of fishponds. Margaret Wood, in her history, The Medieval English House, wrote that although the gatehouses are not properly defensive in a military sense, they would provide protection \\"against bands of marauders or discontented peasantry\\". At the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536 Place Farm passed into private ownership. In the 19th century, the farm became part of the Fonthill estate of the Morrison family, who continue in ownership. The tithe barn is let to Messum's, the art dealers, while other farm buildings are occupied by the charity, International Cat Care. The farm house at Place Farm is a Grade I listed building. Dating mainly from the 15th century, it was renovated in the 19th. It is constructed of rubble stone, with a tiled roof. A room in the house has a frieze which carries the initials AM, that probably reference the collector Alfred Morrison who owned the estate in the 19th century. The estate buildings which form three sites of a courtyard are listed Grade II. The tithe barn, which at 200ft long is reputed to be the largest barn in England, has a Grade I listing. The barn was originally tiled, but now has a thatched roof, which was renewed in 1971. The barn is thirteen bays long, with a cruck truss roof structure. The inner and outer gatehouses are also listed at Grade I. Historic England considers the complex at Place Farm, \\"one of the finest surviving groups of monastic grange buildings in England\\".

In the 1920s, due to urban development, the brook was turned into a network of drainage channels, which are partially covered and partially open. The brook's water source is runoff and groundwater. In the 1970s, the Eric Singleton Bird Sanctuary was built near the mouth of the brook. Water from the Bayswater Brook flows through the wetlands at the bird sanctuary before continuing to the Swan River. It has an average annual flow of 7.5 gigalitres. The Bayswater Brook catchment is the largest urban catchment in the Perth metropolitan area, with an area of . The suburbs which are in the catchment area are Bassendean, Bayswater, Bedford, Dianella, Eden Hill, Morley and Noranda. There are several lakes and parks along the Bayswater Brook. They include Browns Lake Reserve, Nora Hughes Park and Russell Street Park in Morley, and Waverley Pola Reserve in Dianella. The Bayswater Brook is the fifth highest contributor of nutrients into the Swan‚ÄìCanning river system. The catchment area is on Bassendean Sands, which are poor at keeping nutrients. In 2015, the Eric Singleton Bird Sanctuary underwent a rehabilitation project to reduce the amount of nutrients and rubbish entering the Swan River from the Bayswater Brook.

He was a general under the Grand Marshal Huan Wen who distinguished himself as a powerful warrior in his campaigns. According to folklore, he was also a prodigy of the Chinese god, Erlang Shen, who helped the people of Xiangyang defeat a river dragon that terrorized the area.  Career under Huan Wen  Deng Xia was from Chen Commandary and his father, Deng Yue (ÈÑßÂ∂Ω), once served the government. Deng Xia's strength was very well- known even among the common people, who began comparing him to the famous Han dynasty general Fan Kuai. He joined Huan Wen's army and became his Army Advisor. He eventually rose to the rank of General of the Best of the Army and Administrator of Jingling. Very few is recorded about his exact activities in Huan Wen's campaigns, but it was said he followed him in many of them which made him famous at the time.( ÈÅêÂ≠óÊáâÈÅ†„ÄÇÂãáÂäõÁµï‰∫∫ÔºåÊ∞£ËìãÁï∂ÊôÇÔºåÊôÇ‰∫∫Êñπ‰πãÊ®äÂô≤„ÄÇÊ°ìÊ∫´‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÂèÉËªçÔºåÊï∏ÂæûÊ∫´ÂæÅ‰ºêÔºåÊõÜÂÜ†ËªçÂ∞áËªçÔºåÊï∏ÈÉ°Â§™ÂÆàÔºåËôüÁÇ∫ÂêçÂ∞á„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 81 In 352, Deng Xia assisted Zhou Fu (Âë®Êí´) in besieging Xiao Jingwen (Ëï≠Êï¨Êñá) although Zhou Fu had to eventually withdraw.

In folklore  The people of Deng Xia's time believed that he was a general of the Chinese god, Erlang Shen. A folklore tells of Deng Xia killing a river dragon which parallels that of Erlang Shen's. In the Mian River, it was said that there was a deep pool where lived a dragon who terrorized the people of Xiangyang. Deng Xia, serving as the Grand Warden of Xiangyang at the time, pulled out a sword and dived into the depths to kill it. According to the Book of Jin, the dragon coiled around his feet, and Deng Xia quickly chopped the dragon into pieces. The river ran red with blood, and with Deng Xia's bravery, the people of Xiangyang no longer worried about the dragon.(Ë•ÑÈôΩÂüéÂåóÊ≤îÊ∞¥‰∏≠ÊúâËõüÔºåÂ∏∏ÁÇ∫‰∫∫ÂÆ≥ÔºåÈÅêÈÅÇÊãîÂäçÂÖ•Ê∞¥ÔºåËõüÁπûÂÖ∂Ë∂≥ÔºåÈÅêÊèÆÂäçÊà™ËõüÊï∏ÊÆµËÄåÂá∫„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, volume 81 Liu Jingshu's Yiyuan provided a different take on the story. Deng Xia did indeed went into the river to fight the dragon, but rather than with a sword, he defeated it with his fists and brought it ashore to kill it. However, his mother stopped him, saying that dragons are sacred creatures and it would be wrong to kill them. Instead, she told him that he should cast an incantation on it to stop it from being violent. Deng Xia did so and released it into the river, and the dragon no longer posed a threat to the people of Xiangyang.(ËçäÂ∑û‰∏äÊòéÊµ¶Ê≤îÊ∞¥ÈöàÔºåÊΩ≠Ê•µÊ∑±„ÄÇÂ∏∏ÊúâËõüÊÆ∫‰∫∫ÔºåÊµ¥Ê±≤Ê≠ªËÄÖ‰∏çËÑ´Ê≠≤„ÄÇÂçáÂπ≥‰∏≠ÔºåÈô≥ÈÉ°ÈÑßÈÅêÂ≠óÊáâÈÅôÔºåÁÇ∫Ë•ÑÈôΩÂ§™ÂÆà„ÄÇÁ¥†ÂãáÂÅ•ÔºåÊÜ§ËÄåÂÖ•Ê∞¥Ë¶ìËõüÔºåÂæó‰πã„ÄÇ‰æøËàâÊã≥Êõ≥ËëóÂ≤∏ÔºåÊ¨≤Êñ´ÊÆ∫„ÄÇÊØçË™û‰∫ëÔºö„ÄåËõüÊòØÁ•ûÁâ©ÔºåÂØßÂøçÊÆ∫‰πãÔºü‰ªäÂèØÂíí‰ª§ÂãøÂæ©ÁÇ∫ÊÇ£„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅêÂííËÄåÊîæÁÑâ„ÄÇËá™Ëå≤ËøÑ‰ªäÔºåÈÅÇÁÑ°Ê≠§ÊÇ£„ÄÇ‰∏Ä‰∫ëÔºöÈÅêÊãîÂäçÂÖ•Ê∞¥ÔºåËõüÁπûÂÖ∂Ë∂≥„ÄÇÈÅêËá™ÊèÆÂäçÔºåÊà™ËõüÊï∏ÊÆµÔºåÊµÅË°ÄÊ∞¥‰∏πÔºåÂãáÂÜ†Áï∂ÊôÇ„ÄÇÊñºÂæåÈÅÇÁÑ°ËõüÊÇ£„ÄÇ) Yiyuan, Volume 3 Deng Xia's valour earned him the title \\"Erlang Shen\\" and there is a temple dedicated to him in Zhongqingli (Âø†Ê∏ÖÈáå), Hangzhou.Cheng Manchao (1995).

There are an estimated 2,000 Haitian-Americans living in the Salisbury metropolitan area. The community is growing quickly and Haitian businesses, restaurants, media, and religious and cultural organizations have been created to cater to the needs of the population. Demographics The Haitian community of Salisbury originated because Haitian economic migrants were employed by local poultry processing plants such as Perdue Farms, Tyson Foods, and Mountaire Farms. Many members of the community came to Salisbury from Florida or New York. In 1993, only a few dozen Haitian- Americans lived in Salisbury. In 2010, the Haitian-American population of Salisbury was 963. As of 2017, there were 1,967 Haitian-Americans in Salisbury. History In 2016, local Haitian-American activists organized to gather funds for Haitian victims of Hurricane Matthew. Haitians in Salisbury have been disproportionately effected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Maryland. Lack of access to resources, linguistic barriers, and other factors have exacerbated the rate of COVID-19 in the Haitian community. The Salisbury Coronavirus Recovery Task Force has been credited with having a substantial influence on the Haitian community's experience of COVID-19 by promoting inclusion, expanding community outreach, and providing more translators. Culture Several media outlets have formed in Salisbury to cater to the Haitian population. The Wozo Marketing Group offers television programming and a radio station called Radio Wozo. Content is offered in both English and Haitian Creole. Wozo's programming is directed at Haitians who may not speak English or have an advanced education, and thus otherwise might not be knowledgeable about local news. The WRBY-LP radio station offers religious broadcasting in Haitian Creole. There are several Haitian restaurants in Salisbury, including the Caribbean Creole Cafe, Glory Caribbean Express, Grandma's Worldwide Caribbean Restaurant. Other restaurants in Salisbury serve Caribbean cuisine, such as the Jamaican restaurants Caribbean Flava and Reggae Soul Cafe. There are several Haitian churches in Salisbury, including Word of Life Center and the First Haitian UMC of Salisbury. The Word of Life Center conducts services in Haitian Creole and has a congregation of more than 300 people. An annual Haitian Flag Day Festival is held in downtown Salisbury to celebrate Haitian art, culture, music, and cuisine. The festival is organized by the Word of Life church and Rebirth, a Haitian-American community organization. County officials in Wicomico have declared the month of May to be Haitian Heritage Month.

It was recorded in January 2008 at Swiss Radio DRS2 in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, and was released in 2009 by Intakt Records, together with Frith and the ARTE Quartett's first collaborative album, Still Urban, which was also recorded in January 2008 at Swiss Radio DRS2. The Big Picture comprises two suites of music, The Big Picture for saxophone quartet with two improvising soloists, composed by Frith in 2000, and Freedom in Fragments for saxophone quartet, composed by Frith in 1994. Freedom in Fragments was originally written for the Rova Saxophone Quartet and was performed by them on Frith's 2002 solo album Freedom in Fragments. Frith does not perform on The Big Picture. Reception In a review at All About Jazz, Marc Medwin stated that The Big Picture illustrates Frith's \\"fascinating approach to composition\\". He called the ARTE Quartett's playing \\"virtuosic\\", especially in their handling of the Freedom in Fragments suite. Medwin found \\"Song and Dance\\" \\"much livelier and ... more fluid\\" than the original Rova Saxophone Quartet's interpretation, and \\"Red Rag\\" \\"particularly infectious\\". Reviewing the album in Jazzwise, Duncan Heining described The Big Picture suite as \\"a series of miniatures\\" that is \\"remarkably concise, focused and magnificently performed\\". He said the composition is reminiscent of Var√®se or Xenakis. Heining called Freedom in Fragments \\"an essay on the subject of musical freedom\\" that \\"twists and turns across the landscape\\". He opined that the music is \\"[d]emanding and challenging\\" and calls for \\"repeated listening\\". Michael Rosenstein wrote in a review of the album in Cadence that The Big Picture suite is made up of six short pieces that \\"act as episodic juxtapositions of the extremes of timbre and range of the saxophones\\". He said there is \\"plenty of textural variety\\" and occasionally melodies surface. In Freedom in Fragments Rosenstein complimented the quartet's handling of Frith's \\"themes and tight arrangements\\", but did feel that the constraints of the composition leaves \\"little room for the group to stretch things much\\". Writing in The Wire, Julian Cowley called the Big Picture suite \\"a lively negotiation\\" between the Arte Quartett and the \\"less orderly improvised responses\\" of the guest pianist and drummer. In Freedom in Fragments he said the quartet \\"explore[s] unconventional techniques\\", plays \\"folksy\\" and \\"noir melancholy\\" tunes, and each member contributes an improvised solo. But Cowley found that, on the whole, the music did not \\"mov[e] or stimulat[e]\\" him. He stated that \\"saxophone quartets leave me with an uncomfortable sense of the sentimental convenience of family groups\\". Track listing Source: CD liner notes, Fred Frith discography.
