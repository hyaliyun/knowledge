Netherlands-born Frederick Philipse I and two partners made the initial purchase of land that had been part of a Dutch patroonship owned by Adriaen van der Donck. Philipse subsequently bought his partners out and added more land before being granted a royal charter in 1693 for the estate, becoming its first Lord. After his death, the manor was split between his son and grandson, both of whom continued its development. Among the family's numerous enterprises, the Philipses engaged in the Atlantic slave trade, using their own slaves to construct most of the buildings on the Philipsburg property. The tenant farmers on the manor represented a diverse population of Europeans. The manor's property was confiscated during the American Revolution when Loyalist Frederick Philipse III, its third and final lord, was attainted for treason by New York's revolutionary government in 1779. The estate's land was used as collateral to raise money to fund the rebellion and later sold at auction. Some of the original structures still stand, including the Philipsburg Manor House in Sleepy Hollow, Philipse Manor Hall (the family seat) in Yonkers, and the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, all of which are National Historic Landmarks. History Philipsburg Manor House at the Upper Mills in today's village of Sleepy Hollow, New York The land that would become Philipsburg Manor was first bought from Adriaen van der Donck, who had been granted a Dutch patroonship in New Netherland before the English takeover in 1664. Frederick Philipse I, Thomas Delavall, and Thomas Lewis purchased the first tracts in 1672 in current-day northern Yonkers. Philipse made several additional purchases between 1680 and 1686 from the Wiechquaeskeck and Sinsink Indian tribes, expanding the property both north and south; he also bought a small plot of land from the Tappans west of the Hudson River. The manor comprised about of land. Philipse also bought out his partners' stakes during this time. The estate's boundaries were the Spuyten Duyvil Creek to the south, the Croton River to the north, the Hudson River to the west, and the Bronx River to the east. Philipse was granted a royal charter in 1693, creating the Manor of Philipsburg and making him first lord of the manor. Along with the three other main manors of the colony‚ÄîRensselaerswyck, Cortlandt, and Livingston‚ÄîPhilipsburg created one of the richest and most powerful families in the colony. When Philipse died in 1702, the manor was divided between his son, Adolphus Philipse, and grandson, Frederick Philipse II. Adolphus received the Upper Mills property, which extended from Dobbs Ferry to the Croton River. Frederick II was given the Lower Mills, which included the family seat, Philipse Manor Hall, at the confluence of the then Neperhan River (today's Saw Mill) and Hudson Rivers; the two parcels were reunited on his uncle's death. Frederick II's son, Frederick III, became the third lord of the manor in 1751. Philipse Manor Hall, the Lower Mills manor house, in today's Getty Square neighborhood of Yonkers The Philipses used African slaves to build various structures at the Upper and Lower Mills. The Upper Mills saw the building of two gristmills on the Pocantico River as well as a stone manor house, wharf, cooperage, and bake house. Most of the structures were completed by 1697, including the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, now a National Historic Landmark. The Lower Mills saw a gristmill and Philipse Manor Hall built on the north bank of the Neperhan. The Philipses' aim was to make the manor a center for agriculture, which was achieved. In the 18th century, tenant farmers moved in from Great Britain, the Netherlands, France, Germany, and elsewhere within North America. By the beginning of the American Revolution in 1776, the population was about 1,000, up from 200 at the time of Frederick I's death. Several years into the Revolution Frederick Philipse III, a Loyalist, was attainted for treason along with his family. The manor was confiscated in 1779 and used as collateral to raise funds for the Colonial cause. After the war it was sold at public auction, split between 287 buyers. The largest tract, the (about ) Upper Mills, was purchased by Gerard Beekman; the lower, including Manor Hall, went to Cornelius Low. An American Loyalist: The Ordeal of Frederick Philipse III, Stefan Bielinski, New York State Museum (1976) That parcel was passed to numerous owners until 1951, when it was acquired by Sleepy Hollow Restorations (now Historic Hudson Valley). Philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. funded the restoration of about , which became today's Philipsburg Manor historic site. Philipse Manor Hall served as Yonkers City Hall from 1872 until 1908. Both homes became National Historic Landmarks on November 5, 1961 and are now house museums. Legacy In 2004, it was added to the African American Heritage Trail of Westchester County, a group of 13 sites which include the Rye African-American Cemetery, Saint Paul's Church National Historic Site and the Jay Estate.

Shot in a satirical pseudo-documentary style, the film follows Randy, a young man living in a Midwestern US town, as he tries one mundane job after another, including monitoring a machine at a plastics factory, working as a clean-up person at a fast-food restaurant, cleaning motels, and becoming a telephone solicitor. The film was directly inspired by the 1987 magazine \\"American Job\\" created by Randy Russell, which was a collection of job stories from low-wage workers around the United States.https://web.archive.org/web/20070610204046/http://www.americanmovie.com/amjob/stories.html American Job was produced by Chris Smith, edited by Sarah Price and Chris Smith, and written by Doug Ruschaupt, Randy Russell, and Chris Smith.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112345/ Synopsis American Job is a narrative film about Randy Scott (Randy Russell), a youth caught in the dismal confusion of living and working in the world of minimum wage. The film follows Randy through a number of low-paying, menial jobs including fast food dishwasher, custodian, telemarketer, and factory worker. It highlights the sheer boredom of minimum wage work and is a slightly comical and occasionally depressing look at what life is like in the US minimum wage arena.https://web.archive.org/web/20080501133521/http://www.americanmovie.com/amjob/index.html Awards and reception In 1996, the film was part of a roving national exhibition as part of the Fuel Tour.

Life Harenberg attended Columbia College, where he received a Bachelor of Arts; then Columbia Graduate Faculties, receiving a Masters of Arts in Public Law and Government; followed by post-graduate studies at New York University and Hofstra University. He was awarded a fellowship in Russian at the University of Texas and later at the University of San Francisco. In 1984, Harenberg was awarded a Ph.D. at NYU. He taught history and government at James Wilson Young High School in Bayport, New York, from 1955 through 1974, and he spent a year in Great Britain as a Fulbright-Hays Exchange Teacher. Then he entered politics as a Democrat, and was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1974. He remained in the Assembly until 2000, sitting in the 181st, 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st, 192nd and 193rd New York State Legislatures. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Community Aftercare for the Mentally Disabled (Mental Health), Harenberg held public hearings and produced two important reports on the delivery of mental health services in New York State. \\"Wards of the State\\" (1977), detailed the deficiencies of the Department of Hygiene in preventing and investigating incidents of patient abuse. One of Harenberg's proposals that was signed into law established the State Commission on the Quality of Care for the Mentally Disabled. In 1978, Harenberg's report on the dumping of mental patients, \\"From the Back Wards to the Back Alleys\\", brought national attention to the problems of deinstitutionalization without aftercare. As a result, an appropriation of over $26 million and other remedial legislation was enacted by the NYS Legislature to deal with this problem and the Community Support Services was established. Harenberg received the Mental Health Advocate Award from the Long Island Council of the Federation of Parents Organizations. Appointed Chairman of the NYS Assembly Committee on Aging in 1981, Paul Harenberg brought to the job a strong personal commitment to promote the independence and health of older New Yorkers. A longtime advocate of home care and other alternatives to institutional care, Harenberg immediately set out to create a full continuum of services for elderly persons - from income maintenance and tax relief to expanded community and home-based services such as respite care, adult day care, training for informal care givers, and home health care. Harenberg traveled extensively throughout the state, viewing senior programs and speaking with individual organizations. As Chair of the Committee on Aging, Harenberg held numerous public hearings, beginning in 1981 on such diverse topics as energy needs, elder abuse, long-term care, the status of older women, mandatory Medicare assignment, adult homes, Medigap insurance, and age discrimination in employment. Harenberg also expanded the membership of the Committee's Advisory Council, composed of older persons and their advocates, in an effort to elicit a wider range of ideas for legislation and broader- based support for the Committee's legislative efforts. Through these visits and hearings, and with the advice of its Advisory Council under Harenberg's leadership, the Committee on Aging developed and enacted significant legislation to improve the lives of older persons. Recognizing the very important role that families play in providing care to older persons, Harenberg, in his first year as Chairman, sponsored experimental legislation that created some of the first respite programs in the nation, assisting family caregivers and improving the quality of life for the dependent elderly persons. Harenberg led efforts to eliminate age-based discrimination in employment and housing. Additionally, he succeeded in securing passage of a sliding scale of real property tax exemptions for elderly homeowners. Other gains the Committee won for the older New Yorkers in 1984 included the statutory establishment of Enriched Housing programs and further funding increases for Community Services for the Elderly. Creation of the Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage Program (EPIC), established to help income- eligible seniors with the high costs of prescription drugs, was achieved in 1986 through Harenberg's persistent leadership and the support of many statewide senior advocacy organizations. A 1996 cost analysis of the EPIC program showed savings of $40 million as a consequence of delayed need for institutionalizing many of New York's elderly. In addition to his efforts here in New York State, Harenberg has been a strong advocate for New York's elderly at the federal level of government. Strongly critical of federal efforts to cut funding for health care, housing and other senior services, Harenberg was an active delegate at the 1981 White House Conference on Aging and has worked for improved Medicare benefits, as well as for increased funding of the Older Americans Act. Harenberg was successful in securing enactment of spousal impoverishment legislation, allowing the community spouse of a nursing home resident to retain a considerable portion of the couple's joint income and assets. In 1987, Harenberg filed state legislation prohibiting physicians from charging more than Medicare's reasonable fee. In 1990, a slightly compromised version of his original bill passed (A.3500-a), which places a limit of 5% on the amount a physician can charge an elderly patient above the Medicare- approved payment amount. Harenberg also pressed for passage in 1990 of the Health Care Proxy Act, protecting the rights of individuals to control decisions about their health care. Under Harenberg's direction, significant EPIC reform measures (1990) extended this critical program to other moderate- income seniors while enhancing benefits to lower-income seniors was also enacted. Harenberg was appointed Chair of the Assembly Majority Steering Committee in 1997.Mitchell, George A (2000). The New York Red Book 1999-2000, p. 308-309.

The head coach was Red Berenson and the team captain was Brendan Morrison. The team played its home games in the Yost Ice Arena on the University campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The team finished first in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association regular season, won the CCHA Tournament and qualified for the Frozen Four of the 1997 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The team was led by John Madden, Brendan Morrison, and Marty Turco who were Division I All-Americans selections of the American Hockey Coaches Association. For Morrison it was his third consecutive selection. Morrison earned the same Central Collegiate Hockey Association Player of the Year and The Hockey News U.S. College Player of the Year awards he had won the year before. He also earned the Hobey Baker Award. He was joined on the CCHA All-Conference first team by Turco and Madden, who was selected as the conferences best defensive forward. Madden has gone on to become the only Wolverine to win the Stanley Cup three different times as a player with the 2000 and 2003 New Jersey Devils as well as the 2010 Chicago Blackhawks. Morrison ended his career as the school recordholder for both single-season (57, 1996-97) and career (182, 1994-97) assists as well as career points (284, 1994-97). The records remain unbroken. Madden established the current NCAA Division I national record for career shorthanded goals (23). Morrison led the nation in points per game (2.02) and assists per game (1.31); Jason Botterill led the nation in power play goals (19); Madden led the nation in short-handed goals (8); and Marty Turco led the nation in goalie winning percentage (.850). The team led the nation in both goals allowed per game and scoring margin per game for the second year in a row. Morrison led the CCHA in goals and points, while Turco led in goals against average. The team led the conference in both power play and penalty killing. The team had the top two and three of the top four conference scorers. Madden tied with Randy Robitaille in conference shorthanded goals. The team concluded the Central Collegiate Hockey Association regular season as the conference championship with a 21-3-3 record. Their 3 losses were at Michigan State, vs Michigan State in Joe Louis and at Miami, meaning they went undefeated at Yost Ice Arena. In the first round, number one seeded Michigan defeated Alaska in a two-game sweep by scores of 8-1 and 11-0\\\\. In the second round, Michigan defeated number five seed Bowling Green 7-2\\\\.

Architecture The courthouse is set in a small park just on the northern edge of Farmington's central business district, bounded by Main, Anson, Cony, and Church Streets. It is a 3-1/2 story red brick structure, roughly rectangular in shape, with high-style Victorian Italianate features. It has a hip roof which is crowned by a small square tower with a louvered ventilator, clock, and metal dome with weathervane. Each of three facades has a central pavilion which projects slightly and is topped by a gable section. The corners of the pavilions and the building have brick quoining on the first level, with pilasters at the building corners and between the bays on the elongated second level. Farmington was designated the seat of Franklin County in 1838. The county court first met in a converted meeting house, which also housed town offices. This courthouse was built in 1885 on the site of this first building, to a design by the prolific and noted Lewiston architect George M. Coombs. Coombs designed a number of buildings in Farmington, particularly in the wake of a major fire that swept through the town in the 1880s. The annex to the courthouse was designed by his son Harry and completed in 1917.

Scholars at LCHC pursue research focused on understanding the complex relationship between cognition and culture in individual and social development. Such research requires collaboration among scholars from a variety of research disciplines, including cognitive science, education, linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and sociology. LCHC also functions as a research and training institution, arranging for pre-doctoral, doctoral, and post-doctoral training, as well as research exchanges with scholars throughout the world. In addition, LCHC sponsors a journal, Mind, Culture and Activity: An International Journal (MCA),MCA, Mind, Culture and Activity: An International Journal, http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Journal/index.html and an open internet discussion group, XMCA.XMCA discussion list, http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/index.html Formative influences The LCHC is rooted in several research traditions and interests, beginning with cross-cultural research in Africa and Mexico on the developmental impact of indigenous practices, literacy, and schooling. The methodological approach of this research was a blend of experimental psychology and cognitive ethnography that highlighted the roles of cultural contexts and the need to carefully study local practices and local people's interpretations of those practices. As this research developed, it drew inspiration from Soviet psychology,Soviet psychology, http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/soviet-psychology.htm cultural psychology, Black psychology, cultural anthropology, distributed cognition, actor-network theory, and American pragmatism. LCHC has also been strongly influenced by ideas from developmental psychology and takes a strong multidisciplinary, ‚Äútheory and practice‚Äù approach to the social sciences and humanities.for more on the influences on LCHC, see Michael Cole, Cultural Psychology: A Once and Future Discipline, 1996, First Harvard University Press paperback edition, 1998, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge University, and London, England https://www.amazon.com/dp/0674179560 Of the influences mentioned above, Soviet psychology, cultural anthropology, and American pragmatism have been particularly important to the intellectual formation of members of the LCHC. From Soviet psychology‚Äîspecifically the work of cultural- historical psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1896‚Äì1934) and Vygotsky-inspired cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT),on cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), see http://www.edu.helsinki.fi/activity/pages/chatanddwr/chat/ LCHC researchers inherited an interest in cultural mediation‚Äîthe idea that humans use cultural artifacts to control both their environments and their own actions. This interest in mediation was coupled with a concern for the activities that cultural artifacts mediate. From this combined approach, LCHC researchers seek to make visible for analysis those processes \\"that realize a person‚Äôs actual life in the objective world by which he is surrounded, his social being in all the richness and variety of its forms\\" (A.N. Leont‚Äôev, 1977A.N. Leont‚Äôev, Activity and Consciousness, in Philosophy in the USSR: Problems of Dialectical Materialism, 1977, Progress Publishers, available online at http://www.marxists.org/archive/leontev/works/1977/leon1977.htm). From cultural anthropology (e.g., Gregory Bateson, Roy D'Andrade, Clifford Geertz) and American pragmatism (e.g., John Dewey, George Mead, Charles Peirce) LCHC adopted both methods for the analysis of behavior in situ (ethnography, the comparative method, modes of discourse analysis) and theoretical guidance for thinking about the co-constitution of persons and their environments, and the histories of the cultural practices through which they lead their lives. Taken together, these domains of social science theory and methodology have informed the diverse research projects of the members of the LCHC. By integrating these approaches, LCHC researchers combine cultural- historical psychologists‚Äô insistence on historical/developmental analysissee L.S. Vygotsky, Mind in society: the development of higher psychological processes, edited by Michael Cole, et al., 1978/1981, Harvard University Press, Cambridge Mass., p 58-78, see preview at https://books.google.com/books?id=RxjjUefze_oC&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=mind+in+society&hl;=en&ei;=sp2vTKHPEIO2sAP5hYSRDA&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&ved;=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;&f;=false (influenced by Marxism) with anthropologist's/pragmatist's emphasis on the analysis of concrete activity systems and the diversity of such systems within and between societies. Origins and history The LCHC emerged during the Civil Rights Movement, a time when issues regarding education and employment for minorities were being sharply debated. On a world scale, groups such as UNESCO were concerned with how to improve education throughout the developing world. This historical context motivated foundations to give grants to LCHC to conduct research on apparent cultural variations in cognitive development and their significance for maximizing success in schooling.see LCHC: A Program of Research and Training in Cultural Psychology (1984), http://lchc.ucsd.edu/Histarch/carnegie_rpt.html LCHC was originally based at Rockefeller University in New York City from 1971 to 1978 and has been based at the UC San Diego (UCSD) from 1978 to the present. When the LCHC relocated from New York to California, it changed both its university and departmental setting, with its new base of operations now in the Department of Communication.UCSD Department of Communication, http://communication.ucsd.edu/ This institutional relocation permitted the LCHC to: 1) expand its research concerns to include the use of new communication technologies in various settings; 2) forge community partnerships in the racially, economically, and politically diverse border-city of San Diego; and 3) situate LCHC research within the discipline of communication studies, for which mediation is a central, constitutive, concept.see LCHC: A Program of Research and Training in Cultural Psychology (1984), http://lchc.ucsd.edu/Histarch/carnegie_rpt.html Cross-cultural studies The LCHC has participated in key cross-cultural studies, such as research projects with the Kpelle people and the Vai people (both of Liberia), and rural residents in Yucatan, Mexico. These studies were instrumental in formulating a critique of contemporaneous methods of cross- cultural and developmental psychology. LCHC researchers argued that studies of human cognitive activity must be grounded in the actual materials and processes of people's daily lives (ecological validity). Using this approach, they demonstrated that years of schooling strongly influence performance on many common cognitive tasks, but that such influences do not support the conclusion of a general cognitive impact of schooling on cognitive development.on the general impact of schooling on cognitive development, see Cognitive development and formal schooling: The evidence from cross-cultural research by Michael Cole, pp 89-110, in Vygotsky and Education: Instructional Implications and Applications of Sociohistorical Psychology, ed. Luis Moll, 1990/2003, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, available for preview at https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=GUTyDVORhHkC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PA89&dq;=schooling+cognitive+development&ots;=tvjITQHfvJ&sig;=3t-kxzL6YukU0ylXNTwjAc1ko4k#v=onepage&q;=schooling%20cognitive%20development&f;=false This work called into question the use of cognitive tasks to measure school achievement by showing that schooled children scored better on psychological tests while performing far below expectations on their schoolwork. This finding refocused research attention to the link between activities that children engaged in outside of formal schooling and their performance in the classroom. The interplay between informal and formal educational activities continues to concern LCHC researchers today. Research activities in the United States LCHC has been noted for conducting comparative developmental studies in a number of domains of social practice in the United States, including: comparative studies of language and cognitive developmenton comparative studies of language and cognitive development, see Language in Cognitive Development: The Emergence of the Mediated Mind by Katherine Nelson, 1996/2002, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, available for preview at https://books.google.com/books?id=CpIkpVkL2vAC&dq;=language+in+cognitive+development:+Emergence+of+the+Mediated+Mind&printsec;=frontcover&source;=bn&hl;=en&ei;=jgeZTK3RDor0swPMsPHNDA&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=5&ved;=0CCsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q;&f;=false among children of different ethnicities and social classes or with differing forms of apparent learning disability; building model activity systems to promote learning and development, such as PlayworldsPlayworlds, http://www.playworlds.org/ and the Fifth Dimension;Fifth Dimension, http://5thd.communication.ucsd.edu/ and studies of development in work settings.on development in work settings, see http://www.edu.helsinki.fi/activity/pages/research/newforms/ Current active topics of research at LCHC include: adult-child fantasy play worlds as media for inter-generational development;on media for inter-generational development, see Cole, M., & The Distributed Literacy Consortium (Ed.), The Fifth Dimension.

Research philosophy The LCHC's physical location on the UCSD campus is rarely the site of data collection because of LCHC's methodological imperative: to observe cognition and other psychological phenomena in everyday activities, then to use the structure of that activity as a template for creating experiments, conceived of as model activity systems. LCHC research programs strive to meet the practical need for developing democratic collaborations. On the one hand, this need requires local community members to participate in the activities of the laboratory, creating partnerships between academics and non-academics referred to as UCLinks.UCLinks, http://www.uclinks.org/what/what_home.html On the other hand, within the academic community, democratic collaboration requires faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students share responsibility for the implementation of research, creating a multi-generational system of joint activities. Internationalism in research efforts has been a hallmark of the LCHC since its inception. Of special note in this regard is the VelHam Project,see report on the VelHam Project, or the Velikhov-Hamburg Project, 1985-1994, http://lchc.ucsd.edu/Histarch/velham.html which was an ambitious attempt to link Soviet and U.S. educationalists and children engaged in common after-school activities through satellite feeds during the 1980s, and XMCA, a network of scholars seeking to develop the general set of ideas which underpin LCHC's reason for being. Technologies of research The LCHC has a tradition of using modern communication and computer technologies in its research work. This tradition stemmed from a focus on the cultural tools (mediational means) that are central to all culturally organized human activity, and from efforts to extend the scholarly community that pursued issues of mutual concern to members of the LCHC. The role of digital technologies in settings for education, work, and play has and continues to influence the LCHC's research and intervention agenda, as evidenced by the Fifth DimensionFifth Dimension, http://5thd.communication.ucsd.edu/ and UCLinksUCLinks, http://www.uclinks.org/what/what_home.html projects. LCHC researchers also use digital audio- and video-recording technology for data collection, recording real-time interaction that can be analyzed later at multiple levels. Scientific communication activities The LCHC has been directly and indirectly involved with many kinds of publication projects. It created LCHC NewsletterLCHC Newsletter, http://lchc.ucsd.edu/Histarch/newsletters.html (1976 to 1993) to initiate an international discussion about culture in development, followed by the refereed academic journal MCAMCA, Mind, Culture and Activity: An International Journal, http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Journal/index.html (1994 to present). It began sponsoring a listserv in the early 1980s (formerly XLCHC, now called XMCAXMCA discussion list, http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/index.html) where scholars from all over the world discuss the issue of culture and development in a broad, interdisciplinary manner, communicating about topics such as cultural psychology, Vygotsky, cultural-historical activity theory,on cultural- historical activity theory (CHAT), see http://www.edu.helsinki.fi/activity/pages/chatanddwr/chat/ and more. Collaboration Owing to its basic philosophy of research, the LCHC is notable for collaboration with a wide range of researchers in different disciplines and parts of the world. Of special note is the close collaboration between the LCHC and the Center for Research on Activity, Development and Learning (CRADLE)Center for Research on Activity, Development and Learning (CRADLE), (was Center for Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research), and its long-term support of ISCAR (International Society for Cultural and Activity Research).ISCAR (International Society of Cultural and Activity Research), http://www.iscar.org/ Hundreds of researchers have been associated with LCHC over the years and remain associated through its networking system.

It was granted a royal monopoly over the trade with West Africa by Charles I, modelled on the existing English Guinea Company, with which it unofficially co-operated. The company made only a single voyage, of two ships; one returned, whilst the other was seized by Portuguese forces at S√£o Tom√© and its crew killed. Following this, the company made some attempts to recover compensation for the second ship, but without any success, and ceased to operate sometime around 1639. There was no further attempt by Scotland to trade with Africa on an organised basis until the formation of the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies in 1695. Background The Scottish government had made no organised attempts to support colonisation or trade with the \\"new world\\" throughout the sixteenth century, and only began to make limited attempts in the early seventeenth. The first major overseas venture was in the North Atlantic fisheries in 1617, which failed, and an attempt to colonise Nova Scotia and Cape Breton in the 1620s, likewise unsuccessful.Devine, pp. 1-2 Activity The first and only voyage funded by the Company left Britain in late 1636, with two ships, and in the spring of 1637 attempted to trade on the Gold Coast. One ship returned home later in the year with a small cargo, giving an approximate profit of around 50% on its cargo, whilst the second had remained to trade, accumulating around ¬£10,000 sterling in gold.The pound sterling is used here for simplicity, rather than the pound Scots, which was still the legal currency in Scotland at this point. Returning home in September, it put into the Portuguese colony of S√£o Tom√© for repairs, where it was treated as hostile; the ship and cargo were seized, whilst most of the crew was killed. Aftermath The Company did not mount a second voyage; attempts to gain compensation for the loss of the ship were sidetracked by political unrest in both countries, in the form of the Portuguese Restoration War and the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.

It was built in 1860s, and adapted for use as worker housing for G.H. Bass & Co., whose former factory building stands next door. The building, one of a few that survive in Wilton that were adapted in this way, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It now houses the Wilton Historical Society's Wilton Farm and Home Museum. Description The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure on a granite foundation, with a large rear ell. It has a gable roof with the end gable facing the front (western) facade. This facade is three bays wide, with the entry at the southwest corner. The door is framed by narrow sidelight windows and topped by a modest entablature. There are sash windows in the bays on the second floor, and two windows in the gable peak. The roof is pierced on both sides by gabled dormers, although their placement is not uniform or symmetrical. The interior of the house is largely preserved, but modest in style; the lower level of the ell is a large open space.NRHP nomination for Bass Boarding House; available by request from the National Park Service History The significant history of the property begins in 1861, when it was purchased, along with an adjacent mill, by Emerson and Rawson Fuller. The main block of the house was apparently built by Rawson Fuller not long afterward, and was his family home until the early 1900s. It was probably converted by Rawson for use as a boarding house prior to its acquisition in 1911 by George H. Bass. Bass, a tanner by training, had been in the shoemaking business since at least 1871. He acquired Fuller's mill in 1904, and erected the now-standing Bass factory on its site. In order to provide housing for his factory workers, Bass adopted several strategies. He built modest tenement houses in Wilton, and he acquired existing properties and adapted them for use by his workers. This resulted in the dispersed nature of worker housing in Wilton, unlike more formally planned mill housing complexes found elsewhere. Bass purchased this house in 1911, and it served as worker housing until 1937. It was acquired by the Wilton Historical Society in 1987. Wilton Farm and Home Museum The Wilton Farm and Home Museum is a local history museum. Exhibits include historic household items, tools used in crafts and trades such as farming, shoe making and blacksmithing, clothing, a collection of Maine bottles, and displays of local history and culture.

It offered commercial banking services and products to corporate and individual clients. Its traditional banking lines included international payment services, multi-currency account, credit facilities, trade finance, forex trading facilities, internet banking and international card services. FBME serviced clients worldwide. , FBME was the largest commercial bank in Tanzania, with a total asset base valued at approximately US$2.716 billion (TZS:4.4 trillion), with shareholders' equity of approximately US$179.63 million (TZS:291 billion). History The bank was founded in 1952 in Lebanon, as the Federal Bank of Lebanon SAL. In 1982 Federal Bank of the Middle East was established in Cyprus as a subsidiary of the Federal Bank of Lebanon SAL. In 1986 Federal Bank of the Middle East changed its country of incorporation to the Cayman Islands and its banking presence in Cyprus was transformed to that of a branch of the Cayman Islands entity. Since 1993 it had maintained a Representative Office in Moscow. In 2003, Federal Bank of the Middle East terminated its banking presence in the Cayman Islands and established its parent company and operational headquarters in Tanzania. At the same time, its Cyprus operations became a branch of Federal Bank of the Middle East, Tanzania. In 2005 the Federal Bank of the Middle East Changed its name to FBME Bank. FBME Card Services Limited (FBMECS) was incorporated in 2002 and in 2004/5 took over the Card Services operations of FBME Bank.  Controversy  In 2014 the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network accused FBME, which operates primarily in Cyprus, of facilitating financial transactions for multinational organised crime organizations and Hezbollah. The Central Bank of Cyprus took over management of the bank and appointed Mr. Dinos Christofides as administrator, who was later replaced by Andrew Andronicou and thereafter Andronicou was replaced by Chris Iacovides. In May 2015, the International Chamber of Commerce's Arbitral Tribunal called on Cypriot banking authorities to abstain from taking any measures that would destroy irrevocably the business of FBME Cyprus pending completion of arbitration. The request for Interim Measures had been filed by Ayoub-Farid Michel Saab and Fadi Michel Saab, owners of the bank and claimants in the dispute against the Republic of Cyprus. FBME Bank said this confirmed Procedural Order No. 1 by inviting the Republic of Cyprus to refrain from proceeding to the sale or the resolution of FBME Bank before the end of this arbitration and put Cypriot financial authorities under obligation to notify any further measure regarding FBME Cyprus 30 days in advance, and that Cyprus could no longer act in isolation and put all interested parties before a fait accompli. Further, FBME, the Arbitral Tribunal, and Messrs. Saab, owners would be in a position to react before a decision was final, and have an opportunity to take all measures and legal actions that they deemed appropriate. On December 21, 2015, the Central Bank of Cyprus revoked the branch license of FBME bank in Cyprus. After the deposit guarantee scheme was activated for customers with accounts in Cyprus, the bank‚Äôs staff in Cyprus started a strike. In June 2016, staff agreed to assist with the administration of the deposit guarantee scheme and customers start receiving their money up to ‚Ç¨100,000. There are in 2016 numerous court cases ongoing. The verdicts show a sense of predictability. In April 2017, the bank appealed a ruling from a Washington, D.C. federal court which in effect cut off the bank from the American financial system. On May 5, 2017, the Bank of Tanzania discontinued all banking operations of FBME Bank Ltd, revoked its banking business license, placed it under liquidation and appointed the Deposit Insurance Board as a liquidator. On December 24, 2017, The Guardian reported that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation -- in connection with Robert S. Mueller III's investigation (into possible connections between the Russian government and the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign of Donald Trump) -- had asked the Central Bank of Cyprus for financial information about FBME, specifically into information that the bank was used by wealthy Russians with political connections accused by the US government of money laundering. Bloomberg further reports that the Russia-related investigation into FBME was connected to a flow of illegal Russian funds into the New York real estate market. Ownership The shares of stock of FBME Bank were owned by Lebanese bankers Ayoub-Farid M Saab (50%) and Fady M Saab (50%).

He was a linguist, fluent in the language of the Lenape Native Americans, and in early histories of New Jersey he is noted for his service to both the Indians and the English Quakers, helping them negotiate land transactions. Though he was from Holstein, now a part of Germany, he was closely associated with the Swedes along the Delaware because his wife was a Finn and a member of that community. In 1671 Falkenberg lived on property belonging to his father-in- law, Sennick Broer, on the Christina River, now in Wilmington, Delaware. He later moved to the vicinity of Burlington, New Jersey where he lived for nearly two decades, and where he was visited by two journalists of the Labadist sect who were looking for a place to establish a new community. The journalists provided the only known record of Falkenberg's place of origin, and also described his dwelling place, a Swedish style log cabin. By 1693 he had moved from the Delaware River across the Province of New Jersey to become the first European settler in Little Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, near Tuckerton. Here he dug a cave for a home, but later built a large house made of clapboard where he lived until his death, sometime after 1711. Falkenberg wrote a will in 1710, but for unknown reasons it was not probated until thirty-three years later. While he had only two known children to reach adulthood, each by a different wife, he has a large progeny as the ancestor of the Falkinburg family of New Jersey and the Fortenberry and Faulkenberry families of the southern United States. Delaware River The Delaware River valley lands were originally occupied by the Lenape. Over time, the land was controlled by the Dutch West India Company and Swedish settlers. In 1664 the British took possession of the entire Delaware River Valley. While reading the following, this date should be kept in mind. Service as interpreter Falkenberg became fluent in the language of the Lenape who are shown here negotiating a treaty with William Penn (painting by Benjamin West, 1771). In colonial records of New Jersey the name of Hendrick Jacobs Falkenberg occurs frequently in land transactions where he acted as interpreter between the native Lenape and European settlers. The Lenape were eager to acquire European-made goods and the Europeans were eager to acquire land, so the services of Falkenberg were sought by both parties. In his book, Indians of Southern New Jersey, Frank Stewart considered Falkenberg to be the foremost interpreter in the purchase of Lenape lands in southern New Jersey, a sentiment echoed by Dr. Peter Craig in his book about the inhabitants along the Delaware. Falkenberg was particularly helpful to the English Quakers moving into the area of the Delaware River in the late 1670s, helping them negotiate land transactions with the Lenape. When he was evicted from one of his properties in 1678, these Quakers came to his defense and petitioned the Governor of New York on his behalf. For his services as interpreter, the Lenape gave him an 800-acre tract of land in Little Egg Harbor Township in 1674, and the English gave him a 200-acre parcel of land on Rancocas Creek in Burlington County in 1682. Falkenberg's usefulness as an interpreter went beyond the conduct of land transactions, an example of which occurred in 1681 when the Lenape King Ockanickon was dying. The King gave his final words to his nephew, Jahkursoe, whom he appointed to be his successor as King, but he also wanted to share his words with his gathered friends and family, both Indian and Christian. The short statement by Ockanickon was translated by Falkenberg. Soon afterwards, Quaker John Cripps sent the translation to a friend in London where it was put into print. In this small printed document, Falkenberg's name appears as the interpreter where his name is written \\"Henry Jacobs Falckinburs, This name appears as Falekinbery in Good Order.\\" This is the first known instance where his name is given with the surname included. Subsequently, his name appears in the records both with and without the surname in various printed records. First residence: Deer Point The first public record found for Falkenberg was a deed dated October 12, 1672, when he was named as an heir of \\"Seneca Brewer\\" (Sennick Broer). In this document, he is named \\"Henrickus Jackson\\". This indicates that the wife of Hendrick Jacobs was a daughter of the Finn, Sennick Broer. Her given name has not been found. Sennick Broer and family arrived in the Delaware River area on the ship Mercurius in 1656, just after the Dutch took control of New Sweden. The Dutch attempted to turn the ship around and send the passengers back to Sweden, but with the help of some Lenape the vessel was able to slip into port and offload its passengers consisting of 92 Finns and 13 Swedes. Because his wife was of the Swedish colony along the Delaware, Hendrick Jacobs was also considered a member of the Swedish settlement. In 1671, when the English made a census of the inhabitants of the Delaware River, Hendrick Jacobs was likely living with his wife and brothers-in-law on property belonging to his father- in-law, Sennick Broer. This 900-acre tract was called \\"Deer Point\\" and located on the north side of the Christina River, later a part of Wilmington, Delaware. The length of his stay at Deer Point is unknown, but by 1674 Jacobs was living 44 miles to the northeast, upstream along the Delaware River on an island called Mattiniconck (or Matinicum), adjacent to what would become the town of Burlington, New Jersey. Mattiniconck Island Matiniconck Island, Burlington, and Falkenberg's property at Lazy Point. In August 1674 Hendrick Jacobs (later Falkenberg) was a party to a deed stating that his residence at the time was Mattiniconck Island, a 300-acre island in the Delaware River opposite Burlington, New Jersey. He shared ownership of the island, later called Burlington Island, with a French Huguenot named Peter Jegou, with whom he had a long and fairly close relationship. In a court held at Newcastle, Delaware in May 1675, Jacobs petitioned against Jegou concerning a bargain for a still, but thereafter, the relationship between the two men was much more amicable. Jegou represented Hendrick Jacobs in a November 1676 Newcastle court case, and three years later in a case where Jegou was a plaintiff, Jacobs was called his friend. Jacobs lived on Mattiniconck at least until late 1677 when a list of \\"Tydable Persons\\" of the Upland Court dated November 13, 1677, included \\"Hend: Jacobs upon ye Isld.\\" On November 14, 1678, Robert Stacy, one of the Yorkshire commissioners of the Burlington Colony, obtained a lease for this island from Governor Edmund Andros of New York. Stacy tried to evict Jacobs and Jegou from the island. However, on December 5, 1678, twenty-nine Quaker residents of Burlington petitioned the Governor because Jacobs had been of great service for them as interpreter and acquiring land from the Lenape. While the immediate outcome of the litigation is not known, ultimately the West Jersey assembly passed an act in 1682 vesting possession of the island to the town of Burlington with rents to be used for school maintenance and education of youth. Stacy did help compensate Jacobs, however, by approving a deed in January 1681/82 whereby Henry Jacobs was given 200 acres of land on the south side of Rancocas Creek, south of Burlington, in consideration for his services as an interpreter. Jacobs likely resided at this location because on August 8, 1685, he sold this property, with dwelling house, to Noel Mew of Rhode Island. Lazy Point: Visit by journalists Danckaerts and Sluyter While Mattiniconck Island was called Hendrick Jacobs' residence in at least two documents, it is uncertain how long he lived there. By 1679 he was living at a place called Lazy Point which he either owned in partnership with Peter Jegou, or leased from Jegou. Jegou purchased this property in 1668 and was operating an inn there in 1670 when he was plundered by Natives, subsequently leaving the area for Deer Point on the Christina River. A map copied by Jasper Danckaerts shows this property of Hendrick Jacobs as lying on the Delaware River across a small branch, Assiscunk Creek, near the town of Burlington, New Jersey. An engraving of this map is found in Woodward's history of Burlington County, New Jersey, with a modern version depicted in this article. In 1679 Danckaerts and his partner Peter Sluyter, two envoys of the Labadist religious sect, came from the Netherlands to America to find a location to establish a community, their journey extending from New York southward to Maryland. On Saturday, November 18, 1679, (8 November, old style) the two journalists, along with their local guide, Ephraim Herman, met with Hendrick Jacobs, stayed at his house, and wrote about the visit: > Before arriving at this village [Burlington], we stopped at the house of one > Jacob Hendrix, from Holstein, living on this side. He was an acquaintance of > Ephraim who would have gone there to lodge, but he was not at home. We, > therefore, rowed on to the village, in search of lodgings, for it had been > dark all of an hour or more; but proceeding a little further, we met this > Jacob Hendrix, in a canoe with hay. As we were now at the village, we went > up to the tavern, but there were no lodgings to be obtained there, whereupon > we reembarked in the boat, and rowed back to Jacob Hendrix's, who received > us very kindly, and entertained us according to his ability. The house, > although not much larger than where we were the last night, was somewhat > better and tighter, being made according to the Swedish mode, and as they > usually build their houses here, which are block-houses, being nothing else > than entire trees, split through the middle, or squared out of the rough, > and placed in the form of a square, upon each other, as high as they wish to > have the house; the ends of these timbers are let into each other, about a > foot from the ends, half of one into half of the other.

The ceiling and roof do not exhibit > much finer work, except among the most careful people, who have the ceiling > planked and a glass window. The doors are wide enough, but very low, so that > you have to stoop in entering. These houses are quite tight and warm; but > the chimney is placed in a corner. In his journal, Danckaerts called Hendrick Jacobs \\"Jacob Hendrix from Holstein,\\" getting his name backwards, but providing the only reference to his place of nativity. Through YDNA evidence, which follows the male genetic line, the Falkenberg ancestry indicates roots in the Neatherlands, not the Holstein area of Germany. This evidence will be forthcoming. The journal entry also provides a detailed description of an important Swedish contribution to American culture‚Äîthe log cabin. In 1684 and 1685 Hendrick Jacobs appears several times in the Burlington Court Records. In one case he was the defendant in an action of debt, and in another case he and several others were accused of stealing goods from a ship that ran ashore and was grounded. He continued to live near the Delaware River at least until February 1688/89 when he was listed as a member of the Swede's Church in Wicaco (later in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). On January 26, 1691/92, he witnessed the will of Gilbert Morrell of Steatley, Burlington County, New Jersey, his name then being recorded as \\"Hinrich Jacobsen Falckenberg.\\" Across the Province to Little Egg Harbor Township New Jersey, showing important locations in the life of Hendrick Jacobs Falkenberg Sometime in the early 1690s Falkenberg moved across the New Jersey colony to the area of Little Egg Harbor Township near the Atlantic Ocean, about 20 miles northeast of present-day Atlantic City, New Jersey, settling on land that he had acquired from the Lenape in 1674. He was probably there by 1693 when he is absent from the census taken that year of the Swedes along the Delaware River. On April 11, 1697, a deed was drafted confirming the 1674 offering by Lenape of land at Little Egg Harbor, his name being recorded in the 1697 document as \\"Henery Jacobs Faukinburge.\\" On February 7, 1698/99, Falkenberg had the 800 acre tract of land surveyed, 200 acres of which encompassed the two islands of Monhunk (later Osborn's Island) and Minicunk (later Wills' Island). These islands are at the north end of Little Egg Harbor, but they have been absorbed by the mainland and today are scarcely distinguishable as islands. Leah Blackman, in her history of Little Egg Harbor Township, relates that according to tradition Falkenberg was the first white man to settle in Little Egg Harbor Township. Blackman and Heston note that once arriving in this area he dug a cave in a steep hill on the eastern side of a little stream on the portion of the tract later known as the Joseph Parker farm; the remains of the cave were still discernable as an indentation in the ground as late as 1850. (NOTE: Further research has proven that some of Blackman's information is erroneous. Geologic maps indicate that the Little Egg Harbor area was and is composed of estuarine deposites of sand, silt and clay. Would a settler dig a home in the ground as opposed to building a Native home above ground?) Falkenberg sustained himself and his family as a hunter, fowler, fisherman and oysterman. It is most likely that his first wife died prior to his move to the ocean side of the colony, but he probably brought his teenage son Henry with him. Blackman states that Falkenberg made a journey to Swedesboro, New Jersey to find a wife. Being successful, he brought his bride-to-be back to his home and prepared a large wedding, inviting his Lenape friends. They were married according to the Friends' (Quaker) tradition. This likely took place in 1697 or 1698, since the first child of this marriage was born in early 1699. Falkenberg's new wife, called Mary Jacobs (maiden name not known), became a member of the local Friends' Meeting, as did Falkenberg. Blackman writes that Mary Jacobs was a female minister of the congregation who probably spoke at the first meeting held in the new congregation house built in 1709. (NOTE: The Quaker religion does NOT believe in appointed clergy members. There are/ were NO ministers. Members of the congregation, including women, took turns to speak in their meetings.) For about seventy years after the settlement of Little Egg Harbor, the Friends were the only religious denomination in the township and their meeting house is where most who lived in the area worshipped. Mary continued to appear in various Friends' records after 1709 and was still living on the \\"10th day of the 8th month 1728\\" (October 10, 1728) when she and Ann Ridgaway brought a certificate upon their return from Long Island, as recorded in the Little Egg Harbor Monthly Meeting minutes. End of life Falkenberg most likely died at his farm in the original house he built at Little Egg Harbor. This farm and house stayed in the family until 1785 when it was sold to Henry Willits by his grandson, John Falkinburg. The last public record found for Hendrick Jacobs Falkenberg was dated October 1, 1711, when he bought land at Little Egg Harbor from John Cooke. He wrote his will in June 1710, naming wife Mary as sole executrix with friends Edward Andrews and John Wills to assist her, and mentioning only one child, Jacob, a minor. John Woolman, George Bliss and John Wills were witnesses. For unknown reasons, the instrument was not presented for probate until thirty-three years after its writing, June 7, 1743, long after Falkenberg's death, when John Wills appeared in court as the only surviving witness. Though Mary was living in 1728, she had likely died by the time the will was presented in 1743, as she does not appear in any probate documents. Falkenberg likely died shortly after the writing of the will as his name does not appear on any records after 1711.  Summary of where Falkenberg lived  The following summary pinpoints the known residences of Hendrick Jacobs Falkenberg while he lived in America, giving approximate dates for each. *1671-1672 Deer Point on the Christina River (later in Wilmington, Delaware) *1674-1678 Mattiniconck Island, in the Delaware River adjacent to Burlington, New Jersey *1678-1682 Lazy Point, across Assiscunk Creek from Burlington, New Jersey *1682-1685 Rancocas Creek, south of Burlington, New Jersey *1685-c.1692 unknown, but he was a member of the Swedish Church at Wicaco (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) in February 1688/89 *c.1692-c.1712 Little Egg Harbor Township, near Tuckerton, New Jersey Heritage=Children Only three children of Hendrick Jacobs Falkenberg are known, one by his first wife and the other two by his second. By his first wife: *Henry Falkenberg/Faulkenberry/Fortenberry, born roughly 1680, went to Bladen County, North Carolina by way of Cecil County, Maryland and Orange County, Virginia; he was still living in 1759. No record mentioning his name has been found along the Delaware River or anywhere in New Jersey. However, circumstantial evidence indicates that this Henry is the son of Hendrick Jacobs Falkenberg. First, the name Falkenberg is very rare in the American colonies in the 17th century, so a family connection is likely among those bearing the name, and Henry is the right age to be a son of Hendirck Jacobs. Secondly, there was a known connection between the Sennick Broer family and the Falkenberg/Faulkenberry/Fortenberry family in North Carolina. When Brewer Sinixsen, a great-grandson of Sennick Broer, died in North Carolina, the Falkenberg descendants claimed his land as their own, implying a close family connection. This connection is that Henry Falkenberg, as a grandson of Sennick Broer, was a first cousin once removed of the Brewer Sinixsen who died in North Carolina. By his second wife: *Mary Falkenburg, born 10:11mo:1698 (January 10, 1698/99), was not mentioned in the will of her father, and may have died young. *Jacob Hendricks (or Jacob Henry) Falkenburg, born 14:6mo:1702 (August 14, 1702), was the only child named in his father's will. His name is given incorrectly by Blackman, who consistently calls him Henry Jacob Falkinburg Jr. This is erroneous; the Friends' records and every other public document bearing his name clearly call him Jacob Hendricks Falkenburg, in keeping with the patronymic tradition. Jacob was married twice, with the name of his first wife unknown and his second wife being Penelope Stout, a descendant of the Penelope Stout who lived to be 111 years old. Descendants The descendants of Hendrick Jacobs Falkenberg were true American pioneers. While most of the family of his younger son Jacob remained in New Jersey or adjacent states, his older son Henry initiated the spread of the family through every southern state from Virginia to Texas. Following is a list of descendants who were the first known members of the family to settle in the areas given: *Jacob Faulkenberry (b. c. 1715) and John Faulkenberry (b. c. 1720), sons of Henry Falkenberg (b. c. 1680), went with their father to Orange County, Virginia and Bladen County (later Anson County), North Carolina. They subsequently went to Lancaster District, South Carolina. *David Faulkenberry (b. c. 1746) and Robert Faulkenberry (b. c. 1755), sons of the above Jacob (b. c. 1715), went to Jackson County, Georgia. David later moved to Rutherford County, Tennessee. *James Leath Fortenberry (c. 1755 - 1831) was undoubtedly a grandson of Henry Falkenberg (b. c. 1680), but by which son has not been determined. He was the founder of the family in Lawrence County, Arkansas, coming there by way of New Madrid County, Missouri Territory. Some of his descendants later settled in the Texas counties of Denton, Hunt, Wise and Cooke. *Jacob Falconberry (b. 1757), the son of Isaac Faulkenberry (b. c. 1725) and grandson of Henry Falkenberg (b. c. 1680), went to Lincoln County, Kentucky and then to Jennings County, Indiana. *William Jasper Fortenberry (c. 1772 - February 5, 1842), the son of John Faulkenberry (b 1740) and grandson of Jacob Faulkenberry (b. c. 1715) mentioned above, was the founder of this family in Pike County, Mississippi. *Isaac Fortenberry (c. 1775 - November 1845), the son of Isaac Fortenberry (b. c. 1748) and grandson of the first mentioned John Faulkenberry (b. c. 1720), founded the Fortenberry family in Marion County, Mississippi. *Israel Falkenberry (1781 - 1861), the brother of the preceding William Jasper Fortenberry, settled in Monroe County, Alabama. *Joseph Fortenberry (1817 - 1856), the son of Jacob Fortenberry (1789 - 1862) and grandson of James Leath Fortenberry, above, settled in Hunt County, Texas about 1850. *Oliver Rice Fortenberry (1821 - 1874), William M. Fortenberry (1827 - 1884), and A. H. Sevier Fortenberry (1828 - 1868), all brothers of the preceding Joseph Fortenberry (1817-1856), settled in Denton County, Texas between 1850 and 1869. Notable descendant U.S. President Jimmy Carter is descended from Mary Margaret Fortenberry (or Falkenborough) who married George Helms and lived in North Carolina in the mid-1700s. Mary Fortenberry was likely a daughter or granddaughter of Henry Falkenberg, oldest son of Hendrick Jacobs Falkenberg.

The predominant spelling of the name in New Jersey became Falkinburg and in the southern states became Fortenberry, with Faulkenberry being another common variation. b. Peter Jegou lived at Deer Point until 1683 and then moved to Cecil County, Maryland where his will was proved on April 1, 1687, mentioning no descendants. c.

Life and career Tanaka initially trained as a stage actor in the shingeki movement under Kaoru Osanai, but eventually joined the Nikkatsu film studio in 1917. He debuted as a director in 1918 but mostly had to work with shinpa stories, not the shingeki techniques he was used to although two early films, The Living Corpse (Ikeru shikabane) and The Cherry Orchard (Sakura no sono) were based on Tolstoy and Chekhov respectively. Working in parallel with the Pure Film Movement, Tanaka made two films, Ky≈çya eirimise (1922) and Dokuro no mai (1923), based on his own screenplays, that were highly praised for their cinematic technique. He remained a rather conservative filmmaker and still used oyama (male actors) in female roles, including in his masterpiece Ky≈çya eirimise, a melodrama about a merchant's destructive love for a geisha. He used actresses for the first time in Dokuro no mai, a story of a monk reminiscing about his youth and early loves. His career as a director came to an end in 1923 aside from two minor sound films in the 1930s but he also penned screenplays for such directors as Kenji Mizoguchi and Yutaka Abe and concentrated on acting, appearing in films by Tadashi Imai and Shir≈ç Toyoda.

Elhanan Winchester - Page 233 1836 Life Self- educated eldest son of a farmer and religious seeker, Winchester began preaching to the New Lights of the Congregationalist Church in his native Massachusetts as a youth. He soon joined the Baptists, where he married the first of what would become his five successive wives. At a revival meeting in 1771, he was ordained a Baptist minister in Rehoboth, Massachusetts. In 1774, Winchester traveled to Welsh Neck, South Carolina to accept a position, which he left upon the death of his first wife. He married again in Boston, but that wife too died, as did his third wife (whom he met in Virginia) in 1779. Seven of his eight children also predeceased him. As an itinerant preacher, Winchester grew increasingly troubled about slavery. In a 1779 revival meeting, he preached to fifty whites and about a hundred blacks, one of the first to share the gospel openly with slaves. He discovered solace in the Everlasting Gospel of Paul Siegvolck and Universal Restitution of George Stonehouse, Oxford Holy Club alumni like John Wesley, and came to believe in universal salvation. Winchester decided to stay in Philadelphia after stopping there on the way back from a Massachusetts vacation, and receiving invitations to preach from a white church and a black church. He also eventually married for the fifth time. After the Baptist Church excommunicated his 100-member congregation in 1781, Winchester founded the Society of Universal Baptists and preached at the University of Pennsylvania for four years before a meeting- house could be built on Lombard Street. Winchester also became acquainted with Unitarians, including the physician George de Benneville, who had fled France and Germany to a safe haven near Ephrata, Pennsylvania. The two traveled on missionary tours through Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia. During what became a six-year trip to England (September 1787-July 1794), Winchester preached at least twice daily and worked with William Vidler to transform the General Baptist Assembly. In the end the Assembly excommunicated Vidler for universalist tendencies in 1793. Winchester also met Joseph Priestley, Thomas Belsham and Richard Price, and published The Universal Restoration: Exhibited in Four Dialogues in 1788. During his absence, American Universalists including his friend Benjamin Rush had held a Convention in 1790 and established their own church.Joseph H. Allen and Richard Eddy, A History of the Unitarians and Universalists in the United States, New York: the Christian Literature Company, 1894 at pp. 411-413 available at https://books.google.com/books?id=HnfRXIirFEcC&pg;=PR9 Winchester returned to New England in 1794 for a preaching tour and became moderator of the Massachusetts Universalist Convention. He then returned to Philadelphia in 1796, where he drew Priestley to American shores and shared his pulpit, but fell ill with tuberculosis. He gave a major sermon to the Convention in Hartford, Connecticut, and several lesser sermons, before his death on April 18, 1797 aged 45.

Simalungun people live mostly in Simalungun Regency and the surrounding areas, including the city of Pematang Siantar, an autonomous city, but previously part of Simalungun Regency. The regent of Simalungun is JR Saragih. The Simalungun live in the 'Eastern Batak' lands, bordering the lands of the Batak Toba to the south and west, and the Batak Karo to the north. The Simalungun are considered to have more in common with their Karo than Toba neighbours, both groups having migrated from Toba and Pakpak in order to participate in trade.http://www.kitlv- journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/3113/3874 The Simalungun language is still spoken by many Simalungun people, in addition to Indonesian. Traditional Simalungun life A Simalungun museum in Pematangsiantar, North Sumatra, Indonesia. Long before Dutch colonialism was established in North- East Sumatra, people now known collectively as Batak Timur (Eastern Batak) claimed the area as their original homeland, for example Sin Raya (Raya's peoples), Sin Silou (Silou's peoples), Sin Bandar (Bandar's peoples), and so forth. Dutch colonialism was first established in the Malay area of Deli (Medan) under \\"De Vide et impera\\" (the concept of Dutch political colonialism). The Batak Timur people were ruled by raja (kings), considered to be living gods. One by one their kingdoms capitulated to Dutch aggression and expansionism. The Dutch then gave a collective name to their new colonial area of the Eastern Batak kingdoms, that name being Simeloengoen. With the current Indonesian orthography the name Simalungun is still used today, even among Eastern Batak people themselves. The Simalungun people were ruled by raja (kings), considered to be living gods. G.L. Tichelman (1893‚Äì1962), a Dutch researcher, described Simalungun villages as consisting of houses built parallel to rivers from wooden poles and palm leaves. Houses could accommodate a single family (rumah parsatanggaan), or as many as twelve (rumah parrumahopattanggaan) with a designated area for each family within. The head of the village lived in the 'Rumah Bolon', the village's largest, most ornate house. The Head of Village was installed by, and loyal to The King. The main village or capital of each Kingdom were called 'Pematang.' Villagers drove out spirits from the village by holding 'Robu Tabu', days on which the village would be decorated and outsiders excluded from the village. Villages would bathe in a communal 'tapian', with water piped through bamboo tubes for bathing. The Simalungun also used bamboo tubes for carrying water back to the village. Religious ceremonies would often be held near the Tapian. 'Parsihili' were statues used to take an illness away from a person, while 'Pasiarhon' were statues used for communing with the dead. Although villagers would support victims of house fires, it was considered unlucky to offer them shelter for fear of further fires, and instead a new house would be constructed communally as soon as possible. It was considered inappropriate to bargain with family members, so an intermediary would be used when purchasing items from family. Courtship was arranged in the marketplace using a betel nut. Girls wishing to avoid attention would give the nut to an old man, who would look after her during market day, or would wear a hiou, to suggest unavailability. The pounding of rice was an important activity, and the communal 'Losung', or riceblock, was used for this activity, with a hole allocated for each family to use. A new losung would be cut from a tree trunk, and on an auspicious day decorated with flowers and transported into the village accompanied by music. A boy and girl dressed in ceremonial clothes would invest the new riceblock by throwing rice over it, and the villagers would sing songs. The birth of a child was an auspicious occasion, and the dukun (midwife/witch doctor) was appointed to drive off spirits, and to cut the umbilical cord with a bamboo knife. The newborn baby would be swaddled and daubed with rice chewed by the dukun prior to the mother commencing breastfeeding. The placenta would be buried under the house and for seven nights a fire would be maintained to drive off spirits. On the seventh day the child would be brought to the tapian. If the date of birth was an auspicious one, this would be done using by the mother a new hiou, a ragi idup or ragi panei, but if the date was a bad one, the baby would be carefully brought by all the women of the village, who would set out to deceive the evil spirits in order to protect the baby. When the child was named, it would be given black, white and red bracelets for protective purposes. A well-preserved traditional Simalungun village can be seen at Pematang Purba. Simalungun people Heads of Simalungun in East Coast Sumatra. The concept of a cohesive Simalungun people is derived in part from Dutch colonialism. In 1870 the Dutch established the Residency of East Sumatra, centred on Medan in the Kingdom of Deli. In 1904 the Netherlands East Indies government signed surrender agreements with the seven kingdoms of the 'Simeloengoenlanden', in order to form the administrative of unit Simeloengoen en Karolanden. These seven Simalungun kingdoms were the kingdoms of Siantar, Tanoh Jawa, Panei, Dolok Silou, Raya, Purba and Silimahuta. It has been suggested that Tanoh Jawa had more in common with early pagan Asahan (later to become the Asahan Sultanate) than it did with the other Simalungun kingdoms. The colonial seat was established in 1908 at Pematang Siantar. The Dutch colonial system encouraged migration, especially of Javanese and Tobanese labourers working on Dutch plantations, with both peoples bringing new influences to the area, which tended to cause the original people of Simalungun to be intimidated and marginalized. After World War II, in 1946, a social revolution occurred in East Sumatra which is viewed as a tragedy by the Simalungun people. Non-native settlers in East Sumatra demanded changes to the monarchy systems of Deli, Karo and Simalungun, and agitated for unity with the Javanese government which had been proclaimed as the Republic Of Indonesia in August, 1945. Many were kidnapped and killed, especially from the royal families of each Kingdom. The monarchy system in East Sumatra was deposed and, while the families are still intact and acknowledged by the Simalungun people as such among themselves, the titles are now entirely ceremonial within the Simalungun cultures. Christianity August Theis, a German missionary arrived in Sumatra in 1902. He was subject to Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen, who instructed him to head to the Simalungun region. They arrived on 2 September 1903, a day now commemorated by the Simalungun church. Theis opened several schools, and returned to the Netherlands in 1921. The first translation of The Bible into an indigenous Indonesian language was by Wismar Djaulung Saragih Sumbayak, who had been baptised by Theis in 1910. Wismar also authored the first Simalungun dictionary, and successfully campaigned for teaching in schools to be conducted in Simalungun rather than Toba. He also pushed for the use of traditional Simalungun clothes and music in the church. His efforts eventually led to the formation of the distinct Simalungun Protestant Christian Church.  Language  Simalungun has its own regional language that is different from Indonesian, Karo Batak, Toba Batak and Malay and is called Batak Simalungun language. Simalungun surnames Roof of a rumah bolon, the house of a Simalungun Batak raja and his family. Simalungun people belong to one of four surnames (clans). Each surname has sub-surnames, although individuals may choose to identify primarily by their surnames, rather than sub-surnames, in order to emphasize common kinship.

On December 18, 1687, he concurrently received the position of wakadoshiyori . Tadamasu became daimy≈ç of Odawara on the retirement of his father in 1698. In November 1703, the Great Genroku earthquake caused severe damage to Edo and to Odawara, destroying much of Odawara-juku on the T≈çkaid≈ç connecting Edo with Kyoto. Despite this disaster, on September 21, 1705, Tadamasu was promoted to the position of r≈çj≈´ under Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi. However, further natural disasters followed. On October 4, 1707, the Great Hoei earthquake again devastated Edo and Odawara, destroying much of what had been rebuilt from the earlier disaster. This was followed by the H≈çei eruption of Mount Fuji in December, with volcanic ash raining on Edo and Odawara and repeated earthquakes. The following year the Sakawa River flooded due to sediment build-up resulting from the ash fall, and the crops failed. Some 104 villages in Ashigarakami District and 59 villages in Sunt≈ç District were rendered uninhabitable. Tadamasu appealed to the Tokugawa shogunate for assistance, and in response, the government annexed the disaster-struck portions of his territories as tenry≈ç under the direct control of the central government, and provided Tadamasu for new territories with an assessed value of 60,000 koku scattered across the provinces of Izu, Mimasaka and Harima. In addition, a special nationwide tax of two gold ry≈ç for every 100 koku of rice produced raised 480,000 ry≈ç for relief efforts. Tadamasu died in 1713. The new territories provided by the shogunate where exchanged back in 1747, but did not regain their former value for another several decades.  References  * Papinot, Edmond.

Peter Paul Marshall (1830 - 16 February 1900) was a Scottish civil engineer and amateur painter, and a founding partner of the decorative arts firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. Marshall was born in Edinburgh, the son of local artist, William Marshall, and was educated at Edinburgh High School. He worked as a draughtsman for Thomas Grainger, a civil engineer and early Scottish railway builder. In 1847, he became an assistant to architect James Newlands, and accompanied him to Liverpool when Newlands was appointed Civil Engineer to the Borough. Marshall exhibited paintings at the Liverpool Academy in 1852 and 1854.Gibeling (1996), pp. 8-9. Marshall was living in London by 16 March 1857, when he married Augusta Buchanan Miller, daughter of John Miller, an important early patron of the artists of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Later that year he became surveyor to the Tottenham Local Board of Health. Marshall was introduced to Pre-Raphaelite circles in London by Ford Madox Brown, whom he had probably met when Madox Brown was exhibiting in Liverpool in the 1850s.Gibeling (1996), p. 10. In 1861 Marshall became a founder-shareholder in Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., \\"Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals,\\" along with William Morris, Ford Madox Brown, Edward Burne-Jones, Charles Faulkner, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Philip Webb.Harvey & Press (1991), p. 38 Marshall's exact role in the firm is unclear. According to William Michael Rossetti, the idea of forming a decorative arts firm originated with Marshall, and Marshall designed some stained glass panels and furniture for the firm, but most writers have followed Morris's biographer John William Mackail in discounting Marshall's contributions. Marshall continued his work as a civil engineer during the early years of the partnership. He resigned his position with the Tottenham Board of Health under pressure following a typhoid outbreak in 1873. He exhibited several paintings between 1873 and 1875, when Morris, Marshall, Faulkner, & Co. was dissolved, and continued to paint after he accepted the position of City Engineer in Norwich in 1877, a position he held until June 1893 when his health began to fail. He retired to Teignmouth the following year, where he continued his artistic pursuits. He died on 16 February 1900.Gibeling (1996), p. 13 NotesReferences * * Category:Scottish civil engineers Category:19th- century Scottish painters Category:Scottish male painters Category:People from Edinburgh Category:1830 births Category:1900 deaths Category:Morris & Co.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 14, 2010. The episode follows housewife Lois after she is convinced to become a championship boxer. As she continues fighting, however, she eventually decides to go into retirement, only to be challenged by the top ranked fighter in all of Rhode Island. Deciding to accept the challenge, Lois faces the fight of her life, causing her to unleash pent-up anger at Peter. The episode was written by Alex Carter and directed by Julius Wu. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 7.00 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Luke Adams, Carrie Fisher and Nicole Sullivan, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It was first announced at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. Plot Announcing his excitement for his upcoming birthday, Peter eagerly awaits to receive his gifts. After receiving a birthday card from Cleveland, Peter receives tickets to a female's boxing club from Quagmire, who invites the group there, where Peter's wife, Lois, is volunteered to participate in a fight. Easily beating her competition in an instant, the club owner suggests she become a professional boxer. Unable to understand how she won the fight, Lois becomes reluctant to fight anyone else. After Peter takes her blindfolded to a boxing club (even tricking her into wearing a boxing outfit) she thinks is a fancy restaurant, Lois becomes angered at him for tricking her. By imagining that she is beating up Peter, she is able to win the fight. Returning home, Lois begins taking boxing seriously, and starts working out. Continued to be angered by Peter, Lois aspires to be a champion boxer, and eventually becomes the top-ranked boxer in Quahog. During a fight, however, Lois' nose is broken, and she becomes reluctant to fight any longer. Going on to reveal that the only reason she fought was because of her hatred of her husband's obsession with boxing, and that she imagined she was beating up Peter during her matches because she can't actually beat him up for real, Lois and Peter agree to end her career, and go into retirement. In a ceremony honoring Lois, held by Mayor Adam West, she is called out by Deirdre Jackson, an undefeated champion fighter who was said to have killed three women in the ring, and she challenges Lois to a match. After insulting and humiliating Peter at the statue dedication (milking his man-breasts like cow udders), Jackson eventually convinces Lois to compete and come out of retirement. In a pre-fight interview with Tom Tucker, Jackson announces her intention to kill her opponent in Round 6, which only causes Lois to become even more angered. As the match begins, Lois becomes an easy target for Jackson in the first round. Feeling she stands no chance, Lois is convinced to continue fighting, making it to the sixth round. Badly beaten, Lois continues to be beaten by Jackson, who suddenly hits her with a big left hook, causing her to become nearly unconscious. Quickly recovering, Lois then begins unleashing her pent-up rage, and eventually and finally knocks her opponent unconscious herself. The next day, Lois begins her recovery as a champion, and she is surrounded by her family at the breakfast table. Peter is also excited, as he triumphantly announces that he now able to eat his cereal with his own breast milk, saved from his encounter with Jackson.

Cultural references The plot of the episode parodies the film Rocky III, with the character of Deirdre Jackson being a female replica of Clubber Lang from the third film of the series. On his very lengthy audio birthday card, Cleveland can be heard singing Hanson's \\"MMMBop\\". During Lois' final fight, Peter sings the Survivor song \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" and is interrupted by Quagmire to focus on the fight. Reception \\"Baby, You Knock Me Out\\" was broadcast on November 14, 2010, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by The Simpsons, and Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane's spin-off, The Cleveland Show, and followed by an episode of American Dad!. It was watched by 7.00 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with Desperate Housewives on ABC, Undercover Boss on CBS and Sunday Night Football on NBC. The episode also acquired a 3.3 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating American Dad! and The Cleveland Show in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership. The episode's ratings decreased significantly from the previous week's episode. Television critics reacted mostly positive toward the episode, calling the storyline \\"another strong outing, once it got going.\\" In a simultaneous review of the episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the show, and the broadcast of American Dad! that followed it, The A.V. Club's Emily VanDerWerff wrote, \\"Family Guy, like The Simpsons last year, is quietly turning out a pretty solid season for what the show has become in its later years.\\" VanDerWerff went on to compliment several elements of the show, including the under reliance on cut-away gags, and its utilization of \\"such time-honored bits as Brian acting like a dog or Peter acting like a 4-year-old.\\" She ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the second best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode \\"Little Man on Campus\\" and the American Dad! episode \\"Stan's Food Restaurant\\". In a slightly more neutral review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's \\"nonsensical humor\\" and its acknowledgment of Cleveland Brown and The Cleveland Show. Hughes went on to comment on the episode's ability to focus on the main storyline, writing, \\"as is becoming more common, were again few and far between as the central plot dominated the episode. In fact, the boxing storyline was the only plot going, which is incredibly rare in any sitcom format.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 9) episodes Category:Boxing mass media ","title":"Baby, You Knock Me Out"},{"id":"29125370","text":"St. Mary's Girls High School is a sister school of St. Thomas Higher Secondary School, Kozhencherry in Kerala, the South Western state in India.

The Maramon Convention, the largest Christian gathering in Asia, is held in every February on the sand bed of Pamba which is near to the church. This is one of the oldest churches in Kerala, established in AD 1599. In 1941 the new church was built adjacent to the old church. At the time of construction of the new church, this was the biggest Christian church building in the Central Travancore region.  Church history = Kochupally  Kochupally, Kozhencherry Certain ancient Christian families who resided on the banks of river Pampa have recorded their origins and these evidences speak of the early Christian settlers around Kozhencherry to have worshiped in the churches at Maramon and Chengannur. According to these records, the earliest church at Kozhencherry was constructed in AD 1599, according to the Malayalam Era (M.E. 775). The location of the church, a small thatched building was at Vennapra, a hilly area on the eastern part of the Mulayodil field which is situated towards the east of the present St. Thomas Marthoma Church Kozhencherry The society in those days of Hindu domination was plagued by the evils of caste discrimination and untouchability. While the renovation of the church was in progress, the Kovilans demolished the church enraged by the supposed disrespect of some of the 'Mappilas'. The prominent Christians of the time organized themselves and brought their grievance to the attention of the then ruling King Maharaja Thekkumkur Kulasekhara. As a result, His Highness the Maharaja graciously granted the land which belonged to the Chengazhasseri illom (where the present Kochupalli is situated) and the land was exempted from giving tax by the authority of the seal of the Maharaja on a Chempola. Worship was resumed in a temporary structure constructed on the north of the Kochupalli, where the present cemetery stands. The people of the locality joined the Maramon Church for worship until the church was re-established in Kozhencherry. Around 950 M.E. (1774) a new church was established in the name of Virgin Mary in the location of the present Kochupalli. Subsequent to the 'Naveekaranam' in Malankara Church, launched by Abraham Malpan, in 1012 M.E. (1836) the Malankara Syrian Church split into two factions one supporting naveekaranam (reformation) and the others who was against it, following a court order. As a result, reformist faction established them self as separate church known as Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church . The Kochupalli in Kozhencherry was among the few churches allotted to the Marthoma church. Afterwards, the Marthomites and the Orthodox believers conducted their worship in the Kochupalli taking turns. In 1069 M.E. (1893) the church was renovated. On the northern side of the compound wall, where the old church had existed, a piece of land was set apart for use as a cemetery. The expenses were met by the Marthomites. On finishing the work, the Orthodox were asked to meet a share of the expenses which was not obliged to by them. A court case was filed and the judgement asked the Orthodox to remit a share of the expenses if they were to conduct worship once in five times. But the orthodox were not prepared to comply with it. They secured a place of their own and established a parish church, which they could use with full freedom. This left the Kochupalli exclusively to the Marthomites. As the large majority of Christian families of this area continued to support Naveekaranam, the number of parishioners increased and the Kozhencherry Church grew stronger day by day.  St. Thomas Marthoma Valia Pally, Kozhencherry  In order to accommodate the increasing number of parishioners, it became inevitable to enlarge the Kochupalli. But there was strong opposition from the parishioners about demolishing the Kochupalli. Many of them wanted the Kochupalli to be kept intact as it was one of the very few buildings representing the antiquity and the treasured traditions of the Mar Thoma church. However, Edavaka sangham, the Parish General Body was aware of the inadequacy of the available plot and it was decided to secure a new plot and construct a new bigger church. Some were of the opinion that if a plot adjoining the church ground on the western side was purchased there would be enough space to construct a new church. But there was a pathway in between the two plots. The intervention of the influential Rev. C. P. Philipose was instrumental in arranging a new pathway in place of the old one. After this, the Mannurethu plot on the western side of the church was bought and under the inspiring leadership of Kurumthottickal Thomas Kathanar II (Rev. K. T. Thomas), the initial steps were taken to build the new church. Titus II Mar Thoma Metropolitan laid the foundation stone of the church on 8 Vrichikam 1108 M.E. (23-11-1932). Koikalethu Mathai Upadesi gave constant and able support to Rev. K. T. Thomas in constructing the church. On 8 April 1941, the dedication ceremony of the biggest church in Travancore at that time was led by Abraham Mar Thoma Metropolitan. According to the church records, it took only 46, 000/- for the entire construction of the church. Even today, the imposing edifice, remarkable for its architectural beauty, with its walls built of perfectly shaped stones stands tall in Central Travancore in all its grandeur and majesty. Today St Thomas Mar Thoma Church, Kozhencherry has a large congregation with more than 1780 families and about 13475 members. As a result of the efforts of the church, several institutions which have proved a blessing to many in the entire area have been established. A reputed college, an industrial training centre, separate high schools for boys and girls, a higher secondary school adjoining St. Thomas High School, an English medium senior secondary school, a pain and palliative care unit, a magnificent auditorium, shopping complexes and a counseling centre in the area are all the contribution of the church for the public. The church has played a key role, in many ways the most significant role, in the development of Kozhencherry and its surrounding areas. Maramon Convention is held in the Kozhencherry side of river Pamba Cathedral status The people in Kozhencherry are demanding Cathedral status for this church.  Institutions = Mar Thoma Senior Secondary School  Mar Thoma Senior Secondary School, Kozhencherry was established in the year 1982. Since then the school has attained a supreme position in the academic arena of Central Kerala, aiming at the all-round development of personality. The school curriculum provides for mental and physical growth. The school is situated in a calm and serene campus in the heart of Kozhencherry at a short distance from the Kozhencherry bus stand. The Mar Thoma Metropolitan is the patron and the vicar of the St. Thomas Mar Thoma Church, Kozhencherry is the Manager of the school.  St. Thomas Higher Secondary School  The St. Thomas High school, Kozhencherry was established in the year 1910 and has been instrumental in moulding the lives of many leaders of today. The School is situated at the heart of Kozhencherry town just a short distance from the St. Thomas Mar Thoma church, Kozhencherry. The school was upgraded to Higher Secondary level in the year 1998 incorporating the system of co-education at higher secondary level.  St. Mary's Girls High School  St. Mary's Girls High School was founded in 1930. Since then the school has been imparting quality education to girl students.  Pain and palliative care  The pain and palliative care unit was inaugurated on 24 August 2008 by Philipose Mar Chrysostom Valiya Metropolitan. Its purpose is to support severely ill and bed-ridden patients in and around Kozhencherry. Food Kits are deliveredto less-well-off patients by the team leaders, and monthly supplies of medicines are provided for patients who cannot afford to buy them. The services of doctors are made available to the patients in the unit by the help and support of the District Palliative Care unit operating at Kozhencherry Government Hospital.

Born in New Zealand, she was self-employed in Australia in the 1980s. After graduating from the University of Waikato, she joined the Hamilton law firm McCaw Lewis Chapman and became a partner and held senior management roles. She is involved in various community and business organisations at a governance level. As a political novice, she defeated former Mayor and experienced politician Bob Simcock in the 2010 New Zealand local government elections. Hardaker was re-elected in the 2013 election beating her main rival Ewan Wilson, with a majority of 2911 votes, becoming the first mayor of Hamilton in nearly two decades to survive their first term in office. She was returned to power with an increased majority, capturing 43.6% of the valid mayoral votes cast. Life outside politics Hardaker grew up near Rotorua. She lived in Australia during the 1980s, where she was self- employed in retail. She graduated from the University of Waikato Faculty of Law in 1995 as the top law student with LLB Hons. Hardaker also holds a Masters of Management (Hons 1st class) degree from Waikato University. She was recently elected Chair of Women on Boards, a division of Governance New Zealand. After university she joined the Hamilton law firm McCaw Lewis Chapman, where she became a partner in 2000. She initially specialised in dispute resolution, before turning her attention to employment law. She chaired the law firm's governance board, and at the time of her election as Mayor of Hamilton, she was in charge of finance. Hardaker has served on the boards of the Waikato Chamber of Commerce and Industry Inc. She has been a member of the St Peters School Board of Trustees, and has been on the board of Habitat for Humanity Waikato. Before her election as Mayor, she was the chairperson of the Waikato SPCA. Hardaker was also the founding chair of The Peoples Project, established in Hamilton to respond to homelessness based on a housing first model. Hardaker is married to Steven Perdia, who is father to two boys living in Australia. Political career Hardaker entered the 2010 mayoral contest as a political newcomer, one of six candidates. Her main opponent was the experienced politician Bob Simcock, the incumbent Mayor, who has been on Hamilton City Council for 6 years. He had been appointed Mayor in 2007 following the resignation of his predecessor, and had represented Hamilton West in Parliament from 1996 until his defeat in 2002. Hardaker campaigned for opening the books on the V8s, transparent government, city living and making the Waikato River accessible. Of the 33,000 votes cast Hardaker and Simcock received 13,626 and 12,670, respectively, a majority of 956 votes and representing about 41% for Hardaker. A year into her reign, an opinion poll by the Waikato Times showed an almost unchanged level of support, with 40% of the respondents stating they would vote for her again if an election were held tomorrow. She stood for re-election in the 2013 mayoral election. Her manifesto for her second term was managing finances, implementing the Waikato River Plan and investing in the city. The three-way battle between incumbent Hardaker, Ewan Wilson and David Macpherson narrowed when trailing Macpherson asked his supporters to shift their vote to Wilson which Hardaker called political game playing and claimed it made a mockery of the election process. She was re-elected with 15737 votes over rival Ewan Wilson with 12826 votes, a 2911 majority which was a three-fold majority increase from 2010 and the first Mayor in Hamilton to be re-elected since Margaret Evans in 1995. In March 2016 Hardaker announced that she would not be contesting the 2016 mayoral election and returning to her law career. Hardaker described her greatest challenge during her term as Mayor as opening the books on the financial status of the V8 Super Car Racing, a major event which was entered into by the previous Council. Her leadership and resolve during the process, which included establishing a City financial recovery plan moving the Council out of a 9-year run of operating deficits, received accolades from across the political spectrum. In 2010 City debt was $422 million and forecast to increase to $830 million. By 2016 the council was running operating surpluses and debt had reduced to $348 million. Hardaker listed other Mayoral legacies as the Central City Transformation Plan, Hamilton Gardens and Hamilton City River Plan which is a 30-year visionary document containing a mix of short and long-term projects along 16 km of the Waikato River that would transform the city's relationship with the river. During her term the Hamilton Gardens won \\"World Garden of the Year\\" at the International Garden Tourism Awards in Metz, France. Her performance as Mayor was graded an \\"A\\" having delivered on election promises through a combination of hard work, intelligence and unwavering self-belief. At Hardaker's final Council meeting the City presented to her a new garden rose breed called 'Julie' which is now grown at the Hamilton Gardens.

They are one of two principal ethnic groups in Belgium, the other being the French-speaking Walloons. Flemish people make up the majority of the Belgian population (about 60%). \\"Flemish\\" was historically a geographical term, as all inhabitants of the medieval County of Flanders in modern-day Belgium, France, and the Netherlands were referred to as \\"Flemings\\", irrespective of their ethnicity or language. The contemporary region of Flanders comprises a part of this historical county, as well as parts of the medieval duchy of Brabant and the medieval county of Loon, where the modern Flemish ethnic group and culture gradually formed.  History  The sense of \\"Flemish\\" identity increased significantly after the Belgian Revolution. Prior to this, the term \\"Flemings\\" in the Dutch language was in first place used for the inhabitants of the former County of Flanders. Flemish however had been used since the 14th century to refer to the language and dialects of both the peoples of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant.Lode Wils. De lange weg van de naties in de Lage Landen, p.46. The modern Belgian province of Limburg was not part of the treaty, and only came to be considered \\"Flemish\\" in the 19th century. The Wedding Dance by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, 1625 In 1830 the southern provinces of the United Netherlands proclaimed their independence. French-dialect speaking population, as well as the administration and elites, feared the loss of their status and autonomy under Dutch rule while the rapid industrialization in the south highlighted economic differences between the two. Under French rule (1794‚Äì1815), French was enforced as the only official language in public life, resulting in a Frenchification of the elites and, to a lesser extent, the middle classes. The Dutch king allowed the use of both Dutch and French dialects as administrative languages in the Flemish provinces. He also enacted laws to reestablish Dutch in schools.E.H. Kossmann, De lage landen 1780/1980. Deel 1 1780-1914, 1986, Amsterdam, p. 128 The language policy was not the only cause of the secession; the Roman Catholic majority viewed the sovereign, the Protestant William I, with suspicion and were heavily stirred by the Roman Catholic Church which suspected William of wanting to enforce Protestantism. Lastly, Belgian liberals were dissatisfied with William for his allegedly despotic behaviour. Following the revolt, the language reforms of 1823 were the first Dutch laws to be abolished and the subsequent years would see a number of laws restricting the use of the Dutch language.Jacques Logie, De la r√©gionalisation √† l'ind√©pendance, 1830, Duculot, 1980, Paris-Gembloux, p. 21 This policy led to the gradual emergence of the Flemish Movement, that was built on earlier anti-French feelings of injustice, as expressed in writings (for example by the late 18th-century writer, Jan Verlooy) which criticized the Southern Francophile elites. The efforts of this movement during the following 150 years, have to no small extent facilitated the creation of the de jure social, political and linguistic equality of Dutch from the end of the 19th century. After the Hundred Years War many Flemings migrated to the Azores. By 1490 there were 2,000 Flemings living in the Azores. Willem van der Haegen was the original sea captain who brought settlers from Flanders to the Azores. Today many Azoreans trace their genealogy from present day Flanders. Many of their customs and traditions are distinctively Flemish in nature such as Windmills used for grain, S√£o Jorge cheese and several religious events such as the imperios and the feast of the Cult of the Holy Spirit. Identity and culture Map of the medieval County of Flanders. Within Belgium, Flemings form a clearly distinguishable group set apart by their language and customs. However, when compared to the Netherlands most of these cultural and linguistic differences quickly fade, as the Flemish share the same language, similar or identical customs and (though chiefly with the southern part of today's Netherlands) traditional religion with the Dutch.National minorities in Europe, W. Braum√ºller, 2003, page 20. However, the popular perception of being a single polity varies greatly, depending on subject matter, locality and personal background. Generally, Flemings will seldom identify themselves as being Dutch and vice versa, especially on a national level.Nederlandse en Vlaamse identiteit, Civis Mundi 2006 by S.W Couwenberg. . Page 62. Quote: \\"Er valt heel wat te lachen om de wederwaardigheden van Vlamingen in Nederland en Nederlanders in Vlaanderen. Ze relativeren de verschillen en beklemtonen ze tegelijkertijd. Die verschillen zijn er onmiskenbaar: in taal, klank, kleur, stijl, gedrag, in politiek, maatschappelijke organisatie, maar het zijn stuk voor stuk varianten binnen √©√©n taal-en cultuurgemeenschap.\\" The opposite opinion is stated by L. Beheydt (2002): \\"Al bij al lijkt een grondiger analyse van de taalsituatie en de taalattitude in Nederland en Vlaanderen weinig aanwijzingen te bieden voor een gezamenlijke culturele identiteit. Dat er ook op andere gebieden weinig aanleiding is voor een gezamenlijke culturele identiteit is al door Geert Hofstede geconstateerd in zijn vermaarde boek Allemaal andersdenkenden (1991).\\" L. Beheydt, \\"Delen Vlaanderen en Nederland een culturele identiteit?\\", in P. Gillaerts, H. van Belle, L. Ravier (eds.), Vlaamse identiteit: mythe √©n werkelijkheid (Leuven 2002), 22-40, esp. 38. This is partly caused by the popular stereotypes in the Netherlands as well as Flanders which are mostly based on the 'cultural extremes' of both Northern and Southern culture.Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: Accounting for the past, 1650-2000; by D. Fokkema, 2004, Assen. But also in great part because of the history of emancipation of their culture in Belgium, which has left many Flemings with a high degree of national consciousness, which can be very marked among some Dutch-speaking Belgians. Alongside this overarching political and social affiliation, there also exists a strong tendency towards regionalism, in which individuals greatly identify themselves culturally through their native province, city, region or dialect they speak.  Language  Flemings speak Dutch (specifically its southern variant, which is often colloquially called 'Flemish'). It is the majority language in Belgium, being spoken natively by three-fifths of the population. Its various dialects contain a number of lexical and a few grammatical features which distinguish them from the standard language.G. Janssens and A. Marynissen, Het Nederlands vroeger en nu (Leuven/Voorburg 2005), 155 ff. As in the Netherlands, the pronunciation of Standard Dutch is affected by the native dialect of the speaker. At the same time East Flemish forms a continuum with both Brabantic and West Flemish. Standard Dutch is primarily based on the Hollandic dialect (spoken in the northwestern Netherlands) and to a lesser extent on Brabantic, which is the most dominant Dutch dialect of the Southern Netherlands and Flanders.  Religion  Approximately 75% of the Flemish people are by baptism assumed Roman Catholic, though a still diminishing minority of less than 8% attends Mass on a regular basis and nearly half of the inhabitants of Flanders are agnostic or atheist. A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, showed 55% chose to call themselves religious, 36% believe that God created the universe.Inquiry by 'Vepec', 'Vereniging voor Promotie en Communicatie' (Organisation for Promotion and Communication), published in Knack magazine 22 November 2006 p.14 [The Dutch language term 'gelovig' is in the text translated as 'religious'; more precisely it is a very common word for believing in particular in any kind of God in a monotheistic sense, and/or in some afterlife.

The first documented useArmorial des provinces et des communes de Belgique, Max Servais of the Flemish lion was on the seal of Philip d'Alsace, count of Flanders of 1162. As of that date the use of the Flemish coat of arms (or a lion rampant sable) remained in use throughout the reigns of the d'Alsace, Flanders (2nd) and Dampierre dynasties of counts. The motto \\"Vlaanderen de Leeuw\\" (Flanders the lion) was allegedly present on the arms of Pieter de Coninck at the Battle of the Golden Spurs on July 11, 1302. After the acquisition of Flanders by the Burgundian dukes the lion was only used in escutcheons. It was only after the creation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands that the coat of arms (surmounted by a chief bearing the Royal Arms of the Netherlands) once again became the official symbol of the new province East Flanders.  Diaspora = Brazil  Canada  The first sizeable wave of Flemish migration to Canada occurred in the 1870s, when Saint Boniface proved a popular destination for work in local flour mills, brick yards and railway yards.

United Kingdom  Prior to the 1600s, there were several substantial waves of Flemish migration to the United Kingdom. Today, numerous towns in England and Wales boast large or majority populations with Flemish ancestry as a result. The first wave fled to England in the early 12th Century, escaping damages from a storm across the coast of Flanders, where they were largely resettled in Pembrokeshire by Henry I.

It was released on 6 January 1985, for broadcast on The Disney Channel and distribution on Disney Home Video VHS. Plot During the Wars of the Roses (1455-1487), Sir Daniel is a powerful, unscrupulous knight, surrounded by equally treacherous retainers, Oates, Sykes, Appleyard, and Scar. Since the white rose of the House of York is in the ascendant, Sir Daniel and his household are loyal to York and the white rose. The film takes place just before Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick's rebellion against Edward IV (1469‚Äì1471). Some twelve years prior to this Daniel, Oates, Sykes, and Appleyard perjured themselves to attaint a nobleman, who later would go by the name of \\"Black Arrow.\\" He went to France in exile while his five year old daughter Joanna was warded to Sir Daniel. Black Arrow had not seen his daughter for twelve years since she had been kept in a convent during the wars. Sir Daniel was also the guardian of his nephew Richard, who is trained to fight by Scar. Scar and Richard are unaccountably enemies. On the eve of Richard's twenty-first birthday he is finally able to defeat Scar, although Scar is handicapped by his left hand tied behind his back. Daniel's court then hails him as Sir Richard after he takes the oath to be loyal to the white rose of the house of York. Sir Daniel arranges for Black Arrow's now seventeen-year-old daughter Joanna to be brought from the convent to his castle to keep her from being rescued by her father. He also plans to marry her to take full possession of her inheritance. Appleyard is sent by Sir Daniel to one of his tenants to confiscate livestock for the Earl of Warwick's upcoming visit. Richard is also sent to assist Appleyard. Appleyard surmises that Black Arrow will confront him, which he does. Black Arrow accompanied by Lawless and armed with a long bow succeeds in killing Appleyard, armed with a cross bow. Richard challenges the outlaws to a duel with staves, but he is beaten and sent back to Sir Daniel. Joanna at Sir Daniel's castle is being prepared for marriage. She is a defiant adherent to the red rose of Lancaster, and she outrages Sir Richard by daring to wear a red rose in Sir Daniel's household. Richard angrily snatches the red rose off Joanna's dress and crushes it. The Earl of Warwick comes to Sir Daniel's castle for a visit during which time Sir Daniel persuades him to outlaw Black Arrow. Warwick is eager to help Sir Daniel because he wants to enlist his help in his future revolt against King Edward. Joanna overhears Sir Daniel and Warwick planning for her marriage, so she steals Sir Richard's clothing while he is bathing and escapes from the castle. Sir Richard is sent by Sir Daniel to recapture her and take her to York where Sir Daniel and Warwick have gone. Secretly Sir Daniel sends Scar and men-at-arms to kill Sir Richard and frame Black Arrow for his murder so as to take over his inheritance. Joanna succeeds in ambushing Sir Richard, who in turn overpowers her. While this is going on Scar shoots Sir Richard in the shoulder, but Joanna comes to his rescue. Hearing the approach of Scar and his companions Joanna rides off to draw them away from where Sir Richard lies gravely wounded. She is then captured by Scar and his men and taken to York. Sir Richard is discovered by Black Arrow and his men, who subsequently capture Scar. Sir Richard recovers sufficiently to engage Scar in close combat, which ends in Scar's death. In York, Oates reminds Sir Daniel that he will be a bigger land owner than Warwick and, then, double-crosses him by going to Warwick with the information that it was Sir Daniel that had Sir Richard killed. Oates is also fortunate in capturing Black Arrow and his companion Will, when the two arrive in York incognito to stop Joanna's marriage to Sir Daniel. Sir Richard manages to get to Warwick in York. Warwick, who is wary of Sir Daniel, grants Sir Richard's request to release Black Arrow and his companion. During Sir Daniel's wedding it is Richard, Black Arrow and Will who stand up to show just cause why Sir Daniel and Joanna should not be joined in marriage. Oates also stands up denouncing Sir Daniel as a murderer. Sir Daniel dispatches Oates with a tossed dagger. Sir Richard fights blade to blade with Sir Daniel but is disarmed and nearly killed, but Black Arrow succeeds in killing Sir Daniel with a black arrow. Sir Richard and Joanna marry and ride off into the sunset, Ostensibly headed for Sir Daniel's Castle which Sir Richard has automatically inherited.

Name From 1958 to 1972, it became known as the Vidyodaya University and from 1972 to 1978 as the Vidyodaya Campus of the University of Sri Lanka during which time it became a secular state university. The renaming of the Vidyodaya Campus in 1978 as the University of Sri Jayewardenepura led to the re-emergence of the Maligakanda Pirivena, which has since claimed to be the successor to the Vidyodaya Pirivena. History Siri Nanissara Thero, principal of Vidyodaya Pirivena before his death 1923. The Vidyodya Pirivena was founded due to the efforts of Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, who is considered to be one of the pioneers in the revival of Buddhism and the tradition of oriental education during the 19th Century in Sri Lanka. The land at Maligakanda (a suburb of Colombo) and funds for its foundation were donated by the philanthropist Andiris Perera Dharmagunawardhana. Both Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera and Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, following their success in the Panadura Debate, played a key roles in its development. Their aim was to train educated orator monks to save Buddhism from the decline it was undergoing due to colonial rule,Sri Lanka Department of Government Information Vidyalankara Pirivena: Its contribution to cultural and educational development. Retrieved 1 July 2011 and for that purpose it was made the study of logic compulsory in pirivena education.

Allergies are hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system to specific substances called allergens (such as pollen, stings, drugs, or food) that, in most people, result in no symptoms. Trees within the order Fagales possess particularly potent allergens, e.g. the prototypical Bet v 1, the major white birch (Betula verrucosa) pollen antigen. Bet v 1 is the main cause of type I allergies observed in early spring. Type I, or immunoglobulin E-mediated (IgE-mediated) allergies affect 1 in 5 people in Europe and North America. Commonly observed symptoms are hay fever, dermatitis, asthma and, in severe cases, anaphylactic shock. First contact with these allergens results in sensitisation; subsequent contact produces a cross-linking reaction of IgE on mast cells and concomitant release of histamine. The inevitable symptoms of an allergic reaction ensue. Categorization A nomenclature system has been established for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in humans.[WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee King T.P., Hoffmann D., Loewenstein H., Marsh D.G., Platts-Mills T.A.E., Thomas W. Bull. World Health Organ. 72:797-806(1994)] This nomenclature system is defined by a designation that is composed of the first three letters of the genus; a space; the first letter of the species name; a space and an Arabic number. In the event that two species names have identical designations, they are discriminated from one another by adding one or more letters (as necessary) to each species designation. The allergens in this family include allergens with the following designations: Bet v 1, Dau c 1, and Pru a 1. Other proteins belonging to this family include the major pollen allergens: * Aln g I from Alnus glutinosa (Alder); * Api G I from Apium graveolens (Celery); * Car b I from Carpinus betulus (European hornbeam); * Cor a I from Corylus avellana (European hazel); * Mal d I from Malus domestica (Apple). Structure NMR analysis has confirmed earlier predictions of the protein structure and site of the major T-cell epitope. The Bet v 1 protein comprises 6 anti-parallel beta-strands and 3 alpha-helices. Four of the strands dominate the global fold, and 2 of the helices form a C-terminal amphipathic helical motif. This motif is believed to be the T-cell epitope. However, one very striking feature of the three-dimensional structure of Bet v 1 is the presence of a large hydrophobic cavity, which is open to the exterior and probably functions as a ligand binding site. The motif is also found in: * the wound-induced protein AoPR1 from Asparagus officinalis (Garden asparagus); * the pathogenesis-related proteins from Phaseolus vulgaris (Kidney bean) and Petroselinum crispum (Parsley) (PR1-1 and PR1-3); * the disease resistance response proteins, STH-2 and STH-21, from Solanum tuberosum (Potato) and pI49, pI176 and DRRG49-C from Pisum sativum (Garden pea); * the P.sativum abscisic acid-responsive proteins ABR17 and ABR18; * and the stress- induced protein SAM22 from Glycine max (Soybean). Additionally, the core domain of Bet v 1 founds or is part of a superfamily of domains called SRPBCC (START/RHOalphaC/PITP/Bet v1/CoxG/CalC) that include the StAR-related lipid- transfer (START) domain.  Function  The biological function of Bet v 1 is still under investigations. Bet v 1 harbors a large hydrophobic pocket and is able to bind a large spectra of ligands in it like hormones and siderophores like flavenols. It belongs to the pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, which are usually expressed upon infections and stressful conditions, implicating a role in host defense. In vitro, Bet v 1 has been shown to be immune- suppressive, when its pocket was filled by a ligand, but was able to mount a Th2-response important in allergy development, when the pocket remained empty.

At one time, the Double-O Ranch covered over . The ranch was owned by Bill Hanley, a well-known cattle baron and Bull Moose progressive. In 1941, the United States Government purchased most of the Double O Ranch property and added it to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. The two remaining Double-O Ranch buildings are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Early history  The Double-O Ranch is located in the Harney Basin of southeastern Oregon. Around 9,800 years ago, the Harney Basin was covered by a single great lake covering . The birds, animals, and plants found in the wetland around the lake provided abundant food for early inhabitants. About 3,500 years ago, small villages began to develop around the lake. Beginning about 1,400 years ago, extended droughts began to shrink the lake and surrounding wetlands.\\"The Prehistory of the Malheur Marshes\\" , Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Princeton, Oregon, 10 November 2008. While there are no records of the earliest people to inhabit the Harney Basin, Native Americans used the wetland areas around Harney Lake for thousands of years before the arrival of European settlers. By the time Europeans began to explore the area in the early nineteenth century, the Northern Paiute people were well established in the Harney Basin. Hudson's Bay Company fur trappers were the first Europeans to visit the Harney Basin. Peter Skene Ogden passed through the area in 1826. Other fur trapping expeditions followed in the 1830s. Several military expeditions explored the area in the late 1850s. Major Enoch Steen was the first non-native to explore the Donner und Blitzen River area south of Harney Lake in 1860. Steens Mountain, that dominates central Harney County, was named in his honor. In the 1860s, the United States Army established a number of military outposts in the Harney Basin.\\"A Little Bit of Malheur History\\" , Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Princeton, Oregon, 10 November 2008. The Double-O Ranch was established in 1875 by Amos W. Riley and James A. Hardin. It was one of the first permanent pioneer settlements in Harney County. In June 1878, during the Bannock War, the original ranch buildings were burned by a Bannock and Paiute war party. On 23 October 1878, the only pitched battle of that war occurred near Silver Creek on the northern edge of the Double-O Ranch.\\"Double-O Ranch Historic District\\", National Register of Historic Places Inventory -- Nomination Form, Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Burns, Oregon, 29 January 1979.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades (Third Edition), Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, p. 275.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

After the Bannock War, Riley and Hardin rebuilt the Double-O Ranch. They continued to operate the ranch until 1903, when it was sold to William \\"Bill\\" Hanley who owned land north of the Double-O Ranch. Hanley improved the Double-O property, significantly increased cattle production. He also made the ranch a rustic retreat for his many guests.LaLande, Jeff and Cain Allen, \\"William Hanley\\", The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, 2005.  Bill Hanley  William \\"Bill\\" Hanley moved to Harney County in eastern Oregon in 1879. Hanley initially purchased land near Burns, Oregon. In 1903, he acquired the Double-O Ranch near Harney Lake for $6 an acre. Over time, Hanley turned it into one of the county's largest cattle ranches, and a showplace for his personal guests who wanted to enjoy the privacy and open space of southeastern Oregon.Jackman, E. R. and John Scharff, Steens Mountain in Oregon's High Desert Country, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, 1967, p. 164-165.Terry, John, \\"Bill Hanley Held the Mantle of Cattle King for Decades\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 19 September 2009. The Double-O was one of five ranches operated by Hanley. His ranch holdings totaled over of deeded property. His Bell-A Ranch was three miles east of Burns. It only covered , but it was widely regarded as one of the finest ranch estates in the western United States. His Double-O Ranch was over . At the Double-O Ranch, it was from the ranch gate to the front door of the main house.Friedman, Ralph, \\"William Hanley: A Fine Feeling For Life\\", The Other Side Of Oregon, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, 1993, pp. 173-180.Oregon End of the Trail, Oregon State Board of Control, Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1940, p. 432. Hanley also had access to thousands of acres of public range land. In 1913, The New York Times reported that Hanley's cattle operation covered .\\"Hanley of Harney Lauds His State\\", The New York Times, New York, New York, 23 November 1913. He eventually established the Harney Valley Improvement Company to promote his land interests and encourage the development of Harney County. During the time he was building his ranch empire, Hanley knew the other powerful eastern Oregon cattle barons well. His peers included Peter French, who owned of the vast P Ranch; John Devine, founder of the White Horse Ranch; and Henry Miller, head of the Miller and Lux Company that controlled over of land in California, Oregon, and Nevada.Jackman, E. R. and John Scharff, Steens Mountain in Oregon's High Desert Country, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, 1967, pp. 143-148, 156-157, 168-173. Hanley was a progressive thinker, who became famous for his ranch hospitality. He entertained guests at his Bell-A Ranch or took them to the rustic Double-O Ranch to enjoy the outdoors. His friends included prominent politicians like Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and William Jennings Bryan as well as business tycoons such as James J. Hill, owner of the Great Northern Railway. Hanley also played host to well- known writer CES Wood, poet Edwin Markham,Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades (Third Edition), Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, p. 245. painter Childe Hassam,Engeman, Richard H., The Oregon Companion, Timber Press, Portland, Oregon, 2009, p. 168. sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor,Hassrick, Peter H., \\"The Oregon Art of Alexander Phimister Proctor\\", Oregon Historical Quarterly (Vol. 104, No. 3), Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, Fall 2003. and humorist Will Rogers. In 1914, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate as a progressive Bull Moose Party candidate.  Malheur National Wildlife Refuge  The Malheur Migratory Bird Refuge was created in 1908. Over the years, the refuge grew to encompass around Malheur Lake. During the 1930s, the P Ranch near Frenchglen, Oregon and Sod House Ranch south of Malheur Lake were incorporated into the refuge, adding to the protected wildlife area. In 1940, the name of the refuge was officially changed to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Double O Station on the Malheur wildlife refugeIn 1941, the United States Government purchased of Double-O Ranch land from the Hanley family for $118,000, adding it to the adjacent Malheur wildlife refuge to preserve shorebird habitat and protect critical waterfowl nesting areas.\\"Addition to be Made to Malheur Refuge\\", The Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 27 March 1940. The Double-O Ranch included the lower Silver Creek drainage and several lakes that provided water to irrigate the property. The ranch's riparian areas, lake shore wetlands, and grassy meadows provided habitat for migratory birds traveling along the Pacific Flyway. A number of natural warm springs made the lakes a winter haven for non-migratory birds as well. Numerous birds including wild swans, Canada geese, great white egrets, herons, pelicans, and many duck species nested on the Double-O Ranch. Because the ranch played an important role in the development of the cattle industry in the western United States, the Double-O Ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district on 25 October 1982. The district covers ; however, there are only two of the original ranch buildings remaining at the site. Both of these historic structures are located on the compound of Double O Station, a year around field station operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

Structures  Cabin built for ranch blacksmith in the 1880sRanch blacksmith shop photographed in 1982After the original Double-O Ranch buildings were burned by Indians in 1878, the ranch was rebuilt by Riley and Hardin. Between 1879 and 1903, a number of buildings were constructed at the site; however, only two of those buildings remain. There are no buildings remaining from the Hanley era. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service added three non- historic building in the 1950s to support refuge operation. The two remaining historic structures include a log cabin and a blacksmith's shop, both dating from the 1880s. In 1982, when the historic district was created, the cabin was in good condition, but the blacksmith's shop was partially collapsed. The log cabin was used as the blacksmith's residence. It is a -story, hand-hewn log structure. All of the logs have been squared and have dovetailed ends that lock the log joints together. The cabin's footprint is by . The cabin has a wooden floor and a cedar shingle roof. There is a porch on the south side of the building that shelters the main door. On the north side there is a second door and two windows. The structure was restored in 1979. The restoration project replaced the doors, windows, and roof. The porch and fireplace were also repaired, and a concealed concrete foundation was placed under the structure. The blacksmith's shop is a single-story log structure with no foundation. The building is approximately by . The only door is on the north side. It has two windows, one on the east end and the other on the west end. A board floor was added in 1903. There are three other modern structures within the historic district. They include a residence used to house a refuge employee who lives at the site year around. The residence was moved from Camp Abbot to its present location in 1954. A large garage was built in 1955, and a pump house was added sometime in the 1950s. None of these structures have historic significance.  Location  The Double-O Ranch Historic District is located within the boundaries of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon.

A balloon is a flexible bag that can be inflated with a gas, such as helium, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and air. For special tasks, balloons can be filled with smoke, liquid water, granular media (e.g. sand, flour or rice), or light sources. Modern day balloons are made from materials such as rubber, latex, polychloroprene, or a nylon fabric, and can come in many different colors. Some early balloons were made of dried animal bladders, such as the pig bladder. Some balloons are used for decorative purposes or entertaining purposes, while others are used for practical purposes such as meteorology, medical treatment, military defense, or transportation. A balloon's properties, including its low density and low cost, have led to a wide range of applications. The rubber balloon was invented by Michael Faraday in 1824, during experiments with various gases. He invented them for use in the lab. Applications=Decoration or entertainment Balloon decorating Decorations made of balloons with a combination of stacking and twisting techniques showcasing the deco-twisting style. Balloons are used for decorating birthday parties, weddings, corporate functions, school events, and for other festive gatherings. The artists who use the round balloons to build are called \\"stackers\\" and the artists who use pencil balloons to build are called \\"twisters.\\" Most commonly associated with helium balloon decor, more recently balloon decorators have been moving towards the creation of air-filled balloon decorations due to the non- renewable natural resource of helium limited in supply. The most common types of balloon decor include arches, columns, centerpieces, balloon drops, sculptures, and balloon bouquets. With the increased aptitude for balloon twisting as well as balloon stacking, the rise of the deco-twister manifests itself as the combination of stacking techniques as well as twisting techniques to create unique and interesting balloon decor option. gay pride parade in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Party balloons are mostly made of a natural latex tapped from rubber trees, and can be filled with air, helium, water, or any other suitable liquid or gas. The rubber's elasticity makes the volume adjustable. Twisting balloons can be used to create decor centerpieces for events and to create a more unique look than can be provided by foil balloons. Often the term \\"Party Balloon\\" will refer to a twisting balloon or pencil balloon. These balloons are manipulated to create shapes and figures for parties and events, typically along with entertainment. Filling the balloon with air can be done with the mouth, a manual or electric inflater (such as a hand pump), or with a source of compressed gas. When rubber or plastic balloons are filled with helium so that they float, they typically retain their buoyancy for only a day or so, sometimes longer. The enclosed helium atoms escape through small pores in the latex which are larger than the helium atoms. Balloons filled with air usually hold their size and shape much longer, sometimes for up to a week. Even a perfect rubber balloon eventually loses gas to the outside. The process by which a substance or solute migrates from a region of high concentration, through a barrier or membrane, to a region of lower concentration is called diffusion. The inside of balloons can be treated with a special gel (for instance, the polymer solution sold under the \\"Hi Float\\" brand) which coats the inside of the balloon to reduce the helium leakage, thus increasing float time to a week or longer. Animal-shaped balloons Beginning in the late 1970s, some more expensive (and longer-lasting) foil balloons made of thin, unstretchable, less permeable metallised films such as Mylar (BoPET) started being produced. These balloons have attractive shiny reflective surfaces and are often printed with color pictures and patterns for gifts and parties. The most important attribute of metallised nylon for balloons is its lightweight, increasing buoyancy and its ability to keep the helium gas from escaping for several weeks. Foil balloons have been criticized for interfering with power lines.\\"Metallic balloons spark controversy\\" . Los Angeles Times. April 8, 2008. Retrieved April 15, 2010.\\"New bill to ban certain balloons\\" . ABC. April 8, 2008. Retrieved April 15, 2010. =Modelling and use in art= Balloon artists are entertainers who twist and tie inflated tubular balloons into sculptures such as animals (see balloon modelling). The balloons used for sculpture are made of extra-stretchy rubber so that they can be twisted and tied without bursting. Since the pressure required to inflate a balloon is inversely proportional to the diameter of the balloon, these tiny tubular balloons are extremely hard to inflate initially. A pump is usually used to inflate these balloons. Decorators may use helium balloons to create balloon sculptures. Usually the round shape of the balloon restricts these to simple arches or walls, but on occasion more ambitious \\"sculptures\\" have been attempted. It is also common to use balloons as table decorations for celebratory events. Balloons can sometimes be modeled to form shapes of animals. Table decorations normally appear with three or five balloons on each bouquet. Ribbon is curled and added with a weight to keep the balloons from floating away. =Drops and releases= Party balloons in Italy A decorative use for balloons is in balloon drops. In a balloon drop, a plastic bag or net filled with air-inflated balloons is suspended from a fixed height. Once released, the balloons fall onto their target area below. Balloon drops are commonly performed at New Year's Eve celebrations and at political rallies and conventions, but may also be performed at celebrations, including graduations and weddings. For decades, people have also celebrated with balloon releases. This practice has been discouraged by the balloon industry, as it has posed problematic for the environment and cities. In recent years, legislation, such as the California Balloon Law, has been enacted to enforce consumers and retailers to tether helium-filled foil (BoPET) balloons with a balloon weight. This ensures that the helium-filled balloons do not float into the atmosphere, which is both potentially injurious to animals, the environment, and power lines. Many states now have banned balloon releases. It is becoming more common for balloons to be filled with air instead of helium, as air-filled balloons will not release into the atmosphere or deplete the earthly helium supply. There are numerous party games and school-related activities that can use air-filled balloons as opposed to helium balloons. When age-appropriate, these activities often include the added fun of blowing the balloons up. In many events, the balloons will contain prizes, and party- goers can pop the balloons to retrieve the items inside. =Publicity use= Balloons are used for publicity at major events. Screen printing processes can be used to print designs and company logos onto the balloons. Custom built printers inflate the balloon and apply ink with elastic qualities through a silk screen template. In January 2008, the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York organized a display of 4,200 red balloons outside the United Nations Headquarters.Sela, Neta (January 24, 2008) 4,200 balloons released in NY to protest Qassam fire , Ynet News. Also in the 1950s at the start of the Cold War, activists in Western Europe uses balloons for propaganda purposes that would float east over Eastern Europe, which would release newspapers and pamphlets. Today, South Korean activists are using the same balloon method to get information to those in North Korea.\\"Target Satellite Europe.\\" Popular Mechanics, April 1956, pp. 110‚Äì112. Paolo Scannavino set the record of 11 for the most giant balloons entered in 2 minutes. =Water balloons= Water balloons are thin, small rubber balloons filled with a liquid, usually water, instead of a gas, and intended to be easily broken. They are usually used by children, who throw them at each other, trying to get each other wet, as a game, competition, or practical joke. By forcing water out the open end of a water balloon, it is possible to use it as a makeshift water gun. =Solar balloons= Solar balloons are thin, large balloons filled with air that is heated by the sun in order to decrease its density to obtain lift. =Balloon rockets= Balloons are often deliberately released, creating a so-called balloon rocket. Balloon rockets work because the elastic balloons contract on the air within them, and so when the mouth of the balloon is opened, the gas within the balloon is expelled out, and due to Newton's third law of motion, the balloon is propelled forward. This is the same way that a rocket works. Flying machines Hot air balloons, San Diego, California Balloons filled with hot air or a buoyant gas have been used as flying machines since the 18th century. The earliest flights were made with hot air balloons using air heated with a flame, or hydrogen as the lifting gas. Later, coal gas and later still helium were used. An unpowered balloon travels with the wind. A balloon which has an engine to propel it is called a dirigible balloon or airship. Medicine Angioplasty is a surgical procedure in which very small balloons are inserted into blocked or partially blocked blood vessels near the heart. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to clear or compress arterial plaque, and to stretch the walls of the vessel, thus preventing myocardial infarction. A small stent can be inserted at the angioplasty site to keep the vessel open after the balloon's removal. Balloon catheters are catheters that have balloons at their tip to keep them from slipping out. For example, the balloon of a Foley catheter is inflated when the catheter is inserted into the urinary bladder and secures its position. Insertion of balloons subsequently filled with air or liquid can be used to stop bleeding in hollow internal organs such as stomach or uterus. History Man has intentionally filled bladders, especially actual animal bladders, with air since prehistory. In Ancient Greece, these had a number of recorded uses. The Aztecs inflated cat intestines to make shapes to present as sacrifices to the gods.Jean Merlin, Kaufman and Greenberg, Great Balloons! The Complete Book of Balloon Sculpting, 1994. By the 18th century, people were inflating balloons of cloth or canvas with hot air and sending it aloft, the Montgolfier brothers going to far as to experiment with first animals in 1782, and then when altitude did not kill them, human beings in 1783. The first hydrogen-filled gas balloon was flown in the 1790s. A century later the first hydrogen-filled weather balloons were launched in France. The first modern, rubber balloons on record were made by Michael Faraday in 1824. He used these to contain gasses he was experimenting with, especially hydrogen. By 1825 similar balloons were being sold by Thomas Hancock, but like Faraday's they came disassembled, two circles of soft rubber. The user was expected to lay the circles one on top of the other, then rub their edges until the soft, gummy rubber stuck, leaving the powdered inner part loose for inflation.Balloons (Rubber) - History of Balloons Modern, preassembled balloons were being sold in the US by the early 20th century. Safety and environmental concerns An illustration of the degradation of the latex polymer in aquatic environments There has been some environmental concern over metallised nylon balloons, as they do not biodegrade or shred as rubber balloons do. Release of these types of balloons into the atmosphere is considered harmful to the environment. This type of balloon can also conduct electricity on its surface and released foil balloons can become entangled in power lines and cause power outages. Released balloons can land anywhere, including on nature reserves or other areas where they can pose a hazard to animals through ingestion or entanglement. Because of the potential harm to wildlife and the effect of litter on the environment, some jurisdictions even legislate to control mass balloon releases. Legislation proposed in Maryland, US, was named after Inky, a pygmy sperm whale who needed six operations after swallowing debris, the largest piece of which was a Mylar balloon. The Balloon Council, a trade organization that represents the interests of balloon businesses, claims that there is no documentary evidence to suggest that the death of any sea mammal has been attributed to foil balloons as a sole cause, to date. In the United Kingdom, foil balloons sold at major theme parks and zoos have balloon weights attached to help prevent accidental release into the environment. Anthony Andrady says that releases of latex balloons that descend into the sea pose a serious ingestion and/or entanglement hazard to marine animals because balloons exposed floating in seawater deteriorate much more slowly than those exposed in air. Balloon manufacturers will often state that a latex balloon is perfectly safe to release into the environment as it is made from a natural substance and will biodegrade over time. However, a latex balloon can take up to a year to degrade if it lands in the sea and during this time it is possible for a marine animal to ingest the balloon and die from slow starvation if its digestive system is blocked. NABAS (National Association of Balloon Artists and Suppliers), an organisation that styles itself \\"The Balloon and Party Professionals Association\\" and represents the UK balloon industry, publishes guidelines for people holding balloon releases. When balloons eventually return to the ground, they begin the degradation process. Latex balloons are the most used because of their ability to biodegrade. The problem with this is that it can take at least 4 weeks to show substantial degradation of the polymer in the environment, and around 6 months in aquatic environments. This issue can have an effect on the wildlife on both land and in aquatic systems because animals will confuse deflated balloons as food, nesting material, or simply something to play with. When that happens, it can lead to negative effects for the animals. For example, a bird will use a deflated balloon as a component for its nest. When the eggs hatch, they will get tangled in the balloon and that can lead to death. Another environmental problem with latex balloons is not the effects the balloons have on the environment once they are decomposed, but when they are being made. When latex is being produced, it produces greenhouse gases, such as CO2, CH4, N2O. This is becoming an increasing problem, especially in Thailand which is responsible for 35% of the worlds natural rubber production. Physics=Air pressure Contemporary illustration of the first flight by Professor Jacques Charles, December 1, 1783 Once inflated with regular, atmospheric air, the air inside the balloon will have a greater air pressure than the original atmospheric air pressure.Serway, Raymond, Chris Vuille, and Jerry Faughn (2008). College Physics, Volume 10. Cengage Learning. Air pressure, technically, is a measurement of the amount of collisions against a surface at any time. In the case of balloon, it's supposed to measure how many particles at any in any given time space collide with the wall of the balloon and bounce off. However, since this is near impossible to measure, air pressure seems to be easier described as density. The similarity comes from the idea that when there are more molecules in the same space, more of them will be heading towards a collision course with the wall. The first concept of air pressure within a balloon that is necessary to know is that air pressures \\"try\\" to even out. With all the bouncing against the balloon wall (both interior and exterior) there will be a certain amount of expansion/contraction. As air pressure itself is a description of the total forces against an object, each of these forces, on the outside of the balloon, causes the balloon to contract a tiny bit, while the inside forces cause the balloon to expand. With this knowledge, one would immediately assume that a balloon with high air pressure inside would expand based on the high amount of internal forces, and vice versa. This would make the inside and outside air pressures equal. However, balloons have a certain elasticity to them that needs to be taken into account. The act of stretching a balloon fills it with potential energy. When it is released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and the balloon snaps back into its original position, though perhaps a little stretched out. When a balloon is filled with air, the balloon is being stretched. While the elasticity of the balloon causes tension that would have the balloon collapse, it is also being pushed back out by the constant bouncing of the internal air molecules. The internal air has to exert force not only to counteract the external air to keep the air pressures \\"even\\", but it also has to counteract the natural contraction of the balloon. Therefore, it requires more air pressure (or force) than the air outside the balloon wall. Because of this, when helium balloons are left and they float higher, as atmospheric pressure decreases, the air inside it exerts more pressure than outside it so the balloon pops from tension. In some cases, the helium leaks out from pores and the balloon deflates, falling down.\\"Balloons.\\" Reach Out Michigan. N.p., n.d. Web. November 30, 2010. Why are balloons stretchy?

Early life Mike Clifford was born in Los Angeles, California. His father, Cal Clifford, was a professional trumpeter, who took him to many of his engagements. Mike soon developed an interest in music and began taking voice lessons. While in school, Mike began to entertain at school and community functions, and by the age of 15 was performing at local nightclubs in Los Angeles. After singing for just a short time period, Clifford signed with Liberty Records in 1959. He recorded his first single that year, titled \\"Should I\\". The song was written and produced by Mark McIntyre and featured additional vocals from Patience and Prudence and Eddie Cochran on guitar. Clifford met Helen Noga through an introduction by a friend and she agreed to become his personal manager after hearing him sing. Helen Noga and her husband John managed the career of Johnny Mathis, and were able to get Mike signed to Columbia Records. Later, after much hard work and rehearsing, Helen Noga brought Mike to meet Ed Sullivan who was so impressed with Mike‚Äôs poise and stage presence that he booked him for his TV debut, the first of three appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Initial success Mike Clifford's first taste of success came at age 18 when \\"Bombay\\" became a hit in Venezuela. He appeared on the state owned Venevision in his own TV special. However, Clifford's recordings for Columbia received little buyer‚Äôs attention, and in July 1962, Clifford signed with United Artists Records. Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller produced several songs for Clifford, including his biggest hit \\"Close To Cathy\\", written by Earl Shuman and composed by Bob Goodman. The song reached number 12 in September of that year, and stayed there for 2 weeks and remained on the charts for 12 weeks.

He died 31 December 1602 and was succeeded by his son, Concubhair Mac Bruideadha. The names of both father and son crop up repeatedly as jurors and arbitrators in official documents preserved in the Inchiquin Manuscripts. Background Maoilin √ìg Mac Bruideadha was of Kilkee, in the parish of Dysart, County Clare. He succeeded his father, Maoilin mac Conor mac Diarmait mac John Mac Bruaideadha, as ollamh upon his death in 1582. Records Under the year 1599, the Annals of the Four Masters record an episode concerning him: The learned historian and poet, Mac Brody (Maoilin Oge), represented that it was in revenge of the demolition of Grianan Oiligh, formerly, by Murtough More, son of Turlough [son of Teige], son of Brian Boroimhe, that God, in consequence of the curse of Columbkille upon the O'Briens, had permitted Thomond to be totally plundered and devastated on this occasion by O'Donnell. This Maoilin Oge came to O'Donnell, to request of him the restoration of his cattle, which a party of the troops had carried off; and they were all given back to him; upon which Maoilin composed the following quatrain: It was destined that, in revenge of Oileach/O Hugh Roe! the Prophet announced/Thy troops should come to the land of Magh-Adhair;/From the North the aid of all is sought. The Annals of the Four Masters, sub anno 1602, contain Mac Bruaideadha's obituary: Mac Brody (Maoilin Oge, the son of Maoilin, son of Conor) died on the last day of the month of December. There was not in Ireland, in the person of one individual, a better historian, poet, and rhymer, than he. It was he who composed these historical poems in D√°n- Direacht: * I will lay an obligation on the descendants of T√°l. Give thy attention to me, O Inis-an-laoigh Ennis. Know me, O Mac Coghlan! Let us make this visitation among the descendants of Cas. The descendants of Cathaoir are exiles here. From four the Gadelians have sprung. Translation work According to Professor Leerssen, he was also one of the few native literati to embrace the new order even to the extent that he was in the employ of Trinity College for a period in the early to mid-1590s, and was also one of those involved with the Gaelic translation of the New Testament, undertaken for purposes of proselytization by the protestant archbishop of Tuam. Poems Six of Maoil√≠n √ìg‚Äôs poems are listed by O‚ÄôDonovan in the Annals of the Four Masters. They include Brathair don bh√°s an doidhbhreas (Poverty is death‚Äôs brother), addressed to Connor O'Brien, 3rd Earl of Thomond, included in a collection edited by Professor T. F. O'Rahilly.

Their main representatives are oxytocin and vasopressin. They are named after the location of their release into the blood, the neurohypophysis (another name for the posterior pituitary). Most of the circulating oxytocin and vasopressin hormones are synthesized in magnocellular neurosecretory cells of the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. They are then transported in neurosecretory granules along axons within the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial tract by axoplasmic flow to axon terminals forming the pars nervosa of the posterior pituitary. There, they are stored in Herring bodies and can be released into the circulation on the basis of hormonal and synaptic signals with assistance from pituicytes. Oxytocin mediates contraction of the smooth muscle of the uterus and mammary gland, while vasopressin has antidiuretic action on the kidney, and mediates vasoconstriction of the peripheral vessels. Due to the similarity of the two hormones, there is cross-reaction: oxytocin has a slight antidiuretic function, and high levels of AVP can cause uterine contractions. In common with most active peptides, both hormones are synthesised as larger protein precursors that are enzymatically converted to their mature forms. Members of this family are found in birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians (mesotocin, isotocin, valitocin, glumitocin, aspargtocin, vasotocin, seritocin, asvatocin, phasvatocin), in worms (annetocin, nematocin), octopuses (cephalotocin), Locusta migratoria (Migratory locust) (locupressin or neuropeptide F1/F2) and in molluscs (conopressins G and S).

It happened that William was joined with his relatives in the war when they demolished their castles, as we have already mentioned; that he grew sorry for this, and went to Galway, under the protection of the English, the month before his execution; but some tale was fabricated against him, for which he was taken and hanged. Such of his followers as went in under this protection were also hanged. Burke was hanged by William √ìge Martyn (died 1592) who, aware that the Mayor of Galway, Dominick Lynch, had a pardon for Burke, prevented the Mayor from arriving in time to stop the execution of Burke and his men. William Burke's elder brother, and one of the two chief leaders of the Mac an Iarla wars, became Earl of Clanricarde in 1582.

The 21-story WAC clubhouse opened in December 1930 and was designed in the Art Deco style by Seattle architect Sherwood D. Ford. The five-story WAC includes a 25-yard pool, full-size basketball court, running track, handball and racquetball courts, and pilates and yoga studios. The top ten floors house the Inn at the WAC, a 109-room boutique hotel. The club also offers a full-service day spa and a wellness center with nutrition, physical therapy, and naturopathic services. The building is also home to three restaurants, a private ballroom, social areas, and numerous meeting spaces. The idea of the Century 21 Exposition was first conceived by club members within the building in January 1955. In 2009, the Washington Athletic Club became a City of Seattle Landmark,Landmarks Alphabetical Listing for W, Individual Landmarks, Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle. Accessed October 8, 2010. and in 2018 its 6th Street building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History=Club's early formation and plans In mid 1927, Seattle newcomer and realtor Noel B. Clarke put together a committee of Seattle attorneys, capitalists and bankers to raise money to form a new athletic club to serve the city's skyrocketing population. They began soliciting $100 founders' memberships to hire an architect and construct a clubhouse and by early 1928 over 1,000 had been collected. Funds were stored in a trust that couldn't be accessed until 2,000 memberships were sold. In February 1928, Clarke announced a 120 x 96' site had been chosen at the corner of 6th and University Streets. The committee hired the Seattle architectural firm of Baker, Vogel & Roush to design a building. Their plans were of an elegant twelve-story structure with Gothic Revival influences. The building would cost around $1 million and construction was to begin in June 1928.\\"Million-Dollar Athletic Club is Assured by City\\" The Seattle Times February 29, 1928. Pg. 1, 3. By March 1928, only 1,200 of the needed 2,000 members had signed up for the new club, causing a delay in the plans.\\"800 Join Seattle's New Athletic Club\\" Seattle Times March 30, 1928. Pg. 42.\\"Time is Asked for Athletic Club Plan\\" Seattle Times May 31, 1928. Pg. 12. More troubles arose in May 1928 when Clarke, the club's biggest single promoter, quit the board because of difficulties dealing with the Seattle Real Estate Board.Anderson, C.L. \\"It's Silver-Jubilee Time at Washington Athletic Club\\" Seattle Times February 5, 1956. Pg. 2. After the passing of the original construction deadline, a new board of 26 of Seattle's most prominent businessmen came together to continue Clarke's work.\\"Governors are Elected for Washington Athletic Club\\" Seattle Times August 19, 1928. Pg. 22. The new committee chose to scrap the club's original design, now becoming dated, and hired architect Sherwood D. Ford to design something different at a new site chosen at the southwest corner of 6th Avenue and Union Street, owned by W.D. Comer, then president of the club and a holder of major financial interest. His first proposal was for an elaborate 12-story building in the Mission Revival Style, unique to the region and similar in style to Seattle's Fox Theatre that Ford would later design.\\"How Club Will Look\\" Seattle Times July 29, 1928.

New plans and construction An architectural detail on the building's facade Sherwood Ford's findings resulted in a new set of plans for a structure priced at $2.3 million. The new design was of an imposing 21-story art deco skyscraper with a central tower. It would be constructed of reinforced concrete and steel while the exterior consisted of brick and decorative terracotta tile and would be completely fireproof.\\"Washington Athletic Club Building [Advertisement]\\" Seattle Times January 6, 1930.

Pg. 28. While the Stock Market Crashed in October 1929, Seattle wouldn't immediately feel the effects and construction went ahead. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on Monday, December 16, 1929 at noon when a steam shovel driven by Reginald H. Parsons, chairman of the board of governors for the club, overturned the first load of dirt. City officials as well as club members and presidents of neighboring clubs were in attendance. The event was followed by a luncheon for board members at the Olympic Hotel.\\"Parsons Starts Work to Break Club Grounds; Ceremonies on Monday\\" Seattle Times December 12, 1929. Pg. 33. Construction commenced immediately with the steel structure of the building. The Wallace Bridge Company, who also constructed the structures of the Harborview Medical Center in Seattle and the St. Johns Bridge in Portland, Oregon, manufactured and assembled the building's steel frame. Over 1,200 tons of steel was used in construction with the beams over the main ballroom weighing 18 tons each.\\"Steel Figures Large in New Construction\\" Seattle Times February 22, 1931. Pg. AS-9. The steel frame was then encased in concrete. Tragedy struck on April 26, 1930 when Albert J.

Grand opening and design View of details on north facade The Washington Athletic Club officially opened on December 16, 1930 followed by a week long celebration of dining, dancing and facility touring. Upon completion, the club, dubbed 'the skyscraper of sports' by local media, made a major addition to Seattle's skyline and was even erroneously said to be taller than Seattle's other art deco skyscraper, the Northern Life Tower. While the latter contained seven more floors, the W.A.C.'s floors were claimed to be taller. Of special note at the time was that out of superstition, the building had no 13th floor, or at least according to the elevators whose buttons skipped from 12 to 14.\\"Yes, this is Friday the 13th; Tall Buildings Dodge Jinx\\" Seattle Times January 13, 1933. Pg. 4. A full-page article in the Seattle Times from December 16, described the layout of the new building in detail: Women were largely segregated from men in the new quarters, having their own entrance and elevator as described by the article: The fourth floor contained the men's grill restaurant while the above that were the men's area including most of the athletic aspects of the club: The entire seventh and eighth floors were occupied by the swimming pool while the ninth floor, the top floor of the building's base section, contained sleeping rooms for guests of club members. The twelve story tower contained 125 hotel- like rooms \\"for the use of club members\\" while a conference room occupied the very top floor. The Athletic club soon became the social epicenter of Washington's athletic community and hosted many luncheons and social gatherings. The club also became a center for training local athletes for professional careers as well as for the Olympics. The club enthusiastically hired Ray Daughters, swimming coach at the Crystal pool. With him to the club followed his young protege, Helene Madison. The club's pool would later be named in her honor.\\"Century Project -- Washington Athletic Club Joins In Honoring Helene Madison\\" Seattle Times December 19, 1999. Retrieved October 8, 2010. Financial troubles and the Great Depression The Great Depression began to affect many social clubs across the nation who saw their memberships begin to taper off and the wave soon reached the west coast. Within a short time of opening some 500 members withdrew from the club because of the shock to their finances. It was reported that in the first three months, the club was losing $10,000 a month. In 1931, W.D. Comer became caught up in the backlash from the financial crash and was sent to jail. The club was threatened with receivership and under the decision of judge Howard M. Finlay, reorganization was begun. The WAC building was purchased by Seattle businessmen Victor Elfendahl, Gilbert Skinner and William Edris. They refinanced the club and exchanged third mortgage bonds for preferred stock. Seeing tight times ahead, they tried to make their club more friendly to more people. Several measures taken by the new owners included offering more moderately priced items in the restaurant, creating more family oriented functions, and adding more card rooms and a quiet room.\\"Athletic Club is Reorganized; Has New Owners\\" Seattle Times March 20, 1931. Pg. 2. Due to the club's large size, it was made known by the owners that it could only be operated with full membership. In an attempt to stay in business, the owners began an aggressive new premium membership program, hoping to sign on 1,200 new members which luckily was a quick success.\\"Membership List of Athletic Club Increased 643\\" Seattle Times April 12, 1931. Pg. 11. During the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, the Washington Athletic Club and University of Washington were represented by 23 athletes, one of which was swimmer Jack Medica, who set a new world record of 4:44:5 in the 400 m freestyle. 1940s to today In May 1940, Eddie Bauer moved his fast-growing sporting goods business into the ground floor retail spaces of the building, his fourth move in little more than five years.\\"Bauer's Sport Shop Opens in New Quarters Today\\" Seattle Times May 8, 1940. Pg. 20. The store later moved again to third and Virginia Streets. By the end of World War II, a historic decision was made by the club membership to buy the building from its owner, The Washington Athletic Club Holding Co., who had been renting the building to them since 1936 at a rate of $12,500 a month, for $1.35 million. Even though the payments would follow the same rate as the rent, the wealthy club members would own the building within 5 and a half years. By the 1950s, the club was beginning to outgrow its old building, now overflowing with use by over 5,000 members. In August 1953, The Washington Athletic club purchased the property to the south on which to build a three-story annex, designed by architect Harrison Overturf, which broke ground on June 24, 1954. The original building also received a major interior remodeling by interior decorator Lou Garner Swift in 1955.\\"Athletic Club's 'New Look' to be Described\\" Seattle Times October 9, 1955. Pg. 3. The new addition opened in time for the club's Silver Jubilee in 1955. An additional eight stories were added to the annex in 1970 along with further interior remodeling. The original 6th street entrance was moved into the new building and the old lobby was closed.Seattle Department of Neighborhoods historical sites - The Washington Athletic Club.

Life Quin by Adriano Cecioni in Vanity Fair, 1872 Quin was born in London, and passed his early years at a school at Putney, kept by a son of Mrs. Sarah Trimmer, the author. In 1817 he was sent to the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. on 1 August 1820. In December 1820 he went to Rome as travelling physician to Elizabeth Cavendish. He afterwards attended her in that city during her fatal illness in March 1824. On his return to London he was appointed physician to Napoleon I at St. Helena, but the emperor died (on 5 May 1821) before he left England. In July 1821 he commenced practice at Naples, and his social gifts made him popular with all the English residents there, who included Sir William Gell, Sir William Drummond, and the Countess of Blessington. At Naples, too, Quin met Dr. Neckar, a disciple of Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, and was favourably impressed by what he learned of the homeopathic system of medicine. After visiting Leipzig in 1826, to study its working, Quin returned to Naples a convert. On the journey he was introduced at Rome to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, afterwards king of the Belgians, and soon left Naples to become his family physician in England. Until May 1829 he continued a member of the prince's household either at Marlborough House, London, or Claremont, Surrey, and extended his acquaintance in aristocratic circles. From May 1829 to September 1831 he practised in Paris, chiefly, but not entirely, on the principles of Hahnemann. In September 1831, after consulting with Hahnemann as to the treatment of cholera, he proceeded to Tischnowitz in Moravia, where the disease was raging. He was himself attacked, but soon recommenced work, and remained until the cholera disappeared. His treatment consisted in giving camphor in the first stage, and ipecacuanha and arsenic subsequently. At length, in July 1832, he settled in London at 19 King Street, St. James's, re- moving in 1833 to 13 Stratford Place, and introduced the homeopathic system into this country. The medical journals denounced him as a quack, but he made numerous converts, and his practice rapidly grew, owing as much to his attractive personality as to his medical skill. But the professional opposition was obstinately prolonged. In February 1838, when Quin was a candidate for election at the Athen√¶um Club, he was opposed by a clique of physicians, led by John Ayrton Paris, who privately attacked Quin with a virulence for which he had to apologise. From 26 June 1845 he was medical attendant to the Duchess of Cambridge. In 1839 Quin completed the first volume of his translation of Hahnemann's Materia Medica Pura, but a fire at his printers' destroyed the whole edition of five hundred copies, and failing health prevented him from reprinting the work. In 1843 he established a short-lived dispensary, called the St. James's Hom≈ìopathic Dispensary. In 1844 he founded the British Homeopathic Society, of which he was elected president. Chiefly through his exertions the London Homeopathic Hospital was founded in 1850. It became a permanent institution, and is now located in Great Ormond Street. On 18 October 1859 he was appointed to the chair of therapeutics and materia medica in the medical school of the hospital, and gave a series of lectures. Quin was popular in London society. In aristocratic, literary, artistic, and dramatic circles he was always welcome. He was almost the last of the wits of London society, and no dinner was considered a success without his presence. His friends included Charles Dickens, William Thackeray, the Bulwers, Macready, Landseer, and Charles Mathews. In manners, dress, and love of high-stepping horses he imitated Count D'Orsay. After suffering from severe and chronic asthma and arthritis, which resulted in an early retirement from medical practice, he died of bronchitisBoase, G. C. and Leary, B (2004).

It is a stringybark with lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds arranged in group of nine or eleven, white flowers and hemispherical fruit.budsfruitbark Description Eucalyptus blaxlandii is a tree that grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has persistent, rough, dark brown to greyish stringy bark on the trunk and larger branches and smooth, whitish bark on the thinner ones. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves long, wide that are a different green on the opposite sides of the leaves and have a petiole. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long and the same slightly glossy green on both sides. The flowers are usually borne in groups of nine or eleven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are oblong or oval, about long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering has been observed in March and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, sessile, hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves level with the rim or slightly above. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus blaxlandii was first formally described in 1919 by Joseph Maiden and Richard Hind Cambage from a specimen collected at Blackheath by Maiden. The description was published in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (blaxlandii) honours Gregory Blaxland, \\"who was leader of the first party to cross the Blue Mountains, where many trees of this species are found\\". Distribution and habitat Blaxland's stringybark grows in forest on sandstone on the Central and Southern Tablelands from Nullo Mountain near Kandos and south to the Dampier State Forest near Bodalla.

Antibodies are added that attach to the outermost layer of cells, which on a blastocyst is the trophoblast. After removing any unbound antibodies and adding complement, the trophoblast cells are destroyed, leaving only the inner cell mass. Immunosurgery is a method of selectively removing the external cell layer (trophoblast) of a blastocyst through a cytotoxicity procedure. The protocol for immunosurgery includes preincubation with an antiserum, rinsing it with hES derivation media to remove the antibodies, exposing it to complement, and then removing the lysed trophoectoderm through a pipette. This technique is used to isolate the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. The trophoectoderm's cell junctions and tight epithelium \\"shield\\" the ICM from antibody binding by effectively making the cell impermeable to macromolecules. Immunosurgery can be used to obtain large quantities of pure inner cell masses in a relatively short period of time. The ICM obtained can then be used for stem cell research and is better to use than adult or fetal stem cells because the ICM has not been affected by external factors, such as manually bisecting the cell. However, if the structural integrity of the blastocyst is compromised prior to the experiment, the ICM is susceptible to the immunological reaction. Thus, the quality of the embryo used is imperative to the experiment's success. In addition, when using complement derived from animals, the source of the animals matters. They should be kept in a specific-pathogen-free environment to increase the likelihood that the animal has not developed natural antibodies against the bacterial carbohydrates present in the serum (which can be obtained from a different animal).‚ÄúProduction of Chimeras,‚Äù Chapter 11, in Manipulating the Mouse Embryo, 3rd edition, by Andras Nagy, Marina Gertsenstein, Kristina Vintersten, and Richard Behringer.

They primarily used it for studying early embryonic development. Though immunosurgery is the most prevalent method of ICM isolation, various experiments have improved the process, such as through the use of lasers (performed by Tanaka, et al.) and micromanipulators (performed by Ding, et al.).Yan Ding, Yi Gan, Jing Bo Feng, Shao Hua Qi, Rui Ming Li, Dong Sheng Li. \\"Efficient isolation inner cell mass from blastocysts by improved microsurgical technique\\".

A champion sheep shearer and professional wrestler, he was the first national heavyweight champion recognised by the National Wrestling Association and successfully defended the title against some of the top stars of the Gold Dust Trio-era, most notably, Stanislaus Zbyszko in 1926. Over 40 years after his death, he was ranked No. 7 in a top ten list of New Zealand's greatest wrestlers by Fight Times Magazine in 2009. As a lay reader of the Anglican church he was closely associated with many prominent members of the clergy, such as Bishop Frederick Bennett, and other notable figures as Te Puea Herangi and Sir Turi Carroll. He was also an elder of the NgƒÅti Kahungunu and especially active in charity work and philanthropy on behalf of the MƒÅori people. His efforts were recognized and was awarded the Order of the British Empire. Early life Ihakara Te Tuku Rapana was born in Wairoa, New Zealand, on 8 November 1886. He was the second of four children born to Ihakara Rapana, a member of the NgƒÅti Raukawa, and Riripeti Te Aue Roberts (or McRobert). His mother was of Scottish and NgƒÅti Kahungunu descent. Shortly after his birth, Robin's family moved to Kohupatiki where he lived for the rest of his life. Although he received a primary education, Robin left school at age 15 to become a chauffeur and mechanic for Napier businessman George Donnelly. A year later, he joined his father as a shearer for the Chambers family at Te Mata station, then one of the biggest sheep stations in Hawke's Bay, as well as other various duties. He began shearing sheep at 20 years old and had a highest daily tally of 150 sheep in his first year. He increased this to 200 a year later and, in his third year, he achieved the title of 'gun-shearer' with a 300 tally. He increased this to 343.Mills, A. R. Sheep-O!: The Story of the World's Fastest Shearers. Wellington: A.H. & A.W. Reed, 1960. (pg. 131) Robin eventually left Te Mata to find work for other shearing contractors and travelled as far as Wanganui and Turakina for employment. While at Mangaohane station in Taihape, he reached his highest personal tally, setting a record of 358 sheep in 8 hours 20 minutes. Robin also regularly competed in the Hawke's Bay Agricultural and Pastoral Society shows. In his best year in the competition, he won seven firsts, three seconds and one third in different shearing events. Robin soon became a shearing contractor and his gangs were highly sought after by stations throughout Hawke's Bay, Wairarapa and Wellington. He eventually became the biggest contractor in Hawke's Bay and, at the peak of his success, Robin employed over 100 workers for both shearing and general farm work. He was able to offer work and accommodation to young homeless MƒÅori, and worked with social welfare agencies in Napier and Hastings. The freezing works at Whakatu and Tomoana caused Robin's shearing contracts to decline as many of his men left his gang and chose to find work independently rather than as a contract worker. Entry into the Anglican church Deeply religious, Robin became a lay reader in the Anglican church in 1911 and served in this position for nearly 60 years. He was a friend and close adviser to the first two MƒÅori bishops appointed to the Anglican Church, and served under other prominent members of the MƒÅori clergy. He was often called to deputise for ministers who were unexpectedly needed to perform other services. If a minister arrived late, the service was restarted upon his arrival. Robin would also host hourly evening services at his home. According to one popular story, Robin was once \\"so absorbed in his preaching that he failed to notice that the congregation comprised only his dog, Hui Toopu.\\" His personal contributions to the church are credited for the successful careers of many church hui. Robin regularly provided donations of meat, vegetables, transportation and other services to the MƒÅori Anglican Church. He also accompanied his personal friend, Bishop Frederick Bennett, throughout New Zealand as a supporter of his ministry. As a foundation member of the Heretaunga MƒÅori Choir, Robin also accompanied the group throughout the North Island where they regularly performed at the choral competitions accompanying major hui. He attempted to enlist in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force during the First World War but, in spite of his physical prowess, was rejected by the New Zealand Army due to flat feet. This was one of the biggest disappointments in his life. He had two children with his first wife, Mata Kato, prior to her death in 1917; both children died in infancy. A year later, Robin married Mei Pere at Kohupatiki on 27 May 1918. Pere owned her own shearing gangs which working on the eastern coastal stations around Haumoana, Clifton and inland towards Taihape. They had five sons and one daughter together. Robin also had a son from an earlier relationship with Mare Hape, who was raised in Dannevirke, and had two adopted sons as well. Professional wrestling career=Athletic and amateur career A noted sportsman as a young man, Robin was \\"a keen competitor at Caledonian sports days\\". At one competition in Napier he participated in the shot-put, hammer throw, caber toss, high jump, tug of war and two styles of wrestling. He won many of the events and collected ¬£26 in prize money. He especially began to excel in wrestling and, after winning the North Island catch-as-catch-can wrestling championship at the Taihape Caledonian games on 24 January 1924, he decided to turn professional later that year. New Zealand and Australasia champion Robin, with his powerful strength and \\"wire and whipcord\\" build, was easily able to dominate his opponents. His earliest professional match was against the Indian wrestler M. A. Sunni at the Municipal Theatre in Napier on 3 May 1924, whom he defeated in two falls within 15 minutes. In August, he defeated the South Island champion and was from then on regarded as the best wrestler in all of New Zealand. Also during that year, Robin wrestled World Light Heavyweight Champion Walter Miller in the earliest-known outdoor wrestling match in New Zealand. The event, held by the Hawkes Bay Wrestling Association, attracted a crowd of 12,000 among whom included then Governor- General Sir Charles Furgusson. At the end of the season, Robin suffered a serious shoulder injury in a title defence against M. A. Sunni. The match lasted for two hours before scoring the pinfall at around midnight. Although he retained the title, and won the ¬£1400 purse, doctors prohibited him from wrestling for at least one month. On 16 March 1925, he defeated Sunni in two straight falls in Auckland to win the NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship, and a ¬£750 purse, becoming the first champion officially recognised by the National Wrestling Alliance. Four months later, accompanied by former Scottish heavyweight champion and manager Alec Bain, Robin travelled to Australia with Sunni and Japanese wrestler Koraeda where he defended the national heavyweight title in a rematch against the Walter Miller. A side wager was made for ¬£500. In October 1925, he defeated Walter on points in a six-round contest in Hastings for the NWA Australasian Heavyweight Championship. That year, he was also on the first wrestling event ever held in Brisbane Stadium where Robin defeated Peter Limutkin. He would successfully defend the national title against local and foreign wrestlers for over a year until his retirement in 1926. Prior to his retirement, he defeated Clarence Weber in a Best 2 out of 3 Falls match for the NWA Australasian Heavyweight Championship in Melbourne. Upon returning to Napier, he was apparently awarded a gold medal in recognition of his victory. Robin became so popular in the country that a patented wire-strainer for fencing, the \\"Ike Grip\\", was named after him. Bout with Stanislaus Zbyszko Robin and Stanislaus Zbyszko shake hands before their 1926 bout in Auckland. In the final months of his career, Robin wrestled Polish-American wrestler Stanislaus Zbyszko at Auckland Town Hall on three occasions; over 1,000 people where turned away from the sold-out Town Hall during their bout on 22 June 1926. Although Zbyszko was billed as the World Heavyweight Champion, he had lost the title to Joe Stecher the previous year. According to one account by the New Zealand Railways Magazine, one of their matches lasted for several hours before ending in a time limit draw which had \\"gone on for many weary hours and when midnight Saturday chimed and Sunday commenced the match had to cease\\". Zbyszko later praised Robin's wrestling abilities claiming that few wrestlers could equal Robin for strength and that \\"with proper training for two months or so, he would be a world-beater\\". Brief comeback and retirement Robin chose to compete in his home country, however, because there were so few local professionals active at the time it was difficult to earn a living and he decided to retire. The national title would remain vacant for three years until Tom Alley won the title shortly before of the founding of the Dominion Wrestling Union. He briefly came out of retirement to compete for the Wellington Wrestling Association in 1930, refereeing some preliminary amateur bouts at the Wellington Town Hall, and visiting American wrestler Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis expressed interest in wrestling Robin for the NWA Australasian title. By 1932, Robin was in full training in preparation for a comeback and, after a six-year absence, had his first return bout against Finnish wrestler Peter Limutkin at the Wellington Town Hall on 18 July 1932. Although he was awarded the victory, Robin's in-ring performance was considered disappointing. The Evening Post noted \\"Against Peter Limutkin he did not show anything which would give hope of his performing creditably against a visiting wrestler approaching his own weight. Robin certainly won, but that was all, and the match can best be written down as just another effort on the part of the [Dominion] Wrestling Union to give a local man a chance to prove his worth\\". As the season went on, his later bouts were more favourably reviewed. His 21 July match against younger MƒÅori wrestler Toa Kaha, for example, went to the full four rounds amazing the audience \\"at the endurance shown by both Native giants\\". On 16 September 1932, Robin's match against Abe Kaplin went to a time limit draw and was called by The Evening Post as \\"one of the best wrestling matches seen at Hastings\\". The following year he wrestled American wrestler Harry Mamos in Napier on 28 June 1933, which ended in a draw. Throughout the 1933 season, he challenged George Walker for the NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship and was considered a top contender for the title, along with Harry Mamos and Rumberg, by the end of the year. He and Billy Meeske were reportedly in line to challenge George Walker for the NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship during the summer of 1935. The 49-year-old Robin, however, was now nearing middle age and in the midst of a changing business decided to retire. His nephew, Keita Meretana, also became a noted amateur and professional wrestler during the 1950s. Long after his retirement, wrestlers visiting from overseas would often stop by Robin's home to pay their respects. Over 40 years after his death, he was ranked No. 7 in a top ten list of New Zealand's greatest wrestlers by Fight Times Magazine in 2009. Later years Robin returned to Anglican service following his retirement. He also became active in politics, being involved with the Labour Party, and corresponded with a number of government figures, including governors general and prime ministers, as well as president of New Zealand MƒÅori Council Sir Turi Carroll, a close and lifelong friend. He was familiar with MƒÅori leaders, such as Te Puea Herangi, and met with royalty as a representative of the MƒÅori people of Hawke's Bay. His lifelong activities in charity work and philanthropy were partly influenced by Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata and the Young MƒÅori Party, and his hometown of Kohupatiki was described as \\"a home away from home for the boys of Te Aute College and the girls of Hukarere\\". His granddaughter, Maisie, was chosen as the model for the statue of Pania which now adorns Napier's Marine Parade. In the 1950 New Year Honours, Robin was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for social welfare services to MƒÅori, particularly in the Church of England sphere. As an elder of the NgƒÅti Kahungunu, he frequently appeared as an orator at tribal ceremonial events throughout his life, even when afflicted by severe rheumatism and arthritis in his old age. His condition grew so severe that he eventually became bed-ridden and, on one occasion, had to be carried out of his home by one of his grandsons when his bedroom caught fire. Robin died at Kohupatiki on 21 June 1968, survived by his wife, three (or six) sons and a daughter. Following his death, the people of Kohupatiki honoured Robin with the song, Tuku whakarererere, in his name.

The society affiliates with the Hong Kong Museum of History to establish artifact collections and journal publications. History After the discovery of prehistoric sites in Hong Kong during the 1920s, archaeology activities began in the area. Artifact recoveries and research publications appeared by the 1930s. The earliest recorded archaeologists in Hong Kong were John Schofield and Raffaele Maglioni. The unearthed stone tools, potteries, and bronze artifacts led to support of human presence during the late Neolithic period and Bronze Age in the Hong Kong area with artifacts dating back to 3000‚Äì1200 BC and 1200‚Äì400 BC. In 1955, the accidental discovery of the Eastern Han Dynasty tomb at Lei Cheng Uk. An archaeological team was formed by the University of Hong Kong a year later, with a limited membership to survey the site. By 1960, the team carried out other excavations at Man Kok Tsui, Lantau Island with artifact dating back to the Bronze Age. In 1967, the archaeologist team reformed to the Hong Kong Archaeological Society to anticipate larger participations numbered around 200 members. Notable excavations During the 1970s, projects in Sham Wan and Sha Po Old Village of Lamma Island discovered artifacts dating to Bronze Age and Neolithic eras. In 1990, the society began a 16 months artifact rescue mission in Chek Lap Kok at the future site of the Hong Kong International Airport. In 1991, an excavation at Yung Long, west to Tuen Mun revealed a cultural phase with painted pottery, dated to 4400‚Äì3800 BC. In 1994, salvage project in Kau Sai Chau revealed a site without pottery dating to approximately 5000 BC. In 1999, the society discovered numerous artifacts in Chan Ka Yuen in Ha Pak Nai, west to Tuen Mun. In 2000, Lam Tsuen Valley in Tai Po was investigated by the society. In 2001, a house structure with underground water system dated to Song Dynasty were discovered in Mong Tseng Wai of Yuen Long. It was the only Song Dynasty village site in Hong Kong. In 2004‚Äì05, the society invited Lingnan Archaeology of Sun Yat-sen University to salvage a stone quarry excavation site at Wong Tei Tung, Sai Kung Peninsula. Artifacts discovered were dated back to late Paleolithic era. In 2007, excavations in Luk Keng Village, Lantau Island was discovered two furnaces with more than 2,000 items belonging to Tang, Ming, and Qing Dynasty, with some belongs to Bronze and Neolithic age as well.

He was one of the United States government's main planners for the post World War II world and \\"probably the foremost author of the UN Charter.\\" Thomas Connally said in his memoirs \\"Certainly he had more to do with writing the framework of the charter than anyone else.\\"Schlesinger, p.44, citing Connally, p.279 His New York Times obituary is subtitled \\"Wrote Charter of World Organization.\\" A short, rotund, mustachioed pipe smoker with a very large and round head, he joked that he might find it easier to roll than to walk. An aide compared him to the third little pig in the Three Little Pigs, Hull called him \\"Friar Tuck\\". A hardworking \\"one-man think tank\\" for Hull, he preferred to stay invisible, in the background.Schlesinger, pp.33‚Äì35 In the words of Richard Holbrooke, he \\"was one of those figures peculiar to Washington ‚Äì a tenacious bureaucrat who, fixed on a single goal, left behind a huge legacy while virtually disappearing from history.\\" Early life Pasvolsky was born in Pavlograd in the Russian Empire in 1893. His parents were anti-czarists and the family fled to the United States in 1905. After graduating from the City College of New York in 1916 he studied political science at Columbia University and also attended the University of Geneva. He then edited periodicals, the monthly The Russian Review and Amerikansky Viestnik, and the daily newspaper Russkoye Slovo. Engaged in the tempestuous political climate of the emigres in New York, he debated Leon Trotsky during his visit to New York in 1916. He was at first optimistic about the Russian Revolution, and worked as the secretary of Boris Bakhmeteff, the last Ambassador to the US of the Kerensky government, but became embittered and anti-communist after Lenin's October Revolution. In 1919 he covered the Paris Peace Conference for the New York Tribune, the Brooklyn Eagle and other newspapers, and in 1921 he covered the Washington Arms Conference for the Baltimore Sun. During this period he became a Wilsonian internationalist and softened his stance toward the Soviet Union, arguing for its recognition by the US and its admission into the League of Nations. Brookings In 1922 he became an economist on the staff of the Brookings Institution, from which he received a Ph.D. in 1936, and which was his institutional base until his death in 1953. In November 1926, he married Clara Christine McCormick of Pittsburgh. In his writings in the 1920s, he argued that the Soviet Union's 1918‚Äì1921 war, communism was an ideologically based attempt to realize Marx's vision of socialism or communism, rather than a short-term wartime expedient with no lasting significance., citing Peter J. Boettke, \\"The Soviet Experiment with Pure Communism,\\" Critical Review: A Journal of Books and Ideas, Vol. 2 No. 4 (Fall 1988), pp. 149‚Äì182. He also wrote critically about Proletkult, saying that its chief characteristic was pretentious artificiality. With foundation of Kultintern he claimed this would reduce the Proletkult movement \\"not primarily, but exclusively\\" to a weapon to promote the Bolshevik view of communism. Pasvolsky's book on Bulgaria and others from this period are still regarded as useful surveys by specialists. Bureaucrat Early in the first Roosevelt administration, he was hired by Cordell Hull as his personal assistant but returned to Brookings after two years. Later, he worked in the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce of the Department of Commerce (1934‚Äì35) and in the Division of Trade Agreements 1935‚Äì36 and later in various capacities in the State Department from 1935 to 1946.Domhoff, p. 119 During the 1930s and 1940s, frequently with Harold G. Moulton, his closest ally and collaborator since the 1920s at Brookings, he envisioned a stable, open world economy based on international political cooperation involving a successor to the League of Nations, wider than an alliance of democracies, and with international police powers. Earlier Brookings studies of the 1920s and 1930s focused on the importance of worldwide demand to the American economy, but by 1941 Paslovsky and Moulton underscored the ever-growing dependence of the American economy on foreign raw materials binding the US more tightly to the world economy. \\"Even before America entered the war, Pasvolsky was thinking about the postwar world.\\"Goodwin, p. 92 He joined the Council on Foreign Relations in 1938. Along with Norman Davis, Pasvolsky, nicknamed \\"Pazzy\\" by some council members, became the main liaison between the Council and the State Department, and regularly attended the Council's Economic and Financial Group meetings in New York.Shoup & Minter, p. 124 As Hull's assistant, he was on the same level as the six assistant secretaries of state. In September 1939, Hull assigned Pasvolsky to planning for the postwar peace, and at Pasvolsky's suggestion, set up the Advisory Committee on Problems of Foreign Relations. After this became moribund, Hull appointed Pasvolsky the first director of the State Department's new Division of Special Research in February 1941. During 1942 diplomat Charles W. Yost served as Assistant Chief. The two would work together at the Dumbarton Oaks conference, drafting the UN Charter. When the division was split in January 1943 into a Division of Political Studies and a Division of Economic Studies, Pasvolsky continued to supervise them. He was executive officer of the secretive Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy, which superseded the Division, returning to the broadly based Advisory Committee concept.Schlesinger, pp.39 UN planning The work of the Advisory Committeeled to the drafting of an outline for a \\"preliminary UN\\" by Undersecretary Sumner Welles, based on the design of the League of Nations. Pasvolsky and Hull eventually opposed Welles' draft as being too hastily written. The major split was over whether the organization would have a \\"regional\\" nature, perhaps with local councils, in which each great power would have most of the responsibility for its region, or would have more centralized structure. Welles, as well as Winston Churchill (and later, Nelson Rockefeller) favored \\"regionalism,\\" while Pasvolsky and Hull favored a unitary global body. Roosevelt wavered between the two sides. Throughout 1942, Welles took the lead on planning for the UN and in January 1943 discussed a new and full draft charter with Roosevelt. It incorporated Roosevelt's four power \\"global policemen\\" but gave them less than absolute veto powers on an Executive Council with \\"regional\\" members too. Welles continued to work on the draft, but after a period of political infighting with Hull, he was forced to resign in August 1943. Subsequently, Hull took charge of UN planning, and appointed Pasvolsky to put together a draft charter, which he produced in August. It retained the Security Council, General Assembly and Secretariat, which Welles and Pasvolsky had agreed on, but downplayed regionalism. With the absence of Welles or any other figure with comparable influence, interest and expertise Pasvolsky's ideas and phrasing dominated the drafting henceforward. Before Hull departed for the Moscow Conference (1943), Pasvolsky advised him that economic reconstruction, especially in the USSR, should be a prioritized, while Isaiah Bowman insisted on territorial agreements restricting Soviet expansion.Smith, p.387 By February 3, 1944, Roosevelt had approved Pasvolsky's latest draft. It incorporated two major departures \\"that modulated at least the naked appearance of Big Four dominance\\". Unlike the League of Nations, it entrusted security matters exclusively to the Security Council. However, it widened the Security Council into an 11-member entity, reducing the dominance of the four big powers that Roosevelt had long envisioned.Hoopes & Brinkley, pp. 114‚Äì115 In 1943 Pasvolsky was placed in charge of International Organization and Security Affairs in the State Department with responsibility for drafting the United Nations Charter; he was present at Bretton Woods and Dumbarton Oaks. He became chairman of the Coordination Committee at the San Francisco United Nations Conference on International Organization, where the charter was negotiated and signed. Secretary Hull depended heavily on Pasvolsky to explain the plans and proposals for the UN to President Roosevelt. Craufurd Goodwin writes \\"It is striking how close a resemblance Pasvolsky's statement of objectives for the new international organization bears to the positions he had taken with Moulton throughout the previous decade.\\"Goodwin, p. 93 Another important innovation at Dumbarton Oaks was the Economic and Social Council. Pasvolsky and the new Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, Jr. managed to persuade Roosevelt to drop his idea of adding Brazil as a sixth member of the Security Council. Pasvolsky opposed an absolute veto by permanent members on all Security Council discussions and resolutions as giving these big states too much power, while Hull and the Soviets supported it. His persistence on this issue persuaded Hull and eventually the Soviets to limit the veto to substantive matters only ‚Äì not allowing it on procedural ones including discussions.Schlesinger, pp.49‚Äì55 Other postwar planning The British Foreign Research and Press Service, directed by Arnold J. Toynbee, also worked on plans for postwar reconstruction and political and economic arrangements and collaborated closely with the Advisory Committee. Toynbee and Pasvolsky \\"met on many occasions to discuss in detail ideas about the shape of a world order under Anglo-Saxon leadership.\\"Ban, p153-54 Pasvolsky, reflecting the thought of the State Department, the British, led by Lord Keynes and even the Soviets, envisioned the \\"eventual integration of Germany into the world economy.\\" This lenience towards Germany in a 1944 State department memorandum by Pasvolsky inspired Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's opposed Morgenthau plan, but while the Morgenthau plan won tentative approval, the more lenient policies were eventually carried out. Similarly, Pasvolsky, concerned about the strain on occupation forces, favored not insisting on the removal of the Japanese emperor, opposing Dean Acheson and Archibald MacLeish Return to Brookings and death He resigned from the State Department in March 1946. In 1946‚Äì53 he was director of international studies at the Brookings Institution, and at the time of his death, he was working on a study of the origin and history of the United Nations. He died of a heart attack on May 5, 1953 in Washington, DC, survived by his wife Christine McCormick Pasvolsky, two sisters (Elaine Elnett and Clara Pasvolsky) and two brothers (Valentine and Elias). His incomplete manuscript on the history of the UN was the basis of his assistant Ruth Russell's 1961 History of the United Nations Charter, the standard work on the subject.Schlesinger, p.281 Critics Pasvolsky had his share of enemies at the State Department. Isaiah Bowman, one of the leading advisers of the State Department, took an instant dislike to Pasvolsky. Bowman, Welles and Pasvolsky engaged in a power struggle over the direction of the Advisory Committee in late 1942.Smith, p.385 Bowman's differences with Pasvolsky erupted at San Francisco, where he wrote that he was \\"dangerous to American interests\\" and that it was \\"a mistake to put one man with his background into a key position.\\" Pasvolsky resented Bowman equally, and wrote him out of subsequent histories of the UN's founding.Smith, p.404 I F Stone called Pasvolsky \\"Kerensky's gift to American foreign policy and political science\\" and considered that the widely used Brookings publications on US foreign policy prepared under his direction reflected \\"an ultra-right point of view\\".Stone pp. 154-156 Some considered Pasvolsky's Brookings ideas for the world's economic problems simple-minded. Dean Acheson referred disparagingly to the \\"Hull-Pasvolsky establishment\\" and wrote that \\"Leo Pasvolsky was Mr. Hull's principal speech writer. Or one might say, he wrote Mr. Hull's principal speech: for whatever the occasion or title, the speech was apt to turn into a dissertation on the benefits of unhampered international trade and the true road to it through agreements reducing tariffs.\\" Acheson pp. 55, 64 Acheson belittled Pasvolsky's postwar planning: > The whole effort, except for two results, seems to have been a singularly > sterile one, uninspired by gifts either of insight or prophecy. One of these > results was the foundation work for the United Nations Charter, the other, > which laid an even broader foundation, the education of Senator Arthur > Vandenberg to understand that beyond the borders of the United States > existed a \\"vast external realm\\" which could and would affect profoundly our > interests and our destiny.Acheson p. 64 In a 1967 letter, Acheson criticized American moralism in international affairs, which he saw as culminating in \\"that little rat Leo Pasvolsky's United Nations.\\" Works   * * NotesReferences    * * Inderjeet Parmar, Think Tanks and Power in Foreign Policy: a comparative study of The role and influence of the CFR and RIIA, 1939-1945 (Palgrave Macmillan, 2004) Further reading  * * External links  Category:Bretton Woods Conference delegates Category:United States Department of State officials Category:American male journalists Category:20th-century American journalists Category:20th-century American economists Category:Columbia University alumni Category:City College of New York alumni Category:American officials of the United Nations Category:1893 births Category:1953 deaths ","title":"Leo Pasvolsky"},{"id":"29127271","title":"2006‚Äì07 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team"},{"id":"29127309","text":"Brih, Breeh ( also transliterated as Bri7 ) () is a village in the Chouf District in Mount Lebanon region, Lebanon.

First, Craig argues that the universe began to exist, using two philosophical and two scientific arguments. Second, Craig argues that whatever begins to exist has a cause that caused it to begin to exist. Finally, Craig argues that this cause is a personal creator who changelessly and independently willed the beginning of the universe.Guminski, A. T.

Part II moves to defend in length the substance of the argument. Basic argument #Whatever begins to exist, has a cause of its existence (i.e. something has caused it to start existing). #The universe began to exist. i.e., the temporal regress of events is finite. #Therefore, the universe has a cause.

Second sub-set of arguments Argument based on the impossibility of the formation of an actual infinite by successive addition: #A collection formed by successive addition cannot be an actual infinite. #The temporal series of past events is a collection formed by successive addition. #Therefore, the temporal series of past events cannot be actually infinite. The first is that a) an actual infinite cannot exist in the real world; and b) an infinite temporal series is such an actual infinite.

Under the First French Empire, he became a general officer and fought under Emperor Napoleon I of France in two notable campaigns. He became a cavalryman under the Ancien R√©gime and by 1798 he commanded a regiment of cavalry. He fought in the 1806-1807 campaign in Poland, commanding a brigade of cavalry. During the 1809 Danube campaign, he led a division of corps cavalry and played a prominent role. Afterward, he commanded forces in the interior. He retired from service after the Hundred Days and briefly returned to active duty in the 1830s. MARULAZ is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 11. Early career Born on 6 November 1769 in Zeiskam in territory then belonging to the Bishop of Speyer (in modern-day Germany), Marulaz enlisted in the French army's Esterhazy Hussar Regiment in 1784. While in this unit, which became known as the 3rd Hussars, he was promoted to Farrier in 1791 and Quartermaster in 1792.Sonet, pp 564-565 French Revolution In 1792, Marulaz became a lieutenant in a units of scouts which soon became the 8th Hussar Regiment. He fought in the Austrian Netherlands in 1792 and was promoted to captain in March 1793. He took part in several actions in the War in the Vend√©e in late 1793. In May 1794, he was elevated to Chef d'escadron and participated in the Flanders Campaign during the War of the First Coalition. He distinguished himself at the head of 30 hussars on 15 September in the Battle of Boxtel. October 1794 found him fighting near Mainz. In October 1795 he fought near Huningue near the Switzerland border. He fought the Swiss near Bern in March 1796 and captured a number of enemy soldiers. Marulaz received promotion to Chef de brigade (colonel) of the 8th Hussars on 28 December 1798 in time for the War of the Second Coalition. He fought in the First Battle of Zurich on 4 June 1799, the 8th Hussars being attached to the 7th Division.Smith, p 158 On 15 June he led a successful raid on an enemy camp, capturing 400 men. He was shot five times, including one ball that passed right through his body from side to side, breaking two ribs. At the start of Jean Moreau's 1800 campaign, the 8th Hussars belonged to Dominique Vandamme's division of Claude Lecourbe's corps.Smith, p 177 This division fought at the battles of Stockach and Messkirch in April 1800.Smith, p 181 During the Battle of Hohenlinden campaign that fall, the 8th Hussars were assigned to Charles Gudin's divisionSmith, p 189 and fought at Salzburg on 14 December 1800.Smith, p 190 French Empire In 1803, Marulaz was confirmed as colonel of the 8th Hussars. He became a member of the L√©gion d'honneur and a Baron of the Empire in 1804. He was elevated to the rank of general of brigade on 6 March 1805 and briefly was in charge of the Haute-Sa√¥ne. In October he was called to command a cavalry brigade in the Grande Arm√©e. Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau, by Antoine-Jean Gros During the War of the Fourth Coalition, Marulaz led a cavalry brigade at the Battle of Golymin on 26 December 1806.Smith, p 236 At the Battle of Eylau on 8 February 1807, he led Marshal Louis Davout's III Corps cavalry brigade. Under his orders were the 1st and 12th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments, the 2nd Chasseurs having been assigned to other duties. At first his troopers covered the advance of Louis Friant's division, then drove off some cossacks.Petre Poland, p 184 Marulaz took a position guarding the right flank and repelled an attack by Russian cavalry. He became embroiled in the bitter fight over possession of the village of Klein Sausgarten.Petre Poland, p 185 During Davout's subsequent advance, Marulaz protected the extreme right flank of the III Corps.Petre Poland, p 188 Late in the afternoon, his cavalry were attacked by the late-arriving Prussians near the village of Kutschitten and driven back along with the rest of Davout's troops.Petre Poland, pp 192-193 The 12th Chasseurs of his brigade was present at the Battle of Heilsberg on 10 June 1807.Smith, p 247 Still a general of brigade, Marulaz found himself leading Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na's IV Corps cavalry division at the outset of the War of the Fifth Coalition.Chandler, p 1107 His 2,765-man command included the 3rd, 14th, 19th, and 23rd Chasseurs √† cheval Regiments, in addition to the Baden Light Dragoon and Hesse-Darmstadt Chevaul√©ger Regiments.Bowden & Tarbox, p 60 On the morning of 21 April 1809, the 23rd Chasseurs seized the bridge over the Isar River at Moosburg in a brilliant coup. Marulaz's cavalry quickly crossed to the east bank and turned northeast toward Landshut where Johann von Hiller's Austrians were making a stand.Arnold Crisis, pp 142-143 That day, Napoleon defeated Hiller in the Battle of Landshut. The emperor hoped to catch the Austrians in a pincer attack between his forces and Mass√©na's.Chandler, p 687 Map of the Battle of Neumarkt-Sankt Veit, 24 April 1809 Marulaz marched rapidly down the east bank of the Isar until he found his way blocked by Austrian infantry defending the southwest suburbs of Landshut. He sent a courier galloping for infantry assistance. Soon Louis Jacques de Coehorn's infantry brigade arrived and Marulaz asked him to clear away the Austrian foot soldiers. However, Coehorn was unwilling to advance without orders from his division commander, Michel Marie Clapar√®de. When one of Mass√©na's staff officers tried to argue with Clapar√®de, that general obstinately refused to help Marulaz. By the time Mass√©na appeared and ordered the infantry forward, it was too late; Hiller's troops escaped what might have become a trap.Arnold Crisis, p 148 On 22 April, Napoleon took most of his troops to the north to fight Archduke Charles in the Battle of Eckm√ºhl. The emperor appointed Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessi√®res to lead a task force consisting of Marulaz's division, Karl Philipp von Wrede's Bavarian division, and Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor's French infantry division. The force was instructed to pursue Hiller's command.Petre Archduke, p 187 Late on 23 April, Hiller turned on his pursuers. Marulaz, leading the 3rd and 19th Chasseurs and an infantry battalion, collided with the Austrians at Erharting village, just north of M√ºhldorf. The outnumbered French quickly pulled back to Neumarkt-Sankt Veit.Petre Archduke, p 218 Hiller attacked Bessi√®res on 24 April in the Battle of Neumarkt-Sankt Veit. During the action, Marulaz was unable to hold back the Austrian center column. After the defeat, Bessi√®res pulled back to Vilsbiburg.Petre Archduke, pp 218-219 Hiller was soon in full retreat to the east with the French in pursuit.Petre Archduke, p 220 Near the villages of Kallham and Riedau on 1 May 1809, Marulaz's Baden Dragoons scored a splendid success when they broke an Austrian infantry square. After the foot soldiers fired a volley, the dragoons charged, broke into the square, and cut down its commanding officer. At this, the 3rd battalion of the Jordis Infantry Regiment # 59 laid down its weapons and 16 officers and 690 soldiers became prisoners.Smith, p 296 Marulaz led the IV Corps advance guard in the pursuit from Landshut to Vienna. On the morning of 3 May, Marulaz pressed aggressively against Hiller's rearguard near Linz. By 10:00 AM, he found the Austrians under Joseph Radetzky von Radetz and Karl von Vincent holding Klein M√ºnchen village, just west of the Traun River. Marulaz deployed his French regiments in the front line and his Germans in the second. At this time another Austrian column under Emmanuel von Schustekh arrived and began filing over the bridge at Ebelsberg.Petre Archduke, pp 232-236 Attacking a village packed with infantry was not a job for cavalry, so Coehorn's brigade was summoned. The French foot soldiers soon flushed the Austrians from the houses and there was a stampede of troops dashing for the bridge with Marulaz's horsemen hacking at the fugitives. In the confusion, the French captured hundreds of Austrians. Coehorn's leading elements forced their way across the span and the vicious Battle of Ebelsberg resulted. When the Austrians began to fight back hard, the elite company of the 19th Chasseurs crossed to join the action.Arnold Conquers, pp 8-10 Before the battle was over, the French lost at least 4,000 men and the Austrians 4,495, and numbers of wounded soldiers were burnt to death when the town caught fire.Arnold Conquers, p 15 With his division numbering only 1,960 sabers, Marulaz fought in the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 21 and 22 May.Bowden & Tarbox, p 87 During the first day, the French infantry held the two villages on the flanks while cavalry divisions under Marulaz, Antoine Lasalle, and Jean-Louis-Brigitte d'Espagne defended the center. At 4:00 PM, Napoleon ordered Marulaz to attack Austrian infantry near Aspern while the other two divisions charged the enemy cavalry.Petre Archduke, pp 282-283 Marulaz charged no less than 17,000 infantry and 50 cannons belonging to Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen's column. Archduke Charles brought two additional infantry regiments to Hohenzollern's support and personally rallied the troops. Against such odds, the attack failed, Marulaz had three horses shot under him, and his Chief of staff was killed. However, the cavalry attacks delayed the Austrian offensive.Arnold Conquers, p 53 After 6:00 pm, the village of Aspern fell and the archduke ordered Hohenzollern to break the weak French center. Bessi√®res sent his horsemen in charge after charge to stave off defeat. In one charge, Marulaz smashed through the Austrian cavalry only to be confronted with an unbroken array of enemy infantry. His horse fell dead and Marulaz only escaped capture when a lieutenant offered him his own mount. Eventually, the battle petered out with the French center still intact.Arnold Conquers, p 61 Battle of Wagram by Carle Vernet On the second day, Marulaz and Lasalle charged no less than three times in assisting the attack of Marshal Jean Lannes in the center. The French horsemen were repeatedly thwarted by new Austrian tactics. After overthrowing the first Austrian line, they found themselves confronted with a second line they were unable to overcome. At this time Marulaz suffered a serious wound.Arnold Conquers, p 70 At the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July, Marulaz led the 23rd Chasseurs, Hesse-Darmstadt Chevaul√©gers, 1st Prince Royal Bavarian Chevaul√©ger Regiment, and two Bavarian 6-pounder artillery batteries, a total of 1,223 sabers, 301 gunners, and 12 cannons. His other regiments were on detached duty.Bowden & Tarbox, p 147 In the early hours of the first day, Marulaz crossed to the north bank with the rest of the IV Corps. Mass√©na posted his infantry with its left flank on the river and sent Marulaz and Lasalle to guard his right flank. While the infantry overran the Austrian riverbank defenses, the cavalry helped clear away some stray enemy units.Petre Archduke, p 353 Later in the day, he deployed on the left flank with IV Corps and missed the unsuccessful late afternoon attack.Epstein, p 153 Marulaz acquired the Ch√¢teau de Filain in 1808 and died there in 1842. At 2:00 am on 6 July, Mass√©na shifted his corps toward the center, leaving only Jean Boudet's infantry division holding the left flank.Petre Archduke, p 364 That morning Archduke Charles launched a dangerous attack on the French left flank and succeeded in defeating Boudet's troops.Arnold Conquers, pp 143-144 At 11:00 am, Napoleon sent Mass√©na to retake the ground on the left. Marulaz made several charges to help Boudet's troops, then he managed to surprise and overrun an Austrian artillery battery. The guns were quickly retaken by enemy hussars, but with Lasalle's assistance, the hussars were driven away and two cannons captured. This incident marked the high tide of the Austrian advance.Arnold Conquers, p 162 During the pursuit, Marulaz's troopers proved unable to break two steady Austrian squares. A 12-pounder battery was brought up to blast the enemy, and the chase went on. When an Austrian bullet fatally struck Lasalle, Marulaz made a speech to his old 8th Hussars from Lasalle's division, reminding them he was their former colonel. Ending the harangue with, \\"You will charge. Marulaz is at your head\\", he led a charge. He was shot in the arm, but he didn't relinquish command until a cannon shot killed his horse and he was badly stunned in the fall.Arnold Conquers, pp 165-166 Pleased with Marulaz's performance, Napoleon promoted him to general of division on 12 July 1809 and appointed him to command the 6th Military Division at Besan√ßon. From 8 January to 20 April 1814, he successfully withstood a siege of Besan√ßon by Prince Aloys Liechtenstein and 12,000 Austrian troops. Marulaz's 9,000-man garrison included elements of the 2nd, 38th, 64th, 93rd, and 154th French Line Infantry Regiments, the 3rd and 4th Swiss Infantry Regiments, and the 25th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment. As many as 1,000 of his troops were killed, wounded, or died of illness during the siege. The Austrians withdrew when Napoleon abdicated.Smith, p 524 Marulaz accepted the Bourbon Restoration and was made a Chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis in 1814. He held a number of positions under King Louis XVIII of France but during the Hundred Days, he switched his allegiance to Napoleon. After the emperor's final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, he was forced to retire from military service in October 1815. Later career Marulaz remained in retirement until the July Revolution of 1830. On 7 February 1831 he was placed in the General Staff reserve and retired from the army for the last time on 1 December 1834. He died at the Ch√¢teau de Filain on 10 June 1842. He had acquired the property in 1808. During his military career, he was wounded 19 times and had 26 horses killed under him. NotesReferences * Arnold, James R. Crisis on the Danube.

Situated in the north of the Beqaa Valley near Chtaura and Zahl√©, 38 km from Baalbek, the winery and distillery are located on the Tana√Øl property, which is also home to vineyards and a restaurant. The Beqaa Valley has an extensive history of viticulture dating back over 5,000 years to the Phoenicians.McGovern, Patrick.E. \\"Uncorking the Past\\". University of California Press, 2009, Pg. 7. The northern Bekaa has traditionally been a favoured terroir for viticulture,Karam, Michael (2005) The Wines of Lebanon Saqi Books especially since the beginning of the last century.McGovern, Patrick.E. Uncorking the Past. University of California Press, 2009, Pg. 7. Vines have also been introduced in the southern Bekaa as part of the recent surge in the number of wineries established in Lebanon.  The history of the estate The Tana√Øl property was brought by Michel and Amal Ghosn in the early 1970s and was used by the family as a country retreat from their primary residence in Beirut. In line with tradition, it was planted table grapes, including indigenous varieties such as beitamouni and obeidi, used to produce home-made arak. It also had a kitchen garden growing mekti, an indigenous drought-resistant cucumber, and orchards. The outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975 forced the family to leave the estate and both Sami and Ramzi Ghosn left Lebanon to study abroad. In the early 1990s Sami and Ramzi returned to Lebanon and decided to work on revitalisating the war-ravaged estate. Establishment At the end of the civil war in 1991 there were five wineries in Lebanon ‚Äì Ch√¢teau Musar, Ch√¢teau Ksara, Kefraya, Domaine des Tourelles and Nakad https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/wine/8243878/Lebanese-wine- Edgy-exhilarating-and-drinkable.html but that number has now increased to over 30. As part of this renaissance,New York Times, Where Conflict Raged, Lebanon Now Tends Its Vineyards, October 2005 the Ghosn brothers, assisted by French partners, established the Massaya winery in 1998, citing the historical potential of Lebanese terroir and a desire to revitalise both a traditional industry and an area that had suffered hugely during the civil war. Initially the brothers focused on the revival of traditional home-made arak, the Lebanese spirit made from wine and aniseed, often likened to Turkey's raki and Greece's ouzo. Only traditional methods were used, including the burning of vine wood to heat the copper alembics used for distillation and the use of traditional clay jars for ageing the arak. The clay jars are produced for Massaya by specialised potters from the village of Beit Chabab. The arak is triple distilled and aged for 18 months. It is drunk diluted with water or ice.http://www.economist.com/node/2281757 Massaya now produces 40,000 litres per annum which is sold in distinctive blue bottles and has had notable success http://www.economist.com/node/2281757  French partners  The Brunier family of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape and the Hebrard family, formerly of Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc in Saint-√âmilion, Bordeaux, are partners in the winery. Hippolyte Brunier planted his first wine stocks on Plateau de la Crau, where grapes had been grown since the 14th century and where, in 1972, Claude Chappe, the inventor of the optical telegraph, built one of his signal towers. Hippolyte‚Äôs son, Jules, extended the estate to 42 acres and gave it its name \\"Vieux T√©l√©graphe\\". Since the early 1980s, the family business has been run by Fr√©d√©ric and Daniel, both of whom are partners in Massaya. After the sale of the Hebrard family enterprise, Dominic Hebrard established la Maison Hebrard, a new Chateau in Saint Emilion, and went into partnership with Massaya. by Tom Cannavan and Michael Karam Wines The grapes are harvested in September and October from Massaya's vineyards on the Tana√Øl property as well as other areas of Massaya land around the Bekaa valley. Massaya bottles five wines per vintage: one white, one ros√© and three reds ‚Äì Classic, Silver Selection and Gold Reserve, made from varying blends of Grenache noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Mourvedre, Syrah and Cinsault.

China is the largest importer of e-waste and is home to most of the world's largest dumpsites. Rapid economic growth, coupled with the world's increasing demand for electronics has dramatically increased the amount of e-waste being disposed of. Roughly 70% this global e-waste ends up in China. While the e-waste disposal sector is responsible for many jobs in rural Southeastern China, it has also posed environmental and health risks by releasing toxic pollutants. Most of these risks arise from the fact that 60% of the e-waste is processed in informal recycling centers by unskilled ill-equipped manual labour. This e-waste is often processed through crude, informal practices, causing serious environmental damage and permanent health risks in areas surrounding the disposal sites. While the Chinese government and the international community have taken action to regulate e-waste management, ineffective enforcement has been an obstacle to mitigating the consequences of e-waste. Process of electronic waste= Sources  China receives pollution from both ends of the supply chain: during production process and by allowing electronic waste to be recycled and dumped in the country. Large amounts of foreign e-waste, mostly from the developed Western world, have been imported into China since the 1970s. Cheaper labor and lax environmental standards attracted e-waste from developed countries that could save much of the cost of processing the waste domestically. By 2000, China was the largest importer of e-waste in the world. Although the Chinese government enacted a ban on the import of waste in 2002, much of the world's e-waste is still smuggled in via illegal channels, often through Hong Kong or Southeast Asia. A 2013 study by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) examining the e-waste trade showed that most of the e-waste originating in developed countries, such as the US, Japan, Korea, and various countries in the European Union (EU), was illegally bound for developing countries, including China. According to the study, 976,500 tonnes of illegal waste, including e-waste, was seized by Chinese authorities in 2013. In the same year, 211 cases of waste smuggling were halted by Chinese authorities. China's domestic contribution of e-waste is also substantial. China in 2012 was the world's second largest producer of electronic waste, generating 229.66 million units, compared to the 32.99 million units generated in 2001. China is now the second largest e-waste producer in the world after the US, creating up to 6.1 million tons per year. This amount is expected to continue rising with China's economic development, technical innovation, and urbanization as more electronics are created and consumed, and disposed. The major sources of e-waste processed in China are households, domestic institutions, such as schools, hospitals, and government agencies and businesses, and equipment manufacturers. This e-waste is usually channeled through: second-hand markets where reusable devices can be re-sold at reasonable prices, (illegal) donation systems that send used home appliances to poorer rural areas of western China, or through peddlers who re-sell e-wastes to dealers. The third channel is the most common form of e-waste management in China, which creates a massive informal sector.  Treatment  Most of this e-waste is sent to recycling sites in order to extract precious metals and organic materials to be resold for economic value. The most common form of e-waste treatment used in China is the ‚Äúphysical/mechanical method‚Äù that separates the difference elements in each electronic device through manual dismantling and chemical separation. This often involves rudimentary practices, such as heating circuit boards, cutting cables and wires, chipping and melting plastics, and extracting precious metals through acid leaching and incineration. These operations, such as strong acid leaching and the open burning of heavy materials, have resulted in the release of toxic metals and pollutants.  Informal sector  The majority of e-waste recycling in China takes place illegally within the informal sector. The informal sector is constructed of a system of small- scaled, often family-run workshops and ‚Äúbackyard‚Äù recycling sectors. It is generally run by peddlers traveling door-to-door offering marginal fees for disposal of obsolescent appliances. These peddlers then resell these devices to e-waste dealers. The informal recycling method consists mainly of manual, unskilled labor and is inherently mobile. Informal recycling operations also commonly occur in suburban areas where they lack effective enforcement and control. A main concern around the informal sector is that most peddlers and dealers lack knowledge and access to adequate equipment and technologies for safe e-waste disposal. Studies measured higher potential health risks from heavy metals at informal e-waste recycling sites than in formal recycling sites, such as those operating in Jiangsu and Shanghai. Nonetheless, it is a very profitable market in China thanks to low wages, high demand for used electronics, used parts and materials. While there have been centralized efforts to mitigate these risks through formalizing the e-waste management sector, the informal sector still dominates the e-waste collection system.  Environmental and health impacts  Most e-waste recycling sites in China lack the appropriate facilities to safeguard environmental and human health. This results in the leaking of massive amounts of toxic chemicals, such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. Without the proper methods and necessary safety precautions, e-waste is directly responsible for deteriorating health and environment in China's e-waste hotspots. Residents in major e-waste recycling sites face a potential higher daily intake of heavy metal. Residents are exposed to the hazardous e-waste remnants though inhalation from air, dietary intake, soil/dust ingestion and skin contact. This has created serious health risks for people in these regions. Studies have also found greater soil and groundwater contamination in e-waste processing sites, as well as a higher cancer incidence. Special concern has been risen for children, as their potential health risk was measured to be 8 times that for adult e-waste workers due to their smaller size and higher ingestion rate.  Affected regions  The main region where the e-waste is shipped to is the Guangdong province, situated along China's south east coast. From there it is spreading to other regions such as Zhejiang, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hunan, Fujian and Shandong. All of these regions are located along China's entire east coast. Guiyu in Guangdong Province is the location of the largest electronic waste site on earth. Most of China's informal recycling sectors are limited to regions along the southeastern coast of China. From there it is spreading to other regions such as Zhejiang, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hunan, Fujian and Shandong for processing. All of these regions are located along China's entire east coast. E-waste disposal operations frequently occur in the suburban areas, due to the lack of effective enforcement and control.  Guiyu  Guiyu in Guangdong Province is the location of the largest electronic waste site on earth. The town has up to 5,000 workshops treating up to 70 percent of the world's e-waste, and employing around 100,000 people; electronic waste lines most of the streets and reports indicate that the smell of burning metal and plastic are constantly in the air. The disposal sites recycle 15,000 tons of e-waste on a daily basis. Over 80 per cent of the town's residents make a living off of manually disassembling and disposing e-waste full-time. The residents of Guiyu are known to have the highest reported level of lead and dioxin found in people globally. These high dioxin levels also result in much higher miscarriage rates for women that are pregnant and reports show that over 70 percent of children have high lead levels in their bloodstreams.  Taizhou  The Taizhou region of the Zhejiang province is also a major e-waste recycling center. Taizhou's residents are especially vulnerable to the contamination of their large agricultural sector caused by the e-waste sector. Taizhou has been a major site for soil and sediment pollution by toxins generated from e-waste disposal. Residents of Taizhou also have a high dietary intake of heavy metals through rice, vegetable, and water consumption. In 2012, their average intake of heavy metals was 3.7 mg/(day$kg bw), exceeding the FAO tolerable daily intake of 3.6 mg/day$kg bw.  International agreements on electronic waste = Basel Convention  In 1992, the United Nations Basel Convention was established to control the transboundary movement and disposal of hazardous waste. [24] It provided the first comprehensive global environmental agreement on hazardous wastes and acknowledged e-waste as within the scope of environmental protection and cross-border trade. The general obligation proposed by the convention is that states exporting hazardous wastes must do so in an environmentally sound manner for the state of import and that they respect the policies of any country that prohibits imports as a whole. Currently, 176 states, including China, have ratified the convention. China signed the Basel Convention in 1990. Furthermore, an extension of the convention, the Basel Ban Amendment specifically bans members of the OECD from exporting e-waste to non-OECD, which includes China.  Domestic measures = National legislation  A variety of environmental legislations and programs have been issued by the Chinese government in order to regulate the electronic product production and e-waste management sectors. In 2008, the Ministry of Environmental Protection passed a set of administrative rules requiring all e-waste treatment enterprises to pass an environmental impact assessment and obtain official licenses to continue operations. The Chinese State Council also mandated the recycling of electronics by the consumer and required all other unnecessary materials discarded in the manufacturing process to also be recycled. In 2011, the Collection and Treatment Decree on Wastes of Electric and Electronic Equipment strengthened national standards for the e-waste treatment sector, setting minimum annual treatment capacities for formal e-waste treatment enterprises. These new set of laws also required treatment plants to adopt pollution prevention principles during the entire disposal process in order to minimize negative environmental impacts. In 2012, China adopted the extended producer responsibility (EPR) system from the EU, which held manufacturers responsible for the collection and recycling of electronics. Otherwise known as ‚ÄúProducer Takeback,‚Äù the EPR management system requires manufacturers to carry out environmentally safe management of their products even after they are discarded. The Measure on Tax Levy and Use for E-waste Recycling was implemented on manufacturers to officially enact the EPR system.  Provincial programmes  Along with national legislation, several provincial programs have been set in place to address e-waste management issues in more urgent regions, such as the Guangdong, Qingdao, Beijing and the Sichuan provinces. Many of these programs have been aimed at controlling the informal sector and strengthening formal e-waste channels. Waste collections systems and storage points for e-waste have been created in villages with larger disposal sites. In the regions of Tianjin, Taicing, Ningbo, Taizhou and Zhangzhou, local recycling parks have been built in which informal laborers still work as manual recyclers, but under production and pollution management. In Guiyu, the government promoted technical upgrades in informal workshops by replacing coal-fired grills with electrical heaters that would reduce the amount of leaked toxins when treating circuit boards. In June 2009, China initiated the \\"Home Appliance Old for New Rebate Program\\", which first launched in nine cities and provinces considered to be more economically developed. It restricted the collection of old appliances by accredited household appliance retailers. These authorized collectors would be able to pay consumers a higher price for their e-waste as well as compensate them with discount coupons for new devices. By April 2011, about 46.6 million old home electrical appliances were collected along with the sale of 45 million new ones. This initiative resulted in the rapid growth of the formal waste electronic and electric equipment recycling industry. It reduced e-waste recycling based on private individual collection, and increased collection by formal entities through large-scale delivery and rational distribution with a centralized and statistical information system. Corporate initiatives In order to establish normative e-waste recycling network, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) designated Qingdao Haier, Hangzhou Dadi, Beijing Huaxing, and other companies, as the national e-waste collection and recycling pilot projects in 2004. These projects, along with the United Nations Environment Program were a failure due to the fact that they could not get adequate e-waste collected for efficient operations. Many companies, like Nintendo, are aware of the problem of e-waste and are developing their own initiatives. Companies joined forces by creating a collective e-waste reclamation campaign. But that does not solve the whole problem. China Mobile, Motorola, and Nokia collaborated in launching a recycling program where they took back used cellphones and electronic accessories. This ‚Äútake-back,‚Äù or ‚ÄúGreen Box‚Äù program safely collected about 20 tons of e-waste by 2009. In response to low incentives some companies, like Dell, started to provide compensations to consumers in Beijing and Shanghai of US$0.15 for 1 kg of old computer. In order to receive the incentive consumers had to bring their used computers to local Dell stores at their own expense. The project failed because the financial gains of returning their computer to formal recyclers were lower than the gains from selling computers to informal collectors. Legislative inadequacies Though legislation and regulations have been accepted by the developed countries against illegal exportation of e-waste, the high number of illegal shipments continues exacerbate the e-waste problem in China. For instance, the members of the EU agreed not to transport any waste subject to the Basel Convention out of the EU or the OECD but illegal shipments are still rising in China and other developing countries. Greenpeace International claims that a large amount of e-waste is usually illegally shipped from Europe, the U.S. and Japan to China. One of the main incentives for them to export e-waste is that the cost of domestic e-waste disposal is higher than the exportation fees. Moreover, e-waste brokers make large profits from the trade and get paid twice: once for acquiring the e-waste, once for shipping it. In China, informal collectors buy old electronic devices from consumers. The incentive to participate in collection systems, which cost them compared to informal recycling, is low, even though many Chinese consumers realize that it is important to recycle e-waste safely. As many as 90% of the consumers are reluctant to pay for e-waste recycling because there is still monetary value in the end-life of products. While electronic devices and waste are collected in different Chinese regions and impart various environmental and health problems on the area, many activists argue that the distributors and source countries are not being held significantly responsible. While international regulations have increased domestic recycling programs in these source countries (such as the United States), shipment of Electronic Waste has not completely been eradicated and remains a significant global issue.

Suitability for club use, particularly low cost and maximum utility, were prime considerations. It is produced in kit form for home assembly. The CR.100 is a conventional single engine, low-wing monoplane, with the large control surface areas and absence of dihedral expected in an aerobatic aircraft. The structure is mostly wood and fabric, though the main wing spar is a plywood and carbon laminate composite and carbon covered ply is an option for the wing surfaces. All the flying surfaces are straight edged and tapered. The ailerons take up about 60% of the wing's trailing edge. The ailerons have spades to reduce control loads. The remainder of the wing trailing edge is three- position flaps. The rudder and elevators are horn balanced and there is a fixed rudder trim tab. The width of the flat sided fuselage is determined by the side by side seating arrangement. Full dual controls, including a pair of left hand throttles, are fitted. A sliding bubble canopy covers the cockpit and is faired behind into a raised and rounded fuselage top decking. The wide track main conventional undercarriage has cantilever legs in fairings, with wheels usually in spats. The tailwheel is freely castoring. The CR.100T variant offers the alternative of a tricycle undercarriage. The CR.100 is powered by a 180 hp (135 kW) Lycoming O-360 flat-4 engine, driving a fixed pitch, two-bladed propeller. The CR.110 variant has a Lycoming engine uprated to 200 hp (150 kW). The CR.120 high agility version is intended to be competitive in the 200 hp class of the Doret Cup and also has the uprated engine. It differs from the CR.110 aerodynamically in having almost full span ailerons and a shorter span to increase the roll rate, at the cost of the flaps, and structurally in having an entirely carbon fibre airframe. The CR.120 was also intended for use as a military trainer. The first flight of the CR.100 was on 27 August 1992. The CR.120 flew in September 1996 and the CR.100T in November 2000. Operational history The RC.100 won the Championnat de France II, the national competition for two-seat light aircraft, in 1994 and 1995. By 2001, more than 35 kits had been sold. In 2010 13 CR.100s, 1 CR.100T and 2 CR.120s were on the French civil aircraft register. Two CR.100s flew with the l'Equipe Voltige de l'Arm√©e de l'Air between 1995 and 1997; one of these was later registered in the UK, the other is now a French civilian.

W. Halse and published in the UK by Micro Power. The game was released in 1984 for the BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, and Commodore 64 computers. Although the cassette inlay gives the release date as 1984, some sources state the release date as 1983 and the game is also known as Stock Car Racer. Description In-game screenshot (Acorn Electron) The game provides a top-down view of one of six user-selectable racing tracks. One or two human players in red cars compete against yellow computer- controlled cars. Oil slicks can be added which cause the cars to veer off- course, making the game more challenging. The amount of skidding can also be selected by the player. A race consists of anything between 1 and 40 laps. Players can steer their car left and right, but unlike most racing games, there are no keys for directly braking or accelerating. Instead, the player drives by selecting one of four gears (or neutral) and the car will accelerate according to the currently selected gear. Reception Tom Bowker describes the game as \\"primitive\\", but he \\"loved it deeply\\". The game was reviewed in the August 1984 edition of Acorn User (Issue 25) and later briefly mentioned in issue 4.03 of Electron User as part of the ten-game Micro Power Magic compilation, where it was described as \\"very realistic\\". Legacy Another game, Grand Prix by S. Merrigan on the Triple Deckers volume 1 compilation was described by Dave Reeder as \\"a very poor copy of Stock Car\\".

Background Huddinge Idrottsf√∂rening is the municipality's oldest sports club. Inspired by the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Otto Hellkvist founded the club in the same year. For several decades the club had many sections, including bandy, table tennis, cycling, athletics and skiing. Today Huddinge IF is purely a football club and is one of Stockholm's largest with about 1,200 active members and 70 teams. Successful clubs in Huddinge that owe their origins as sections within Huddinge IF before breaking away from the parent club include Huddinge IK (ice-hockey) and Huddinge BT (tennis). Since their foundation Huddinge IF has participated mainly in the middle and lower divisions of the Swedish football league system.

On 28 February 1968, United States Navy SP-2H Neptune aircraft on routine patrol detected a North Vietnamese SL class naval trawler heading towards the South Vietnamese coast from north of the DMZ. By the next morning, three more trawlers were discovered and units of Operation Market Time were deployed for a surprise interception. The suspect trawlers did not fly flags so it was not until the start of the engagement that their origin was discovered. The trawlers were steel hulled vessels, 100 feet long and armed with 57-millimeter recoilless rifles and machine guns. All four vessels were loaded with weapons and ammunition intended to be delivered to the Viet Cong. American and South Vietnamese forces that engaged in action included the United States Coast Guard cutters , , , , , , , the swift boats , , , , , and , two South Vietnamese navy junks and one patrol boat. Two U.S. Army helicopter gunships also participated in combat as well as aircraft used to fire flares. Background The United States Navy, South Vietnamese navy, and the U.S. Coast Guard, operating under the authority of the South Vietnamese government, established a blockade of South Vietnam designated Operation Market Time to prevent infiltrations of personnel, munitions and equipment by the North Vietnamese government. A twelve mile wide restricted zone existed along the entire South Vietnamese coast and ships assigned to Market Time had the authority to stop and search any vessel within the zone for contraband material and check the identity papers of any person on a detained vessel.Cutler, p 81Larzelere, pp 6‚Äì7Scotti, p 18 Action=Action off Bo De River The trawler designated in U.S. Navy records as An Xuyen Province Trawler (map reference #1) was first sighted on 28 February approximately 150 miles east southeast of V≈©ng T√†u holding a southeasterly course.Kelley, p 5-541 On the evening of the 29th she changed to a westerly course and USCGC Winona started a covert surveillance. The trawler crossed the 12-mile limit at 0120 1 March and began a run for the beach near the mouth of the Bo De River at 0200. A blocking force placed near the mouth of the river consisted of several Navy PCF's and the Coast Guard cutters Point Hudson, Point Grace, and Point Marone.Tulich, p 8 Winona fired warning shots eight miles off the coast which were ignored so she opened up with her 5-inch/38 caliber gun after receiving return fire from the trawler.Johnson, p 335Larzelere, p 130 The trawler exploded in a huge fireball after taking several direct hits and sank approximately seven miles off the beach.Cutler, p 131 Winona was struck by several pieces of debris from the explosion, however only minor injuries were sustained by the crew during the action.Scotti, p 77 Action off Nha Trang The trawler designated Kh√°nh H√≤a Province Trawler (map reference #2) was first sighted by Market Time aircraft on 29 February approximately 90 miles east northeast of Nha Trang with a southwesterly course.Kelley, p 5-359 Surveillance was continued by Market Time vessels until she crossed the 12-mile limit 28 miles northeast of Nha Trang. Ignoring warning to heave to for boarding, the trawler continued on towards the beach. A South Vietnamese Navy patrol boat opened fire on the trawler and it quickly changed course and returned fire. Assisted by a U.S. Air Force AC-47 gunship, swift boats PCF-42, PCF-43, PCF-46, PCF-47, PCF-48 and two SVN junks sortied to help the patrol craft chase the trawler to a cove where it ran aground in the Hon Heo Secret ZoneKelley, p 5-247 At 0230, 1 March, five 81-millimeter mortar rounds from PCF-47 were direct hits and the trawler exploded with a massive explosion due to the munitions aboard. Fourteen dead North Vietnamese sailors were recovered the following morning. Rifles, machine guns and rocket launchers; along with considerable ammunition and explosives were recovered from the sunken trawler. The salvage operations extended over 12 days and included the recovery of a 14.5 millimeter antiaircraft gun and 68 cases of ammunition. Action off Tha Cau River USCGC Androscoggin, \\"Weather decks secure\\" by Don Van Liew. Forty miles from Chu Lai and six miles off the coast, (map reference #3) USCGC Androscoggin intercepted a third trawler designated in U.S. Navy records as the Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province Trawler. Androscoggin signaled the trawler to identify itself at 0112 but there was no response so Androscoggin shot 5-inch star shells into the air to illuminate the trawler.Larzelere, p 128 It was then that the trawler was positively identified as an SL class North Vietnamese trawler so the Androscoggin opened fire at 0120 with 5-inch high explosive naval gunfire and .50 caliber machine guns.Larzelere, p 129 The trawler returned fire with a recoilless rifle, laid a smoke screen and turned into Androscoggin's direction but one of the cutter's shells hit the after starboard side, so the trawler turned reversed course and headed for the shore.Scotti, p 75 As a result of a civilian junk passing through the battle area the Market Time ships had to cease fire.Cutler, p 130 Two United States Army helicopters were directed to engage the trawler with rockets and miniguns at 0129 and after their attack a reduction in the amount of fire coming from the trawler was noticed. At 0140 Point Grey, Point Welcome, PCF-18 and PCF-20 were ordered to take the trawler under fire with mortars and machine guns at close range because the trawler had moved too close to shore for Androscoggin to maneuver.Johnson, p 336 Point Welcome struck the trawler twice with 81-millimeter rounds. The trawler then grounded 50 yards off the mouth of the Tha Cau River at 0210. At 0220, the North Vietnamese tried to scuttle their ship and failed but a second attempt at 0235 succeeded in destroying the vessel in a 500-foot fireball.Scotti, p 76 The explosion caused some damage to the pilothouse of Point Welcome and the deck was littered with debris but no casualties were reported. Other action on 1 March shadowed the trawler designated as the B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province Trawler (map reference #4) but soon after being detected, the trawler turned around and headed back out to sea without being engaged. It was apparently headed for the Lo Dien area 42 miles north of Qui Nh∆°n.Kelley, p 5-430 The trawler never got any closer to the coast than 30 miles and after she reversed course was monitored by aircraft until she approached the coast of the People's Republic of China. While on Market Time patrol duties on 1 March, discovered an abandoned junk at anchor 52 miles southeast of Da Nang. After a search of the area failed to locate persons in the water, the junk was boarded and items were found of a Communist Chinese origin including a Communist Chinese flag. The junk was hoisted on board Persistent and delivered to Da Nang for further inspection. Aftermath  The destruction of three of the four trawlers and the turning back of the fourth demonstrated that Operation Market Time was an effective net for the interception of supplies destined for resupply of the Viet Cong. Except for the 1 March trawlers and one other instance in the days after Tet 1968 no other trawlers were spotted between July 1967 and August 1969.Summers, p 100 The North Vietnamese were forced to use the Ho Chi Minh trail through Laos or the neutral port of Sihanoukville in Cambodia to ship supplies to the Viet Cong. With the closing of the port at Sihanoukville to Communist shipping in August 1969, attempted North Vietnamese trawler traffic into South Vietnam resumed.Scotti, p 54 Of 15 trawlers detected by Market Time assets from August 1969 to late 1970, one was sunk, 13 were turned back and only one got through. In 1970, ten out of eleven trawlers were either sunk or were turned back.

He is best known as the lead singer of the synthpop duo Hurts. Early life Theo David Hutchcraft was born on 30 August 1986 in Richmond, North Yorkshire. Career=Bureau and Daggers (2004‚Äì2008) Hutchcraft met Adam Anderson and Scott Forster in Manchester in 2004. Over the next few months they exchanged music and lyrics via e-mail, before forming Bureau in March 2006, along with Flick Ward and Jamie Alsop. They performed their first gig as a quintet in May at The Music Box in Manchester, and were shortly afterwards signed to independent record label High Voltage Sounds. They released their first double A-side single \\"After Midnight\\" / \\"Dollhouse\\" in November, which was made Single of the Week on Xfm. In 2007, Bureau disbanded, and soon after Hutchcraft and Anderson formed the band Daggers. They signed to Label Fandango and in October released another double A-side single \\"Money\\" / \\"Magazine\\", which despite failing to chart, was nominated for the Popjustice Twenty Quid Music Prize. Throughout 2008, Daggers continued to build a following, and began working with successful producers Biff Stannard and Richard X, but after a disastrous A&R; showcase in London in September, Hutchcraft and Anderson returned to Manchester to reflect on the band's future. They recorded a mournful ballad called \\"Unspoken\\" together, and they immediately realised that this was the sound that they wanted to develop as a duo. After informing the rest of the band that it was finished, they went on a short break to Verona, Italy, where they claim they discovered the genre Disco Lento. Daggers announced on their Myspace page in January 2009 that they had split up. Hurts (2009‚Äìpresent) Hurts performing in Milan, October 2010 Now called Hurts, Hutchcraft and Anderson recorded an amateur music video for a song called \\"Wonderful Life\\" with a female dancer who had responded to an advert in a shop window. After they uploaded the video to their YouTube channel in April 2009, it quickly went viral. They were signed to RCA imprint Major Label in July. The video has since had over 21 million views on YouTube, putting it in the top 200 most watched videos on the website. Hurts finished fourth on the BBC's Sound of 2010 poll, and Zane Lowe premiered new song \\"Blood, Tears & Gold\\" as his \\"Hottest Record in the World\\" soon after. Hurts performed their first gig on 22 January at the Michalsky Stylenite in Berlin, followed by a gig on 22 February at St Phillips Church in Salford, where they performed eight songs. This was quickly followed by gigs at Wiltons Music Hall, London, and in Berlin and Cologne in Germany. Following massive success on Greek radio, Hurts were invited to perform at the MAD Video Music Awards ceremony in Athens in front of 11,000 people on 15 June. Also in June, it was announced that Kylie Minogue was recording with the band. She recorded a verse and backing vocals for the song \\"Devotion\\", which was to be included on the band's album. Hurts recorded a performance of Kylie's 1994 hit \\"Confide In Me\\" for newspaper The Suns website, and has since been a regular inclusion on their gig setlists. Kylie later returned the compliment by recording a performance of \\"Wonderful Life\\" in Radio 1's Live Lounge. Hurts' debut album Happiness was released in September 2010, reaching the Top 10 in 12 European countries and selling over 1 million copies worldwide. Hurts have also sold more than 1 million singles worldwide.

During his tenure, Odawara suffered from repeated natural disasters, including the earthquakes and fires which destroyed Odawara Castle and much of the surrounding Odawara-juku. Inclement weather led to crop failures, including the Great Tenmei Famine, which severely curtailed traffic on the T≈çkaid≈ç highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. As one of the major post stations on the T≈çkaid≈ç, this created an economic crisis for the town residents. Although Tadaaki responded with the usual restrictions on spending in an effort to economize of the domain's tax revenues, his efforts were undermined by rampant inflation, and demands from the Tokugawa shogunate to strength coastal defenses against possible incursions of foreign vessels. He retired from public life in 1796 with these issues unresolved and died in 1803. Takaaki was married to a daughter of Nakagawa Hisasada, daimy≈ç of Oka Domain in Bungo Province.

Before the Meiji Restoration, his courtesy title was Kaga no Kami. Biography ≈åkubo Tadanori was the nephew of Tokugawa Nariaki, which made him a cousin to Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu. He was born as the 5th son of Matsudaira Yorihiro, daimy≈ç of Takamatsu Domain, in Sanuki Province. On the death of former daimy≈ç of Odawara, ≈åkubo Tadanao in 1859 he was adopted into the ≈åkubo clan as 11th clan head, and by default, daimy≈ç of Odawara Domain. He served in a number of posts within the administration of the Tokugawa shogunate, including that of S≈çshaban (Master of Ceremonies) in November 1863, and accompanied Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemochi on his visit to Kyoto in 1864. He was briefly appointed K≈çfu j≈çdai from September to December 1867. During the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, he permitted the pro-Imperial forces of the Satch≈ç Alliance to cross Hakone Pass without opposition. However, in May 1868 he met with Hayashi Tadataka and other members of the pro-Tokugawa resistance and indicated his willingness to support their cause. With the fall of Edo to the Satch≈ç Alliance, he changed sides again, and met with the leaders of the Satch≈ç Alliance in Edo to plead his case. Considered a traitor to the imperial cause, he was ordered to retire from public life, and his titles were transferred to ≈åkubo Tadayoshi, daimy≈ç of Ogino-Yamanaka Domain, a cadet house of the Odawara Domain. In July 1875, when Tadayoshi retired from public life, Tadanori returned to the leadership of the ≈åkubo clan. In 1884, with the establishment of the kazoku peerage system, he was made a viscount (shishaku). He died on August 10, 1897 and his grave is at the clan temple of Saisho-ji in Setagaya, Tokyo.

One of the most controversial games in Australian rules football history, the match was declared no result and the premiership was withheld after fans invaded the field and eventually took down the goal posts, preventing North Hobart full- forward David Collins from taking a kick after the siren which would likely have won or tied the game for the Robins. Tasmanian State Premiership The Tasmanian State Premiership was a competition played most years from 1909 until 1978 between the individual premiers of Tasmania's two or three major football leagues: the Hobart-based Tasmanian Football League (TFL/TANFL); the Launceston-based Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA); and (after 1950) the North West Football Union (NWFU), based on the north-western coast of the state. From 1950, one of the three leagues would qualify directly for and host the Premiership Final, while the premiers from the other two leagues would play-off in a Preliminary Final for the right to contest the Premiership. Lead-up It was the NWFU's year to host the final, so the coastal premiers, the Wynyard Cats, qualified directly. After the disappointment of being eliminated in the 1966 coastal preliminary final after finishing the regular season as the Minor Premiers,The Mercury, \\"Football Details\\", 22 August 1966 and 12 September 1966 Wynyard dominated the 1967 season. The Cats finished with a 17‚Äì1 record, with their only loss coming against Ulverstone by eight points, and they finished six wins ahead of the other three finalists: Burnie, Ulverstone and Cooee.The Mercury, \\"Football Details\\", 28 August 1967 They beat Burnie by 58 points in the second semi- final,The Mercury, \\"Football Details\\", 11 September 1967 and then won the Grand Final against Cooee by 36 points.The Mercury, \\"Football Details\\", 25 September 1967 It was Wynyard's second ever NWFU premiership, and the first time since 1957 that the flag had been won by any team other than the two Burnie-based sides (Burnie and Cooee).Devaney, J., 2009, Full Points Footy's Tasmanian Football Companion\\", John Devaney & Full Points Publications. North Hobart, then known as the Robins, had finished last in the TANFL in 1966 with a record of 2-16. They had recruited John Devine from the Geelong Football Club in the VFL to serve as playing coach, but the team initially continued to languish as Devine served a suspension carried over from his final VFL match.Welsh, K., The Mercury, \\"Robins are premiers ‚Äì because they wanted that ball\\", 18 September 1967 The Robins sat last with a record of 1-6-1 after eight weeks, but then turned their form around, winning nine of their remaining eleven games to finish fourth on the TANFL ladder.The Mercury, \\"Football Details\\", 21 August 1967 In the finals, they improved this record to twelve wins from fourteen games with a 5-point win over New Norfolk in the first semi-final, a 9-point win over Clarence in the southern preliminary final,The Mercury, \\"Football Details\\", 13 September 1967 and a 15-point win over Minor Premiers Glenorchy in the TANFL Grand Final. It was North Hobart's 21st TANFL premiership, and the first time a club had come from fourth on the ladder to win the flag. In the State Preliminary Final at North Hobart Oval, the Robins hosted first-time NFTA Premiers, East Launceston (who had also come from last place in 1966 to win their flagCullen, J., The Mercury, \\"East made history with first title\\", 18 September 1967), and were comfortable winners by 51 points. Wynyard had never previously contested the State Premiership, while it was North Hobart's eighteenth appearance in the State Premiership Final, with the club attempting to win its twelfth title, and first since 1962.Devaney, J., Tasmanian State Premiership , Retrieved 9 October 2010. The match was umpired by Jack Pilgrim from the NTFA, the neutral league. Pilgrim had umpired the TANFL preliminary and grand finals.Launceston Examiner, \\"No State final replay\\", 3 October 1967 The match was played at West Park Oval in Burnie, 16 km east of Wynyard. The Game=First quarter North Hobart won the toss kicked to the eastern end of the ground.Stokes, R., The Mercury, \\"Tremendous match ended in fiasco\\", 2 October 1967 With the aid of a westerly wind, North Hobart was the dominant team in general play. The Robins managed eleven scoring shots to Wynyard's two, but led by only 19 points at quarter time, 3.8 (26) to 1.1 (7). Some credit for North Hobart's inaccuracy in front of goal is given to strong defensive work by Wynyard's Phillip Dell and David Cox. John Devine was instrumental as ruck-rover around the ground. Late in the quarter, the Cats finally managed a goal against the wind, courtesy of a downfield free kick to West.Leeson, A., The Advocate, article reproduced in: Devaney, J., 2009, Full Points Footy's Tasmanian Football Companion, John Devaney & Full Points Publications, pp. 67‚Äì68. Second quarter Kicking with the aid of the wind, Wynyard dominated the second quarter. They had scored a goal within the first minute of play, and had overcome their quarter- time deficit after only seven minutes. Wynyard's Leon Clarke started to control the ruck contests after a relatively even battle with his North Hobart opponents in the first quarter, while the forward-line combination of West and captain-coach John Coughlan was dominant. North Hobart, goalless for almost the entire quarter into the wind, managed two late goals, including one by Devine after the half time siren, to bring the margin back to 20 points,. Overall, Wynyard kicked 8.6 (54) to North Hobart's 2.3 (15) in the quarter, to lead 9.7 (61) ‚Äì 5.11 (41) at half time. Third quarter Kicking with the wind in the third quarter, North Hobart took full advantage. After an early goal to Wynyard, the Robins dominated and regained the lead after fifteen minutes. Devine continued to find himself in open space around the ground, and was very damaging, scoring two goals himself and assisting on three more for the quarter. Dell and Cox were again good in defence for Wynyard ‚Äì although the Cats twice conceded bouncing goals after leaving the goal square unguarded. North Hobart scored 6.6 (42) to Wynyard's 1.2 (8) in the third quarter, and led by 14 points at three-quarter time: 11.17 (83) to 10.9 (69). Through the third quarter and into the final quarter, the game began to be marred by some violent clashes off the ball by both sides. Wynyard rover Kevin King in particular was forced to endure substantial scragging, and the media reported that more than six players were king-hit behind play.Walkley, B., Launceston Examiner, \\"Match out of control even before the riot\\", 2 October 2010. Fourth quarter The strong wind, which to this stage had seen 17.20 (122) of a total 21.26 (152) kicked to the eastern end of the ground, had waned, and proved less of an advantage to Wynyard in the final quarter. Two early goals in two minutes saw Wynyard close the margin to less than a goal. Devine scored his fifth goal, spectacularly stealing the ball away from Dell as he juggled a mark at full back. Wynyard continued to attack, and after two consecutive behinds, West scored his sixth goal in the 20th minute to tie the game at 90‚Äì90. No further goals were scored: Atkins managed a behind to put the Cats ahead, the Robins rushed a behind to tie the game again, and Templar scored a behind in the 29th minute to put the Cats ahead 92‚Äì91. In the final minute of the game, Templar conceded a holding-the-man free kick to Devine 30 yards from goal; Devine's kick into the wind fell short, setting up the controversial finish. The Finish=Collins' mark and the final siren As Devine's kick fell short, a mark was taken in front of a pack by North Hobart full forward David \\"Dickie\\" Collins near the tip of the goal square, between 10‚Äì20 yards from goal on a slight angle; and, the final siren sounded.Welsh, K., The Mercury, \\"Before siren\\", 2 October 1967 The order of these two events is a point of contention, but according to umpire Pilgrim ‚Äì whose decision, by the rules of the game, is final in such cases ‚Äì Collins did take his mark before the final siren, permitting him to take a kick after the siren to win the game.The Mercury, \\"Decision today on title issue\\", 2 October 1967. Collins was reported in the media to have said that he believed he had taken the mark before he heard the siren, while Wynyard captain-coach John Coughlan said that he had heard the siren and seen Pilgrim raise his arms to signal the end of the game before the mark was taken, and he therefore believed the game was now over and that Wynyard had won the premiership by a point. A Wynyard player knocked the ball from Collins' hands shortly after the mark was taken, and Pilgrim awarded a 15-yard penalty to Collins.The Mercury, \\"Umpire not to blame\\", 3 October 1967. It is unclear whether this incident happened before or after Pilgrim heard and acknowledged the siren. Pitch invasion As Wynyard players argued with Pilgrim about whether or not the mark was legitimate, Wynyard fans streamed onto the ground and occupied the western end, surrounding Collins and other players. It is estimated that more than 3,000 of the game's 8,289 attendees were involved in the invasion.Walkley, B., Launceston Examiner, \\"Will Collins get chance to kick that goal?\\", 2 October 1967. North Hobart captain-coach John Devine specifically instructed Collins not to take his kick until a space had been cleared around him. Umpires, players, team officials, trainers and police did their best to clear a pathway for Collins to take his kick, and after several minutes, they did succeed temporarily; however, Pilgrim did not allow Collins to take his kick at this time because he was not on the correct line with the goal.Cullen, J., The Mercury, \\"Mark before the siren ‚Äì umpire\\", 2 October 1967. The crowd again converged on Collins before he could correct his line, and the opportunity was lost. By this stage, the pitch invasion was riotous, with many punches thrown, and umpires, players, team officials, and police were now tasked with restoring order, particularly after Collins' teammate Barry Styles was knocked to the ground and trampled; he was left unconscious with broken fingers and had to be carried from the field on a stretcher. It was at this stage of the pitch invasion that Wynyard fans pulled down the goal posts at the western end of the ground, the famous scene from which this game earned its nickname, \\"the Goalpost Final\\". Pilgrim abandoned the game and left the ground under police protection after he saw that the goalposts had been taken down, making Collins' kick impossible. The last remaining players left the arena shortly afterwards, and Collins, who still had the ball tucked under his guernsey, was the last player to leave the arena, about ten minutes after Pilgrim and under police protection. With all players and officials off the ground, still nobody knew for sure who had won the game. Pilgrim and Collins would later be driven from the ground in police cars for their protection. Aftermath=Game declared no-decision Half an hour after players had left the arena, match manager Jack Leary made the following announcement to the thousands of fans still awaiting an outcome, on behalf of the members of the T.F.L. Standing Committee who were present on the day: At this stage, only the match had been declared no-decision. The Standing Committee had not yet determined what steps, if any, would be taken to decide the premiership. Premiership declared no-decision The TFL Standing Committee met on the night of Monday 2 October to make a ruling on the premiership. A full replay of the state final at a neutral venue (namely York Park in Launceston) was a potential solution, and each club was approached for its opinion. Wynyard was in favour of a replay match; on 2 October, they were quoted as being satisfied with a game at a neutral venue, but with a different umpire, suggesting a high calibre umpire be brought from Victoria to officiate; the following day, Wynyard instead said it would be happy for Pilgrim to umpire any replay, but that the game should again be played in Burnie. North Hobart, on the other hand, was opposed to playing a replay, stating that the club had fulfilled its obligations to the league for the season,The Mercury, \\"Wynyard irate at decision\\", 3 October 1967 and that to replay the game would vindicate the riotous behaviour of the north-western crowd. Another option available to the committee was to have allowed Collins to take his potential game-winning kick at a later date. Although the modern laws of the game allow a match to be abandoned after a delay of thirty minutes, this provision was not included in the laws of 1967. Collins himself said that he was surprised that he was not allowed to return to take his kick the following day. The committee could also have chosen to overturn Pilgrim's decision to pay the mark to Collins, and then awarded the game to Wynyard at the score 13.14 (92) to 12.19 (91), if it was sufficiently convinced that Pilgrim had erred in his judgement that the mark was taken before the siren. Such a decision would not have been without high-level precedent ‚Äì most notably, the result of the 1907 WAFL Premiership was overturned after a successful protest that a free kick was paid after the half-time siren rather than before itDevaney, J., 1907 WAFL Grand Final: Perth vs East Fremantle; A Premiership on Protest , Retrieved 26 October 2010 ‚Äì but such protests were rare beyond the early years of the 20th century. After its meeting, the Standing Committee agreed to uphold the declaration of no- decision for the game, upheld umpire Pilgrim's assessment that Collins' mark was taken before the final siren, and recommended that the match should not be replayed and that the state premiership should not be awarded. Wynyard was critical of the decision, stating that the committee's ruling was weak, and that a replay should have been recommended. Wynyard also suggested that North Hobart's opposition to replaying the game should have been interpreted as forfeiture.The Mercury, \\"Taken after siren, says Coughlan ‚Äì willing to play again\\", 3 October 1967 At a meeting on the night of 3 October, the TANFL officially agreed with the Standing Committee's recommendation. This ended any possibility for a replay, and officially left the 1967 State Premiership unawarded.The Mercury, \\"No replay decision confirmed\\", 4 October 2010. In some sporting codes, spectator interference (as was held in this case for removal of the goalposts) is legal grounds for officials to charge Wynyard with spectator interference and a forfeit, awarding the match to North Hobart. General aftermath Police superintendent Mackey, who had been watching the game off-duty but became involved in the peace-keeping efforts, stated that the crowd's behaviour was \\"disgraceful\\". Wynyard was critical of umpire Pilgrim's performance, blaming his failure to control the on-field violence, which grew throughout the second half, as a contributing factor to the pitch invasion and the rioting. The NFTA was complimentary of Pilgrim's performance in a difficult situation, and criticised the coastal supporters for their conduct. North Hobart blamed the Wynyard players, rather than the crowd, for inciting the pitch invasion indirectly through their remonstration with Pilgrim after Collins' mark. The goalposts themselves were left on the ground in front of the grandstand after the pitch invasion. A group of North Hobart fans returned during the night and tried to take one of the posts home to Hobart with them, but police retrieved it before their train left Burnie.Launceston Examiner, \\"He's got his own posts!\\", 2 October 1967 David Collins returned home to find that friends had erected a set of goal posts, decorated in Robins' colours, in his front yard. Collins left West Park Oval with the match ball under his guernsey, and is reported to have still have the ball in his possession. Precedent and legacy A semi-final between and in the 1920 Victorian Football Association season ended in near identical circumstances, with Considine prevented from taking a 30-yard kick after the final bell which could have won the game for North Melbourne. That match was also declared no result, and a replay was held the following week. The game was one of the moments depicted in The Game That Made Australia, a painting by Jamie Cooper which was commissioned for the sport's 150-year anniversary celebrations in 2008. It shows two fans from each club watching on from a suburban style scoreboard bearing the unofficial final score, while two Wynyard fans sneak in front of them carrying a goalpost.Australian Football League The Game That Made Australia painting, retrieved 19 September 2010. Unusually for the painting, the depiction is an idealised representation of the event, rather than being painted directly from an image of the moment. The crowd in the act of rioting and removing the goalpost is also a background feature in Cooper's Tasmania's Team of the Century painting.JCAP, Tasmania's Team of the Century, retrieved 25 September 2010 The match has been inducted as a Great Match in the Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame.

However, the history and early lineage of Togakure-ry≈´ may be impossible to verify due to the antiquity of the time period and its claimed historicity has been disputed by Watatani Kiyoshi, writer for the Bugei Ry≈´ha Daijiten. After Togakure, the title of S≈çke (head of school) was recorded by Toda Shinryuken Masamitsu to have been passed down through other practitioners that kept the style secret from the outside world. Toshitsugu Takamatsu is the recorded 33rd S≈çke of this school. According to Bujinkan sources he became well-known throughout China and Japan for his martial arts prowess and his knowledge from studying ninjutsu that he then imparted on various Chinese nobles. Takamatsu passed the title of S≈çke to Masaaki Hatsumi, the recorded 34th S≈çke; it was Hatsumi who largely brought the style to public attention, and subsequently resulted in wide-scale media and public attention given to ninja and ninjutsu in the Western world. Hatsumi recently passed on the school to Takumi Tsutsui. The style of Togakure-ry≈´ has been described by its practitioners as having less-restrictive training regimens, which encourage individual personal training. One of the main goals of the training is to develop shin shin shingan () so that they can learn to properly know their opponents and defend themselves. The Bugei Ry≈´ha Daijiten has claimed that embellishments were made to the history of the Togakure-ryu, changing the age of things to make the school appear older than it is. This was not uncommon in many Japanese lineages. History According to Bujinkan researcher Glenn Morris, Togakure- ryu originated in the Mie Prefecture with its creator, Daisuke Nishina. Morris explains that it was started in 1162, as a way of fighting in the war between the Genji and Heike (Taira) clans. The style itself would go on to be known as the origin of ninjutsu and its various fighting styles. Nishina was a samurai and a member of the Genji clan, which had been staging a revolt against the Heike clan because of their oppression against the Genji people. The revolt, however, was crushed and Nishina fled his home village of Togakure in Shinano Province to save his children. Hatsumi Masaaki indicates that Nishina then changed his name to Togakure to reflect where he had come from and settled in the forests on the Kii Peninsula in the Iga Province. This account claims that it was there that Nishina met Kain D≈çshi, a warrior-monk who had been politically exiled from China. From Kain, Togakure learned the fighting styles of China and Tibet and put aside his samurai code (bushid≈ç). Hatsumi has stated that Togakure's first successor was his son, Rokosuke, and that Togakure also trained a deshi () called Shima, who would become the third master of the style after Rokosuke. According to Hatsumi, since historical times, the Togakure-ry≈´ style was passed down through the years until mastership was granted to Shinryuken Toda, the 32nd S≈çke of Togakure-ry≈´. He began teaching the style to his grandson, Toshitsugu Takamatsu, since Takamatsu was five in 1893. When he turned 19, Takamatsu was announced as the next successor of the Togakure-ry≈´ style, becoming the 33rd S≈çke. After this pronouncement, Takamatsu decided to spend a year meditating in the \\"mountains between Kyoto and Nara\\". Upon his return, he set out again, this time to China where he spent time in the courts of nobles as an important adviser because of his extensive knowledge from his ninja training. It is stated by Hatsumi that because of a series of incidents that occurred throughout China, Takamatsu became infamous throughout the region by the age of 25. When he turned 28, he was elected as the \\"Head of Japanese martial arts in China\\". Bujinkan sources indicate that Takamatsu became known throughout China and Japan for his martial-arts abilities and from his ninjutsu knowledge that he imparted to various Chinese nobles. Passing on the title of S≈çke to Masaaki Hatsumi (the stated 34th S≈çke) it was Hatsumi who took the style public, which has resulted in the high amount of media and public attention on ninjas in the Western world. Masaaki also went on to found the Bujinkan, an international martial arts organization, in Noda, Chiba. The group combines modern Togakure-ry≈´ and the eight other martial-arts styles. As of 1986, there were 20 dojos for Togakure-ry≈´ in Japan that housed 100 instructors and around 100,000 students. There were also around 50 international dojos teaching Togakure-ry≈´ outside Japan. Lineage As stated by the Bujinkan organization, the lineage in the line of S≈çke (grand masters) of Togakure-ry≈´, beginning with Daisuke Togakure, is as follows: # Daisuke Togakure (1162) # Shima Kosanta Minamoto no Kanesada (1180) # Goro Togakure (1200) # Kosanta Togakure # Kisanta Koga # Tomoharu Kaneko # Ryuho Togakure # Gakuun Togakure # Koseki Kido # Tenryu Iga # Rihei Ueno # Senri Ueno # Majiro Ueno # Saburo Iisuka # Goro Sawada # Ippei Ozaru # Hachiro Kimata # Heizaemon Kataoka # Ugenta Mori # Gobei Toda # Seiun Kobe # Kobei Momochi # Tenzen Tobari # Seiryu Nobutsuna Toda (1624‚Äì1658) # Fudo Nobuchika Toda (1658‚Äì1681) # Kangoro Nobuyasu Toda (1681‚Äì1704) # Eisaburo Nobumasa Toda (1704‚Äì1711) # Shinbei Masachika Toda (1711‚Äì1736) # Shingoro Masayoshi Toda (1736‚Äì1764) # Daigoro Chikahide Toda (1764‚Äì1804) # Daisaburo Chikashige Toda (1804) # Shinryuken Masamitsu Toda (born 1824 ‚Äì died 1909) # Toshitsugu Takamatsu (born 1887 ‚Äì died 1972) # Masaaki Hatsumi (born 1931) # Takumi Tsutsui (born 1964) Style As a ninjutsu tradition influenced by the samurai martial arts of the Sengoku period, the style of Togakure-ry≈´ consists of a small number of physical escape and evasion techniques, called ninpo taijutsu, and a series of sword attack patterns, or biken kata. However, the majority of the art involves techniques of geography, meteorology, swimming, signaling, potion-making, fire-starting, concentration, disguise, impersonation, and other forms of knowledge suited for the unique information- gathering and infiltration roles of ninja. Togakure-ry≈´'s ninpo taijutsu is described as being \\"fundamentally different\\" from other styles of Japanese martial arts that are currently taught. This is largely because, unlike these other styles, Togakure-ry≈´ does not have a \\"tightly regimated [sic] organizational structure.\\" The Bujinkan teaches that while Togakure-ry≈´ contains some \\"historical kata\\", which are similar to the training in judo and aikido in that they require an opponent to attack and initiate the movements. Much of the \\"formality\\" that other styles contain is not present in modern Togakure-ry≈´. Stephen K. Hayes explained that it is likely this \\"freer, more flexible structure\\" that makes it different, as the style has an atmosphere where \\"questions are encouraged, but there isn't one part answer for every question.\\" Modern Togakure-ry≈´ resembles other martial-arts in the \\"footwork and dynamics\\" that all styles utilize because of the nature of human movement. Hayes stated that a main goal of the style is shin shin shin gan (), which refers to the \\"development of a broad vision or knowledge\\" to anticipate the moves that an opponent will make and to also be able to sense danger. Weapons The Bujinkan organization teaches that the original Togakure-ry≈´ utilized many special weapons. One was the shuko, which is a \\"spiked iron band worn around the hand\\". It enabled the wearer to use it as a defense against sword attacks and also to reach higher terrain, as it could be used to climb trees or walls, especially when worn with similar devices for the feet called ashiko. Additionally, the tetsubishi (a type of caltrop) was a \\"small spiked weapon used to slow pursuers or protect doorways\\". The third was the kyoketsu- shoge, a blade from a double-bladed spear that was tied to a length of rope with an iron ring at the other end for the wielder to hold. In addition to use as a weapon, it could be used to \\"wedge open a door, climb into a tree or over a wall, or tie up an opponent\\". Training areas There are 18 training areas that modern Togakure-ry≈´ focuses on. The areas are constantly updated to remain relevant to modern threats that practitioners will need to face. The Togakure ryu Ninjutsu Hidensho is a Japanese manuscript written by Takamatsu, in the possession of Masaaki Hatsumi, that documents modern Togakure-ry≈´. The document is purported to contain the origin of the \\"18 Skills of Ninjutsu\\". Modern Togakure-ryu is taught in the syllabi of the Bujinkan, Genbukan, Jinenkan, Gi Yu Kyo Kai, and To-Shin Do. The training areas include: * Seishin teki kyoyo (spiritual refinement) * Tai jutsu (unarmed combat) * Kenjutsu (sword techniques) * Bo-jutsu (stick and staff fighting) * Shuriken-jutsu (throwing blades) * Yari-jutsu (spear fighting) * Naginata-jutsu (halberd fighting) * Kusari-gama (chain and sickle weapon) * Kayaku-jutsu (fire and explosives) * Henso-jutsu (disguise and impersonation) * Shinobi-iri (stealth and entering methods) * Ba-jutsu (horsemanship) * Sui-ren (water training) * Bo-ryaku (strategy) * Ch≈çh≈ç (espionage) * Intonjutsu (escape and concealment) * Ten-mon (meteorology) * Chi-mon (geography) Criticism of historical claims Modern Togakure-ryu and various historical claims are taught by Masaaki Hatsumi (Takamatsu's successor) and the Bujinkan organization. Criticism regarding the historical accuracy of the Bujinkan's claims of lineage have arisen from several issues of the Bugei Ry≈´ha Daijiten: * The 1978 version of the Bugei Ry≈´ha Daijiten states that Takamatsu's Togakure-ryu \\"genealogy includes embellishments by referring to data and kuden about persons whose existence is based on written materials and traditions in order to appear older than it actually is.\\" * The 1969 version of the Bugei Ry≈´ha Daijiten states that Takamatsu's Togakure-ryu \\"is a genealogy newly put together by Takamatsu Toshitsugu, who made use of (took advantage of) the popularity of written materials on ninjutsu after the Taish≈ç era\\" and that \\"there are many points where it has added embellishments, it has made people whose real existence is based on written records older than is actually the case, and so it is a product of very considerable labor\\". * The 1963 version of the Bugei Ry≈´ha Daijiten states of Takamatsu's Togakure-ryu \\"this genealogy refers to various written records and oral transmissions and there are many points/places where embellishments have been added and people appearing in the genealogy are also made older than they actually are\\".

Population pyramid of the Czech Republic in 2007. \\"Hus√°k's Children\\" represent the most populous category. Hus√°k's Children (in Czech: Hus√°kovy dƒõti, in Slovak: Hus√°kove deti) is a term commonly used for a generation of people born in Czechoslovakia during the baby boom which started in the early 1970s, during the period of \\"normalization\\". The generation was named after the President and a long-term Communist leader of Czechoslovakia, Gust√°v Hus√°k.Roberts (2005), p. 61  State pro-population policy in the 1970s  The most significant post-war baby boom in Czechoslovakia culminated in 1974. After the events of the Prague Spring in 1968 and subsequent restoration of the conditions prevailing before the reform period, many Czechoslovaks resigned themselves to their fate and became unconcerned with the political situation in the country. In reaction, the Czechoslovak communist r√©gime came with its own version of Goulash Communism, presented in a new concept: the state pro-population policy. The duration of maternity leave was extended, the child allowance increased, and newlyweds were subsidized with attractive state loans. However, the \\"generous\\" state policy soon reached its limits. In the late 1970s, the state finance reserves intended for the support of the pro-population policy were limited and the baby boom ended. The influence of the state pro-population policy has been questioned in the past. The population growth began to increase in 1969. The state financial subsidy was approved in 1973 and the baby boom culminated in 1974. After the initial sharp increase, the birth rate began to decline. The roots of the unusual population explosion could be associated with the post-war period rather than the \\"social engineering\\" of the communist regime.  21st century  As of the 00s, the generation of Hus√°k's children represent an important element of Czech society. The 1970s generation of baby boomers caused another significant population increase in the later years of the aughts. Hus√°k's children also became a target of a marketing and economic \\"retro-invasion\\" on the Czech market. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, following a period of fascination with almost any Western product, Czech society gradually turned its attention back to the traditional Czech brands. The marketing campaigns of the companies began to focus on the productive generation and its nostalgia for its childhood. Retro designs of products and brands known in the 1970s and 1980s appeared on the Czech market once again.

In conjunction with the existing Advanced Access Content System (AACS) digital rights management (DRM) inclusion of Cinavia watermarking detection support became mandatory for all consumer Blu-ray Disc players from 2012. The watermarking and steganography facility provided by Cinavia is designed to stay within the audio signal and to survive all common forms of audio transfer, including lossy data compression using discrete cosine transform, MP3, DTS, or Ogg Vorbis. It is designed to survive digital and analog sound recording and reproduction via microphones, direct audio connections and broadcasting, and does so by using audio frequencies within the hearing range. It is monaural and not a multichannel codec. Cinavia's in-band signaling introduces intentional spread spectrum phase distortion in the frequency domain of each individual audio channel separately, giving a per-channel digital signal that can yield up to around 0.2 bits per secondNote: Cinavia's experimental patents make reference to up to 20 kilobits per second, but with high psychoacoustic perceptibility. The Cinavia de facto standard as implemented in the Blu-ray Disc standards uses 3 bits per 15 seconds.‚Äîdepending on the quantization level available, and the desired trade-off between the required robustness and acceptable levels of psychoacoustic perceptibility. It is intended to survive analog distortions such as the wow and flutter and amplitude modulation from magnetic tape sound recording. On playback, no additional audio filters are used to cover up the distortions and discontinuities introduced. The signal survives temporal masking and sub-band coding by operating on the fundamental frequency and its subharmonic overtones, and by dealigning the phase relationship between the strongest signal and its subharmonics. Each phase discontinuity introduced by the encoder will result in a corresponding pulse of wideband white noise, so a further range of additional distortions are introduced as a noise mitigation strategy to compensate. The desired hidden digital data signal is combined in the distortion step using a pre-determined pseudorandom binary sequence for audio frame synchronization and large amounts of forward error correction for the hidden data to be embedded. The watermark is only embedded when certain signal-to-noise ratio thresholds are met and is not available as a continuous signal‚Äîthe signal must be monitored for a period of time before the embedded data can be detected and recovered. Extraction of the hidden signal is not exact but is based on recovering the convolutional codes through statistical cross-correlation. The Blu-ray Disc implementation of Cinavia is designed to cover two use-cases: the first is the provision of a Cinavia watermark on all movie theater soundtracks released via film distribution networks; the second use-case is for the provision of a Cinavia watermark on all Blu-ray Disc releases that points to the presence of an accompanying AACS key. If a \\"theatrical release\\" watermark is detected in a consumer Blu-ray Disc audio track, the accompanying video is deemed to have been sourced from a \\"cam\\" recording. If the \\"AACS watermark\\" is present in the audio tracks, but no accompanying and matching AACS key is found on the disc, then it is deemed to have been a \\"rip\\" made by copying to a second blank Blu- ray Disc. , known hardware players which can detect Cinavia watermarks include the PlayStation 3 (began with v3.10 System Software), as well as newer Blu-ray Disc players. Overview Cinavia works to prevent copying via the detection of a watermark recorded into the analog audio of media such as theatrical films and Blu-ray Discs. The intent is to prevent all copying, both counterfeit copies and legal copies of one's own content (for example, format shifting). Verance claims on their website that, while the watermark is able to survive recording through microphones (such as recording a film in a movie theater with a camcorder), as well as compression and encoding, it is imperceptible to human hearing, as well as that the presence of the watermark does not affect audio quality. When media with the watermark is played back on a system with Cinavia detection, its firmware will detect the watermark and check that the device on which it is being played is authorized for that watermark. If the device is not authorized (such as not being an authorized movie projector in the case of a cam bootleg, or not utilizing AACS in the case of a copy of a commercial Blu-ray Disc or CSS in the case of a copy of a commercial DVD), a message is displayed (either immediately or after a set duration) stating that the media is not authorized for playback on the device and that users should visit the Cinavia web page for more information. Depending on the device and firmware, once the message is triggered, the audio may be muted, or playback may stop entirely. Messages Following an intervention by the Cinavia+AACS system, one of four messages is displayed to reflect the specific situation in which a watermark was detected. The messages are numbered \\"Cinavia message code 1‚Äì4\\", allowing the messages themselves to be easily translated for consumers in different languages: # Message Code 1: Playback stopped‚ÄîShown when theatre- or hotel-distributed audio content is being played back on a consumer playback device. # Message Code 2: Copying stopped‚ÄîShown when theatre- or hotel-distributed audio content is being recorded by a consumer recording device. # Message Code 3: Audio muted‚ÄîShown when consumer-sold audio content is being played back from an optical disc, without the matching AACS key present at the centre of the disc. # Message Code 4: Copying stopped‚ÄîShown when consumer-sold audio content is being recorded by a consumer recording device. Licensing For Cinavia the owners Verance make their money through licensing agreements with several sections of the entertainment and media industry. these licence costs due to Verance were $10,000‚Äì$300,000 per manufacturer of Blu-ray Disc players‚Äîfor the rights to embed the Cinavia detection system‚Äîplus additional software costs for the implementation itself. Production facilities need to pay $50 for each audio track that is watermarked with Cinavia. Distribution houses must finally pay $0.04 per disc with Cinavia watermarked content included. Technical aspects Verance claims Cinavia has the following features: * Only a single channel of audio is required to detect the watermark. * The watermark is able to survive re-recording through a microphone. * The watermark can be detected through \\"the production, duplication, distribution, broadcast, and consumer handling of recorded content\\". (In the white paper for their DVD-Audio Detector Compliance Verification Suite all tests are single-channel files.) * Different copies of otherwise identical works can be distinguished. DVD- Audio The data throughput for a watermarking system used for DVD-Audio requirement is for \\"Watermark Output: 3 water-mark data bits per 15 seconds (2 CCI bits and 1 SDMI Trigger Bit)\\". The two CCI bits in the example contain Digital Copy Control Information, while the succession of SDMI bits contains Secure Digital Music Initiative data when reconstructed. Also in the Compliance Verification Suite the lowest sample rate test is at 16,000 samples per second with 16 bits per sample. This could indicate that the bandwidth requirements top out at 8 kHz. History On 5 June 2009, the licensing agreements for AACS were finalized, which were updated to make Cinavia detection on commercial Blu-ray Disc players a requirement. On 3 July 2009, Maxim Anisiutkin published an open source DVD Audio watermark detector and neutralizer computer program to the SourceForge web site. The software package contains a detailed description of the method and embedding parameters used in creating the DVD Audio or SDMI (Secure Digital Music Initiative) watermark, which was created by Verance Inc and was the earlier version of the Cinavia watermarking technology. From January 2013 onwards, attempts were made by third-party software suppliers to make use of existing bugs and loopholes in Blu-ray Disc players to avoid Cinavia message triggering, but without any attempt being made at precisely removing the Cinavia signal from the audio. These attempts included iDeer Blu-ray Player, DVDFab and AnyDVD HD (version 7.3.1.0) which used workarounds to avoid Cinavia-enabled software Blu-ray Disc players from triggering Cinavia detection messages. In August 2013, DVD-Ranger released a white paper detailing their methods for detecting, and subsequently removing, the present Cinavia signal from audio files. The DVD-Ranger CinEx beta software synchronises and detects the Cinavia signal in the same way as a consumer Cinavia detection routine; these identified parts of the audio stream are permanently removed, removing the Cinavia signal. Post-processing can be used to try to \\"fill-in\\" the audible gaps created. There are claims that Cinavia can be removed using open source software like Audacity with an extracted audio file from a video source. The audio file is processed by decreasing pitch by 13%; the processed audio file is then merged back into the video source. This renders the Cinavia watermark unreadable, however the reduction in pitch can be easily noticed.

Ultimately he followed the career of a journalist in London. About 1803 he started The Traveller, a journal intended to represent the commercial travellers; it was one of the earliest of professional papers, but it \\"was much more than a class journal, being .... a bold advocate of political reforms. 'If it has not much wit or brilliancy', said a contemporary critic, 'it is distinguished by sound judgment, careful information, and constitutional principles‚Äù‚Äô (Fox Bourne, i. 288). As editor of the paper, Quin accepted some of the earliest of Leigh Hunt's essays. In 1823 The Traveller was merged in the Globe under the general title of The Globe and Traveller. Quin also owned and edited The Day until its amalgamation with the New Times. He was elected a common councilman for the ward of Farringdon Without in 1805, and enjoyed in the common council a reputation for eloquence. He died of apoplexy at Sheerness on 7 July 1823.

The Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Sch√§dlingsbek√§mpfung mbH (translation: German Corporation for Pest control), in short Degesch, was a German chemical corporation. Degesch produced pesticides used against weeds, rodents and insects. Degesch had the patent of the infamous Zyklon, a pesticide whose \\"Zyklon B\\" variant (without odor or irritant) was used to execute people in gas chambers of German extermination camps during the Holocaust. Through the firms Tesch & Stabenow GmbH (Testa) and Heerdt-Linger (Heli) Degesch sold the poisonous gas Zyklon B to the German Army and the Schutzstaffel (SS). Degesch was founded in 1919 as a subsidiary of Degussa. Its first director was chemistry Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. In 1936, Degussa and IG Farben each held 42.5% of the shares, while Th. Goldschmidt AG held the remaining 15%. During the years 1938 through 1943, Degesch was extremely profitable. For most of these years, IG Farben received dividends amounting to twice the value of their shares. After the Second World War Degesch continued production. In 1986 the company was sold to Detia Freyberg GmbH; the current name is Detia-Degesch GmbH.  Prosecution  During the IG Farben trial the director of Degesch, Gerhard Friedrich Peters, implicated himself.

Biography Banikanta Kakati was born in 1894 at Barpeta of Assam. He was the second son of his parents Lalitram Kakati and Lahobala. Kakati showed sign of his genius from his early childhood. In his school days he obtained 105 marks out of 100 in his Sanskrit answer book. It is also said that he could memorise the whole of PƒÅ·πáini in his school days. Kakati secured the highest position in English in Assam in his matriculation under the Calcutta University. 1913, he stood first amongst all the candidates in the intermediate from Cotton College, Guwahati under the Calcutta University. He took first M.A. degree in English Literature from Presidency College, Calcutta in 1918. Later on he secured the first class first position in M.A. in English Language group in 1923 from Calcutta University. Kakati joined Cotton College in 1918 as a professor of English until he became the principal of the College in 1947. He joined in Gauhati University in 1948 as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Head of the Department of Assamese. Kakati's health broke after the demise of his beloved wife Kanaklata in 1952 and died in the same year, on 15 November, the date of his birth. Literary career Soon after joining Cotton College as a lecturer in 1918, Banikanta Kakati took up the study of Srimanta Sankardeva and old Assamese literature. Soon, he was drawn into a controversy between two rival schools of Assam Vaishnavism. His erudite exposition of scriptural lore in the various issues of the Banhi under the pseudonym of Babananda Pathak, in defence of the values represented by the teachings of Sankardeva still makes fruitful reading. While studying MA examination in English, he obtained his doctorate for his thesis ‚Äì Assamese : Its Formation and Development in 1935. The publication of the thesis in 1941 was a god-send for the Assamese people who had been frantically struggling to establish the identity and provenance of their mother tongue. Kakati had to work far from the great centres of learning, in a place where even Leonard Bloomfields‚Äô Language (1833) could not be made available. Yet the work was acclaimed by no lesser an authority than Dr Emeneau who found it ‚Äòground-breaking in many ways.‚Äô His interest in language proliferated over the years, but meanwhile, his mind started straying into other fields and pastures new. He made an intensive study of the Kalita caste and incorporated his findings in Kalita Jatir Itibritta (1941), Mother Goddess Kamakhya (1948) deals with socio- religious issues prevalent in Ancient Kamarupa. Finally he turned his attention to Indian mythology and his Vaishnavite Myths and Legends has been acclaimed as 'one of the very few studies of the religious scene in India, produced by our scholars, that deserve reading and pondering over.' Dr Kakati was one of the greatest critics that the country has produced. His Purani Asomiya Sahitya provides the axes for the appreciation of Vaishnavite literature of medieval Assam. He was certainly the most capable interpreter of religious mysticism in the poetry of the Nam Ghosha. He also raised the perennial issue of a possible tension between poetry and belief. Himself a scion of the Romantic age, Kakati sketched the critical background for the twentieth century Assamese romantics. The post-war decade in Assam is a decade of disenchantment. In this decade he also wrote on the contemporary situation which seemed to show that a great age was over and another was yet to be born. He died too early to see the achievements of the ensuing age. Books Banikanta Kakati's writings both in English and Assamese mark a distinct achievement in the history of Assamese scholarship. As a critic of old and new literature in Assamese and as a writer on sociology and religious trends in medieval India-particularly Assam, he set new standards.

Kant thought that certain of his antinomies (God and Freedom) could be resolved as \\"Postulates of Practical Reason\\". He used them to describe the equally rational-but-contradictory results of applying the universe of pure thought to the categories or criteria, i.e. applying reason proper to the universe of sensible perception or experience (phenomena). Empirical reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which transcends it. Overview Kant's antinomies are four: two \\"mathematical\\" and two \\"dynamical\\". They are connected with (1) the limitation of the universe in respect of space and time, (2) the theory that the whole consists of indivisible atoms (whereas, in fact, none such exist), (3) the problem of free will in relation to universal causality, and (4) the existence of a necessary being.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th ed. (1911), Vol. 2. The first two antinomies are dubbed \\"mathematical\\" antinomies, presumably because in each case we are concerned with the relation between what are alleged to be sensible objects (either the world itself, or objects in it) and space and time. The second two are dubbed \\"dynamical\\" antinomies, presumably because the proponents of the thesis are not committing themselves solely to claims about spatio-temporal objects.S. Al-Azm, The Origins of Kant's Argument in the Antinomies, Oxford University Press 1972.M. Grier, Kant's Doctrine of Transcendental Illusion, Cambridge University Press 2001.M. Grier, \\"The Logic of Illusion and the Antinomies,\\" in Bird (ed.), Blackwell, Oxford 2006, pp. 192-207. Note: Kant himself did not use the plural term, \\"antinomies,\\" but only the singular term, \\"Antinomy,\\" as the logical status of a species of metaphysical argument. There is Antinomy, and Kant argued in detail regarding four cases of Antinomy in his Critique of Pure Reason (1780). The mathematical antinomies=The first antinomy (of space and time) *Thesis: **The world has a beginning in time, and is also limited as regards space. *Anti-thesis: **The world has no beginning, and no limits in space; it is infinite as regards both time and space. The second antinomy (of atomism) *Thesis: **Every composite substance in the world is made up of simple parts, and nothing anywhere exists save the simple or what is composed of the simple. *Anti-thesis: **No composite thing in the world is made up of simple parts, and there nowhere exists in the world anything simple. The dynamical antinomies=The third antinomy (of spontaneity and causal determinism) *Thesis: **Causality in accordance with laws of nature is not the only causality from which the appearances of the world can one and all be derived. To explain these appearances it is necessary to assume that there is also another causality, that of Spontaneity. *Anti-thesis: **There is no Spontaneity; everything in the world takes place solely in accordance with laws of nature. The fourth antinomy (of necessary being or not) *Thesis: **There belongs to the world, either as its part or as its cause, a being that is absolutely necessary. *Anti-thesis: **An absolutely necessary being nowhere exists in the world, nor does it exist outside the world as its cause.

(1908). Soziologie: Untersuchungen √ºber die Formen der Vergesellschaftung. Leipzig: Duncker & Humblot. There are three English translations of Exkurs √ºber den Fremden. The first appeared under the title ‚ÄúThe Sociological Significance of the ‚ÄòStranger‚Äô,‚Äù in Park, Robert E., and E. W. Burgess (1921). Introduction to the Science of Sociology. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, pp. 322‚Äì7. The second appeared in the fifth part of Kurt Wolff‚Äôs collection of Simmel‚Äôs texts (The Sociology of Georg Simmel. Translated and edited by Kurt H. Wolff. New York: The Free Press, 1950.) The third and most recent translation of the text was published in a collection edited by Donald Levine (‚ÄúThe Stranger.‚Äù In Georg Simmel: On Individuality and Social Forms, Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1971, pp. 143‚Äì50) In this essay, Simmel introduced the notion of \\"the stranger\\" as a unique sociological category. He differentiates the stranger both from the ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù who has no specific relation to a group and from the ‚Äúwanderer‚Äù who comes today and leaves tomorrow. The stranger, he says, comes today and stays tomorrow. The stranger is a member of the group in which he lives and participates and yet remains distant from other ‚Äì ‚Äúnative‚Äù ‚Äì members of the group. In comparison to other forms of social distance and difference (such as class, gender, and even ethnicity) the distance of the stranger has to do with his ‚Äúorigins.‚Äù The stranger is perceived as extraneous to the group and even though he is in constant relation to other group members; his ‚Äúdistance‚Äù is more emphasized than his ‚Äúnearness.‚Äù As one subsequent interpreter of the concept put it, the stranger is perceived as being in the group but not of the group.Wood, Margaret Mary. (1934). The Stranger: A Study in Social Relationships. New York: Columbia Univ. Press. In the excursus, Simmel briefly touches upon the consequences of occupying such a unique position for the stranger as well as the potential effects of the presence of the stranger on other group members. Most notably, Simmel suggests that because of their peculiar positions in the group, strangers often carry out special tasks that the other members of the group are either incapable or unwilling to carry out. For example, especially in pre-modern societies, most strangers were involved in trade activities.

Different kinds of ulos have different ceremonial significance. The ulos is normally worn draped over the shoulder or shoulders, or in weddings to ceremonially bind the bride and groom together. Ulos are traditionally hand woven and in the case of higher-quality examples are significant family heirlooms, to be worn at important events, such as funerals and weddings. With increasing modernisation has come the decline in significance of the ulos, with many varieties no longer in demand.http://www.antaranews.com/view/?i=1196433922&c;=SBH&s;= History According to the Batak people, there are three sources of warmth for humans; Sun, Fire and Ulos. Why is ulos a source of warmth? Ulos is said to be a source of warmth because they were living on cold mountains. This natural condition makes sunlight insufficient to give warmth especially at night. Then, they created something that is able to give them warmth, also believed to be able to give the men bravery and the women strength against infertility . At first, Ulos was only used as an ordinary cloth but it later developed to a symbol of love, traditional ceremony requirements, and society structural system symbol. Even today ulos is believed to have magical religious power and is thus considered 'sacred' and has special power to protect the user. There are many kinds and motifs of ulos, which have their own respective meaning in accordance to the characteristic, condition, function, and some relation. When it is used given to whom, and which traditional ceremony like wedding, birth, death and other rituals will never run without Ulos. If Ulos is used by a man, the upper part of it is called ande-ande, the lower called singkot, the one used on the head called tali-tali, or bulang-bulang. But, because of its sacred value, not all Ulos can be used in daily activities. Ulos Jugja, Sadum, Ragidup, and Runjat are only used in some occasions. In everyday life, men wear Ulos in box pattern with black shirt named baju Kurung without shoes nor sandals. Usage Toba Batak people performing a traditional dance, wearing ulos When ulos is used by a female, the bottom is called haen, the back is called hoba-hoba and if it used as s—Åarf it is called ampe-ampe. If used as head cover it is called saong, and if used to carry baby it is called parompa. In daily life, the females wear a black long dress and head cover. There are three ways to use Ulos. First, siabithononton, the Ulos used for this are Ragidup, Sibolang, Runjat, Djobit, Simarindjamisi, and Ragi Pangko. Second, sihadanghononton (used as head cover). The Ulos used for this are Sirara, Sumbat, Bolean, Mangiring, Surisuri and Sadum. Third, sitalitalihononton (tied at hip). Ulos used for this are Tumtuman, Mangiring and Padangrusa. Using Ulos in the right way is extremely important to make good looking and also to fulfill the philosophy meaning in Ulos. Ulos as love symbol is called mangulosi. In Batak culture, mangulosi (giving Ulos) is a symbol of love to the receiver. In mangulosi, there are common rules, mangulosi can only be done by people who have a family relation or to give it to lower social status people. For example, parents can mengulosi their children, but not opposite. To mangulosi a child who gives birth to their first child, the Ulos given is Ragidup Sinagok. Ulos given to a special guest is Ulos Ragidup Silingo. Production Ulos is made with a manual loom machine. A spinner (Sorha) is used to make cotton into yards. Pamanggung is used to tie yards. Pagabe to hold the yard. Baliga, used to organize yards. Hatalungan is used to separate yards. Pamapan used to make the yard into cloth. Palabuan (Periuk tanah) is used to saving coloring water. Ulos made of cotton and the coloring water made of barks, grass, roots, mud or leaves.

Its main gallery is located in Conwy and it has over a hundred members. Plas Mawr, Conwy Early history During the 19th century there were numerous attempts to establish an academy in Wales comparable to those already in existence in England, Scotland and Ireland.Davies (2008) p. 778 The Royal Cambrian Academy of Art was eventually founded in 1881, by a group of mainly English painters led by Henry Clarence Whaite, many of whom were now based in the Conwy Valley. Ever since political unrest had made the Grand Tour hazardous for travellers, the wilds of North Wales became a fashionable alternative for English artists, in particular the area around Betws-y-Coed which attracted the likes of David Cox. The coming of the railways later aided artists from Liverpool and Manchester in transporting their art materials to Wales. These artists arranged to meet a group of like-minded Welsh artists at Llandudno Junction, and from this meeting a group was formed called the Cambrian Academy of Art. Although they had no permanent gallery, they circulated their prospectus to other artists in Wales and their numbers began to grow. Initially they only exhibited their work in north Wales, but they later extended membership to the south of the country. The Academy's rapid growth was recognised the year after its formation, when in 1882 Queen Victoria commanded that it should be styled the 'Royal' Cambrian Academy of Art. Originally based in Llandudno, where there were already a number of commercial art galleries in the town, catering for the growing tourist trade, the academy later moved its operations to Plas Mawr in Conwy. Plas Mawr, an Elizabethan town house which the Academy shared with a local junior school, was offered to the group under lease by Lord Mostyn. The town house, which at the time was in a state of neglect, was restored by the Academy. Although an impressive historic building, Plas Mawr was not a natural gallery, and in 1896 an annexe was added to house the Victoria Gallery. Twentieth century In 1934 the Royal Cambrian Academy gained one of its most notable Presidents, when Augustus John accepted the role, holding the title until 1939. In 1994, inspired by the efforts of their then President, Sir Kyffin Williams, the Academy broke its ties with Plas Mawr opening a new gallery close to their old headquarters in Conwy. The Academy's present President is Jeremy Yates and Vice President is Ann Lewis, while its patron is Charles, Prince of Wales.

John na Seoltadh was a son of Donnell √ì M√°ille of Ui Mail, the √ì M√°ille lordship based around Clew Bay. He was a kinsman of Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille though in an unknown degree. Gr√°inne did have a brother or half-brother called D√≥nal na Piopa √ì M√°ille who was acknowledged as a son of her father, Eoghan Dubhdara √ì M√°ille. The main source for John is an entry in the Annals of the Four Masters, sub anno 1568. A hosting was made by James, the son of Maurice, son of John, son of the Earl, about Lammas, against Mac Maurice of Kerry, i.e. against Thomas, the son of Edmond. This James was commander of the Geraldines in the stead of the sons of James, son of John, who had been kept in captivity in London for a year previous to that time. The country was soon plundered, devastated, burned, and totally ravaged by James and his forces. The greater part of the inhabitants of the country fled, carrying with them to Lec-Snamha as much of their cattle as they were able. James had so numerous an army that he pitched two very extensive camps on both sides of this town. He placed O'Conor Kerry and the Clann-Sheehy, with their battalions, and a proportionate number of the gentlemen and chiefs of the army along with them, at the eastern side of the town; and he himself went, with that portion of the army which he wished to accompany him, to the west side of the town, so that Mac Maurice and his people were in great jeopardy between them. Intense heat of the air, sultriness and parching drought, also prevailed (as was natural at that season), so that their people and cattle were obliged to drink the brackish water of the river, in consequence of the intensity of their drought and the oppressiveness of their thirst. Edmond, the son of Gilla-Duv, son of Conor, son of Donough, son of Donnell-na-madhman Mac Sweeny, was constable to Mac Maurice at this time; and he had with him only a small party of gallowglasses of his followers, scarcely fifty men, the time of their service being expired. However, they did not think it honourable to depart from Mac Maurice, as this danger had overtaken him. There happened also to be in the town at this time one John-na-Seoltadh, son of Donnell O'Malley, with the crew of a long ship, who, being friends to the fleet of Mac Maurice, had come to visit him without visitation or engagement, and did not think it becoming to desert him on that occasion. Mac Maurice consulted with those chieftains, to know what he should do. They answered and said unto him with one accord:‚Äò In our present situation our life is next to death, and it is not relief we shall receive by the consent of those who are opposed to us, and who are besieging us; and, as it is not thy wish to give hostages to the son of Maurice, the son of the Earl, what thou shouldst do is, to resign thy luck and prosperity to fate and fortune this day, and take for thy portion of Ireland till night what shall be under the feet of thine enemies, and let us attack the Clann-Sheehy, for against them our enmity and indignation are greatest.‚Äô This resolution being agreed to, they rose up quickly with one accord, and Mac Maurice placed in order and array of battle the small body of friendly forces that he had with him, and the Clann-Sweeny were placed in the van to make the onset. No wealth or principality was, they thought, more agreeable to the Clann-Sheehy, and all those who were about them, than to see them approach in this order, for they had rather subdue them on the spot as they thought they could, than to remain awaiting them any longer, eating, as they had been, the green grain from the blade of corn, and drinking cold water. As for Mac Maurice and his people, they deviated not from the common road until they came up with the Clann- Sheehy ; and then it was that both parties made trial of the temper of their sharp spears, the strength of their battle-axes, the keenness of their swords, and the hardness of their helmets; and after having thus fought for some time, the fine army of the Geraldines were worsted, and took to flight, and turned their backs from maintaining the field of battle. They were vehemently and swiftly pursued by the people of Mac Maurice of Kerry, who proceeded to wound and slaughter them; so that it would not be easy to reckon or enumerate all of the Geraldines and of the Clann-Sheehy that fell in this defeat. John is not listed among the casualties of the incident, but his ultimate fate is unknown.

Design They were part of a standardisation scheme of Dean's, whereby he designed four classes with similar boilers, double frames, and cylinders, but of different wheel layouts. The 3201 class was close in design to the 3501 Class, ten of which were built initially as 2-4-0T \\"convertibles\\" for the broad gauge, and numbers 3511 to 3520 built as standard gauge condensing 2-4-0Ts. Construction Initially there were 5 members of the class. The prototype, No.3201, built in December 1884, was immediately sold to the Pembroke and Tenby Railway, who named it Stella. It returned to the GWR in 1896 and retained the nameplates until 1902. Nos. 3202-3205 were constructed in the summer of 1885. Between 1892 and 1895 the class was enlarged to 25 locomotives, as the broad and standard gauge 2-4-0Ts were all eventually converted to standard gauge tender locomotives. Tabor notes that \\"... the uniformity was very short-lived, as the class soon acquired a remarkable variety of boilers.\\" Use The original Stellas worked in the Bristol division but after the gauge conversion of 1892 all 25 locos were dispatched to Cornwall, where they worked the principal trains west of Newton Abbot until the arrival a few years later of the 3252 or Duke Class.

An explosive fire engulfed the ship while en route to Klaipƒóda on 9 October 2010. Specifications The ship was built in 2001 at the Szczecin Shipyard as the Golfo Dei Coralli for the shipowner Lloyd Sardegna Compagnia Di Navigazione from Olbia in Italy. She was however not delivered, but instead bought by DFDS on 19 July 2002, and was sailed under a Danish flag as the Dana Gloria. During this time she sailed on the route from Harwich to Esbjerg as the replacement for Dana Anglia. In June 2003 she was in turn replaced by her sister ship, the Dana Sirena, that also sailed under a Danish flag and provided facilities for 600 instead of 308 passengers. The ship was later transferred to Rasa Multipurpose Shipping, Klaipƒóda, renamed Lisco Gloria and sailed for DFDS Lisco (incorporated into DFDS Seaways in 2010) on the route between Klaipƒóda and Kiel. The ship had sailed under a Lithuanian flag since 1 June 2003. 2010 fire On 9 October 2010, the ship was on its way from Kiel to Klaipƒóda, carrying 204 passengers and 32 crewmembers, mostly Lithuanian citizens. Just after midnight, as the ship was travelling in the Fehmarn Belt, some 8‚Äì10 km south of Lolland, an onboard explosion occurred on the car deck, which resulted in a fire that later engulfed the entire ship. Being in the zone of German responsibility, all passengers and crew were rescued from the ferry by the German Coast Guard and some smaller vessels that had hurried to the scene, and transferred to other ferries, most of them on board the Deutschland. 3 persons, that had inhaled smoke were transferred to a hospital by helicopters. The German Coast Guard said that the incident showed no signs of being a terrorist attack. The ship later drifted into Danish waters and the Danish Coast Guard dispatched an oil containment vessel to the site because Lisco Gloria had some 200 tons of fuel oil on board. A German team managed to enter the ship and released the anchor. However, officials said that it was almost impossible to put out the fire and concentrated on cooling the hull to prevent her from sinking. In the morning she listed at 15 degrees. After the fire she was first towed to Odense, Denmark, where she was declared to be a constructive total loss.

His sons Nicolas and Jacques were also artists, and a number of chalk portraits by Fran√ßois and Nicolas survive. Jacques's work is known only through a single drawing, Time slaying Youth.Brugerolles & Guillet, The Renaissance in France (ENSBA/Harvard, 1995), p. 210. Pierre's work is also mostly lost, excepting an Architectural Study after Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, preserved at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and another drawing, a view called Ch√¢teau of S√©es.Brugerolles & Guillet (1995), 210-11 & note1, (?Ch√¢teau d'O, 9km from S√©es). The Abb√© de Marolles, a seventeenth-century French writer, recorded Pierre in verse as the designer of a stained-glass window for the Eglise des Augustins in Paris in 1557, with subject, Ascension of Christ with Portraits of Henri II and Catherine de Medici, now destroyed. Marolles also stated that Pierre and his son Fran√ßois designed tapestries.Jannet, P., ed., Marolles' Livre des Peintres et Graveurs, Paris (1855) 49‚Äì51.

He held papers pertaining to the failed colony of New Albion. Life He was born in Yorkshire about 1725. He visited Ireland in his twenty-first year, spending some time with Edward Synge, bishop of Elphin. He was instrumental in the introduction there of the farming of flax. He is said to have received from the linen board a premium of ¬£100 for the quality of flax raised under his management. In 1748 he would seem to have been farming on his own account in the county of Leitrim, and to have been also an early experimenter in turnip husbandry, then becoming prominent. Aged 26 he married, and began as a farmer and grazier in Ireland on a large scale. He introduced the Rotherham plough, patented in 1730, by Stanyforth & Foljambe of Rotherham. In 1760 the prohibition on the export of Irish cattle to England was removed. Varlo accordingly sold his land in Ireland, and brought his cattle over to England. The step was, however, very unpopular. Varlo's cattle were slaughtered by the mob in the streets of Dublin, and he himself had a very narrow escape. A small compensation was given to him by the government at the instance of the Duke of Bedford, then lord lieutenant, and he appears to have begun grazing in England, probably in Yorkshire. In 1764 he finished a machine that harrowed, sowed, and rolled at the same time, for which he received a premium from the Dublin Society. Another invention was a winnowing machine which he perfected in 1772. A third invention was ‚Äòa machine for taking off friction.‚Äô In 1784 he was living in Sloane Square. At this date occurred a strange incident. He had got possession of certain papers and charters purporting to have been granted by Charles I to Sir Edmund Plowden, and entitling him to colonise New Albion (i.e. New Jersey). This attempt at colonisation proved abortive, and in Charles II's reign the charter was superseded by a new grant to James, Duke of York. Armed with his papers (which were probably forgeries), Varlo went out to the American colonies (the independence of which had just been recognised by Britain), expecting apparently to be acknowledged as governor of the province of New Jersey and as lessee of one-third of the territory. The case was tried before the colonial courts, and Varlo's claim was dismissed. Varlo printed his documents in America in a pamphlet of thirty pages, containing (1) ‚ÄòThe Grant of Charles I to Sir E. Plowden, Earl Palatine of Albion‚Äô (apparently a transcript with alterations of the grant to Lord Baltimore); (2) ‚ÄòThe Lease from the Earl Palatine to Sir T. Danby [Sir Thomas Danby];‚Äô (3) ‚ÄòThe Release of the Co-Grantees to the Earl Palatine;‚Äô and (4) ‚ÄòThe Address of the Earl Palatine to the Public.‚Äô Only two copies of Varlo's original pamphlet are known to exist, one of which is in the Boston (U.S.A.) Athen√¶um. Hazard considered the papers to be sufficiently authentic to be introduced into his collection of state papers (vol. i.) Varlo also took a twelve months' tour through the states of New England, Maryland, and Virginia (where he met George Washington). On his return to England he petitioned the king and the Prince of Wales in the hope of getting some of the money granted to American loyalists. The last trace of him is on 24 February 1795, when he was living in Southampton Row, New Road, Paddington, where Sir John Sinclair sent a formal letter of thanks for certain suggestions made by Varlo to the Board of Agriculture on premiums for the cultivation of maize. Varlo must have been over seventy at this time.  Works  Varlo wrote: * The Yorkshire Farmer, a work chiefly concerned with the cultivation of corn and flax. Some of the opinions given in this book he renounced later (New System, i. 18). * A New System of Husbandry, from Experiments never before made public, York, 1770, 3 vols. Two further editions were published prior to 1773, one of these at Winchester. In 1774 a fourth edition was issued in London, and in 1785 a fifth in Boston, U.S.A. (Catalogue of the Boston Athen√¶um). This work of Varlo's evinces a wide acquaintance with different parts of the United Kingdom; in fact Varlo appears, like Arthur Young (1741‚Äì1820), only in a less degree, to have conducted regular agricultural tours (New System, iii. 227, 300). Varlo is to some extent a disciple of Jethro Tull (iii. 97). * Schemes offered for the Perusal and Consideration of the Legislature, Freeholders, and Public in General ‚Ä¶ by C. Varlo, Esq., 1775. It is probably to this work that Varlo refers when he says that he published a book called ‚ÄòPolitical Schemes‚Äô in 1772. This covers to a large extent the same points as are mooted in the ‚ÄòHusbandry,‚Äô and also enlarges on the advantages of a general enclosure act (for, though Varlo was one of the most spirited defenders of the open-field husbandry, he was in favour of a general act for the enclosure of waste and untilled land). * Nature Displayed: a New Work by different Gentlemen on several Subjects; Lectures on Philosophy; a Twelve Months' Tour of Observations through America, also Political Hints offered to the Legislature, 3rd ed. 1793; new ed. 1796. * Floating Ideas of Nature, suited to the Philosopher, Farmer, and Mechanic, 1796, 2 vols. These later works of Varlo are agricultural miscellanies, the greater part of the material for which is taken literally from his earlier writings. Whatever new matter there is chiefly relates to America, and especially to American agriculture, an account of Varlo's travels, and proposals to introduce into England certain details of American farm management, such as the cultivation of maize or the stabling of horses without litter.

Short and repetitive migrations of archaic humans before 1 million years ago suggest that their residence in Europe was not permanent at the time. Colonisation of Europe in prehistory was not achieved in one immigrating wave, but instead through multiple dispersal events. Most of these instances in Eurasia were limited to 40th parallel north. Besides the findings from East Anglia, the first constant presence of humans in Europe begins 500,000‚Äì600,000 years ago. However, this presence was limited to western Europe, not reaching places like the Russian plains, until 200,000‚Äì300,000 years ago. The exception to this was discovered in East Anglia, England, where hominids briefly inhabited 700,000 years ago. Prior to arriving in Europe, the source of hominids appeared to be East Africa, where stone tools and hominid fossils are the most abundant and recorded. Arising in Europe at least 400,000 years ago, the Neanderthals would become more stable residents of the continent, until they were displaced by a more recent migration of African hominids, in their new home are referred to as European early modern humans (historically called Cro-Magnon Man), leading to the extinction of Neanderthals about 40,000 years ago.  Pre-human hominids  A fragment of skull belonging to Ouranopithecus macedoniensis, a hominid found in Europe in the Late Miocene In the early Miocene, Europe had a subtropical climate and was intermittently connected to Africa by land bridges. At the same time, Africa was becoming more arid, prompting the dispersal of its tropical fauna‚Äîincluding primates‚Äînorth into Europe. Apes first appear in the European fossil record 17 million years ago with Griphopithecus. The closely related Kenyapithecus is also known from fossils in Germany, Slovakia and Turkey. Both Griphopithecus and Kenyapithecus are considered likely to be ancestral to the great apes. From 13 million to 9 million years ago, hominids flourished in Europe and underwent an adaptive radiation as they diversified in response to a gradually cooling climate. Middle Miocene European hominids include Pierolapithecus, Anoiapithecus, Dryopithecus, Hispanopithecus, and Rudapithecus. The diversity and early appearance of great apes in Europe has led some scientists to theorise that hominids in fact evolved there, before dispersing \\"back to Africa\\" in the Middle Miocene. Around 9 million years ago most of Europe's hominid species fell victim to the Vallesian crisis, an extinction event caused by the disappearance of the continent's forests. Some hominid species survived the event: Orepithecus, which became isolated in forest refugia; and Ouranopithecus, which adapted to the open environments of the late Miocene. However, both were extinct by 7 million years ago. In 2017, a reanalysis of Graecopithecus fossils from Greece and Bulgaria, previously associated with Ouranopithecus, concluded that the species was in fact a hominin dating to just after the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees (about 7.2 million years ago). The authors suggested that the origins of the human lineage were therefore in the Mediterranean, not Africa. Others are sceptical of their claims. Although subtropical conditions returned to Europe in the Pliocene (5.33‚Äì2.58 million years ago), there are no known fossil hominids from this period. Archaic humans Homo erectus populations lived in southeastern Europe by 1.8 million years ago. The most archaic human fossils from the Middle Pleistocene (780,000‚Äì125,000 years ago) have been found in Europe. Remains of Homo heidelbergensis have been found as far north as the Atapuerca Mountains in Gran Dolina, Spain, and the oldest specimens can be dated from 850,000 to 200,000 years ago. Neanderthals evolved from a branch of Homo heidelbergensis that migrated to Europe during the Middle Pleistocene. Neanderthal populations date back at least as far as 400,000 years ago in the Atapuerca Mountains, Spain. While lacking the robustness attributed to west European Neanderthal morphology, other populations did inhabit parts of eastern Europe and western Asia. Between 45,000‚Äì35,000 years ago, modern humans (Homo sapiens) replaced all Neanderthal populations in Europe anatomically and genetically. This is evident in the transfer and combination of technology and culture.  Anatomically modern humans  The recent expansion of anatomically modern humans reached Europe around 40,000 years ago, from Central Asia and the Middle East, as a result of cultural adaption to big game hunting of sub-glacial steppe fauna.Oppenheimer, Stephen \\"Out of Eden: Peopling of the World\\" (Robinson; New Ed edition (March 1, 2012)) Neanderthals were present both in the Middle East and in Europe, and the arriving populations of anatomically modern humans (also known as \\"Cro-Magnon\\" or European early modern humans) have interbred with Neanderthal populations to a limited degree. Modern human remains dating to 43‚Äì45,000 years ago have been discovered in Italy and Britain, with the remains found of those that reached the European Russian Arctic 40,000 years ago. The composition of European populations was later altered by further migrations, notably the Neolithic expansion from the Middle East, and still later the Chalcolithic population movements associated with Indo-European expansion. The modern indigenous population of Europe is composed of three major foundational populations, dubbed \\"Western Hunter-Gatherers\\" (WHG), \\"Early European Farmers\\" (EEF) and \\"Ancient North Eurasian\\" (ANE). WHG represents the remnant of the original Cro-Magnon population after they re-peopled Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum. EEF represents the introgression of Near Eastern populations during the Neolithic Revolution, and ANE is associated both with the Mesolithic Uralic expansion to Northern Europe and the Indo-European expansion to Europe in the Chalcolithic.. \\"most present Europeans derive from at least three highly differentiated populations: West European Hunter-Gatherers (WHG), who contributed ancestry to all Europeans but not to Near Easterners; Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) related to Upper Paleolithic Siberians, who contributed to both Europeans and Near Easterners; and Early European Farmers (EEF), who were mainly of Near Eastern origin but also harbored WHG-related ancestry. We model these populations‚Äô deep relationships and show that EEF had ~44% ancestry from a \\"Basal Eurasian\\" population that split prior to the diversification of other non-African lineages.\\"  Pressures favoring migration  Homo ergaster specimens indicate a change toward a diet more reliant on animal products, evident by greater encephalization with higher energy requirements. This transition to becoming more carnivorous affected the way of life unlike primates before. Archaeological evidence of cut bones from large mammals and broken stone tools increasing in frequency support this increasing trend. To meet increasing demand of calories, the range of hominids would have expanded, making the necessary hunting versus prior scavenging possible. It is believed that the adjustments required to meet these new demands would expand the home range size eight to ten times. Range could also increase or decrease in size due to environmental changes. A more recent example is absence of humans in Britain during the last glacial maximum which ended in the Late Pleistocene, 10,000 years ago. At this time, Russia had an influx of people following the major prey species shifting to this region. It has been argued that Neanderthals', and previous hominids', expansion northward were limited by lacking proper thermoregulation. Behavioural adaptations such as clothes-making to overcome the cold is evident in archaeological finds. The potential to expand also grew with the Neanderthal reaching the status of top carnivores. These humans could fear less during expansion, without the worry of other predators. The desire to push into these northern areas was influenced by this requirement to eat a lot of meat to satisfy the human brain which uses 20% of the body's energy. Larger game for hunting is available the closer you are to the poles.

In December 2011, Betty White received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie for her performance. Plot The story follows the characters of a TV journalist, Susan Allison (Hewitt), working on a profile of a woman, Caroline Thomas (White), whose husband naval aviator Lt. Neil Thomas was declared MIA 60 years ago during World War II. Susan immediately clashes with Caroline's grandson, Lucas Thomas (Faris), when he overhears her referring to the potential story as a fluff piece, rather than the very personal story it is, since she herself doubts if pure and true love exists. She apologizes, and manages to start the interview and starts spending time with both Caroline and Lucas. Her developing friendship with Lucas makes her have doubts about her relationship with her almost fiance, Andrew Hawthorne, a photographer who is frequently absent overseas. The interview with Caroline reveals that for 66 years she has had no information about her husband from the Department of the Navy. She tells her story about how she and her husband met in 1943, married, and then renovated a house they had bought from her uncle (which is where Caroline still lives). After a year, and despite a child forthcoming, Neil felt he should help his country more than just acting as a training officer, so he went into combat. Their last moments together were at the Union train station, where she handed him a handmade valentine professing her everlasting love, as he departed on a train. Caroline remained strong, and sent many letters to Neil. On one occasion, Neil replied with a letter containing a small, handmade whittled wooden sculpture of a fighter plane for the baby. After that Caroline stopped receiving letters. Caroline, along with the entire neighborhood, dreaded the times when a Western Union deliveryman arrived in the neighborhood with a yellow telegram, since this meant that someone's loved one was reported to be dead or missing in action. Eventually, the moment where Caroline received one came, but the telegram stated that her husband was missing in action, so she refused to believe that he was dead. Since then Caroline has returned every year on Valentine's Day to the same train station to wait for him. With the help of a United States Senator (Susan did an unrelated story on him) who puts pressure on the Navy, they locate the Billings family, whose now deceased father Jeff was a gunner on Lt. Thomas' airplane. From a surviving letter by Jeff to his wife we hear the account of the crash and of Morang, a Filipino guerilla, who rescued two wounded crash survivors. Susan turns to Andrew for help because he still has connections to the Philippines where Lt. Thomas was last seen alive. Putting past hard feelings over his breakup with Susan aside, Andrew manages to locate the elderly Morang whilst in the Philippines and sets up a video conference between him and Caroline. The story of the fate of Lt. Thomas, Morang says, is that he was badly wounded, but insisted his more seriously injured gunner, Jeff Billings, be evacuated first. When Lt. Thomas had recovered, he joined the Filipino guerillas and fought the Japanese deep behind enemy lines. During a patrol, Lt. Thomas was killed by a Japanese sniper while selflessly trying to rescue a little boy. Morang reveals he knows where Lt. Thomas's body is buried. The U.S. Navy goes to the grave site and returns Lt. Thomas' remains and personal effects to the United States. Caroline is handed Neil's dog-tags, watch, and wallet, which contains her valentine to him, now faded, which he always carried close to his heart. In recognition of Lt. Thomas's bravery, courage, and meritorious service, he is to be posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, Silver Star and Purple Heart. On Valentine's Day Lt. Thomas's coffin is returned to Caroline at Union Station by the U.S. Navy with full military honors, conducted in front of well-wishers and TV cameras, with a tearful Caroline taking her last goodbyes from her beloved Neil to the sound of Taps. Caroline is cheered when Lucas and Susan begin a romantic relationship. The film ends with Caroline, who has found peace and closure, seeing that the rosebush Neil had planted long ago in their garden has a new single bloom, the first in a long time, signaling long-lasting love, as she remembers her romantic moments with Neil in the same garden, to the sound of \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\" playing on the radio.

Spencer met the author of the book, James Michael Pratt, in 2001 and fell in love with the story line. Her screenplay based on the novel, ultimately resulted in a contract with Hallmark. Spencer is also co-producer of the project. The producers did well in matching young and old Caroline. White and Fahy's facial features, including expressive blue eyes, are similar in most respects, though it would appear Fahy is slightly taller than White. Anachronisms Three versions of the song \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\" are heard in the film: sung by the Mills Brothers, as a duet by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, and by Doris Day. The first two are 'out of time', as the Mills Brothers and the duet versions were set during the war, when in fact, the Mills Brothers version was recorded in 1964 and the duet in 1950. Home media The film aired on January 30, 2011, on CBS and was available to order from Hallmark after the film aired. Reception The Lost Valentine earned mostly positive reviews, with White's performance receiving high praise and great acclaim. The film received a generally positive review from US Magazine, who said it was \\"Supercorny, though White tugs the heart\\". Brian Lowry of Variety stated that \\"Betty White is easily the best reason to watch The Lost Valentine.\\" Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said of White's performance that \\"She‚Äôs a funny lady for sure, but she can also nicely manage gravitas and vulnerability.\\" Jackie Cooper from HuffPost said of White \\"This movie allows audiences to see her dramatic side and if her grieving widow can‚Äôt break your heart, nothing can.\\" And Jim Heinrich of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described White's performance as \\"Excellent.\\" The film was a huge success which not only won its time period in viewers (14.53 million, beating out Fox's second hour of coverage of the NFL Pro Bowl) but represented the most-watched Hallmark movie in four years (since the film Valley of Light aired in January 2007). The film won the Faith & Freedom Award for Television at the 2012 Movieguide Awards.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands close to the castle of the same name as the village, which was built to command this part of the Welsh Marches. The village is partly in Shropshire and the county boundary is not far from the church. Notably, the tower is detached from the main body of the church, and stands about to its east. History The church dates from the 12th century. It was extended early in the 14th century, and again in the early 15th century, and restored in the late 19th century. The church was declared redundant on 1 August 1982, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 30 March 2001. The village continues to be served by the Church of England with the All Saints church at Batchcott, Shropshire. Architecture The exterior and surroundings Exterior St Bartholomew's is constructed in stone rubble with tile roofs. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel built in the 12th century, a south aisle and a north chapel built in the 14th century, and a south porch of the 15th century. The south aisle is in three bays between which are stepped buttresses. The middle bay contains a pair of lancet windows. In the easternmost of the bays has a two-light window, and in the western bay is the south doorway. The porch is arched, and in each side of it are two-light windows. The west window of the aisle consists of two lancets, and at the east end is a three-light window. The west window of the nave has four lights. On the north wall are two buttresses, and it contains two 12th-century round-headed windows, one of which is partly obscured by a buttress. The chapel has a four-light north window, and three-light windows on the east and west sides. The south wall of the chancel is in three bays. It contains a priest's door, with a two-light window on each side. The east window has four lights, and below it are a two-light mullioned window and the head of a doorway leading to a vault. Interior Inside the church, the south arcade has three bays and the arcade between the chancel and the chapel has two bays. In the south wall of the aisle is a piscina, and against its west wall is a 13th-century coffin lid inscribed with a foliated cross. Under the north window of the chapel is a tomb recess. In the nave and aisle are box pews from the 17th century. Elsewhere in the church are benches, and there is an 18th-century family pew in the chapel under a canopy. There are fragments of 14th-century glass in many of the windows. In the chancel are six hatchments on the walls, and 18th-century memorial slabs on the floor. Tower To the east of the church is a detached tower dating from the 14th century. Some restoration was carried out on it during the 19th century. It has a square plan and is surmounted by a slate pyramidal roof with a weathervane. The tower is in three stages. In the lowest stage is an arched entrance on the west side. There are square-headed windows in the east and south sides in both the lowest and the middle stages. The upper stage contains two-light arched bell openings on the north, south and east sides. The tower has been designated separately as a Grade I listed building.

It is aimed at power users; GeeksPhone claims it to be the first Android phone which is not locked down but gives users full access to the operating system and even encourages modifying it. The device was originally priced at ‚Ç¨300 in the EU, lowered to ‚Ç¨160 in December 2010, and is currently out of stock. Hardware * GPS with DGPS (WAAS/EGNOS) * 3-axis accelerometer * Retractile stylus Hardware specifications of the One were changed at various stages after its announcement: * The original prototype looked similar to the Samsung Omnia and lacked a physical keyboard, the final design was adopted later. * A DVB-T tuner, although initially announced, is not found in the final product. * A second, front-facing camera for use in video calls was also mentioned before the release and is clearly visible next to the earpiece in photos of prototypes, although reportedly disabled in initial software releases. The final product lacks this second camera. * The first releases were shipped with 256 MB ROM; later models are equipped with 512 MB. Software The GeeksPhone One originally shipped with a customized build of Android 1.6 (Donut); updates to later Android versions are available. The system image also includes closed-source Android components, as well as some commercial third-party applications. Philosophy The GeeksPhone One is the first handset produced by GeeksPhone. The company claims it to be the first Android-powered handset which allows the user to modify operating system components without having to root the device first. New OS images can easily be installed on the device; the company operates a wiki and a forum for users to share knowledge. However, unlike similar efforts such as Openmoko, GeeksPhone does not publish details on the phone's hardware beyond common technical specifications. Another difference to Openmoko is that GeeksPhone aims to provide a stable device suitable for everyday use and capable of competing with other commercial devices on the market. The GeeksPhone One ships with an Android version which has undergone quality tests and passed Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Code Compliance certification, allowing it to include closed-source Android components and participate in Android Market. As of July 2010, the GeeksPhone is not available through any of the big mobile operators. While GeeksPhone does not rule out cooperation with operators, CEO Javier Ag√ºera has stated that the ‚Äúfreedom-based‚Äù business model would have priority over any such agreement. Certified Community Release program In July 2010, GeeksPhone announced their Certified Community Release (CCR) program. CCRs are Android ports developed by the community and subsequently certified by GeeksPhone. Releases may be certified as ‚Äústable‚Äù or ‚Äúbeta‚Äù. While full credit is given to the developer, GeeksPhone will give technical support to users of these builds and flash phones with a CCR if requested by the customer. Use of a CCR will not void the warranty of the phone. Developers can get technical support from GeeksPhone and major contributors may receive an additional free handset for development from GeeksPhone and, in some cases, sponsorships. GeeksPhone initially announced that phones would not yet ship with CCRs preinstalled; however, as of at least October 2010, phones have been shipped with a CCR based on Android 2.2 (Froyo). Market availability and clones GeeksPhone sells the One in Europe and Latin America. In Russia, computer discounter Vobis distributes the GeeksPhone One under the name Highscreen Zeus, apparently with a different software package than the original GeeksPhone One.

Her career as an artist spanned more than fifty years and explores ecological and urban problems through land art. Her works are site-oriented and ephemeral. Early life Escobedo was born on July 28, 1934 to a Mexican lawyer father and an English mother in Mexico City. She was educated in her home in a small neighborhood setting with her younger brother Miguel, taught by a French governess until the age of ten. At a young age, she learned ballet until she outgrew it. She was taught violin by Sander Roth, who at the time was a member of the world- famous Lener Quartet. Even though she became proficient with her violin skills, Escobedo eventually decided to switch to art.Schmilchuk, Graciela. Helen Escobedo: Footsteps in the Sand. Mexico: Consejo Nacional Para La Cultura Las Artes, 2005. Education At the age of 15 in 1949, she decided to enroll at the Mexico City College\\"Helen Escobedo (Mexican, Born 1936).\\" Helen Escobedo Biography ‚Äì Helen Escobedo on Artnet. http://www.artnet.com/artists/helen-escobedo/biography. and attended art classes in the afternoon twice a week. At Motolinia University, she took art classes under an abstract sculptor, Germ√°n Cueto where she experimented with many different materials. Impressed by her work, Professor John Skeaping, a British sculptor from the Royal College of Art, encouraged her to pursue sculpture. He offered her a one-year grant to study in London at his institution, where she attended eventually with a three-year scholarship. She studied under the guidance of Frank Dobson, Henry Moore, Jacob Epstein, Leon Underwood, and for a short time, Ossip Zadkine. In her second year, she wrote her thesis: Renoir and Degas: Two Impressionists in Sculpture. She got her bachelor's degree in Humanities at Motolinia University in Mexico and her master's degree in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art in London, U.K. by 1954 at the age of 20. Career Aside from sculpture, Escobedo was a talented painter, printmaker, installation artist, writer, performance artist, lecturer, curator, and museum director in her lifetime. Escobedo accepted the position be the head and served as director of the Museo de Arte Moderno and the Department of Museums and Galleries at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in 1960, where she worked until 1978, organizing exhibitions.Walkup, Nancy. 2000 THE SPIRIT OF PLACE. The Free Library (April, 1), http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE SPIRIT OF PLACE.-a061524586 As she worked as director, she continued her craft and completed commissions as well as exhibitions of her own work. She would go on to serve as the Director of the Museum of Modern art between 1982 and 1984. From 1985 to 1989, she worked as an art curator of the Museum of the UNAM, specializing in international exhibitions. Having left her directorial role in art administration, Escobedo decided to concentrate on her own work. Exhibitions Her first solo exhibition was held in 1956 at the Galeria de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City. It included her works made of bronze, drawings, and paintings. After marrying Fredrik Kirsebom, a Norwegian, they moved to Sweden where Escobedo spent two years learning about her new home and making some religious sculptures that would be shown in her second solo exhibition at the Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano when she returned to Mexico two years later. In 1968, Mathias Goeritz invited her to participate in the Ruta de la Amistad (Route of Friendship) for the XIX 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, for which she made the sculpture called Puertas al Viento (Gateway to the Wind).\\"M√©xico 68.\\" M√©xico 68. http://www.mexico68.org/en/sculptures/19.html. The Route of Friendship was constructed to be an Olympic highway consisting of monumental sculptures made by selected artists. It was her first large-scale sculpture piece. In the same year, Escobedo set up an exhibition, self-produced and curated by Willoughby Sharp featuring fifteen large-scale environments made by many individual international artists. When Escobedo mounted her Dynamic Walls exhibition, it traveled to different cities starting in Prague but eventually became lost on its journey to Rome. It reappeared in 1971 in poor condition that resulted in her method of creating temporary or ephemeral works at the location for a one- time installation rather than let her work travel and become ruined again. This would become her signature, known internationally, to create site- oriented ephemeral sculptures using materials that are available at or near the site. Escobedo created a paper mural at the Galer√≠a Pecanins in Barcelona in 1973. The following year, she held another exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art and at this point, was also the director of the Department of Museums and Galleries. In 1978, Escobedo created Coatl, at the University Cultural Center of UNAM in Mexico City, out of steel girders painted yellow to orange to red measuring to 15 meters. As a statement, her exhibit called Negro basura, negro ma√±ana (Black garbage, black tomorrow)\\"Negro Basura, Negro Ma√±ana, 1991. Helen Escobedo.\\" Negro Basura, Negro Ma√±ana, 1991.

As the years go by, she participated in many other exhibitions throughout the world.'' Her next solo exhibition show was called Estar y no estar and was displayed at the University Museum in 2000. Two years later, she did three exhibitions, one in Mexico City called Sal√≥n Bancomer and the other two in Germany called Die Fluctlinge: The Refugees and Bicycle Taxi. The following year she returned to her home of Mexico City for her escasr R√≠os Perenes exhibit.

He became the 57th Mayor of Dunedin in October 2010 and was re-elected in both the 2013 mayoralty race and 2016 mayoral election. Before politics, he was a presenter for Television New Zealand and an author. Early life and career before politics Cull was born and grew up in Invercargill, where he attended Southland Boys' High School. He obtained a BA and PG Dip in political science at the University of Otago. He has worked as a television presenter for Television New Zealand, hosting lifestyle and home improvement shows including Home Front, and is a writer who has published several books. He is married to Joan Wilson and they have two daughters. Political career David Cull was elected to the Dunedin City Council in 2007. During his time as a councillor, he opposed the new stadium, which has since become a financial drain on the council. In the 2010 Dunedin mayoral election, he was one of seven candidates, one of whom was incumbent mayor Peter Chin. Cull stood as part of the Greater Dunedin group and was successful. He took office as mayor on 27 October 2010. Cull expressed support for a controversial planned waterfront hotel that at 28 storeys, would tower over much of the city. In March 2014, Cull entered a memorandum of understanding with the developer on behalf of Dunedin City Council, but the agreement fell over and was terminated a month later, which meant the end of the project. In January 2013, Cull announced that he would seek re-election in that year's mayoral election. On election day, he beat ex ACT MP Hilary Calvert, Councillor Lee Vandervis, and six other challengers. In July 2017, Cull was elected as the president of Local Government New Zealand. He had previously served as the organisation's vice-president and chair of its metro committee. In late May 2019, Cull announced he would not seek re-election at that year's mayoral election. In mid August 2019, Cull announced that he would be contesting local body elections for the Southern District Health Board; he was elected, and then appointed as the Board's Chair in December 2019.

The difference between manufacturing and process is typically the types of control involved, discrete control or continuous control (aka process control). Many plants offer a hybrid of both discrete and continuous control. The underlying commonality between them all is that the automation systems are often an integration of multi-vendor products to form one system. Each vendor product typically offers communication capability for programming, maintaining and collecting data from their products. A properly orchestrated plant floor environment will likely include a variety of communications, some for machine to machine (M2M) communications ‚Äì to facilitate efficient primary control over the process and some for Machine to Enterprise (M2E) communications ‚Äì to facilitate connectivity with Business Systems that provide overall reporting, scheduling and inventory management functions. Machine to machine (M2M) communications Automation controllers typically offer communication modules to enable them to support a variety of industrial protocols, to facilitate machine to machine communications. These modules are often special designed for the protocol. A new class of module, the universal gateway, is becoming more prevalent as it offers the ability for an automation controller to communicate over one or more protocols simultaneously, and can be reconfigured for additional protocols without a module change. Machine to enterprise (M2E) communications Few automation controllers offer direct connectivity to business systems such as MES and ERP systems. Overall integration of automation controllers to business systems are typically configured by system integrators, able to bring their unique knowledge on process, equipment and vendor solutions. Integration Integration is typically managed through one of three mechanisms: Direct Integration ‚Äì Business systems include connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering. This requires the business system developers to offer specific support for the variety of plant floor equipment that they want to interface with. Business system vendors must be expert in their own products, and connectivity to other vendor products, often those offered by competitors. Relational Database (RDB) Integration ‚Äì Business systems connect to plant floor data sources through a Relational Database Staging Table. Plant floor systems will deposit the necessary information into a Relational Data Base. The business system will remove and use the information from the RDB Table. The benefit of RDB Staging is that business system vendors do not need to get involved in the complexities of plant floor equipment integration. Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the system integrator. EATM (Enterprise Transaction Modules) ‚Äì These devices have the ability to communicate directly with plant floor equipment and will transact data with the business system in methods best supported by the business system. Again, this can be through a staging table, Web Services, or through system specific business system APIs. The benefit of an EATM is that it offers a complete, off the shelf solution, minimizing long term costs and customization. Custom Integrated Solutions ‚Äì Many system integrators designs offer custom crafted solutions, created on a per instance basis to meet site and system requirements. There are a wide variety of communications drivers available for plant floor equipment and there are separate products that have the ability to log data to relational database tables. Standards exist within the industry to support interoperability between software products, the most widely known being OPC, managed by the OPC Foundation. Custom Integrated Solutions typically run on workstation or server class computers. These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term cost in terms on maintenance and reliability. Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation.

Early years=First twenty-five years, 1887 to 1912 Window depicting St. Kieran, Seir Kieran Church, Bell Hill The advent of the GAA club at Clareen in 1887 coincided with the drive to build a new Parish Church, as the old one (erected in 1795 in the townland of Breaghmore) had become structurally unsound. The first secretary of the club, from 1887 until he emigrated in 1895, was Frank Pilkington of Bell Hill. Pilkington went on to become secretary to the Offaly GAA Club in New York for many years.The Music of the Ash, page 219 Seir Kieran participated in competitions year on year. In 1907, the Offaly hurling championship was divided into Senior and Junior grades, and in 1909, the Offaly County Board introduced the \\"Parish Rule\\".The Music of the Ash, page 10 These developments led to a first big breakthrough for club, when they beat Roscore (3-0 to 1-1) in the Offaly Junior Final for 1912. This final was not actually played until November 1913. Although a Central Council ruling, earlier in 1913,James Nowlan: The Alderman and the GAA in his Time, page 20 had reduced team size form 17 players to 15, this did not affect the still-unfinished 1912 championship. As such, Seir Kieran and Roscore may have been the last-ever teams to play a 17-a-side hurling final.The Music of the Ash, page 13 It was during this period that Seir Kieran adopted their present club colours, of black and amber (similar to the Kilkenny county colours). In November 1911, John Drennan of Conway Hall, Kells, County Kilkenny donated a set of black and amber jerseys to the Kilkenny County Board, GAA. It is reported that prior to this gesture, he had won a large amount of money on a horse whose jockey wore those colours.Kilkenny: The GAA Story page 322 John Drennan was a brother of Fr. Jeremiah Drennan, parish priest of Seir Kieran from 1904 to 1921. It is likely that Fr. Drennan emulated his brother's gesture by presenting the club with a set of jerseys identical to the Kilkenny ones.Approach The Fountain Great War to the 1930s From 1915 to 1918, Jimmy Corrigan of Clareen served as secretary to the Offaly County Board, GAA. Corrigan was captain of the team which won Offaly's first Leinster Junior Hurling Championship and advanced to the 1915 All Ireland Final. On account of the Easter Rising, this Final could not be played out until 20 August 1916, when Offaly traveled on a D.E. Williams motor lorry to Athlone and narrowly lost to Tipperary (1-6 to 2-2). By that stage, Corrigan was doing his club hurling with the Birr Club, as he taught at the Workhouse Schools in the Town.Magic Memories, page 10 He was also secretary to the Birr Sinn F√©in Club, and (clandestinely) a lieutenant of Volunteers. He died aged 27 in October 1918, either from tuberculosis, or from the Spanish 'Flu which reached pandemic proportions that year. Corrigan was deeply mourned by his comrades in the Offaly GAA, who erected a Celtic Cross- shaped commemorative headstone over his grave in the Seir Kieran New Cemetery.The Music of the Ash, page 18 Headstone of James Corrigan (1891-1918) ‚Äì teacher; Offaly GAA secretary; captain of Offaly Junior hurlers in 1915 All Ireland Final; Lieutenant of Volunteers, Irish Republican Army Seir Kieran reached the 1920 Junior Hurling Final. On account of the War of Independence and the Civil War (when the Clareen Company, 4th Battalion, IRA comprised several Seir Kieran hurlers),Relating to Roscomroe, page 281 this Final could not be played off until 13 May 1923, when Clara defeated them (Clara 5-2, Seir Kieran 2-1). In the Junior Final for 1923 proper, played at Kilcormac on 18 November, Seir Kieran won their second Title with a 4-0 to 1-0 victory over Tullamore. Paddy Corrigan was captain. One of that team, Tom Dooley, represented the club on the Offaly panel that won the 1923 Junior All Ireland. Again owing to the Civil War, the All Ireland Final against Cork could not be fixed until July 1924. Cork initially would not participate in protest at the continuing imprisonment of their County Board chairman Sean McCarthy (who had sided with the Irregular or Republican side), whereupon a walkover was awarded to Offaly.The Music of the Ash, page 17 The Offaly County Board unanimously refused to accept the Title on that basis, and the Final eventually went ahead at Croke Park on 12 October 1924. Offaly won a thrilling, uncompromising battle by 3-4 to Cork's 3-2. The captain was Jack Holligan of Kinnitty, while Drumcullen's Bill Fox gave a man-of-the-match display.The Music of the Ash, page 27 In 1929, PJ Grogan of Clareen captained Offaly to a second Junior All Ireland hurling title. Cork again provided the opposition in the Final, played out on 15 December 1929 at Thurles, and were beaten by 2-3 to Offaly's 6-1. On the club scene, Seir Kieran were unlucky to lose the 1927 Offaly Senior Hurling (South County) Final, going down to Drumcullen by 3-3 to 2-4.The Music of the Ash, page 227 Discontent with the Land Commission's subdivision of the Kilmaine estate militated against unity of purpose in the club, and Kilmaine House itself was burned down in the early hours of Monday 23 July 1926.Midland Tribune, 12 March 1927 ‚Äì KILMAINE HOUSE ‚Äì Burning Compensation Claim By Land Commission ‚Äì 'A Blackguardly And Disgraceful Act' Seir Kieran did however contest the Junior Championship of 1929, overcoming Birr and Coolderry before losing to Shannonharbour (5-3 to 2-2) in the Semi-final, on 8 September 1929. In May 1931, young John Coughlan played in goals for the Offaly Minors (against Westmeath at Clara).Midland Tribune, 13 May 1931 Intermediate success The first Intermediate Title came in Ballyduff, Tullamore on 20 September 1931, when Seir Kieran (captained by PJ Grogan) beat Clara by 5-7 to 2-5. At Senior grade for the following two seasons, the Clareen side gave stirring displays against the likes of Coolderry and a rising Tullamore team. The 1932 panel was augmented by Dick and Willie Conway from Roscomroe, a district of Kinnitty Parish with historic ties to Seir Kieran.Relating To Roscomroe, page 53 Other noted players included Mick Leahy, Kieran Grogan and Dan Murphy, although none could compare with red-maned Jim Killeen \\"the thatcher\\", one of the finest-ever Clareen hurlers. Originally from Lusmagh, Jim and his brother Mick had come to Clareen as young boys, where they lived with a childless couple, Din Browne and his wife.The Music of the Ash, page 31 Seir Kieran were a diminished force after Killeen went to Killdangan in North Tipperary in the mid-1930s (a time when many others were emigrating to England), but they recovered to claim the Offaly Intermediate Hurling Final of 1938 against North Portarlington. Played at Tullamore on 27 August 1938, this match also served as the Junior Final of 1937, with the result that Seir Kieran annexed both Titles in the one hour of hurling.The Music of the Ash, page 52 The Clareen side, featuring players such as Pakie Troy (who served as club secretary for many years) and the great Jack Purcell, scored 6-8 to North Portarlington's 2-1. The Seir Kieran panel who claimed both the 1937 Offaly Junior Hurling Title and the 1938 Offaly Intermediate Hurling Title by beating North Portarlington, August 1938 in Tullamore. In 1939 the team reached a new high-water mark, by advancing to the Offaly Senior Hurling Final on 22 October against Coolderry. Coolderry relentlessly built up their winning margin of 6-4 to 2-2, to claim their 14th Title. Nonetheless, Seir Kieran matched their opponents well in a fast-paced, hard-hitting contest. Throughout the 1939 championship, their rain-maker was the brilliant Sean O'Neill at midfield.The Music of the Ash, page 54 The eldest son of the Clareen schoolmaster, O'Neill was a student at St Kieran's College in Kilkenny, where he captained the team that won out the Leinster Colleges Hurling Championship of 1939. In the 1940s, despite an ongoing crisis of numbers, Seir Kieran won the Intermediate Hurling contests of 1943 and 1947. The 1943 championship was curtailed by wartime restrictions, especially rationing of petrol and food supplies. On 12 September 1943, Seir Kieran won the Final against Clara by 7-5 to 5-1. Rationing had hardly eased by the Springtime of 1947, when a brutal Arctic freeze was exacerbated by blizzards that set in on St Patrick's Day. Nonetheless, an entertaining Intermediate Championship ensued. In the Semi- Final against Shinrone at Killyon, a last-gasp Jack Purcell point saw Seir Kieran salvage a draw. Due to a \\"man of the match\\" performance by Tom Featherstone, they won the replay by 3-6 to 3-2.The Music of the Ash, page 280 Featherstone was carried shoulder-high from the field, and Fr. William Brennan the club chairman declared: \\"This is our Jim Langton\\". Seir Kieran won the Intermediate Final against Carrig & Riverstown by 5-3 to 2-4. The medals were awarded in the Parish Hall on St Stephen's Night 1947. The schoolmaster, Mr. Sean O'Neill, the team trainer, Fr. William Brennan PP, and John Coughlan the team captain gave the speeches, in which they looked forward to Senior success in 1948. Good wishes were also extended to Fr. Michael Troy, a member of the panel about to set sail for Africa. Although the team made little headway the following year, the club took great heart from Seamus Mulrooney's brilliant displays with Offaly in the 1948 Leinster Minor Hurling Championship.The Music of the Ash, page 63 The Leinster Final was held at Tullamore on 11 July, where Offaly let slip a 0-6 to nil half time lead, and lost to Kilkenny by 5-2 to 3-6. Junior success 1950 to 1969 During the 1950s emigration reached a staggering rate. A tragedy on the playing field in June 1952, when young John Dooley of Clashroe, Roscomroe was fatally injured by an accidental blow to the head when playing for Seir Kieran,Relating to Roscomroe, page 150 further shook the club's confidence in the future.The Music of the Ash, page 87 The mentors managed to rally the team, who beat both Tullamore and Birr to reach the Senior Hurling Final for the first time since 1939. At St Brendan's Park on 31 August 1952, they were beaten by Drumcullen by 9-11 to 4-3. Despite this outcome, Seir Kieran sustained their Senior challenge both in 1953 (when Coolderry had to be at their best to overcome them) and in 1954 when they reached the Semi-final (before again going down to Coolderry). By 1955, though, the club could not muster 15 Senior players, and so had to concede a walkover to Shannon Rovers in the Championship.The Music of the Ash, page 70 The following year at Intermediate grade, the club joined forces with neighboring parish Kinnitty whose demographic situation was just as dire. The amalgamated team, known as St Flannan's, won through to the 1956 Intermediate Hurling Final against Ferbane on 16 September 1956. St Flannan's (wearing green and white) emerged victorious by 4-7 to 4-1.The Music of the Ash, page 281 Promoted to Senior grade in 1957, St Flannan's were heavily defeated in their opening match to Shannon Rovers ‚Äì a result which put an end to the Kinnitty-Clareen combination. Consequently, it was again under the Seir Kieran banner that the Clareen men fielded in 1958, and won passage to the 1958 Junior Hurling Final. Delayed until 8 March 1959, this Final saw Seir Kieran defeating St Columba's (Durrow) by 4-6 to 1-1. 1958 was the Parish's fourth Title at Junior grade, and was crucial in boosting morale after the big setbacks during the decade gone by. A reporter for the Midland Tribune described the challenge that this posed to the club's viability, especially once they stepped up to Senior grade in 1960 and 1961: :: \\"Coolderry had a few newcomers but Seir Kieran were less lucky. Limited to the smallest parish in Ireland, they had to rely on several veterans who still keep the colours flying, and here lay their weakness ‚Äì the lack of vigorous youth. That they still maintain a Senior team is a tribute to the players and club officials; that they take to the field year after year with high hopes is a tribute to all concerned.\\"Midland Tribune, 12 July 1961 Another morale boost came in October 1961, with the acquisition of six statute acres adjacent to Clareen crossroads, as a permanent home for the club. This purchase was signed off on by four trustees: John Coughlan and Seamus Mulrooney, on behalf of Seir Kieran; and Rody O'Brien and John Dowling, on behalf of the Offaly County Board. Development of these facilities was coupled with more organized training of the talented younger players who began to emerge. Seir Kieran had an inspirational one-point win over the new St. Rynagh's GAA Club (Banagher and Cloghan combined) in the Junior Hurling Semi-final of 1962, but in the Final on 21 October they slumped to a big defeat (3-10 to 1-1)The Music of the Ash, page 289 against Edenderry in Tullamore. It was much the same story in St Brendan's Park on 7 April 1968, when Killeigh beat Seir Kieran by 5-5 to 0-7 in the delayed 1967 Junior Hurling decider. The Seir Kieran panel that won the Offaly Junior Hurling Title of 1969Notwithstanding such bitter disappointments, the Clareen side were consistently featuring in top-notch, close, exciting Junior matches. In the 1965 Offaly JHC, Kinnitty needed three attempts before edging out Seir Kieran by 2-10 to 3-6. In 1968, a last-minute Joe McKenna goal separated Shinrone and Seir Kieran after a thrilling replay. Success finally crowned these endeavours in 1969, when Seir Kieran became Offaly Junior Hurling champions for a fifth time. Once again, the Junior Final was deferred until the following Spring. On 26 April 1970, the team traveled to Tullamore and defeated Clara by the minimum (3-2 to 1-7).The Music of the Ash, page 291 Tim Mulrooney the captain lifted the James Clarke Cup. Seir Kieran have fielded a Senior team in each subsequent year. At senior grade 1970 to 1979=Return to the top flight, 1970 to 1974 On 7 June 1970 (in their first Senior hurling game since July 1961), the Clareen team very nearly toppled reigning champions St Rynagh's. Damien Martin's goalkeeping enabled St Rynagh's to battle back for a draw (Seir Kieran 4-6, St Rynagh's 2-12). Fore- warned was fore-armed in the replay on 12 July, when the Banagher men won by 4-13 to 2-3. The Clareen side were still alive in the 1970 championship, but were eliminated by Coolderry in the next round. There was only one bite of the cherry in 1971, when Seir Kieran were dismissed by Ballyskenagh. While they won their opening round match against Rahan in 1972, Kinnitty proved too strong for the black and amber when the next round was finally played off in October. In both 1973 and 1974, something of a back door system operated in the Offaly Senior Hurling Championship. Therefore, Seir Kieran's 2-12 to 1-8 loss to Birr in June 1973 set them on the road to the Loser's Group Final against Na Piarsaigh (Killoughey and Kilcormac combined). It took a trilogy of matches to decide this Final. The first two installments, played at Birr on successive Sundays in September, ended in deadlock. It was a different story in the second replay, for which the venue was switched to Tullamore. Seir Kieran did not play well, and Na Piarsaigh ran out winners by 1-13 to 1-4. The Offaly GAA Convention for 1974 passed a motion that the Fixtures Committee be mindful of the ongoing Oil Crisis when selecting venues. Measurements on the playing field were also changing ‚Äì 70 yard frees were replaced by 65 metre frees. New rules decreed the painting of large and small rectangles. A player could not be in the square before the ball, only three defenders could line the goals in the event of a penalty, and charging a player not in possession was banned. Like many other hurling panels, Seir Kieran would have considerable trouble adapting to the new rules. They opened their 1974 Senior campaign with a narrow loss to Kinnitty. A bigger defeat followed at the hands of Drumcullen in the next round, but Seir Kieran had another chance in the Senior Hurling 'B' Championship. Seir Kieran defeated St Carthage's (Rahan) to advance to the 'B' Final, played in Birr on 24 November 1974. In a mean- spirited game, Lusmagh took an early lead which they still held when the game was abandoned in the second half. At a County Board Disciplinary Committee hearing on the Wednesday before Christmas, both clubs were fined ¬£20; while two Seir Kieran players and one Lusmagh player were suspended for six months. In spite of the eventual outcome, Seir Kieran took heart from the clear progress that was being made, including in terms of representation on the Offaly hurling panels. Kieran Mooney had been Offaly's top scorer (0-8) in their narrow loss to Dublin in the Leinster U-21 Hurling Final of 1972. Kieran Mooney along with Sean Bergin also represented the club in 1974, when an Offaly side managed by Brother Denis Minehan and captained by a young P√°draig Horan recorded a first-ever win over Dublin in the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship. The Semi-final against Kilkenny took place at Croke Park, where Mooney put Offaly's opening goal past Noel Skehan. (Despite Damien Martin's heroics in the Offaly goals, however, Kilkenny advanced without undue trouble.) Schools hurling and underage hurling Inscription on wall of Seir Kieran National School, Clareen, Co. Offaly, Ireland Even more encouraging for the Club's future was the organized effort being made at primary school level, led in Clareen's case by successive Principals of Seir Kieran National School: Mr. Frank McNamara; Mr. Tony Hogan; Mr. Damien White; Mrs. Majella Gibbons; and Mr. Jonathan Dunne in the present day. In 1974, a team captained by Joe Dooley won Seir Kieran's first Bord na Scol hurling championship. This feat was emulated in 1976, when Mick Mulrooney captained the Bord na Scol team. Seir Kieran went on to claim the Offaly U-14 'B' hurling title for 1976 ‚Äì an achievement indeed for a club that had waited 40 years to win an under-age championship. The school teams were mentored by Damien White N.T., Canon Se√°n Collier, and Tony Murphy; while the U-14s were looked after by Club chairman Paddy Guinan, Canon Collier, Seamus Mulrooney and John Joe Coffey. There was also a big input from the parents and many others in the parish community. Although ultimately unsuccessful, Seir Kieran had also won through to both the Minor 'B' and the U-21 Hurling Finals of 1974. Of the Minor 'B' Final against much-fancied Killeigh, the Midland Tribune reported that \\"At no stage was full back Eugene Coughlan allowed to relax his most extraordinary talents\\". Future stalwarts such as Paddy Mulrooney, Noel Bergin, Jimmy Connor, Mick Coughlan, Johnny Abbott and Joe Mooney also featured. Johnny Abbott played in goals that year for the U-21 team, coached by Tony Murphy. He was kept busy in the U-21 Final against Kinnitty, where much of the Minor panel, augmented by players like Liam Corcoran, Brendan Coughlan, Val Kennedy, Sean Coughlan, Barney Breslin and Joe Bergin, proved no match for a Kinnitty side powered by Pat Delaney, Des Egan and Frank Bergin. Despite this setback, it was clear that Seir Kieran's unfolding horizons were very bright. At the club's AGM for 1975, an intense discussion took place on how to bring on all of the young players. This resulted in something of a \\"new departure\\" for Seir Kieran ‚Äì the establishment of a Minor Club with Seamus Mulrooney as its first chairman.The Music of the Ash, page 92 From the 1960s onward, the Vocational Schools and the other post- primary schools in Offaly had put emphasis on the proper preparation of their GAA teams. This process would receive an important boost with the opening of St. Brendan's Community School in Birr in 1980. The catchment area of the Community School comprises much of Offaly's hurling heartland, as well as contiguous parts of north Tipperary. The experience of winning together for the School tended to dilute the old parochial bitternesses, and to ensure that these students would give of their best for their County later on. Consolidation of senior status The great strides being made at other grades gradually percolated into Seir Kieran's Senior displays also. Although they beat Lusmagh in the 1975 championship, Drumcullen exploited a lack of pace to put an end to the Clareen interest that year. Seir Kieran came within an ace of turning the tables in 1976. A highlight of their first round victory over St Carthage's was Sean Coughlan's tussle with the Rahan centre forward, Pat Corcoran. The second round clash at first seemed like deja vu as Drumcullen amassed a 12-point lead, despite scores from Billy Kennedy and Patsy Coffey and Mick Murphy's chipping in a goal from the corner of the square. A comeback after the interval was stopped just short. In the end, Seir Kieran paid the price for some erratic shooting ‚Äì but they had again put the County on notice that they were a team to watch. This point was driven home in 1977 when, following a narrow first round defeat to Tullamore, Seir Kieran went into the Losers' Group and faced St Rynagh's on a chilly June day at Kilcormac. Throwing down the gauntlet with sturdy ground hurling, the Clareen 15 launched into the attack, and eliminated the five-in-a-row County Champions by 4-9 to 1-11. Seir Kieran next beat Na Piarsaigh to reach the 1977 Losers' Group Final; only to slump to defeat (3-8 to 0-11) to Killeigh at Tullamore. Seir Kieran opened their 1978 campaign with a win against Shinrone. In the second round they met St Rynagh's. Although they beat Killeigh in the third round (4-11 to 1-3), this only led to a tame exit to Coolderry (1-10 to 0-8, of which 0-7 was scored by Kieran Mooney). Late 1970s In 1979, St Rynagh's bested Seir Kieran by 1-17 to 1-3 in the opening round, at Kilcormac on 5 August 1979. A St Rynagh's official expressed relief at the result saying: \\"When we get over that hurdle, other teams don't present quite the same problem.\\"The Music of the Ash, page 102 Seir Kieran beat Killeigh by 2-6 to 1-4 in the next round, despite each side going down to 14 men after hurleys and fists flew. It was a much more disciplined and cohesive Clareen team that fielded in St Brendan's Park for their last competitive game of the 1970s, on 26 August 1979. Seir Kieran beat Drumcullen by 3-11 to 0-9. Seir Kieran and the rise of Offaly, 1975 to 1979=Struggle for consistency Offaly hurling's trajectory in the later 1970s, like that of Seir Kieran, seemed to be a case of two steps forward, one step back. By 1975, future All Stars Pat Fleury (Drumcullen) and Joachim Kelly (Lusmagh) were regulars on the Senior team, while Kieran Mooney represented Seir Kieran. A somewhat laboured 1-14 to 0-11 win over Kildare set up a Leinster Senior Hurling Semi-final clash with Wexford. By the interval Offaly were being beaten stupid, despite Kieran Mooney getting the game's only goal from play; but in a scintillating third- quarter display, Offaly raised nine white flags in 17 minutes. However Wexford maintained their long-range sniping (all six Wexford forwards and their two midfielders scored at least twice) and prevailed by 1-29 to 1-18. The Offaly Minors, including several Seir Kieran players, were making slow but significant progress as well, and ran Wexford close in the Leinster Minor Hurling Semi-final of 1976 (2-15 to 4-8). During the National Hurling League of 1976/77, Offaly began to demonstrate the strength and depth of their hurling revival. Defeating Wicklow and Laois and drawing with Waterford in close, tough pre-Christmas matches, they began the New Year by beating Westmeath then taking Galway by 2-6 to 1-5 in a major upset. Their no-nonsense brand of ground hurling similarly overcame Antrim at Corrigan Park, Belfast to win out Division 1B and advance to the Quarter-finals. Against Wexford at Nowlan Park, the rank outsiders overturned the reigning Leinster champions by 1-12 to 1-8. P√°draig Horan (St Rynagh's) dominated at centre back, while Pat Delaney (Kinnitty) was unerring from placed balls. In the League Semi-final against Clare, at Thurles on 10 April 1977, a 2-15 to 0-7 defeat brought Offaly crashing back to earth; and another costly lesson was learned in the subsequent Leinster Senior Hurling Championship. On a Mullingar pitch made slippery by non-stop rain, Offaly were miles off the pace as Dublin eliminated them by 3-10 to 2-8. Some measure of revenge was exacted by the winning of Offaly's first Walsh Cup against Dublin (7-7 to 1-7), the following 4 December at Birr. Eugene Coughlan's brace of goals were a highlight of an Offaly performance (for those who were there to see) of revelatory force. Breakthrough at U-21 level Success finally came in 1978, when the Offaly Under-21 hurlers annexed the Leinster Title that had narrowly eluded them in 1972. Noel Bergin at corner forward and Joe Mooney at wing back represented Seir Kieran. Wins over Carlow (4-17 to 1-6) and Wexford (5-9 to 1-10) set up a Leinster Final clash with Laois, at Carlow in July 1978, and a 2-14 to 2-7 victory. Jim Troy (Lusmagh) was goalkeeper, and Brendan Keeshan (Shinrone) was captain. Offaly progressed to their first-ever All Ireland U-21 Semi-final ‚Äì and a bitter 2-14 to 2-7 defeat at the hands of a Galway squad whose hurling bore a more authoritative stamp. Despite this sequel, to have made a breakthrough at the consistently excellent U-21 grade could only be a tonic for Offaly hurling. The Senior team could not emulate the U-21s in 1978, submitting meekly to Kilkenny (2-17 to 1-4); but they would pull out all the stops the following year. Administration and Coaching Fr. Sean Heaney was chairman of the Offaly County Board at this stage, while John Dowling continued his long service as Secretary. Two new assistant secretary posts (with responsibility for hurling and for football) were created. In 1978, Seir Kieran's Tony Murphy was elected to the hurling secretary role, in which capacity he would make a singular contribution to the County's success. Persistent and bold experimentation was now a watchword for Offaly management and mentors, as they sought to break the Wexford-Kilkenny stranglehold on the Bob O'Keeffe Cup. One such expedient was to try P√°draig Horan at No. 14; while the erstwhile full forward Eugene Coughlan was switched to defensive duties from 1978 onwards. In the National Hurling League of 1978/79, Offaly showed themselves to be on a par with anything else in Leinster. Drawing with Clare in the opening round ‚Äì an important result for Offaly following their dismal Leinster Championship exit ‚Äì they next faced Wexford in Gorey and recorded a victory that still stands apart. With a Seir Kieran contingent of Eugene Coughlan at corner back, Joe Mooney at wing back and Kieran Mooney at corner forward, Offaly battled back from an 11-point half time deficit to prevail by 2-17 to 0-17. Although less spectacular, of even more significance was the third round victory over Kilkenny (3-10 to 2-6), at Birr on 29 October 1978. Although repeatedly foiled by Damien Martin's goalkeeping, Kilkenny did gain sway for 15 minutes of the second half. But Offaly, with Eugene Coughlan now at centre back, reasserted themselves towards the end of a hard-fought, fair, no-holds-barred encounter and a notable victory. √âamonn Cregan's personal tally of 2-7 for Limerick in the fourth round, at Ennis on 12 November 1978, in itself would have been enough to dispose of Offaly. However, another stirring Offaly performance resulted in a draw against Galway in bitterly cold late November conditions. Eugene Coughlan kept Noel Lane out of contention. The teams were level seven times, with Kieran Mooney's point tying it up with just seconds to go. Defeat to Waterford at Dungarvan in February 1979 did not derail Offaly's advance to the League Semi-Final against Tipperary. Although concession of too many frees again cost Offaly dear, this was an exciting and competitive encounter, with Paddy Kirwan (Ballyskenagh) converting a last- minute free despite the huge tension, to leave it all square (Offaly 4-8, Tipperary 1-17). This form was not maintained in the League Semi-final replay at Croke Park on 15 April, which Tipperary easily won. This was not the best prelude to encountering Wexford in the Leinster Senior Hurling Semi-final, fixed for Athy on 24 June 1979. Nonetheless, the casual beginning to this match gave way to a thrilling climax, when gallant Offaly went down by the minimum. Offaly began with an all-Seir Kieran half back line of Joe Mooney, Eugene Coughlan and Kieran Mooney, with Coughlan in particular doing many fine things at centre back. Lusmagh's Joachim Kelly played a powerful game at midfield, while of the forwards, Pat Carroll (Coolderry) posed the greatest threat. Offaly had their noses in front in the closing stages, but conceded the frees that allowed Buggy to level for Wexford; then Casey pointed from Tony Doran's '65, and Wexford advanced by 0-17 to 2-10. Although this slender defeat was a big setback, the National Hurling League of 1979/80 again indicated that Offaly were not far off. One man playing close attention was Monsignor Tommy Maher of Thomastown, who had revolutionised the coaching of hurling from his base at St Kieran's College. The Monsignor was instrumental in persuading Dermot Healy, of the Conaghy Shamrocks Club, to take up the position of Offaly coach in November 1979.The Godfather Of Modern Hurling ‚Äì The Father Tommy Maher Story On 18 November in Nowlan Park, Offaly had a signal victory (2-9 to 3-4) over Kilkenny, proving that their October 1978 win had been no flash in the pan. Eugene Coughlan was in great form at midfield; P√°draig Horan scored both of Offaly's goals; and newcomer Mark Corrigan (Kinnitty) continued to impress. By this stage Offaly (along with Galway) had become the longest-surviving team in League Division 1. But the Leinster Championship remained the real test. Lifting the Bob O'Keeffe Cup, 1980 and the Liam MacCarthy Cup, 1981=Victory in Leinster, 1980 The Leinster Senior Hurling championship of 1980 was the first to take place under the \\"Open Draw\\" system, meaning that Kilkenny and Wexford would no longer be kept on different sides of the draw. Offaly were trained by Andy Gallagher (Tullamore) as well as Dermot Healy, and the other selectors were Tommy Erritty (Coolderry), Charlie Daly (Na Piarsaigh), Mick Spain (Drumcullen) and Paudge Mulhare (St Rynagh's). Offaly's campaign began at Portlaoise with a 2-10 to 0-12 victory over Laois. Damien Martin's hand injury led to his replacement by Seir Kieran's Noel Bergin, and the other two Clareen players were Eugene Coughlan and Joe Mooney. The Semi-final took place on 8 June 1980, when Offaly beat Dublin (despite an eye injury to Mark Corrigan) by 0-18 to 0-10. The Faithful County were through to their first Leinster Senior Hurling final since 1969, with Damien Martin and Kinnitty's Johnny Flaherty the only players to bridge the gap. The opposition was again Kilkenny, and they also fielded two survivors from the 1969 encounter ‚Äì Noel Skehan and Liam \\"Chunky\\" O'Brien. Before a poor attendance of 9,631, Offaly's seismic 3-17 to 5-10 victory was as glorious for the manner in which it was achieved as for the way it overturned the Faithful County's seven previous defeats at this stage. Offaly won because, apart from the character that allowed them to shrug off the five Kilkenny goals, they had the fitness to harry the aristocrats mercilessly for the entire seventy minutes, and the skill and economy to convert most of their own scoring chances. Kilkenny full forward Matthew Ruth's quicksilver display continued to trouble the Offaly defence even after the introduction of substitute Eugene Coughlan. Nonetheless, it was the rattled Kilkenny mentors who rang in the changes at the start of the second half. Offaly had gone three points down when they were awarded a penalty, which P√°draig Horan blasted shoulder-high. Although Sekhan parried, the talismanic Brendan Bermingham (Lusmagh) pounced to level the match. A minute later Horan sent to Johnny Flaherty, who hand-passed to the net. Ruth got a goal back as Kilkenny almost pulled off a Houdini act; but Ger Henderson's 80-yard free drifted wide and the underdogs clung on. In his Evening Press column the following day, Con Houlihan depicted the post-match scene: :: \\"But then Noel O'Donoghue made a gesture that signified that he had put in the full stop... The joy on the terraces was all-embracing. Every Offaly citizen in the stands seemed to have been catapulted onto the pitch, and we saw men entitled to free travel go bounding across the turf like young greyhounds let loose in the morning.\\" Andy Gallagher's assessment summed it up: \\"They had faith in themselves and in Offaly hurling. Those who opposed the open draw in Leinster got their answer today.\\" It was a day of contrasting emotions for team captain P√°draig Horan ‚Äì not long after he had lifted the massive Bob O'Keeffe Cup, he received word that his father Tommy had died suddenly. The entire Kilkenny hurling team were present at Ballivor, Banagher for the removal to St Rynagh's Church the following evening. Aside from this sad event, Offaly's celebrations were unconfined ‚Äì especially when their Senior footballers overcame Dublin to make it an Offaly Double in Leinster. The hurlers advanced to their first Senior All Ireland Semi-final on 3 August 1980, where a more experienced Galway side narrowly won out (4-9 to 3-10). Eugene Coughlan at corner back was effecting many huge clearances, until he was sent to midfield early in the second half. As the constant drizzle turned into a deluge, Galway went six points up. Although Sylvie Linnane was dismissed, the Tribesmen deftly re- organised and extended their lead to eight points. It took Offaly a while to figure out how to deploy the numerical advantage. Eventually Joe Mooney was brought on as the \\"available\\" attacker, and Brendan Bermingham's goal plus a late 1-1 from Mark Corrigan left it nick-or-nothing at the finish. Only for a short time did defeat put a dampener on Offaly's epochal breakthrough ‚Äì which was given added lustre when Pat Carroll and Joachim Kelly received the Faithful County's first All Star Awards in hurling since Damien Martin in 1971. The 1981 campaign Over the winter of 1980/81, another teak-tough National Hurling League campaign brought the team further on. At Nowlan Park on 19 April 1981, 14-man Offaly held out for a 2-13 to 4-6 League Semi-final win against Laois, after another cliffhanger of hard close pulling. Pat Delaney lofted in a free that Paddy Kirwan sent to the net for what proved the decisive score, despite a furious Laois onslaught in the dying minutes. Some 19,000 spectators came to Thurles on 3 May for the League Final itself. Offaly won the toss and opted to play against the wind and hail ‚Äì only to be rocked by Cork's opening salvo of two goals and three points. Offaly effected a tremendous fightback, holding the Rebels scoreless for the last 14 minutes, but they had left themselves with too steep a climb. Cork took the League Title by 3-11 to 2-8. That year's Leinster Senior Hurling Semi-final (21 June 1981), would be the only championship match of the 1980s or 1990s where Offaly took to the field minus a Seir Kieran contingent. Laois again almost upset the apple cart, as Dermot Healy's charges somehow evaded the usual consequences of piling 20 wides on top of the concession of six goals and ten points. Two penalties and two long-range shots deceived goalie Christy King, while Laois full forward PJ Cuddy had done serious damage by the time Pat Delaney was switched to take him on. Offaly's own tally of 3-20 included a first-half P√°draig Horan goal that had only got in through a big tear in the side netting. Even so, the game was still deadlocked when Offaly were awarded a free over 100 yards out. With the last puck of the game, Paddy Kirwan heroically converted it, for Offaly to reach the Provincial decider by the very skin of their teeth. On the other side of the draw, Wexford had also advanced, to the first Leinster Final without the Cats since 1961. Eugene Coughlan was handed the number 3 jersey for Offaly ‚Äì seven years would go by before any other player would wear it in the Senior Hurling Championship ‚Äì while Damien Martin resumed as first-choice goalkeeper. One of the key duels was Coughlan versus the Wexford full forward, Tony Doran. Early on in the match, amidst a thicket of hurleys that swung on an incoming Wexford ball, Doran went down with a badly gashed forehead and had to be substituted. However, this remained a hum-dinger throughout, as twice Offaly were getting on top and twice Wexford hauled it back. Despite Colm Doran finding the net, from a long-range free two minutes from time, it was Offaly's calmness and self-belief that won out. Damien Martin pucked to P√°draig Horan in midfield, who sent sweetly to Johnny Flaherty and over the bar, to make it 3-12 to 2-13 at the long whistle. The Leinster Champions won direct passage to the All Ireland Final, played on 6 September 1981. The opposition were defending champions Galway, who had overcome Munster champions Limerick in the Semi- final (following a replay). The official attendance of 71,384 (the highest in 18 years) saw Offaly win their first Senior Hurling Title. Galway made the play for long spells, and the Offaly defence absorbed huge pressure. Eugene Coughlan at full back kept John Connolly scoreless, and it was the same for Joe Connolly when he was switched to full forward. Pat Fleury likewise neutralised Bernie Forde, to round out a flawless campaign in which none of Fleury's direct opponents scored at all. At the other end, Pat Carroll's knee- high shot beat Galway goalkeeper Michael Conneely to keep Offaly in touch, notwithstanding Galway's first-half dominance. However, this was a team performance with each line of Offaly's formation sticking to the game plan. They were as disciplined as they were tenacious ‚Äì whereas Joe Connolly converted six times from placed balls in the first half, Offaly conceded just one free after the break. Galway still retained a sizable lead when midfielder Liam Currams (sporting a light beard in what was then a clean-shaven world) soloed forward to score a sweet point. Michael O'Hehir the RTE commentator likened the sliotar on Currams's hurley to \\"a fried egg on a frying pan\\". Centre-back Pat Delaney landed an inspirational point from a huge distance. From the puck-out, Galway quickly sent to Noel Lane in the danger area, who whipped in a ferocious shot. Damien Martin was at full stretch in less than a heartbeat, to somehow turn its trajectory around the upright. Offaly made the most of their reprieve, Johnny Flaherty reducing the margin to two with a well-worked point. Pat Delaney reached skyward to intercept Iggy Clarke's long clearance, laying off to Brendan Bermingham at half forward who hand-passed to Johnny Flaherty, momentarily in the clear. Although the defence converged rapidly, Flaherty palmed over his left shoulder to the net. It was a goal that staggered the Tribesmen, and gave fresh light to the ancient writing on the Walls of Galway: \\"From the fury of the O'Flaherties, Good Lord deliver us\\". Offaly scored twice more for a three-point margin of victory (2-12 to 0-15). Reverberations in Clareen, 1980 and 1981 On the \\"domestic\\" scene, Seir Kieran went down to Kinnitty (1-19 to 3-8) and to Ballyskenagh (4-9 to 4-7) in the 1980 Senior Hurling Championship, and to St Rynagh's (4-16 to 2-7) in 1981. Even so, their contribution to the Faithful County's cause gave a tremendous boost to the profile of the club, and to its grip on the imagination of the rising generation in Clareen. The massive Bob O'Keeffe trophy came to the Seir Kieran National School in March 1981, along with Leinster Championship medal-holders Noel Bergin, Joe Mooney and Eugene Coughlan. Club chairman Tim Mulrooney, Offaly hurling secretary Tony Murphy, and Seamus Mulrooney were in attendance as well. There were even more ebullient scenes when Offaly recorded their famous All Ireland victory over Galway. On the Monday night, preceded by the Mountbolus Pipe Band, the new Champions had a rapturous reception into Emmett Square in Birr. The platform set up for the occasion was a converted articulated trailer provided by Frank Whitten of Clareen. Similar outpourings of pride and acclaim awaited the panel on its tour of the rural hurling strongholds. When they reached Mrs. May Bruce's post office just above the Clareen cross-roads, team captain P√°draig Horan handed the Liam MacCarthy Cup over to Eugene Coughlan, and in that manner the cavalcade arrived in Seir Kieran. Swash-buckling buccaneers 1982 to 1987=Development of the club facilities The Seir Kieran primary school pictured in late 2005, before the rebuilding of 2007-2009. The original school room is to the back and the 1983 extension is in the foreground. At the club's AGM in January 1982, Mick Corrigan of the Racepark was asked to chair a committee looking after the Field Development Scheme. By the close of 1982, the club had also built dressing rooms complete with showers and toilets, put a paling around the field, and installed goalposts and nets. The overall effort received welcome recognition in May 1982, in a presentation to Leinster GAA clubs that took place in the Newpark Hotel in Kilkenny. Seir Kieran were nominated as Offaly's \\"Club of the Year in Section C\\". Chairman Tim Mulrooney and secretary Mick Murphy accepted the award, and attributed the success to the progress made in promoting underage hurling as much as to the work on the facilities. For example, during the 1981 F√©ile na nGael event in Birr, Seir Kieran had played host to young hurlers from Antrim whose club chairman subsequently recorded his appreciation: :: \\"A Chara ‚Äì I refer to the Offaly Hurling Festival for underage players which was held on the 15th to the 17th of May inclusive. This competition was an outstanding success; the precision- like manner in which it was organized was a tribute to Mick Spain and his able helpers. It was the privilege of my club to have been invited to participate in this F√©ile and it was most inspiring to see so many juveniles from all over Leinster display the skills of our national game. Our players were the guests of the Seir Kieran Club and its people. I wish to express our sincerest thanks to V. Rev. Se√°n Collier, PP, Tim Mulrooney and Michael Murphy, Chairman and Secretary respectively of the Seir Kieran Club, and the host families for their extreme kindness. Our players were overjoyed by the reception they received and they will always treasure the weekend they spent in the friendly homes of Clareen. Mise, le meas ‚Äì Arty Pyke (Chairman)\\"Midland Tribune, 11 July 1981 ‚Äì Letter to the Editor A projected rise in population led to an IR¬£60,000 extension to the Seir Kieran National School, officially opened in March 1983 by Dr Laurence Forrestal, the Bishop of Ossory. The Board of Management at that time consisted of Mrs. Bernie Dooley, Mrs. N√≥ir√≠n Coakley, Mrs. Mary Mulrooney, and Mr. Jack Ryan. A year later, the redeveloped GAA pitch was officially opened on Monday 4 June 1984. The Minor hurlers of Offaly and Galway provided the curtain-raiser for a \\"friendly\\" between the Senior teams of Offaly and Clare (which the visitors won by 1-12 to 1-11). John Dowling, a future GAA President, gave the keynote speech. \\"The time has now come\\", said Mr. Dowling, \\"for Seir Kieran to promote Gaelic Games on a higher scale than ever before\\".The Music of the Ash, page 115 County Semi- Finalists 1984; County Finalists 1985 and 1987 On 2 October 1983, a Seir Kieran juvenile selection coached by Michael Connolly (Kinnitty) beat St Saran's in the final of the Offaly U-16 Shield. Birr's Brother Vincent presented the trophy to team captain Kieran Dooley. The following year, a school team captained by Mark Featherstone won the Bord na Scol competition, and got medals specially engraved for the GAA Centenary Year. A \\"back to back\\" Bord na Scol title came in 1985 (when Kieran Abbott was captain), and the team received medals presented by Offaly football's goalkeeping hero Martin Furlong. It was a foretaste of success to come with St Brendan's Community School; with the Offaly Minors and Seniors; and with the Seir Kieran Club itself. The Seir Kieran panel who won the Offaly Juvenile (U-16) Hurling Title of 1983 In their crunch SHC encounter with Coolderry in 1982, Seir Kieran were still leading with ten minutes to go, when they ran out of steam (Coolderry 4-13, Seir Kieran 3-7). Seir Kieran were generally in better shape in 1983. On 29 May, Eugene Coughlan (2-5) and rising Offaly star Joe Dooley (3-1) powered a victory over Killeigh. However, they were beaten by Lusmagh at Rath on 17 July, meaning that the third round match against Coolderry would again be make-or-break. This one ended at 11 points apiece, and the replay on 7 August also finished all square (1-12 to 1-12). Coolderry shaded it extra time by 2-19 to 3-15. The three Clareen goals were scored by Eugene Coughlan, Seamus Coakley and Martin Breslin; nonetheless that was curtains so far as 1983 was concerned. Seir Kieran opened their 1984 SHC campaign with a stunning 3-18 to 2-4 victory over Drumcullen. The second round was at Rath, where Lusmagh went down by 2-10 to 0-9. In the third round against Kinnitty, 16 points (half from frees) were not enough as the reigning champions racked up 3-12, to advance to the last four. A second semi-final slot was now up for grabs between Seir Kieran and Shinrone. This play-off was delayed until 9 September 1984. Joe Dooley scored nine points of a 0-14 to 1-5 victory, as Seir Kieran advanced to their first Senior Semi-final since 1954. As crafty and battle-hardened as ever, St Rynagh's overcame a Clareen team who were on top for long periods, but were not fit enough to close it out. Trailing 1-10 to 1-4 in the second half, the Shannonsiders hit an unanswered 1-5 to pip them at the post. Seir Kieran's trainer for 1985 was Pat Spain of Kinnitty, a first-rate hurler during his own playing days. There were four other selectors ‚Äì Sean Dooley, Tony Murphy, Seamus Kealey and Eugene Coughlan. Their first round encounter with St Rynagh's, on 28 April 1985, reversed the verdict of the previous Autumn (Seir Kieran 2-10 St Rynagh's 0-12). However, Seir Kieran again lived dangerously, before clinging on to a lead they had built up early on. The Midland Tribune editor James \\"Bud\\" Burke colorfully described the scene: :: \\"The swash-buckling buccaneers from the good ship Seir Kieran boarded the St Rynagh's prize ship on the windy Rath sward and fighting a strong battle they subdued the opposition. However the defending St Rynagh's lads rallied and looked like repelling all boarders but Seir Kieran held on and finally hoisted the Jolly Roger.\\"Midland Tribune, 1 May 1985 This remained the pattern during Seir Kieran's four subsequent wins in the championship ‚Äì over St Saran's (2-8 to 2-3); Shinrone (3-7 to 1-7); Drumcullen (3-8 to 2-9); and a (not yet fully amalgamated) Kilcormac/Killoughey team (2-11 to 2-4). The Semi-final took place on 29 September 1985, and Seir Kieran at last defeated Coolderry when it mattered (1-13 to 0-13). Jimmy Connor's goal and several fine Joe Dooley points put them into their first Senior Final in one third of a century. As with Drumcullen in 1952, however, they encountered a Kinnitty side who were not to be denied their three-in-a-row of Offaly Titles. Paddy and Mark Corrigan scored a combined 3-12 of Kinnitty's 3-18, and Seir Kieran only scored 2-8 in reply. It was a chastening experience for the black and amber; but it was clear that their longer-term graph was still pointing upwards. The disappointment was partly assuaged by the All Star Awards won by Eugene Coughlan in both 1984 and 1985 ‚Äì the first such accolades to come to Seir Kieran. Coughlan was also awarded the 1985 Texaco Sports Star Award for hurling, joining a glittering 1985 line-up including Jack O'Shea (Gaelic football), Dennis Taylor (snooker), Pat Jennings (soccer), Barry McGuigan (boxing), Joey Dunlop (motorcycling), and Sean Kelly (cycling).The Music of the Ash, page 122 Seir Kieran's misfired 1986 SHC campaign was a big setback. A 2-13 to 1-11 defeat to Lusmagh did the main damage to the 1985 County finalists, leaving them dependent on results elsewhere to make it as far as the three-way play-offs. These forlorn hopes did not materialize, leading to some straight talking at the AGM for 1987 (the club's 100th year in business). Eugene Coughlan was appointed trainer, and the selectors were Mick Murphy, Johnny Breslin and Liam Corcoran. It was the Junior panel, selected by Michael Connolly, Tim Mulrooney, Mick Coughlan and Mick Mulrooney, who would bring home silverware in 1987. There were jubilant scenes at Kilcormac on 3 May 1987, when Seir Kieran defeated Daingean and team captain Johnny Breslin lifted the Junior Hurling League Cup. As they had done in 1985, meanwhile, the parish's Senior team reached the County Final undefeated. However, although their defence had become very cohesive, the attack was over-reliant on Joe Dooley. A 2-13 to 0-13 first-round win over Birr was followed by hard-fought victories over St Rynagh's (2-4 to 0-9) and Lusmagh (3-12 to 1-7). Seir Kieran next overcame Kinnitty by 1-14 to 1-11 in the Semi-final in September. Centre back Mick Coughlan's long-range points had a demoralizing effect on Kinnitty. In the County Final itself, however, Seir Kieran again lacked the guile to prevent St Rynagh's move into the lead in the 54th minute. Team captain Noel Bergin and substitute Kieran Dooley had had to go off injured. There were still only three points in it when Eugene Coughlan's late rasper flew just over David Hughes's crossbar, to leave it St Rynagh's 0-11 Seir Kieran 0-9. Defeat felt more devastating even than in the 1985 County Final, because the Clareen men had had the winning of this match. Re-capturing the Leinster Crown, 1984 Mick Coughlan and Joe Dooley represented Seir Kieran in the Leinster U-21 hurling championship in 1982. Offaly beat Westmeath in Tullamore by 3-15 to 1-7 in the Semi-final, with Coughlan scoring 2-0 and Dooley 0-5. Although Dooley added 0-4 in the Final in Carlow, three rapid-fire Kilkenny goals killed off the match before half time (5-20 to 2-6). In the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship, the reigning champions overcame Wexford by 2-16 to 3-12 in an enthralling and grueling opening round. Offaly showed their composure when Wexford went a goal ahead in the closing stages. P√°draig Horan's brace of pointed frees and Paddy Kirwan's point from play leveled it, then Kirwan sent over the winner from a brilliant sideline cut deep in the shadow of the Cusack Stand. The Semi-final against Laois was another pulsating game, ending all-square at 3-14 apiece. Pat Delaney was misplaced at corner back and Pat Carroll at midfield, and Offaly shot 21 wides. There was no such experimentation in the replay. Eugene Coughlan suppressed Laois full forward PJ Cuddy and also set up many attacks, as Dermot Healy's men won by 2-17 to 0-14. A fortnight later, on 25 July 1982, it was a very confident Offaly team that returned to Croke Park seeking the three-in-a-row of Leinster Titles. This intriguing Offaly-Kilkenny duel settled into a tight and dour affair. Nonetheless Eugene Coughlan, who allowed not an inch to the quick-turning and tricky Liam Fennelly, seemed to epitomize Offaly's cool control of this match. Eight minutes from full-time, however, when goalie Damien Martin was tracking a Kilkenny ball that seemed to have gone over the end line, the umpire stayed where he was. The referee didn't whistle for a puck-out either. Liam Fennelly deftly flicked the ball to between the posts, where Matt Ruth was arriving to tap to the empty net for the only goal of the game. Con Houlihan subsequently wrote of the umpire: \\"I doubt the good man enjoyed a hearty dinner last evening\\". Nonetheless, even from his usual vantage-point on the terraces at the Canal End, Houlihan himself could not definitively say whether the ball had crossed the line.Evening Press, 26 July 1982 ‚Äì After The Ball Was Over Offaly were still on level terms after conceding the goal, but sent wide from two subsequent frees. Kilkenny scored two late points to re-claim the Bob O'Keeffe Cup by 1-11 to 0-12. It was a bitter derailment for an Offaly side which was then at the peak of its powers. In March 1983 Aidan \\"the Boo\\" Rosney of Birr, collapsed and died while training with his Offaly teammates in Tullamore. He was 19 years old, and one of Offaly hurling's most exciting and stylish prospects. It was a saddened yet determined squad which advanced to the 1983 Leinster Final against the Cats, by virtue of a 1-20 to 0-11 Semi- final win over Dublin. Kilkenny had a more clear-cut 1-17 to 0-13 victory this time, although Offaly's first-time ground hurling was a delight to watch and at no stage were they out of contention. Early in the second half Kilkenny's number 14, Christy Heffernan, switched to left corner forward with Liam Fennelly moving to full forward. Each of the Offaly defence followed his opponent; but with the masterful Eugene Coughlan drawn out of position, Kilkenny now had sea-room. Offaly's own switches in attack did not work out on the day, and Paddy Corrigan's goal was disallowed. In a re-run of 1982, Kilkenny would go on to defeat Cork in the 1983 All Ireland Final. Eugene Coughlan, Joe Dooley, Noel Bergin and Mick Coughlan were the four Clareen men on the Offaly Senior panel for the 1984 campaign, which began on 17 June with a 2-11 to 1-11 Leinster Semi-final win over Dublin. Pat Delaney was out through injury, resulting in the Offaly defence being under constant pressure. Joe Dooley, who otherwise would have started, was also injured. Padraig Horan was just back from his unsuccessful run for the D√°il seat left vacant by the untimely death of Mr. Ber Cowen (which was won by the late T.D.'s son Mr. Brian Cowen, a future Taoiseach). Horan didn't score himself but he did unsettle the Dublin defence. In the second half Eugene Coughlan was taken off injured and a fighting Dublin side finally began to make inroads. However the Sky Blue challenge deflated after their second penalty was stopped, lifted and cleared by Aidan Fogarty, all in the one fluid motion in the teeth of the charging Dubs. In the thrilling Offaly v Wexford Leinster Senior Hurling Final on 8 July 1984, Joe Dooley made his Championship debut and scored 0-2. In all, nine Offaly players found the range, each score proving vital to a 1-15 to 2-11 victory. The decisive goal was scored by Padraig Horan. For Wexford, one point was all that Tony Doran was able to prise out of the rock-like and imperturbable Eugene Coughlan at number 3. Coughlan, as well as midfielder Tom Conneely (St Rynagh's), got a particularly rousing reception when the new Leinster Champions arrived in Birr at midnight. This form was continued in a 4-15 to 1-10 All Ireland Semi-final win over Galway (5 August 1984 at Thurles). Joachim Kelly's power and pace at midfield set the tempo. Joe Dooley's 2-3 made him top scorer, but overall this was an emphatic team performance; and Offaly were seen as having the edge ahead of the Centenary All Ireland against Cork. The unaccustomed \\"favorites\\" tag did not sit well with the team management. Mindful of Cork's great comeback in the Munster Final, Tony Murphy queried: \\"Just how good were Galway? If I knew that I'd be happier.\\"The Music of the Ash page 119 On 2 September 1984, Cork comprehensively won the All Ireland Final by 3-16 to 1-12. Offaly's scorers were Mark Corrigan (1-2), Pat Carroll and Pat Delaney (0-4 each), and Padraig Horan (0-2). Denis Mulcahy kept Joe Dooley well shackled (although, of the 32 hurlers in action that day, Dooley alone would take part in the brace of classic Offaly v Cork All Ireland Semi-finals at the close of the Century.) Seanie O'Leary (2-1),John Fenton (0-7) and Tony O'Sullivan (0-6) were the chief scorers for Cork, and they did the main damage when Offaly faded out in the third quarter. Eugene Coughlan kept Jimmy Barry-Murphy scoreless (ensuring that he would be nominated for Seir Kieran's first All Star Award that Autumn). Nonetheless, it was a somber and downcast Offaly panel that departed Semple Stadium. Their County saw things differently. \\"WELCOME HOME TO OFFALY'S OWN HEROES\\", ran the Midland Tribune's banner headline over a picture of a thronged and appreciative Emmett Square that night.Midland Tribune, 5 September 1984 ‚Äì front page Re-capturing the McCarthy Cup, 1985 The disappointments of Offaly's previous three campaigns, coupled with the continued belief of their supporters, made for an uncommon determination to win back the McCarthy Cup in 1985. Even so, they nearly lost the opening round of the Leinster Championship on 23 June, which ended Offaly 3-18, Kilkenny 3-18. Pat Delaney at centre back did most to hold Offaly together in the first half, while Mark Corrigan's 1-2 made him Offaly's top scorer from play. Nonetheless, when Christy Heffernan palmed the ball past Offaly's new custodian Jim Troy (Lusmagh) to put Kilkenny up 3-11 to 1-8, the Leinster Crown seemed to be slipping away. Only then did the defending champions (including Seir Kieran's Eugene Coughlan, Joe Dooley and Mick Coughlan) pull out all the stops. From a free awarded outfield and to the left, Paddy Corrigan caught Kilkenny napping by going for goal and making it. With a quarter of an hour to go, Pat Delaney lifted another massive free, doubled on by Joachim Kelly for a beautiful goal that set up the most gripping of grandstand finishes. Although Kilkenny regained the lead, another coolly taken Paddy Corrigan free tied it up. The replay on 14 July was another thrilling and sparkling game, with the difference that Offaly kept the whip hand throughout. Eugene Coughlan blotted out Christy Heffernan, Aidan Fogarty kept tabs on Liam Fennelly, while Pat Fleury also reasserted himself. Offaly won by 1-20 to 0-17, and their scorers were Paddy Corrigan (1-11, 0-7 frees), Pat Carroll (0-3), Pat Cleary (0-3), Mark Corrigan (0-2) and Danny Owens (0-1). The Seir Kieran panel that reached the Club's first Offaly Senior Hurling Final since 1952, on 13 October 1985. This was only the second time in a century that Kilkenny had been locked out of consecutive Leinster Finals,Kilkenny: The GAA Story page 54 and the first time since 1948 that both Kilkenny and Wexford were gone before mid-July. The Leinster Final took place between Offaly and Laois on 21 July 1985, and resulted in an Offaly victory by 5-15 to 0-17. Dermot Healy's selection exuded confidence and dominated in every sector, especially at full back where Eugene Coughlan restricted Laois's PJ Cuddy to a single point. When Offaly had taken to the field the old Stadium shook with cheers. Laois had tremendous support as well, and went down fighting. Offaly's captain Pat Fleury took the Bob O'Keeffe Cup over to Matt Connor immediately. 25-year-old Connor, perhaps the Faithful County's most outstanding footballer of all time, had been badly hurt in a car crash on Christmas Day 1984. On 3 August 1985, the Leinster Champions went to Monaghan Town, preparatory to their All Ireland Semi-final encounter, across the border in Armagh City, the following day. Weather conditions were atrocious, although this did not impede Offaly's emphatic victory over Antrim (3-17 to 0-12). Pat Carroll lined out at number 11, but was soon replaced by Declan Fogarty. (This would turn out to be the last glimpse of Pat Carroll on the hurling field). In Croke Park, 90 miles to the south, Galway were meanwhile de-throning the Rebels in a pulsating game, setting up a repeat of the classic decider of 1981. The Final took place at GAA Headquarters on 1 September, and saw Galway tearing into the game at a frantic pace, only to squander many scoring chances. Ten of Galway's 19 wides came in the opening 20 minutes. Having absorbed ferocious pressure, Offaly settled into their own game-plan. Eugene Coughlan kept Galway full forward Noel Lane from repeating the damage Lane had done against Cork. Brendan Bermingham effectively marked another of Galway's Semi-final stars, 21-year-old Tony Keady (who had lost his father that August). Padraig Horan at full forward distributed very effectively, and the other Offaly forwards tacked on points when it mattered. Midway through the first half, Joe Dooley raced in to hand-pass past Galway custodian Peter Murphy, only for it to be adjudged a square infringement. However, Pat Cleary darted through to score two crucial goals, the second of which (early in the second half) seemed to put Offaly in the driving seat. Then PJ Molloy at wing forward and Joe Cooney at midfield initiated a comeback by the Tribesmen. When Michael \\"Hopper\\" McGrath lobbed a ball in, Molloy leapt highest before rifling a sublime goal to the roof of the net. Another Galway goal, from Joe Cooney's long-range effort, was not given when Jim Troy let fly to clear the ball from just inside his goal-line. Brendan Keeshan was introduced to take on Cooney. The mentors made wholesale switches in the closing stages, and Offaly emerged victorious by 2-11 to 1-12. The Irish Independent deemed the two-point winning margin to be \\"a fair and factual summary of seventy minutes of hazard and hope.\\"Irish Independent, Monday 2 September 1985 ‚Äì match report Dermot Healy said that he had had no doubts, because \\"the attitude was right\\".The Music of the Ash, page 121 In evoking the absence through illness of Pat Carroll, Offaly County Board chairman Paudge Mulhare said: \\"You have won an All Ireland for Pat. This is for him and I thank you for that.\\" The McCarthy Cup's return to the Faithful County was as memorable as it had been four years before, not least in Seir Kieran where the Offaly panel (including four parishioners, Eugene and Mick Coughlan, Joe Dooley and Joe Mooney) had a raucous reception on Tuesday, 3 September 1985. Over the following two years, there would be equally heartening triumphs at Colleges and Minor level, and Clareen players would feature in each case. Lifting the Dr. Croke Cup and the Irish Press Cup, 1986 and 1987 The passing of Pat Carroll in March 1986, at the age of 30, came as a big blow to Coolderry and to Offaly. It also signified the break-up of the team that had delivered four Leinster and two All Ireland Titles in six short years. Offaly remained a force to be reckoned with, however, and in June 1986 they beat Laois by 1-23 to 4-9 to qualify for the Leinster Final. When Laois began to get the upper hand, Joe Dooley was switched to midfield and turned in a \\"man of the match\\" performance. The same tactic was not effective in the Final itself. With Jim Troy and Aidan Fogarty out through injury, League champions Kilkenny swamped the Offaly defence and won their 51st Leinster Title by 4-11 to 1-11. Only 0-5 of the Offaly total came from play. Pat Delaney's twice-taken penalty closed the gap to five points, but this would be Offaly's last score. P√°draig Horan's retirement the following winter opened another gap in Offaly's attack formation. Apart from Martin Hanamy (St Rynagh's) and Seamus Coughlan (Kinnitty) the Faithful County had few fresh faces to call on for the 1987 campaign. On 31 May 1987, Offaly showed craft and character to beat Dublin (2-18 to 1-13), exemplified by Joe Dooley's left-handed swing connecting to score the decisive goal ‚Äì but the team failed to score in the last 18 minutes. Similarly, Laois had Offaly on the rack for much of the Semi-final. Jim Troy had to be brilliant between the posts. Eugene Coughlan and Aidan Fogarty combined well under heavy pressure, as the Faithful County won out (1-16 to 0-13). 29,133 spectators were in Croke Park when Offaly contested their eighth Leinster Final in a row in warm August sunshine. They were chronically short of attack options and only scored 0-3 after the break. For Kilkenny, Christy Heffernan almost single-handedly dislocated Offay's half back line. Liam Fennelly's goal and midfielder Ger Fennelly's hail of points ensured that the Cats prevailed by 2-14 to 0-17. While it was demoralising to have lost the Leinster Final twice in a row, the success being garnered by Offaly's youth teams held out the prospect of better days to come. Seir Kieran's Ger Connors was corner back on the St Brendan's Community School team that reached the 1985 All Ireland Colleges Senior Final, losing to the North Monastery in a replay (4-11 to 1-5). The Community School went one better in 1986, with a stunning 5-8 to 1-8 victory over \\"the North Mon\\" in the All Ireland Final, played out on 27 April 1986 at Portlaoise. Billy Dooley (1-1) and Aidan Mulrooney represented Seir Kieran. Team captain Michael Hogan (Birr) lifted the Dr. Croke Cup. The captaincy passed to Billy Dooley the following year. In the Leinster Colleges Final against St Kieran's College Kilkenny, played at Portlaoise on 22 March 1987, a gallant St Brendan's team were beaten by 4-8 to 3-9. Billy Dooley scored 1-7 and his younger brother Johnny scored 1-0. Johnny Pilkington of Birr scored another goal, while Brian Whelahan, also of Birr, was corner forward. For the Kilkenny boys, Adrian Ronan lined out at corner forward while D.J. Carey came on as a substitute in the second half. The Community School provided the bulk of the Offaly team that won the All Ireland Minor Hurling Final in 1986. The first round against Kilkenny resulted in a 2-8 to 2-8 draw. A breathtaking replay on 1 June saw Offaly prevail by 3-9 to 4-5. Having beaten Dublin 2-10 to 0-7 in the Semi-final, Offaly won their first Leinster Minor title on 13 July 1986 against Wexford (4-7 to 1-5). The All Ireland Semi-final against Galway (10 August at Thurles) was another wonderful match, which went down to the wire despite the more comfortable-looking 3-13 to 2-10 score-line. It was back to Croke Park on 7 September, where Offaly triumphed over Cork by 3-12 to 3-9 to claim the Irish Press Cup. After 20 minutes Cork's Rory O'Connor was red- carded for a second bookable offence, yet Cork might still have won. It took sublime finishing by Declan Pilkington to beat the Rebel goalie Paddy Barry. In the end, though, a spirited Offaly side deserved their victory. At the Seir Kieran buffet in the County Arms Hotel in February 1987, presentations were made to Billy Dooley and Aidan Mulrooney on having brought to the club its first All Ireland hurling medals at the Colleges and Minor grades. Offaly successfully defended their Minor Title the following year. Billy Dooley scored three lovely points from play in Offaly's 3-16 to 2-9 win over Wexford. Damage to the Croke Park pitch, sustained during a U2 concert that summer, led to the postponement of the Leinster Minor Final. In the interim, Offaly deployed four of their Minor panel in the Under-16 Hurling Championship at Nowlan Park ‚Äì a day-long 15-a-side \\"blitz\\" competition starting with nine teams. With Johnny Dooley and Kevin Kinahan of Seir Kieran, Offaly won out this U-16 All Ireland by beating Kilkenny North 1-4 to 0-1. When the Leinster Minor Final against Kilkenny did go ahead, at Croke Park on 2 August 1987, Offaly's fast-moving and nippy team gave a great display in which not one of them stood back, and were utterly deserving of their 2-13 to 0-12 victory. Billy Dooley at centre forward scored 1-0, while Johnny Dooley lined out beside him at left half forward. The All Ireland Semi-final took place two weeks later at Dundalk, where Offaly beat Antrim by 4-17 to 1-4. Johnny Dooley and goalie John Troy were the only non-Birr players in a \\"magnificent seven\\" Offaly defenders. (Dooley was switched to the forwards in the second half). In the All Ireland Minor Hurling Final on 6 September 1987, Offaly beat Tipperary by 2-8 to 0-12, to become the first Minor hurlers since Cork in 1978/9 to put All Ireland titles back-to-back. Johnny Dooley lined out at left half back, while Billy Dooley started at centre forward but scored 0-2 when switched to wing forward. When Tipperary stretched their lead early in the second half, Offaly never let their heads drop and their direct first-time hurling eventually paid off. Thomas Moylan the captain hoisted the Irish Prress Cup, which the team took on a slow \\"victory march\\" through the County. They were mobbed at Edenderry, Daingean, Tullamore, Kilcormac and finally Birr, where Paudge Mulhare said that Offaly hurling's future had never looked so bright as it did that day. Lifting the Sean Robbins Cup ‚Äì Seir Kieran in 1988=NHL and Leinster Championship, spring and summer 1988 The National Hurling League of 1987/88 again featured three Seir Kieran players, Eugene Coughlan, Mick Coughlan and Joe Dooley. Starting out in Division 2, Offaly beat Laois in Birr in October 1987 (3-11 to 0-11) then beat Dublin in Tullamore in November (2-8 to 0-6). Big wins over Roscommon and Kerry preceded the Christmas break, then a similarly lop-sided game against Westmeath (5-11 to 1-3) on 23 February 1988 put Offaly into the League Quarter-final. The Westmeath game saw Eugene Coughlan play in the forwards for Offaly for the first time since May 1980. Although the same switch did not work so well in the Quarter-final in March, Offaly had an unexpected 2-11 to 1-13 victory over Galway, the reigning League and All Ireland champions. Mark Corrigan sent over a point in the last minute to clinch this match. At the Semi-final on 10 April 1988, Wexford seemed to be in pole position after scoring two second half goals, but Offaly kept snapping at their heels. For the crucial equalizing goal, Pat O'Connor (Coolderry) sent up the right wing where Ronald Byrne (Lusmagh) doubled on the ball to send to Eugene Coughlan. Coughlan gathered and passed over his head to Joe Dooley, who coolly netted a low shot. Offaly won out by 2-16 to 3-11, to reach only their second League Final. On 24 April 1988, Offaly went down to Tipperary in what was still a thrilling and memorable League Final. Eugene Coughlan was the only Offaly forward to score from play, in contrast to Tipp's spread of scoring forwards. Joe Dooley lined out beside Joachim Kelly at midfield. Aidan Fogarty did well on Nicholas English. Corner back Martin Hanamy (St Rynagh's) consolidated his first team status, as did Michael Duignan (also St Rynagh's) when he was brought on. Mick Coughlan at centre back was having a great game on Donie O'Connell, then he was injured and replaced by PJ Martin. Tipperary were up by 2-13 to 0-8 when Eugene Coughlan finished to the net. A couple of minutes later Mark Corrigan fired a second major when Joachim Kelly was brought down; and Ken Hogan's goal survived other close calls. Tipperary lifted the siege and themselves added 1-2, for a final score-line of 3-15 to 2-9. In the Leinster Senior Hurling Semi-final, Offaly looked in trouble for long spells against Dublin, but had the skill and experience to win by 2-13 to 2-10. The Offaly goals were scored by Joe Dooley and Declan Fogarty. Offaly had given much to ponder ahead of their ninth consecutive Leinster Final appearance, this time against Wexford. On 10 July 1988, Offaly showed grit, character and great passion to seal their fifth Leinster Title, by 3-12 to 1-14. Mick Coughlan's inspirational catches epitomized the superiority of the defence. Eugene Coughlan's height at the edge of the square caused the Wexford rearguard much anxiety, while Joe Dooley's two goals made him top scorer. The subsequent All Ireland Semi-final on 7 August 1988 resulted in defeat to Galway (Galway 3-18, Offaly 3-11). The Tribesmen picked off points from everywhere and 3-14 of their total came from play (compared to Offaly's 2-5). Even so, a brace of Pat Delaney goals brought Offaly right back into contention in the closing stages; but they failed to tack on the points. Seir Kieran, Senior Hurling Champions 1988 Seir Kieran in 1988 were managed by 24-year-old Joe Dooley (trainer), Johnny Breslin, Liam Corcoran and Mick Murphy. The Juniors (trained by John Joe Coffey) beat Daingean to retain the League Cup they had won in 1987, and Billy Kennedy the Junior captain received the Cup from Tony Murphy the Offaly Hurling Secretary. The Seniors made it a League double on Saturday 7 May, when they beat Drumcullen in the Final by 2-14 to 1-9. This was an excellent game, played at championship pace throughout. Two rounds of the 1988 Offaly SHC had been played off before the inter-county championships. Seir Kieran had won against Lusmagh by 3-13 to 1-16 but lost against St Rynagh's by 2-15 to 2-9. The black and amber had their chances in the Banagher game, but accuracy was a problem. The selectors used practice matches, such as the one against Castletowngeoghegan at Durrow, to sharpen up their side. When the domestic championship resumed on 13 August, a hard-fought 3-16 to 4-4 win over Coolderry kept the dream alive. Seir Kieran again faced St Rynagh's in the first leg of the resultant three-way play-off. On a resplendent Rath pitch, Seir Kieran reversed the previous verdict by 3-11 to 2-11 and became the first side to reach the last four. The Semi-final between Seir Kieran and Kinnitty was delayed on account of three events: an early-morning fire in The Greyhound Bar in Birr, which tragically claimed the life of the proprietor John Kennedy, a member of the Seir Kieran Club; Kinnitty's successful appeal against disqualification for not having fulfilled a fixture; and a bereavement affecting the Bergin family of Derrykeale. When the match did go ahead on 9 October, Kinnitty never really recovered from Seir Kieran's 3-1 in the opening minutes, although two goals by Paddy Corrigan and points from Mark Corrigan, Brendan Blake and Pat Delaney got them to within four points. It was the Clareen men who finished the stronger, however, to win by 5-9 to 2-10. Five Seir Kieran forwards ‚Äì Mick Mulrooney, Johnny Dooley, Joe Dooley, Billy Dooley, and Noel Bergin ‚Äì got on the scoreboard, as did Mick Coughlan at centre back. The Clareen goalie Liam Coughlan gave a great display, although another big tally of wides remained a cause for concern going into the County Final. Played out at St Brendan's Park, Birr, on 23 October 1988, between Seir Kieran and St Rynagh's, the 93rd County Final resulted in a four-point black and amber victory (by 3-13 to 4-6 for the Banagher men). The starting line-up was Liam Coughlan, Sean Coughlan, Eugene Coughlan, Paddy Mulrooney, Johnny Abbott, Mick Coughlan (0-1), Ger Connors, Pat Mulrooney (0-1), Kieran Dooley, Johnny Dooley (0-3), Jimmy Connor, Noel Bergin, Mick Mulrooney (1-0), Joe Dooley (0-4) and Billy Dooley (2-4). For the Shannonsiders, Fintan Dolan scored 2-3, Declan Fogarty 2-0, and Michael Duignan converted three frees. In one of the key individual tussles, Kieran Dooley curbed Duignan's influence at midfield. Overall, Seir Kieran had the speed, skill, spirit and determination to become the tenth club to claim the Offaly Title, and the first new name on the Trophy since St Rynagh's themselves in 1965.The Music of the Ash, page 132 The Seir Kieran panel that won their Club's first Offaly Senior Hurling Title in October 1988 Club of the Year It fell to Eugene Coughlan to lift the Sean Robbins Cup on behalf of his 101-year-old club, presented to him by Mr. Brendan Ward who was then vice chairman of the County Board. The captain's acceptance speech paid tribute to the entire panel of players, their selectors, the club officials, the supporters who had been with the team through all the highs and lows, and especially the team trainer Joe Dooley. Celebrations in Clareen continued until well into the following week, with almost everything else put on hold. Messages of congratulation poured in from the parish's diaspora and many others, while the Bishop of Ossory, Dr. Forrestal, drove up from Kilkenny to convey his congratulations in person. Two weeks later, in their very first match in the Leinster Club Hurling Championship, Seir Kieran beat the Meath champions Trim by 2-14 to 0-6. The Leinster Club Semi-final took place on Saturday 20 November at Geraldine Park, Athy, where Buffers Alley of Wexford knocked out the Offaly champions by 1-12 to 1-7. The leg injury that affected Joe Dooley was a factor, but a bigger factor in Seir Kieran's defeat was the large number of frees early on that they failed to convert.The Music of the Ash, page 135 Notwithstanding this sequel, winning its first Senior county championship made 1988 an epochal year in the club's history. At the Offaly GAA Convention for 1989, Pat Grogan the Seir Kieran chairman accepted the accolade of \\"Club of the Year\\". There was further celebration the following St. Kieran's Day, 5 March 1989, when Dr. Forrestal announced to thunderous applause that Fr. Se√°n Collier was being made Canon of the Cathedral Chapter of St. John's, Kilkenny. The new Canon, 21 years in Seir Kieran, was left speechless. Two years later, On 21 April 1991, Fr. Se√°n died suddenly and unexpectedly. The first President of the Seir Kieran GAA Club, the Canon had been born in Portlaoise in 1917 and ordained on 8 June 1941. Initially posted to the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle (England), he returned home at Christmas 1945 and became curate then Administrator of St John's Parish, Kilkenny. Transferred to Seir Kieran as Administrator in 1968, he was made Parish Priest in 1982. As the first incumbent PP to die in Seir Kieran since the 1830s,Relating to Roscomroe, page 54 he was interred on Bell Hill beside the church. Dr. Forrestal led the Requiem Mass, and termed the grief of the parishioners \\"a genuine expression of love and respect for a parish priest who was loyal to them and had served with them to the end.\\"Midland Tribune, 25 April 1991 Five years of frustration, 1989 to 1993=The County Finals of 1989 and 1991 Seir Kieran retained their Senior Hurling League title in 1989, beating Lusmagh on 14 May by 3-13 to 1-10. Since the inception of the SHL, the winners had always gone on to win the championship as well. However, this was not the way it turned out in 1989, and it was Lusmagh who would emerge on top in October. The Clareen side started the championship with wins over Kinnitty (28 May), and Kilcormac/Killoughey (17 September, by a two-point margin), which was enough to qualify for the Semi-finals ‚Äì and to make the last match in the group stages just a formality. This third-round game took place against St Rynagh's on 24 September. Two goals from Pat Mahon and 0-7 from Johnny Dooley meant that Seir Kieran led for most of the way, until Declan Fogarty's last-minute goal swung it (St Rynagh's 3-9, Seir Kieran 3-8). In the Semi-final against Birr, Seir Kieran contained Birr dangerman Ray Landy reasonably well, until Landy scored the townsmen's only goal two minutes from time (Seir Kieran 3-10, Birr 1-9). In the Final on 22 October 1989, an exciting game of great intensity teetered first one way and then another. Lusmagh scored 0-6 from play in the last 20 minutes, to cut the defending champions' lead to two points. In the last minute of play, John Kelly scored a goal for the Reds. Pat Horan blew the long whistle soon after, and Lusmagh (trained by Joachim Kelly and captained by Jim Troy) had deservedly won their first Title by 1-11 to 1-10. Seir Kieran reached the Senior Hurling League Final for the third time in succession on 22 April 1990,The Music of the Ash, page 141 only to lose by four points to a fast-maturing Birr side.Magic Memories, page 119 The black and amber also failed to qualify for the last stages of the 1990 Senior Hurling Championship. A 0-12 to 0-10 loss to St Rynagh's in the opening round was made up for by impressive wins over Birr (2-13 to 0-10) and Kinnitty (4-15 to 0-11). However, Birr had regrouped to beat St Rynagh's and force a three-way play-off, involving those two teams and Seir Kieran. In the first leg of this play-off, on 18 September 1990 at Rath, Birr shocked Seir Kieran by 0-12 to 1-6 to qualify for the Semi-finals. Liam Coughlan the goalkeeper gave the one flawless display, in a Clareen defence much more troubled than for a long time past. The losers had to play St Rynagh's again on 23 September, with the other Semi-final slot at stake. Despite seeming to be in control for most of the way, Seir Kieran conceded 1-3 in the last four minutes and were eliminated by 2-9 to 1-10. Seir Kieran signaled that they were still contenders in 1991 with an opening round 2-12 to 1-8 win over Coolderry. Kevin Kinahan was centre back, and his commanding display led to his selection for the Offaly U-21 hurling team that year. In the second round on 20 July, Seir Kieran also had a big win (3-14 to 0-6) over Tullamore. The Offaly County Board postponed the third round of SHC games, in order to allow Seir Kieran's Johnny Dooley, Lusmagh's John Troy, and Birr's Brian Whelahan and Johnny Pilkington to participate in the U-21 Shinty international against Scotland. (This match was played at Limerick on 27 July 1991,when Ireland and Scotland scored six goals apiece.) Seir Kieran's third- round clash with Birr eventually went ahead on 17 August, and finished Birr 1-17 Seir Kieran 0-8. Birr also had 18 wides as Seir Kieran were out-played in every sector. In their resulting play-off game (14 September at Rath), Seir Kieran bounced back to win by 2-17 to Coolderry's 1-10. In the Semi-final against Lusmagh on 30 September, the black and amber won a tense encounter by 1-13 to 0-12. The County Final took place on 13 October 1991, and the persistent drizzle did not impede a high-standard game with plenty of direct first-time hurling. Seir Kieran capitalized on their early opportunities, but Birr made the crucial switches which forced the Clareen men onto the defensive for most of the second half. It was still deadlocked in the last minute, when the Birr goalkeeper (Paddy Kirwan from Ballyskenagh) came forward to convert the 65' free to make it Birr 1-12, Seir Kieran 1-11.Magic Memories, page 120 Of the five County Finals that they had contested in the past seven years, Seir Kieran had now lost four. Seir Kieran continued to have success in other grades. In November 1989 the following panel ‚Äì including several from Killavilla, with whom Seir Kieran were joined for the purposes of under-age hurling ‚Äì defeated Ballyskenagh to win the Juvenile (U-16) 'B' Hurling Title: Finbarr Murphy, Ray Fitzpatrick, Owen Breslin, Damien Coffey, Aidan O'Neill, Damien Murphy (captain), Neville Phelan, Kevin Abbott, John Dooley, Pat Grogan, Stephen Coakley, Roy Makim, Paul Scully, John Coakley, TJ Dooley, Peter Breslin, Michael Carroll, Joe Guinan, Tadhg Mulrooney, Kieran Kealey (goalie), Ollie Fitzpatrick, and James Coakley. The team was trained by Michael Corrigan. The club's morale was also lifted by continuing to punch above its weight during Offaly hurling's Minor, U-21, NHL, and Leinster Championship campaigns of 1989, 1990 and 1991. Offaly hurling in transition, 1989 and 1990 Having gone down badly to Kilkenny in the Leinster Minor Hurling Final of 1988 (when Aidan Mulrooney and Johnny Dooley represented Seir Kieran), the Offaly Minors proved unstoppable the following year, beating Wexford and Dublin to qualify for a re-match against the Cats in the Leinster Final (9 July 1989). This was a great, fast and open game and ended at 14 points apiece. Offaly won the replay at Portlaoise by 4-13 to 0-13. Kevin Flynn (2), Raymond Dooley and Ronan McNamara were the goal- scorers, while a Kilkenny attack that included Charlie Carter failed to beat John Troy. In the All Ireland Semi-final, Offaly lived dangerously against a fast and skillful Down team, before winning by 1-11 to 1-5. They had sharpened up considerably by the first Sunday in September, and triumphed over Clare (2-16 to 1-12) for the Faithful County's third Minor Title in four years. Brian Whelahan was captain. Offaly played almost to exhibition standard at times, although Clare proved a tough nut to crack. Niall Hand goaled for Offaly after four minutes, and again just before half time when Davy Fitzgerald the Clare custodian failed to cut out Adrian Cahill's pass. Cahill himself scored 0-3, as did Oisin O'Neill, while Raymond Dooley (line-ball) and Ronan McNamara each contributed 0-1. Johnny Dooley scored 0-8, bringing his tally over the entire campaign to 42 points (of which 24 had been from placed balls). In between these Minor games, Dooley had been teaming up with his brother Billy on the Offaly U-21 hurling panel, who came up just short against Tipperary in the 1989 All Ireland Final. Pat Joe Whelahan coached both the U-21 and the Senior hurlers that year. Offaly had first beaten Westmeath (6-19 to 0-6), and then Laois (2-11 to 1-9) in the Leinster Semi-final. John Troy's bravura performance in the Offaly goals kept Laois at bay. On 23 July 1989 at Portlaoise, Offaly defeated Kilkenny by 3-16 to 3-9 for their first Leinster U-21 Title since their breakthrough eleven years before. Offaly looked like they might be caught when DJ Carey got Kilkenny's third goal, but they outscored the Cats from then on. There was no such suspense in the All Ireland Semi-final on 20 August, when Offaly exacted a measure of revenge on Antrim (5-18 to 0-9) for the shock defeat of the Senior hurlers. On 10 September 1989, some 35,000 patrons thronged O'Moore Park for the All Ireland U-21 Hurling Final. A Tipperary team that included Liam Sheedy and John Leahy won by 4-10 to Offaly's 3-11. Billy Dooley scored 1-0 and Johnny Dooley got five points from frees. Tipperary full forward Dan Quirke scored 3-2, of which two goals came shortly before the interval when Offaly full back Damien Geoghegan had been red-carded.The Music of the Ash, page 138 The Faithful County almost overturned the Tipp lead in the second half, but in a feverish finale they couldn't quite get there.Life, death & Hurling, page 75 In the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship, Offaly beat Laois by 5-14 to 1-10. Nearly all of the veteran defence ‚Äì Eugene Coughlan, Aidan Fogarty, Ger Coughlan and Pat Delaney ‚Äì reverted to the positions in which they had won their two All Irelands. Johnny Pilkington made an impressive Senior debut at midfield, alongside Joachim Kelly. Michael Duignan was top scorer on 2-1, and next came Seir Kieran's Joe Dooley on 1-3. Dooley would add 0-3 in the Leinster Final, played on 9 July 1989, which proved to be the margin of victory in the end (Offaly 3-15, Kilkenny 4-9). Mark Corrigan's personal tally of three goals and seven points (0-5 from frees) was the main feature of this match. The Cats hit back for three late goals, but Offaly ended the 1980s as they had begun them ‚Äì by hanging on for their sixth Leinster Title in ten years. The second Offaly v Antrim All Ireland Senior Hurling Semi-final took place at Croke Park on 6 August 1989. In what was the shock result in hurling in the 1980s, Antrim won by 4-15 to 1-15. Ger Coughlan of Kinnitty lined out despite the tragic death of his brother Seamus (a former member of the team) in a drowning accident in Winchester, New York. Each of the team wore a black armband. Eugene Coughlan and Mark Corrigan started for Offaly despite carrying injuries. Even so, it seemed to be business as usual for much of the way, and the Midlanders reached the interval with a 1-10 to 1-6 lead. Antrim switched their burly full forward Ciaran Barr to centre forward, where he grew in influence. Offaly had not envisaged the Glensmen getting a run on them at this stage. Aidan McCarry and Olcan \\"Cloot\\" McFetridge swooped for the late goals that buried the Faithful County. In a spur-of-the-moment gesture, Offaly formed a guard of honour as the Glensmen were leaving the pitch. Tipperary would be the opposition in the Final (having narrowly overcome a Galway team still reeling from the so-called \\"Keady Affair\\"). Playing in their first All Ireland since 1943, Antrim failed to reproduce what they had shown against Offaly, and lost by 4-24 to 3-9. Kilkenny were the heavy favorites in the following year's Leinster Semi-final, played at Croke Park on 17 June 1990. Instead, Offaly ‚Äì coached by Paudge Mulhare, with selectors Tony Murphy, Andy Gallagher, Mick Spain and Willie Gorman ‚Äì won by 4-15 to 1-8. Now 33, Eugene Coughlan was once again in cool command, denying Liam Fennelly so much as an inch of space or a point on the board. 18-year-old Brian Whelahan likewise kept DJ Carey out of contention. Two other relative newcomers, Michael Duignan and Johnny Pilkington, also epitomized Offaly's never-say-die spirit, although it was the goals from veterans Danny Owens, Joachim Kelly and Pat Cleary that really signified the rout of Kilkenny. The Faithful County advanced to the Leinster Final on 8 July 1990, and claimed the Bob O'Keeffe Cup (by 1-19 to Dublin's 2-11) for a magnificent three-in-a-row, and seven out of the last eleven Leinster Titles. As in 1988 and 1989, however, Offaly bowed out at the All Ireland Semi-final stage. On 5 August 1990, Galway won by 1-16 to 2-7. At a Garda match in Portlaoise a couple of weeks previously, Joachim Kelly had been stretchered off with severed ligaments to the knee. Kelly's dynamism was sorely missed against a still-powerful Galway combination. Hopper McGrath and a rampant Joe Cooney hit 0-12 between them. Owing to their opponents' collapse at half back and midfield, this was enough to overwhelm what turned out to have been a \\"last stand\\" for the Offaly team of the 1980s. Although players such as Jim Troy, Joachim Kelly, Paddy and Mark Corrigan, and especially Joe Dooley would soldier on for the Faithful County, Paudge Mulhare grasped that the Galway defeat signified the turning of the page: :: \\"You played it hard and clean and before the game we said that if we won we would come back into this dressing room together. We lost and we came in together. You went down like men, and be as proud leaving Croke Park today as you were the last day.\\" The Music of the Ash, page 143 Victory in the NHL, disappointment in U-21 and Leinster SHC, 1991 to 1993 Although the Galway game was Eugene Coughlan's last appearance in the Championship, the Seir Kieran great again answered the call during Offaly's victorious National Hurling League campaign of 1990-91. Johnny Dooley's marksmanship was another key feature of the campaign. Padraig Horan had taken over as Offaly manager at this stage, and he said the aim was simply to win promotion from League Division 2. A good start was made on 28 October 1990 against Antrim in Casement Park (3-7 to 0-11), before Offaly came home to Birr to defeat Laois by 0-19 to 2-8. Danny Owens (Killoughey) got seven of his nine points from frees, while five of Johnny Dooley's six points were from open play. Wins over Meath (0-13 to 0-9) and Derry (5-9 to 0-7) followed in November. The Derry game took place in a miserably wet Slaughtneil, where Seir Kieran's brilliant goalie Liam Coughlan stood in for Jim Troy. Resuming at Salthill on 17 February 1991, Offaly lost to Galway by 1-11 to 0-9, in what was still a good performance. However, their chances of promotion took a real nose-dive with defeat to Down on 3 March (1-14 to 1-9). Results elsewhere fortuitously fell Offaly's way, and the team got back on track by beating Kerry by 0-21 to 0-6. In the play-off at Drogheda on the last day of March, Offaly again met Down and exacted revenge for the earlier defeat (3-13 to 2-7). The NHL Quarter-final between Offaly and Waterford took place at Thurles on 14 April 1991. This was the first competitive inter-county game in which Joe, Billy and Johnny Dooley (with, respectively, 0-2, 0-1 and 0-4) got on the score-sheet together. A fourth Seir Kieran representative, Liam Coughlan, came on for Jim Troy when the Lusmagh man was elbowed in the eye. Joachim Kelly's return from injury was a big boost to the underdogs, as a very enjoyable match went to extra time. Waterford's training over the winter was supposed to give them the edge in this scenario, but it was Offaly who advanced by 3-14 to 0-14. Tipperary were the opponents in the Semi-final, played at Limerick, and were defeated by 1-7 to 0-7. Five of Offaly's starting forwards ‚Äì Joe Dooley, Johnny Dooley, Michael Duignan, Danny Owens, and Daithi Regan ‚Äì scored from play, with Duignan netting the decisive goal four minutes from time. 22,749 patrons came to Croke Park on 12 May for the League Final itself, and saw Offaly become the tenth county to win the League (and the first new name since Waterford in 1963). Wexford were on top for much of the game, but had numerous wides from distance. Offaly showed tenacity, power and raw courage, as they hunted in packs and got the most out of their own chances. With two goals from Dathi Regan (Birr), it finished Offaly 2-6, Wexford 0-10. While winning the Faithful County's first National Hurling League was a historic achievement, it was a case of \\"pride comes before a fall\\" so far as 1991, 1992 and 1993 were concerned. In the Leinster Semi-final on 3 June 1991, Dublin advanced by 0-19 to 1-14 as the reigning Leinster and League champions were sensationally dumped out. The Metropolitans showed greater fitness, alertness and hunger and led most of the way. Johnny Dooley's second-half goal, fired from a 20-metre free, brought Offaly right back into contention, but it was Dublin who got the late scores to clinch it. Not since 1979 had Offaly failed to reach the Leinster Senior Hurling Final, so their supporters reacted to the final whistle with stunned disbelief. Padraig Horan the coach took the view that: \\"We won our first League and we have the Leinster U-21 Title. Our Senior side is still quite young and the future is bright.\\"The Music of the Ash, page 147 However, Offaly's defence of their League Title got off to a rocky start on 19 October 1991, when Down had five points to spare (2-17 to 2-12) to make a memorable debut in League Division 1. Offaly subsequently beat Laois at Rathdowney by 0-11 to 1-3; but lost to both Tipperary (2-17 to 1-7) and Kilkenny (0-12 to 0-10). Kevin Kinahan was full back for the Tipperary game, when Joe, Billy and Johnny Dooley brought the Seir Kieran contingent to four. Survival in Division 1 remained in jeopardy until the team drew with Limerick (Offaly 2-13, Limerick 1-16) at Birr on 22 March 1992. In a fiercely contested tie full of Offaly's old fire, Johnny Dooley's goal and eleven points inspired the team's escape from relegation. Padraig Horan was happy with the character shown in the Limerick game; but the injury-list meant that the 1992 Leinster Senior Hurling Semi-final would be all-uphill. At Croke Park on 21 June, Kilkenny eliminated Offaly by 2-15 to 1-12. Offaly kept an edge for much of the way, with points from Johnny and Joe Dooley, Brendan Kelly (Lusmagh) and Daithi Regan building on a great goal by Danny Owens. However, sending Michael Duignan on was a mistake, as he was not recovered from ligament trouble and soon had to limp off again.Life, death & Hurling, page 85 Kilkenny's substitutions worked better, Christy Heffernan's guile eventually giving them the upper hand. Billy Dooley was sent on for Offaly late on, and was unlucky with two goal chances. Padraig Horan's tenure as manager ended with this defeat, and he would be replaced by Limerick's √âamonn Cregan. One year later, on 30 May 1993, Offaly again came off second-best in the first round of the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship (Kilkenny 2-10 Offaly 0-14). Notwithstanding the red card shown for Roy Mannion's challenge on Adrian Ronan, Offaly's never-say-die performance deserved to overturn the reigning All Ireland champions. Michael Walsh (son of goalkeeping legend Ollie Walsh, Kilkenny's coach that year) pulled off great saves from Adrian Cahill and Johnny Dooley. At the other end, John Power was awarded a hotly disputed penalty that DJ Carey sent to the net. At the long whistle, the relief of the Cats was palpable and Cregan's men sank to their knees in despair. Like their Senior counterparts, Offaly's U-21 hurlers went from early triumph to ultimate disappointment in both 1991 and 1992. Seir Kieran's Kevin Kinahan played at full back, while Johnny Dooley was wing forward. The Leinster Semi-final of 1991 ended all-square (Offaly 2-9, Wexford 3-6). Offaly won the replay at Nowlan Park by 1-11 to 1-9. In the Leinster U-21 Hurling Final, played at Portlaoise on 7 August 1991, Offaly sandbagged Kilkenny the reigning champions by 2-10 to 0-12. The mentors took a gamble by putting the erstwhile goalie John Troy at wing forward. This worked out very well, especially as Shinrone's Damien Franks (still a Minor) kept a clean sheet in place of the Lusmagh man. The Offaly defence all gave brilliant displays, especially the hooking of Hubert Rigney (St Rynagh's). Johnny Pilkington the captain received the Sean Robbins Cup (named for the time in which the great Offaly administrator had been chairman of the Leinster Council). Offalay's All Ireland U-21 Semi-final, played at Drogheda, turned out to be one-way traffic (Offaly 2-19, Antrim 1-8). The All Ireland Final took place at Limerick on 8 September 1991, when Offaly were blown away by Galway (2-17 to 1-9). Kevin Kinahan did noticeably well on Joe Rabbite, until the Galway man was switched to centre forward where he laid off scoring chance after scoring chance. Of the two penalties awarded to Offaly, Johnny Dooley netted the first but opted to put the second over the bar. Although over ten minutes remained, Galway were nearly out of sight by then. Many of the same U-21 panel were still eligible the following year. At Portlaoise on 28 June 1992, Johnny Dooley scored ten points against a Dublin side that were in contention all the way. Offaly were leading 0-14 to 0-11 with time almost up, when Pauric Tiernan's long-range effort cracked off the crossbar and over to leave it a close shave. Dooley added 0-9 in Offaly's great 1-15 to 2-10 Leinster Final win over the Cats; and 0-11 when the Midlanders had revenge on Galway in the Semi-final (Offaly 3-17, Galway 1-5). The All Ireland U-21 Hurling Final took place between Waterford and Offaly on 13 September 1992, when over 21,000 enthralled patrons crammed into Nowlan Park. It ended all-square (Offaly 0-16, Waterford 4-4) after a riveting game replete with some brilliant scores and some outrageous wides. The Deise's goalie Ray Barry was their hero of the hour, while midfielder Johnny Brenner scored all of Waterford's four points. In the second half, the Deise scored four goals (three of them by big Sean Daly). The last of these had Offaly chasing the game, until Brian Whelahan raced forward for the equalizer just on full-time. The replay took place two weeks later and was another non-stop display of pure hurling. At its end, however, it was Waterford who were victorious by 0-12 to 2-3. Empty-handed once more, after their third U-21 Final in four years, Kevin Kinahan, Johnny Dooley and all of their teammates were inconsolable.The Music of the Ash, page 152 County Championships of 1992 and 1993 Seir Kieran would likewise emerge empty-handed from the following two SHC seasons, and seemed to be sliding backwards at times. They began the 1992 championship in Jekyll & Hyde fashion, with a stunning 4-10 to 2-9 victory over Coolderry then a desolate 1-13 to 0-7 loss to Birr. In the third round against Kinnitty, Mick Mulrooney scored the decisive goal as Seir Kieran won by 1-9 to 0-11, although they had lived dangerously throughout this match. The next outing was on 9 August 1992, when the Clareen team beat Kilcormac/ Killoughey by 2-16 to 0-7 to guarantee a place in the play-offs. Neither could Coolderry really cope with Seir Kieran fully nine weeks later, when they duked it out for a Semi-final place. With Pat O'Connor out with a broken leg, Coolderry had few attacking options and went down by 0-13 to 1-7. On the minus side, the black and amber had 13 wides. St Rynagh's were the opposition in the SHC Semi-final, played at Birr on 24 October 1992, and never relinquished the lead after Aidan Fogarty took an opportunist goal (St Rynagh's 2-14, Seir Kieran 1-12). Seir Kieran also played six matches in the 1993 Senior Hurling Championship, but did not even make the Semi-finals this time. A nail-biting one-point win over Kilcormac/ Killoughey (1-13 to 1-12) was negated by a defeat to Birr by 2-13 to 2-9. Noel Bergin reacted quickest when James Coakley's shot came off the post, but Robbie Sheils's net lived a charmed life after that. Brian Whelahan converted two 65's for a telling advantage. At Rath on 13 June, Seir Kieran and Lusmagh played out a draw (Seir Kieran 2-6, Lusmagh 1-9). Victories followed against Tullamore (0-12 to 1-8) and against Drumcullen (1-15 to 0-11), but these were insufficient to avoid the play-offs. On 15 August 1993, the rampant Reds took two early goals to all but end it as a contest, and went on for a six-point victory (Lusmagh 4-12, Seir Kieran 1-15). It was a fittingly miserable end to what had been five years of failure in the quest to win back the Sean Robbins Cup. Four years of achievement, 1994 to 1997=Reaching the County Final again ‚Äì Seir Kieran in 1994 While the Clareen side's reversals of fortune since 1988 were brutal, a major reason for them was that the Offaly domestic championship had become one of the most competitive in the country. Birr were waxing in strength, St Rynagh's and Lusmagh were always there or thereabouts, and Kilcormac/ Killoughey and now Tullamore had plenty of talent coming through. The Clareen mentors and panel would eventually prove equal to this challenge, going on to contest four County Finals in a row between 1994 and 1997 ‚Äì and to win two of those. As they had in 1987 and 1988, the Junior hurlers led the way in 1994, beating Killeigh/ Killeen, Belmont and Tubber (walkover) and then Daingean in the Quarter-final. The Semi-final, played at Raheen in September, finished Seir Kieran 3-6, Killurin 0-7. The Clareen side, coached by Michael Murphy with selectors Tommy Hynes and TJ Dooley, gave a brave account of themselves in the Junior 'B' Hurling Final, played at Rath on 9 October 1994. Kilcormac/ Killoughey were too strong on the day, and won out by 2-11 to 0-10. Before several of the panel were called up for Offaly's brilliant summer Blitzkrieg, the club's Senior team had made a highly encouraging start in the 1994 SHC, defeating Drumcullen by 5-12 to 1-8 and St Rynagh's by 1-14 to 2-5. Their new coach, Gerry Kirwan of Ballyskenagh, laid considerable emphasis on the age-old problems of fitness and discipline. Eugene Coughlan had come on to score the goal against Banagher; Kevin Kinahan, Kieran Dooley, James Coakley and Damien Murphy all put in great performances; and Johnny Dooley versus Martin Hanamy was one of the key tussles of the match. Their SHC campaign resumed at Kilcormac on 17 September, when the Clareen side went down to an unexpected 6-7 to 2-12 defeat, to a Coolderry side who needed the win to get into the play-offs. Not since 1952 had Seir Kieran conceded so many goals in the Championship. Eugene Coughlan would revert to full back for the remainder of the 1994 campaign, beginning at Rath the following week where a 1-10 to 0-9 victory over Kinnitty got them back on the rails. On 2 October 1994, Seir Kieran once again faced Coolderry in the play-offs, switched to Banagher from a water-logged Lusmagh pitch. A cracking game was expected, as Seir Kieran sought revenge for the ambush at Kilcormac; but the slippery conditions made it a hard slog. Seir Kieran gradually got the upper hand, and lovely points from Mick Coughlan and Johnny Dooley brought it to Seir Kieran 0-7, Coolderry 0-6. In the Semi-final against Kilcormac/ Killoughey, the black and amber's finishing was clinical. Billy Dooley scored two goals (the second nipped off the hurley of Kilcormac goalie Stephen Byrne), and Mick Coughlan added a third, as they won by 3-13 to 0-8. The County Final of 30 October 1994 pitted Seir Kieran against Birr. In appalling weather conditions, it was the Clareen side that got off to a promising start, but Birr gradually restricted the supply of ball to the Seir Kieran danger men, while forcing the concession of frees from within Adrian Cahill's range. Seir Kieran threw everything forward in search of the winning goal, but it was Birr 0-8, Seir Kieran 0-6 at the long whistle. For want of just a little more discipline, Seir Kieran had now lost their fifth County Final out of the six contested since 1985. In wishing Birr the very best in the Leinster Club championship, however, Seir Kieran signalled that they were not finished yet: :: \\"The Club appreciate and thank the entire panel and team management for a big effort from early Spring through to Final day. Despite this loss spirits have been restored and the Club will be battling for honours again next year.\\"The Music of the Ash, page 163 Offaly's third All Ireland Senior Hurling title, 1994 √âamonn Cregan's management team included fitness instructor Derry O'Donovan, whose weight training techniques would prove their worth from the very start of the year. A 3-9 to 3-7 win over Kilkenny in the Walsh Cup Semi-final on 30 January 1994 was very encouraging. Offaly easily retained their Walsh Cup Title (0-14 to 0-6) in a physically tough Final against Meath at Athboy, when Kevin Kinahan played at full back, Johnny Dooley (0-5) at wing forward, and Billy Dooley at top of the left. Joe Dooley, recovered from injury, rejoined the team in time for the make-or-break Leinster Senior Hurling Semi-final, against Kilkenny on 26 June 1994. The reigning All Ireland Champions were firm favorites not only to take the game, but to complete the three-in-a-row for the first time since 1913 (when the Graces, Walton and Dick \\"Drug\\" Walsh were in their prime).Kilkenny: The GAA Story, page 35 Instead, Offaly's determination, passion and will to win resulted in a 2-16 to 3-9 victory. Johnny Dooley was top scorer on six points, closely followed by Billy and Joe Dooley who finished on 1-2 apiece. Scored at the three-quarters stage, Joe's tonic of a goal capped his best performance since the late 1980s. In a last throw of the dice, the Kilkenny mentors put DJ Carey to full forward. Although Carey got little change out of Kevin Kinahan, the Cats did manage a consolatory 2-1 in the last six minutes, and got off lightly in the end. In the Leinster Senior Hurling Final on 17 July 1994, Offaly overcame a lackluster Wexford challenge by 1-18 to 0-14, to win their eighth Leinster Title. A highlight of the game was when John Troy (as though freeze-framing the state of play) reverse-flicked over his shoulder, for Billy Dooley to let fly for the goal that killed Wexford's rally. Martin Hanamy lifted the Bob O'Keeffe Cup, and the Faithful contingent in the crowd of 32,141 went wild. En route to a victory almost as important as the breakthrough in 1980, Offaly had beaten both Wexford and Kilkenny for the first time in 96 years. During the post-match interviews, Billy Dooley remarked that the forwards were clocking up scores like 2-22 and 3-24 in challenge games.The Music of the Ash, page 159 The confidence that Offaly possessed such firepower would prove crucial when the going got tough in the All Ireland Final. In the interim, there were several heart-stopping moments in the All Ireland Senior Hurling Semi-final on 7 August, which ended Offaly 2-13, Galway 1-10. The Faithful County dominated the first half, but lost concentration and allowed a hard-hitting Galway side back into it in the third quarter. Billy Dooley's brave goal at that stage was crucial. Christy Helebert rose to a magnificent display for the Tribesmen, at the price of frees conceded in Johnny Dooley's range. Pat O'Connor, having made a comeback from his leg injuries, led the Galway defence a merry dance. Each of Offaly's rearguard was a tower of strength. Having thus avenged their Semi-final defeats of 1988 and 1990, Offaly were jubilant. However, the celebratory mood was cut short, so far as Clareen and its environs was concerned, by a tragedy off the Wexford coast that same weekend. In the next edition of the Midland Tribune, the Seir Kieran GAA Notes stated as follows: :: \\"It was with shock and sadness that the Club and Parish learned of the tragic death in a drowning accident while on holiday in Wexford of David Bach. To his mother, Ann, father, Geoff, and a wide circle of relatives and friends the Club extends its sincerest sympathy.\\"Midland Tribune, 20 August 1994 Because Offaly had finished so strongly in all of their games, they entered the All Ireland Final on 4 September 1994 wearing the unwelcome \\"favorites\\" tag. Nonetheless, it was Limerick who set the pace, and at times seemed about to overwhelm Offaly. √âamonn Cregan's philosophy of direct first-time hurling, keeping it simple, paid dividends as Offaly had more left in the tank in the dramatic finale. Offaly scored only 1-2 from frees and 2-14 from open play. Limerick's relatively poor return (2-9 from play, 0-4 from frees) was due to Brian Whelahan, Kevin Martin, Martin Hanamy, Kevin Kinahan & co. hunting in packs. Offaly's deft touches and flicks forced Limerick to go the extra mile for their scores. Moreover, having established a half time lead of 2-8 to 1-5, Tom Ryan's team only added five points in the second half. This was indicative of how Offaly gradually started to get to grips. Even so, Limerick's explosive pace and power was such that Offaly needed all of their craft to stay alive. Mike Houlihan's opening point was answered by a goal from Joe Dooley, who pounced on Johnny Dooley's penalty rebound (in Con Houlihan's phrase) \\"like a hawk on a chicken too far from her mother\\".More than a game, page 150 This early cushion proved vital, as Damien Quigley twice beat Jim Troy and was only denied a third goal when Brian Whelahan got back in time to hook. Ger Hegarty, Gary Kirby and Ciaran Carey likewise proved a handful, and Cregan chopped and changed until only Jim Troy, Kevin Kinahan and Johnny and Billy Dooley remained in their starting positions. Scores by Declan and Johnny Pilkington and Johnny and Joe Dooley brought Offaly to within two points, but Kirby, Quigley and Limerick sub Leo O'Connor put six between them again. Michael Duignan and Johnny Dooley again made inroads, only for Kirby to land a pointed free, giving Limerick some extra insurance that it seemed would not be called upon. Then the Limerick defence, mindful perhaps of Billy Dooley's depredations in each championship game so far, floored Offaly's No. 13. As Johnny Dooley calmly stood over the ball on the 21 yard line, Derry O'Donovan signaled that a point would be the best option. However, Dooley had already made up his mind to go for goal, without taking a run at it. Suddenly it was a two-point game. Limerick goalkeeper Joe Quaid took a quick puck out, but it was Offaly's Michael Duignan who won possession and sent to Johnny Pilkington. Pilkington lobbed back in ahead of the inrushing Pat O'Connor, and the Coolderry man doubled on it to put Offaly one point ahead. Offaly's well-oiled conveyor belt of points suddenly clicked into high gear. Johnny Dooley and John Troy effortlessly found the target, and Billy Dooley sent over three in succession from the sideline by the Cusack Stand. It may have been that the frustration of earlier losses, especially at the U-21 grade, fueled Offaly's resolve not to let it slip this time. Otherwise, there was nothing uncharacteristic about how Offaly annexed their victory. Given that Limerick were still only a point behind, even after O'Connor's goal, the real riddle was the Treatymen's failure to find a response of any kind in the last four minutes.More than a game, page 151 The final score was Offaly 3-16, Limerick 2-13. County Champions a second time ‚Äì Seir Kieran in 1995 Martin Hanamy became the second St Rynagh's man (and the first from Cloghan) to lift the McCarthy Cup; Kevin Martin won Tullamore's first All Ireland Senior hurling medal; while the Birr, Lusmagh, St Rynagh's and Coolderry contingents each received heroes' welcomes in their home place. Even so, the Clareen homecoming, on Friday, 9 September 1994, was something special. √âamonn Cregan greatly valued Tony Murphy's role as Offaly hurling secretary.The Music of the Ash, page 214 Kevin Kinahan had held scoreless Limerick's full forward Pat Heffernan. Joe, Billy and Johnny Dooley had amassed a combined 2-11. Joe and Johnny Dooley became the first pair of brothers in modern times to each score a goal in an All Ireland Senior Hurling Final (a feat matched only by the Powers of Carrickshock in the Final of 2014). Three of Offaly's six All Star Awards in 1994 came to Seir Kieran ‚Äì to Johnny and Billy Dooley and to Kevin Kinahan. The club's priority for 1995 was to use these achievements as a springboard back to the top in the Offaly SHC. Seir Kieran's selectors for 1995 were Gerry Kirwan (coach), Christy Coughlan, Johnny Breslin, Willie Dooley and Tommy Hynes. In the opening round of the Senior Hurling Championship, the team unexpectedly went down to a more determined and hungry Coolderry by 0-11 to 0-10. A dour and workmanlike victory over Kinnitty in the second round (1-10 to 0-8) steadied the ship. Victory came at a price, as Billy Dooley was carried off with an ankle injury. It was a seriously depleted Clareen panel who lined out against Tullamore on 27 May 1995, and stared elimination in the face throughout the game. With Tullamore ahead by 1-5 to 0-2, their goalie tossed up the ball to clear it ‚Äì whereupon Eugene Coughlan flicked it to the net. Reduced to 14 men in the second half, Seir Kieran were again in dire trouble, but regrouped doggedly. Mick Mulrooney's goal and points from James Coakley and Johnny Dooley preceded Dooley's great equalizer from a '65. Kevin Abbott scored the winning point (Seir Kieran 2-13, Tullamore 2-12). It was a Lazarus act unprecedented in the club's long history, and meant it was still all to play for when the championship resumed after the inter-county hiatus. By beating Kilcormac/ Killoughey by 2-16 to 2-7 on 24 September, Seir Kieran put themselves emphatically in the frame for a place in the last four. This was secured by a 2-21 to 0-1 mismatch against Belmont on 7 October. Seir Kieran's Semi-final assignment was Birr, who had gone on to win their first All Ireland Club Title against Dunloy (following a replay). Yet the wear-and-tear that this had cost them, coupled with Seir Kieran's absolute cohesion, meant that the Clareen attitude was one of \\"now or never\\". It did not look that way at first. Simon and Brian Whelahan, Ray Landy, Declan Pilkington and Oisin O'Neill had all scored by the time Johnny Dooley opened Seir Kieran's account. Birr recommenced scoring almost at will; until Eugene Coughlan burst through for a great goal that showed weakness in the Birr defence. Mick Mulrooney capitalized by grabbing two more goals, for a slender interval lead (3-2 to 0-9). Jimmy Connor replaced Eugene Coughlan for the second half, when Johnny Dooley scored all six Seir Kieran points. Scores from Ray Landy and Conor McGlone kept the townsmen in the hunt, as both managements made wholesale changes. Brian Whelahan went to full forward for Birr, while Clareen captain Joe Dooley dropped back to help lift the siege. Eventually Whelahan got in for a stunning goal, but Birr were still one point behind (3-8 to 1-13) and on the attack when the referee blew it up.Magic Memories, page 128 With only one week to get set, the Senior Hurling Final against St Rynagh's (22 October 1995 at St Brendan's Park) looked like an even trickier proposition. In the event, two wholly committed sides played out an exciting 1-13 to 1-13 draw, in front of a record attendance of over six thousand. St Rynagh's were very slight favorites going into the replay, on the basis that the Shannonsiders had always taken their second chances before. Instead, Seir Kieran prevailed by 0-10 to 0-9. The line-out for the replay (Saturday 28 October) was Liam Coughlan (goalie), Paddy Mulrooney, Kevin Kinahan, Paddy Connors, Damien Murphy, Ger Connors, Paul Scully, Noel Bergin, Joe Dooley (captain), Johnny Dooley, Mick Coughlan, James Coakley, Billy Dooley, Eugene Coughlan, and Mick Mulrooney. The three subs called upon on the day were Jimmy Connor, Finbarr O'Neill and Kieran Dooley. As the new Offaly champions, Seir Kieran had a Leinster Club Championship fixture in Carlow the very next day, where they beat Naomh Eoin by 3-10 to 0-7. Six days after that (Saturday 11 November), in Dr. Cullen Park, Kilkenny champions Glenmore brought Seir Kieran's campaign to a full stop (1-14 to 0-12). Back in Kinnitty on 26 November 1995, victory in the long-delayed 1994 Senior Hurling League Final(Seir Kieran 2-15, Drumcullen 2-6) restored morale, as did the 1995 All Star Awards won by Kevin Kinahan, Johnny Dooley and Billy Dooley. However, winning out the Offaly SHC was the one that mattered, and was Seir Kieran's most important win since 1988. Eugene Coughlan summed it up: :: \\"I have never seen players, committee members and everyone involved with the club dig so deep.\\"The Music of the Ash, page 170 Back-to-back titles and attempted three-in-a-row ‚Äì Seir Kieran 1996-97 At the Offaly GAA Convention for 1996, Seir Kieran won the accolade of \\"Club of the Year\\" for the second time. In accepting the Fr. McWey Cup, Michael Murphy the club chairman stressed that Seir Kieran were just as proud of their part in the success of Offaly hurling. The Offaly Senior Hurling Championship of 1996 was defined, so far as Seir Kieran were concerned, by lop-sided victories over Belmont and Ballyskenagh and by four no-holds-barred matches against Kilcormac/ Killoughey. These comprised: an exciting second-round match that finished Seir Kieran 1-10, Kilcormac/ Killoughey 0-13; an unexpectedly easy passage in the play-offs (Seir Kieran 1-11, Kilcormac/ Killoughey 1-3); another draw (3-12-all) in the Semi-final on 22 September 1996; and a definitive 0-14 to 0-7 win in the replay six days later. Midfield action from Seir Kieran v Kilcormac-Killoughey game, Offaly Senior Hurling Championship, September 1996 With the Double-K's shaken off at last, Seir Kieran contemplated the prospect of a historic Double of their own ‚Äì assuming they had enough left in the tank to handle St Rynagh's in the Final. The punditry reckoned St Rynagh's would do it this time, having kept the Birr danger-men under wraps in the other bruising Semi-final. However, several of the Banagher camp, such as selector Alo Horan, were much more cautious than that: :: \\"Seir Kieran were victorious last year because they wanted it more than we did. While some of their lads might not be all that skillful, they all have great spirit and would die for their parish. Certainly they will go out and give it everything on the day.\\"The Music of the Ash, page 175 Despite the cross-field gale and the cascading showers on County Final day itself (13 October 1996), Seir Kieran did indeed give it everything, defeating St Rynagh's by 0-13 to 1-8 to put Senior Hurling Titles back-to- back. The black and amber deployed as follows: Liam Coughlan (goalie), Paul Scully, Kevin Kinahan, Paddy Connors, Damien Murphy, Ger Connors, Kieran Dooley, Joe Dooley, Noel Bergin, Johnny Dooley, Mick Coughlan, Mick Mulrooney, Billy Dooley, Eugene Coughlan, Seamus Dooley, and substitutes Kieran Kealey and Jimmy Connor. It was their eighth appearance in the decider in 12 years, of which they had now won three. County Board chairman Brendan Ward presented the Sean Robbins Cup to a delighted Liam Coughlan. On 24 November, Coughlan would also collect the Pat Carroll Cup, after Seir Kieran defeated Kilcormac/ Killoughey in the 1996 SHL Final by 1-12 to 0-6. In the interim, Seir Kieran's third-ever Leinster Club Hurling Championship campaign once again foundered at the Leinster Semi-final stage. Following a spell-binding 1-24 to 0-4 win over Trim in the opening round at Athboy, the Clareen panel went to Portlaoise on 10 November to face O'Toole's. The Dublin champions (including former Kilkenny forwards Eamonn Morrissey and Jamesie \\"Shiner\\" Brennan) powered into a 1-10 to 0-2 lead after the first quarter. Out-maneuvered nearly everywhere, Seir Kieran drew on vast reserves of character and resolve, and lived to fight another day (Seir Kieran 3-10, O'Toole's 1-16). Back in Portlaoise the following Saturday, the Offaly champions were again stretched thin, and again held their shape and composure to make inroads in the second half. O'Toole's kept topping up their points total, however, and (despite Joe Dooley nipping in for a late goal) advanced by 0-18 to 2-9. Undeterred by their failure to navigate further in Leinster, Seir Kieran advanced to the 1997 Senior Hurling Final undefeated, with wins over Lusmagh (1-11 to 0-5), Kilcormac/ Killoughey (0-15 to 1-9), Belmont (5-17 to 0-4), and Tullamore in the Semi-final (2-15 to 2-10). In the Final itself, played out against Birr on 5 October 1997, Joe Dooley was hampered by a leg injury as he alternated between midfield and full forward. This made it easier for Birr to keep tabs on the other Clareen playmakers, and to win out by four points (0-14 to 2-4). In the midst of bitter disappointment in the black and amber camp, what did not change was the determination to challenge, the following year, as ferociously as ever. In the meantime, a great victory in the Junior Hurling 'B' Championship ensured that the year ended on a high. At Rath on 2 November 1997, the following team beat Coolderry in the Final by 2-9 to 2-4: Damien Coffey (goalie), Tom Connor, Paddy Mulrooney, John Coakley, Kevin Dooley, Joe Guinan, Finbarr Murphy, Pat Mulrooney, Aidan O'Neill, Kieran Troy, Noel Bergin, Kevin Abbott, Joe Mooney, Sean Coughlan, and TJ Dooley. Triumph, then disappointment ‚Äì Offaly Hurling 1995 to 1997 Having turned the tide in the 1994 All Ireland Final, Offaly looked set to blossom into the dominant team of the mid-1990s. At the same moment, however, Limerick, Clare and Wexford were surging to the top ranks of hurling counties, while Kilkenny and other \\"traditional\\" powers remained a threat.Hurling: The Revolution Years In response, Offaly upped their own performance levels even further; but their lack of options on the bench began to tell against them. The Birr contingent won their first All Ireland Club Title in March 1995, so they were unavailable to √âamonn Cregan for most of the NHL campaign (during which Johnny Dooley amassed 1-58). The Faithful County still managed to regain Division 1 status and had pleasing wins over Liam Griffin's Wexford (0-16 to 0-14) and over Cork in the Quarter-final (3-10 to 2-11). Although Kilkenny beat them by 4-8 to 0-14 in the League Semi-final at Thurles, Cregan shrugged off Offaly's slackness as something that could be fixed in time for championship. The coach's sangfroid was vindicated by Offaly's 2-14 to 1-10 victory over Wexford on 25 June ‚Äì the first Leinster Senior Hurling Championship match to be broadcast live on television.The Music of the Ash, page 165 Joe Dooley's goal was vital in maintaining an advantage in the third quarter, when Wexford's strategy of luring Offaly's half back line out of position looked like it might pay off. Unbeaten by the Slaneysiders since 1979, Offaly had nearly come to depend on Wexford's erratic shooting whenever the chips were down.Life, death & Hurling, page 69 That remained true in 1995 ‚Äì but Griffin would have recalibrated by the following year. Billy Dooley (0-5) was Offaly's top scorer in the Leinster Senior Hurling Final on 16 July 1995. The throw-in was delayed by a cloudburst, accompanied by thunder and lightning, during which Offaly retreated to their dressing room while the Kilkenny players huddled miserably in the dug-outs. When play did commence, Offaly answered those who had installed Kilkenny as favorites by recording one of their most total victories (Offaly 2-16, Kilkenny 2-5). Although only 0-5 to 0-3 up by half time, the Faithful County had absorbed phenomenal pressure and had broken Kilkenny's resolve by then. Offaly's deft flicks and passes opened up the game in the second half, and the scores began to flow. With Kevin Kinahan in close attendance, DJ Carey made no headway until too late to matter. Since 1980, Offaly had now lifted the Bob O'Keeffe Cup nine times (to seven for the Cats). In the All Ireland Semi-final (6 August 1995), Offaly beat Down by 2-19 to 2-8. On a sweltering afternoon that sapped the energy of some players, Johnny Dooley's 11-point contribution ensured that there would be no repeat of the Antrim result in 1989. Ger Loughnane's Clare team would be the opposition on 3 September, in the 1995 All Ireland Final. On all known form, the reigning All Ireland Champions were the better bet to prevail on this occasion ‚Äì provided they could rise to the same level of intensity as they had shown in the Leinster Final. In the event, the Faithful County went down by two points (Clare 1-13, Offaly 2-8). While they had known that everything bar the kitchen sink would be thrown at them, Offaly were unbraced for the sheer wall of noise that greeted the Bannermens' entry into the arena.Life, death & Hurling, page 101 √âamonn Cregan would afterwards reflect that, while Clare were not any fitter than Offaly, their grueling training sessions had conferred an advantage in terms of upper body strength.The Music of the Ash, page 168 Ger Loughnane's astute switches were a factor also, and Offaly only scored 1-2 after the interval. Even so, Kevin Kinahan defiantly retained control at full back, and the team's greater skill and craft kept them in the hunt. Johnny Pilkington's goal edged them two points in front with four minutes to go, at which stage a couple of wides let Clare off the hook. Clare substitute Eamonn Taaffe nabbed what proved the decisive goal when Antony Daly's effort came back off the post. Referee Dickie Murphy blew it up after virtually no injury time. Having lifted the McCarthy Cup, Daly said in his acceptance speech that Offaly's rise had been an inspiration to teams like Clare. This was scant consolation to the runners-up, who had left everything on the pitch in the quest to put All Ireland Titles back-to-back. Offaly won promotion from Division 2 of the National Hurling League the following Spring, notwithstanding a hideous 1-28 to 1-1 NHL defeat to Galway on 18 February 1996, and an ominous 1-14 to 2-3 League Quarter-final exit at the hands of Wexford. When the championship commenced on 2 June 1996, Offaly also had trouble in putting Meath away (2-18 to 2-12). Liam Coughlan (goalie), Kevin Kinahan (full back), Johnny Dooley (left half forward), Joe Dooley (right half forward) and Billy Dooley (top of the left) lined out together ‚Äì the first time that Seir Kieran had had five representatives in the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship. Each of them went on to play in the Semi-final victory over Laois (Offaly 4-17, Laois 2-10), and in the Leinster Final defeat to Wexford on 14 July 1996 (Wexford 2-23, Offaly 2-15). Offaly's sparkling performance in the Laois game (in which they scored 4-13 from play) had seemed to dispel all of the earlier doubts. Although caught by Wexford in the Final, the Model County's eight-point margin was not an accurate reflection of how poised this epic game had been. Even so, Liam Griffin's tactics worked as intended, and his team had the self-belief to keep the Midlanders under the kosh. It was a measure of Offaly that (in large part because of Liam Coughlan's net-minding) they were only three points down on 66 minutes. However, once Wexford went four up at that stage, they had no choice put to extend everything and big gaps appeared, of which Wexford took full advantage. Offaly were desolate in defeat, and the team management resigned soon afterwards. John McIntyre, the sports editor for the Connaught Tribune, would be appointed Offaly coach for the 1997 League and Championship, with selectors Willie Dooley (Seir Kieran), Jim Troy (Lusmagh), and Sean White (St Rynagh's). Joe Dooley was Offaly's captain for 1997, when the panel was freshened up by the likes of Gary Hanniffy and Gary Cahill (Birr), Ger Oakley (Carrig & Riverstown), Cillian Farrell (Edenderry), Paudie Mulhare (St Rynagh's) and Colm Cassidy (Kilcormac/ Killoughey). However, the playmakers still comprised the \\"Old Guard\\" for the most part. In the first round of the Leinster Championship in Mullingar, Offaly saw off Meath much more handily than they had in 1996 (3-20 to 0-8), but were very nearly caught out by Laois in the next round (Offaly 1-11, Laois 2-7). It was back to Croke Park on 22 June 1997, when Offaly took on the All Ireland Champions in the Leinster Senior Hurling Semi-final. As in 1996, Offaly and Wexford served up an enthralling game; and Offaly came off second-best in the end. Wexford raised two green flags early on, but Billy Dooley's goal just before the short whistle gave his team a fighting chance. However, it was the fourth quarter before Offaly meshed into their top gear. It was too late on this occasion, as Wexford advanced with a goal to spare (Wexford 3-12, Offaly 2-12). This was only the fourth time in eighteen years that Offaly had failed to qualify for the Leinster Senior Hurling Final. In 1991, 1992 and 1993, Offaly had had recent success at Minor and U-21 level. There was no such silver lining in 1997. On the other hand, Offaly's status as a hurling county was higher than ever before. At the August 1996 meeting of the Offaly County Board, Brendan Ward the chairman and Tony Murphy the hurling secretary recalled that during their four years in charge, √âamonn Cregan, Derry O'Donovan and their selectors had delivered two Leinster Titles, victory and runners-up in two All Ireland Championships, two Walsh Cups and one Oireachtas Title. Mr. Ward added: :: \\"That was tremendous progress. I pay tribute to those men, they did a powerful job for Offaly.\\"Midland Tribune, 10 August 1996 Offaly and Seir Kieran ‚Äì Champions in 1998, runners-up in 2000=Offaly's eight championship games of 1998 As John McIntyre's term in charge of the Offaly Senior hurlers was not renewed, he was replaced by the former Tipperary and Laois manager, Michael 'Babs' Keating. At club level, Seir Kieran also had a new coach, Michael Connolly of Kinnitty (who had previously coached the Clareen U-16's to a county title in 1983). This was just one more sign of how tightly the fortunes of Seir Kieran and Offaly had converged. Club and county would both win a long-odds Senior Championship in 1998, be knocked off their perch in 1999, and claw back into the Final in 2000. In the National Hurling League in the Spring of 1998, Offaly avoided a relegation play-off against Kilkenny only by virtue of a better scoring record than had Antrim.The Music of the Ash, page 184 Mitigating factors were Johnny Dooley's knee trouble, and the absence of the Birr contingent (which again lifted the Tommy Moore Cup on St Patrick's Day). Although the injury situation had reached crisis proportions by the first round of the championship, Offaly beat Meath with 32 points to spare (4-28 to 0-8). This was a good tee-up for the crucial Leinster Semi-final. At Croke Park on 14 June 1998, a heart-stopping game of swaying fortunes again looked to be shaded Wexford's way. However, the Slaneysiders would come to rue their nine first-half wides, as Offaly's vastly-improved teamwork in the second half brought them within range. Paul Codd's ninth point put Wexford two clear, leaving Offaly no option but to go for broke. On 69 minutes, Johnny Dooley's strike found its way through a crowded goalmouth to the net, and Wexford were eliminated by 1-15 to 0-17. Notwithstanding Offaly's fortuitous victory, dissent was still brewing over Babs Keating's coaching regimen. This consisted mainly of Johnny Murray's physical training drills, rather than hurling practice (although the physical fitness undoubtedly stood to Offaly later on in the year).Life, death & Hurling, page 113 On 5 July 1998, Offaly's 15th Leinster Senior Hurling Final appearance since 1980 resulted in a poor performance against Kilkenny, and a 3-10 to 1-11 defeat. The Cats were not at their sharpest either, but got over the finish line with two converted frees by DJ Carey (who had retired from inter-county hurling and then changed his mind). As the \\"back door\\" system now gave a second chance to beaten provincial finalists, Offaly were still alive. However, Babs Keating's post-match comments to the press, in which he disparaged his side's commitment, incensed several of the panel. Johnny Pilkington became their spokesman by giving a press interview of his own the following day.Irish Independent, 7 July 1998 It became clear that Keating lacked sufficient support, either among the players or at the County Board, to stay in the saddle. He was replaced by Michael Bond of Galway, who had coached the Galway U-21 hurlers to an All Ireland in 1983.The Music of the Ash, page 186 Offaly's first \\"back door\\" match was the All Ireland Senior Hurling Quarter-final against Antrim. Due to the sectarian violence that racked Northern Ireland that July, very few Antrim supporters came to Croke Park for this game. Offaly won by 2-18 to 2-9, and advanced to the All Ireland Semi-final with everything to prove. The defending champions, Clare, were also on a mission, as the disciplinary action taken against Colin Lynch (after the Munster Final against Waterford) left them feeling hard done by. The result was a contest of gladiatorial intensity, that finished Offaly 1-13, Clare 1-13. Back at Croke Park on Saturday 22 August, Offaly lined out wearing black armbands in memory of Paudie Mulhare's father, who had died that morning. (Ger Oakley started at midfield in place of Mulhare.) The Bannermen gave a more assured display than the previous week, and were ten points ahead at one stage. Offaly's drastic switches of personnel helped them to find their rhythm, and to rattle Clare in the closing stages. They were still three points behind when referee Jimmy Cooney blew it up ‚Äì after only 32 minutes and 54 seconds, or five minutes sooner than the referee had intended. He tried restarting, but several players were leaving the pitch and too many supporters were milling around. (In the subsequent weeks, abusive, cowardly and anonymous phone calls would be made to the referee's family home.) The upshot was a sit- in on the pitch by up to 3,000 Offaly supporters, so the Kerry v Kildare U-21 'B' hurling final had to be abandoned. This demonstration upped the ante on the Games Administration Committee, and deepened the bonds between the Offaly panel and its fan base.Life, death & Hurling, page 128 On the other hand, ‚Äì and notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 137 of the Official GuideThe Music of the Ash, page 188 ‚Äì the decisive factor was Clare's sportsmanship in not disputing the decision to stage the contest a third time. This would cost them dearly at Semple Stadium the following Saturday, when it was Offaly who prevailed by 0-16 to 0-13. IR¬£200,000 of the proceeds of this game went to help those hurt or bereaved by the Omagh Bombing.The Music of the Ash, page 189 Joe Dooley was both top scorer and Man of the Match; Ger \\"Sparrow\\" O'Loughlin was replaced having got no change out of Kevin Kinahan; while the goalie Stephen Byrne (Kilcormmac/ Killoughey) pulled off three superb saves. This was a team performance and there were no weak links. Michael Bond's charges continued this run of form into the All Ireland Final itself, on 13 September 1998. Once more facing a physically-tough Kilkenny side, Offaly overturned the Leinster Final verdict and won by 2-16 to 1-13. Of a myriad highlights, few would be more talked about than Brian Whelahan's move upfield, to become the fulcrum of the Offaly attack. Before lifting the McCarthy Cup, Offaly captain Hubert Rigney (St Rynagh's) declared: \\"We may have gone in the back door ‚Äì but we're coming out the front!\\" The next issue of the Midland Tribune attempted to sum up, from the Faithful County's point of view, a roller-coaster year: :: \\"So who are the heroes? Eighteen on the pitch on Sunday, ten more in the dugout, three in charge, and the team secretary from old Clareen in the background. Brendan Ward too deserves immense credit, along with Christy Todd, and all who contributed to what was the most controversial and the most amazing hurling year of all time.\\"Midland Tribune, 19 September 1998 Seir Kieran's eleven championship games of 1998 The Liam MacCarthy Cup stopped off in Clareen on Wednesday, 16 September 1998, another magical night for both club and parish.The Music of the Ash, page 190 The All Star Awards won by Joe Dooley and Kevin Kinahan in December were the icing on the cake. Even so, Seir Kieran's main focus remained the Offaly SHC. Apart from Michael Connolly the coach, the selectors for 1998 were Sean Coughlan, Sean Bergin and Willie Dooley. Their first assignment on 25 April was the recently crowned All Ireland Club champions. Conditions were heavy ‚Äì one of Liam Coughlan's puck-outs plugged without a bounce into the muck ‚Äì but both sides hurled well. As usual, though, Birr's switches stifled Seir Kieran's early advantage, and they gradually pulled away (Birr 3-14, Seir Kieran 2-7). Another defeat in the second round (Coolderry 1-7, Seir Kieran 0-6) used up more of Seir Kieran's nine lives. On the bright side, they could hope to have Johnny Dooley recovered from injury by the time the domestic championship resumed. Seir Kieran clambered back into contention in the Autumn by four wins in four weeks, beating Drumcullen by 3-10 to 1-8, Lusmagh by 3-9 to 1-10, Tullamore by 2-14 to 2-8, then Kilcormac/ Killoughey by 3-16 to 1-10 in the Quarter-final. Joe Dooley inspired many of their best passages of play. It was the same story against Coolderry on 25 October, when the black and amber avenged their May defeat (3-10 to 1-10) and stormed into their tenth Offaly Senior Hurling Final since 1985. In a tense and scrappy decider on 10 November 1998, St Rynagh's scored 1-6 from play (to only 0-1 from play for the Clareen men). However, Johnny Dooley converted from each of the ten frees (including a last-minute '65) awarded within scoring range, and the sides finished deadlocked (Seir Kieran 0-11, St Rynagh's 1-8). Thirteen days later, the two clubs renewed their epic rivalry. Seir Kieran prevailed by 1-11 to 0-8. Amidst jubilant scenes in St Brendan's Park, Kevin Kinahan lifted the Sean Robbins Cup, the last act of a quite extraordinary Offaly Senior Hurling Championship. That still left the Leinster Club championship to attend to. The following day (Sunday 22 November) the team traveled to Arklow and beat Kiltegan by 2-12 to 0-9. As was the case in 1988, 1995 and 1996, the Leinster Club Semi-final at Nowlan Park proved a bridge too far. On 29 November, Rathnure beat the Offaly standard-bearers by 3-11 to 2-8. Nonetheless, the year 1998 stands among Seir Kieran's finest, as was well expressed in a message from Carrig & Riverstown, another rural club: :: \\"Well done to Seir Kieran on winning the County Final in Birr last Saturday. Apart from being unlucky in last year's Final they have now won four Championships. They give great hope for the survival and the future of small clubs.\\"Midland Tribune, 28 November 1998 Losing the crown ‚Äì Seir Kieran and Offaly in 1999 The Seir Kieran National School panel who won the Offaly U-12 'C' hurling competition in 1999 In April 1999, Seir Kieran reached another Offaly Junior Hurling League decider. Although they lost to Lusmagh in the Final (4-7 to 3-6), their battling display augured well for the fast-approaching championships. Seir Kieran's defence of their Senior Title opened on the first of May, with a 3-7 to 0-11 win over Drumcullen ‚Äì although \\"the Sash\\" stayed in the lead until late on. Seir Kieran also looked vulnerable against Kilcormac/ Killoughey in the second round. With Johnny Dooley again out, the black and amber had 14 wides and lost by 1-14 to 3-6. When the Offaly SHC resumed in August, Sseir Kieran proved themselves back on song with a 1-16 to 0-10 win over Coolderry. Rath was the venue for the fourth round match against St Rynagh's, in which Johnny Dooley scored ten points to match his exploits in the drawn Final of 1998. Paudie Mulhare equalized for the Banagher side (0-15 apiece). In the last group game, Seir Kieran succumbed to an ominous 3-17 to 1-12 defeat by Birr. Although a hard-fought, touch-and- go victory (1-13 to 2-9) over Lusmagh in the Quarter-final steadied the Clareen ship, they still had come up with no answers for Birr by the time of the Semi-final. The defending champions were eliminated on the score-line Birr 3-22, Seir Kieran 1-7. It was the first time in six years that the black and amber had failed to contest the Offaly Senior Hurling Final. On the other hand, they reached the Offaly Junior 'A' Hurling Final on 25 September 1999 ‚Äì the first time Seir Kieran had done so in 30 years. They narrowly lost the Final to Kilcormac/ Killoughey (1-12 to 2-6). Meanwhile, John Coughlan the club's President and his wife Mary received a Sean Gael award at a function in Tullamore. When the 1999 inter-county championships got going, Seir Kieran again had four representatives on Michael Bond's panel. In addition, Damien Murphy, James Coakley and Joe Guinan were called up to the Offaly Intermediate panel, coached by Paddy Scales (St Rynagh's) with selectors Seamus Coakley (Seir Kieran) and Joe Cleary (Shinrone). The Intermediates were beaten by Kilkenny in June. In the Leinster Senior Hurling Semi-final on 20 June 1999, Offaly saw off Wexford by 3-17 to 0-15. Joe, Billy and Johnny Dooley pitched in for a combined 1-13, and Kevin Kinahan also played a stormer. In the Leinster Final on 11 July, however, the reigning Leinster Champions, now coached by Brian Cody felled the reigning All Ireland Champions (Kilkenny 5-14, Offaly 1-16). Kilkenny's goals were scored by DJ Carey (2), Henry Shefflin, Charlie Carter and Brian McEvoy. With their pride severely stung, the Faithful County regrouped admirably. Antrim hit them with everything in the All Ireland Quarter-Final, but Offaly still won by 4-22 to 0-12. The All Ireland Semi-final on 8 August 1999 was only the second-ever meeting between Cork and Offaly in the Senior Hurling Championship, and Joe Dooley was the only player to span the fifteen years since the Centenary Final.The Music of the Ash, page 197 Notwithstanding the wet and greasy conditions, the game became an instant classic of wet-day hurling, and the caliber of both sides' display was absolutely top-drawer. The Rebels shaded it by 0-19 to 0-16. Cork and Offaly each scored 0-12 from play, so the match turned on the frees awarded by the referee, Dickie Murphy.Life, death & Hurling, page 145 Another crucial factor was the maturity shown by Jimmy Barry-Murphy's gifted young team when Offaly's grip seemed to be tightening. In the aftermath, Johnny Pilkington expressed his side's perplexity at having played so brilliantly, and yet having lost the game: :: \\"I don't know where it went wrong ‚Äì if it did go wrong.\\"The Music of the Ash, page 198 The championships of 2000 Pat Fleury took over from Michael Bond for the 2000 season, for which Johnny Dooley was team captain. Although both Billy Dooley and Martin Hanamy had retired, Offaly again defeated Wexford (3-15 to 0-8) in the opening round of the championship. When both the Offaly Minor and U-21 hurling teams won out their Leinster Finals, it briefly seemed that the Faithful County's underage prospects were reviving. In the Leinster Senior Hurling Final, however, Kilkenny beat Offaly comprehensively (Kilkenny 2-21, Offaly 1-13). Kevin Kinahan grimly summed up this third-in-a-row Leinster Final defeat: \\"They opened us up and spread us out ‚Äì typical Kilkenny.\\"The Music of the Ash, page 203 The All Ireland Quarter-final took place on 23 July 2000, between Offaly and Derry. Tony Murphy, long-serving Offaly Hurling Secretary, at the All Ireland Senior Hurling Semi-final, 6 August 2000. It finished Offaly 0-19, Cork 0-15. Not only had Derry shocked Antrim in the Ulster decider, but in the second half of this Quarter-final, Offaly's experimental side looked to be in real difficulty. With an outstanding 12 points from Johnny Dooley, the Faithful County pulled through (Offaly 2-23, Derry 2-17). Not many people rated their chances for the All-Ireland Semi-final re-match against Cork. On the day, however, Offaly wore down their opponents with a display of passion, power and pride, before storming to a famous 0-19 to 0-15 victory. Gary Hanniffy (Birr) got the better of Brian Corcoran, while Kevin Kinahan effortlessly intercepted the balls lofted in towards Joe Deane in the second half. Joe Dooley rated this: \\"one of the sweetest victories of my career.\\". Although Pat Fleury's team were still the underdogs going into the All Ireland Final (10 September 2000), they believed that losing both the 1998 and the 1999 Finals would pile the pressure on Kilkenny in the closing stages. For this to be a factor, Offaly would have to prevent the concession of goals early on. That was exactly what they failed to do, as the rampant Cats scored two early goals. Johnny Dooley led by example and never gave up, but each time Offaly looked like making a comeback, Kilkenny bagged another goal. It finished Kilkenny 5-15, Offaly 1-14. Just like in 1984 and 1995, the supporters turned out for the team's homecoming in their droves. Johnny Dooley said: \\"I think this is not the end of Offaly hurling\\". The Offaly captain would receive his third All Star Award in December 2000. As usual, the end of Offaly's All Ireland campaign signaled the resumption of the domestic Senior Hurling Championship, in which Seir Kieran had finished level in the first round in April (Seir Kieran 1-11, Kilcormac/ Killoughey 1-11) then again against St Rynagh's in May (Seir Kieran 1-12, St Rynagh's 0-15). On 16 September 2000, yet a third draw (1-13 to 0-16) was the result against Birr, when a last-gasp free by Brian Whelahan ‚Äì the only still-playing athlete to be selected on the GAA's Team of the Millennium ‚Äì tied it up for the town.Magic Memories, page 157 Seir Kieran's first outright win of that year's SHC finally came on 24 September against Lusmagh, when a rain of points from all angles made it Seir Kieran 1-19, Lusmagh 2-8. Next up was Ballyskenagh, whom the black and amber defeated (Seir Kieran 4-10, Ballyskenagh 1-9) to earn direct passage to the last four. Against Kilcormac/ Killoughey on 3 December 2000, Seir Kieran narrowly prevailed (0-11 to 0-10), despite the match being marred by an injury to Joe Dooley. That winter was one of the wettest since records began, and was followed in early Spring 2001 by the Foot and Mouth crisis. Therefore, the 2000 Offaly Senior Hurling Final did not proceed until 25 March 2001. It ended Birr 3-21, Seir Kieran 1-9 ‚Äì the biggest Clareen defeat in the County Final since 1952. Modern times=Maintaining senior status Seir Kieran regrouped after the setback in the County Final, lifting the Pat Carroll Cup on 8 July 2001 following a replay (Seir Kieran 1-14, Coolderry 2-10). The team fielded as follows: Liam Coughlan; Kieran Dooley, Paddy Connors (captain), Kevin Abbott; Damien Murphy, Kevin Kinahan, Raymond Dooley; Johnny Dooley, Joe Guinan; Finbarr O'Neill, Mick Coughlan, Joe Dooley; Billy Dooley, Seamus Dooley, Barry Bergin; and substitutes Eugene Coughlan and Damien Coffey. They reached the Quarter-final of the 2001 SHC against the same opposition. Although this exciting tussle also went to a replay, Coolderry won out by 3-13 to 3-9. The club failed to mount a serious challenge for the Sean Robbins Cup in the next few years. Many of their long-serving players retired from Senior hurling, and a string of championship losses in 2007 put Seir Kieran's Senior status in jeopardy. A similar situation pertained in 2008, when a nightmare defeat to Kinnitty in the opening round of the championship left them in relegation trouble later on, but they survived the relegation play-offs against Shamrocks and Drumcullen. By 2009, the Seir Kieran panel was being augmented by some of the talented players who had won out the 2008 U-21 Title. However, Liam Coughlan continued his long service as goalkeeper, while other vastly experienced players also played on. They reached the Senior Hurling Quarter-final against Kilcormac/ Killoughey. With young Joe Bergin in devastating form at centre-forward, the black and amber had the winning of this match, but it went to a replay on 27 September which then went to extra time. It finished Kilcormac/ Killoughey 2-19, Seir Kieran 3-12. The team was coached by Padraig Madden, with selectors Seamus Dooley and Mick Coughlan. The Double Ks also eliminated Seir Kieran (1-14 to 1-11) in the Senior Hurling Quarter-final of 19 September 2010. The Seir Kieran Camogie team, captained by Sandra Dunne, who won the Offaly Junior Camogie competition 2003-2004 Seir Kieran won out the Senior Hurling League on 22 March 2011, when Donal Coughlan became the first Clareen man in a decade to lift the Pat Carroll Cup. Michael Ryan (Tynagh) was coach, with selectors Willie Dooley and Jimmy Connor. However, Coolderry were too strong for them in the 2011 SHC Quarter-final; and it was the same story against Shinrone who advanced to the last four in 2012 (Shinrone 0-16, Seir Kieran 0-11). A breakthrough of sorts was achieved in 2013, when Seir Kieran beat Coolderry to reach their first Senior Semi-final since the turn of the century, where they lost to Kilcormac/ Killoughey. With James Mulrooney in excellent form, they also got to the last four in 2014. However, it was St Rynagh's who went on to the County Final (St Rynagh's 1-17, Seir Kieran 2-07). Building a new clubhouse and compiling the club's history The Seir Kieran clubhouse was redeveloped in the early years of the 21st century, a project managed by the then Club Secretary, Willie Dooley. As well as expanded changing and shower facilities for hurling, camogie and other Gaelic games, the redevelopment comprises enhanced meeting areas used by the GAA and other organisations in the local community. On completion of the project in early 2006, the entire debt from the cost of construction had been discharged. In the same time frame, the club's history, The Music of the Ash, was published. The Secretary asked Jimmy Blake, a club member with a degree in history from University College Dublin, to write the book, which was then edited by Professor Muiris O'Sullivan of the UCD School of Archaeology. The book runs to almost 500 pages and narrates most of the matches in which Seir Kieran players have lined out. It lists the scoreline, team and opposing team for about 1,050 games between 1887 and 2001, including for 283 Offaly Senior league and championship games, 99 Leinster and All Ireland Senior Hurling Championship games, and 193 National Hurling League ties. Also included are 58 photographs and illustrations, 34 of which are in colour. Nickey Brennan, the GAA President, termed the book \\"a massive undertaking\\". The official opening of the new clubhouse, together with the launch of the Club History, took place in April 2006. The then Minister for Finance (and future Taoiseach), Brian Cowen, T.D., commended the contribution to Offaly that Seir Kieran continued to make, and declared the facility open. Other speakers included Ollie Daly, the then chairman of the Offaly County Board, GAA, Michael Murphy, the then Seir Kieran chairman, Willie Dooley, and Muiris O'Sullivan. Sean Dooley acted as M.C. for the evening. In the course of his remarks, Professor O'Sullivan said that the heroes of this book were not only there in the clubhouse. He said there was a belief in Ireland long ago that the souls of the dead gathered round close to the living at special times of the year. The heroes of this book were abroad, either living or dead, down in the graveyard or around the country.Midland Tribune, 5 April 2006 Professor Muiris O'Sullivan, UCD, speaking at launch of Seir Kieran GAA Club History Competitions involving the Seir Kieran National School Training in the skills of the Gaelic games has become a more central part of PE courses at Seir Kieran National School in recent years, and has aimed at maximising the athletic potential and team- working of every girl and boy. The U-13 School team and the U-13 ground hurling team both won out their competitions in 2007. They were presented with their medals by Joseph Bergin on Saturday, 1 March 2008. Also present on the night were the club's main sponsors that year, Osierbrook Cottages, Ciara Morris and Michael Camon, as well as Fr. Peter Muldowney, PP. In September 2009, the Seir Kieran U-12 camogie team won their Title, beating Kinnitty in a thrilling match. In 2014, the School's hurlers won out the 'B' Title and reached the Final of the 'A' championship. In October 2014, the Seir Kieran GAA club presented a hurley to each pupil, in recognition for their successful efforts on the field of play in the previous school year. Eugene Coughlan, who had won Seir Kieran's first All Star Award 30 years previously, made the presentation to each boy and girl. The Under 21 hurling title of 2008 On a score line of Seir Kieran 0-8, Shamrocks 1-4, Seir Kieran won the Under 16 ‚ÄòB‚Äô hurling title in November 2007. In dreadful weather conditions at Mount Bolus, Thomas Carroll did well to score five points from play. However, it took a late pointed free from Sean Coughlan to give the Clareen side victory over a courageous Shamrocks panel. Seir Kieran were the better team over the hour, although they squandered wind advantage by shooting ten first-half wides. Conor Kennedy the captain lifted the Peter Fox Memorial Cup. This Title was a prelude to an even more notable win the following springtime, when Seir Kieran √ìg beat Kilcormac Killoughey Gaels (1-11 to 0-13) in the Offaly U-21 'A' Hurling Final. Having scored 1-6 of the winners' total, Joseph Bergin the captain lifted the P.J. Teehan Cup. The winning panel were drawn entirely from the Parish of Seir Kieran, an achievement which was widely commented on and admired. Seir Kieran √ìg also reached the U-21 'A' Final at Banagher in 2009, although Kilcormac/ Killoughey proved too strong on this occasion. The Clareen side only had one substitute on the bench. In 2010, when the panel was augmented by players from Drumcullen and Gracefield, Seir Kieran √ìg reached their third U-21 Final in succession, but lost to Coolderry. The Junior 'A' hurling titles of 2006 and 2014 Seir Kieran bridged a 37-year gap by winning out the Junior 'A' Final of 2006. Kevin Carey the captain lifted the James Clarke Cup. Joe Dooley, by now reverted to Junior hurling, played a starring role. Winning this Title was a signal accomplishment, as each of the club's previous five Junior championships were in years when the club had no Senior team. The black and amber would continue on winning ways at Lusmagh on 29 November 2008, by winning the Division 3 Hurling League Final (Seir Kieran 1-10, Drumcullen 1-9). Five of the side had played in the 1988 Offaly Senior Hurling Final, all of twenty years before. By contrast, six others had lined out in the 2008 Minor Semi-final against St Rynagh's on 20 September. One of these, Colm Coughlan scored six points from frees, including the winner in stoppage time.Offaly Express, 3 December 2008 ‚Äì Patrick Donegan's match report Paul Scully lifted the Loughnane Cup. Seir Kieran, Offaly Junior Hurling Champions, 2014 On 19 October 2014, Seir Kieran beat Ballinamere by 2-12 to 1-8, to win a magnificent seventh Junior 'A' Title. Michael John Corrigan was captain. On 6 September at Crinkill, the panel had beaten Birr by 4-13 to 1-13 in the Final of the Division 2 League. The Clareen goals were scored by Peadar Murray, Michael John Corrigan and Michael Gilligan. Peadar Murray was nominated as Offaly's Junior hurling player of the year for 2014.

It was built as a seat of the powerful Tƒôczy≈Ñski family. The castle fell into ruin during the Deluge in mid-17th century, after being pillaged and burned by Swedish-Brandenburgian forces looking for the Polish Crown Jewels and rumored treasures of the Tƒôczy≈Ñski family. Subsequently, rebuilt, after a fire in the mid-18th century it again fell into disrepair and remains in that state to this day. Castle stands on rocks which are remnants of Permian lava stream, constituting the highest hill of Garb Tenczy≈Ñski (Castle Hill 411 m above the sea level). History The name of the castle comes from the name of the daughter of Tynek Star≈ºa. According to the legend, he arrived here in the 9th century, founded Tyniec and built a castle for his daughter Tƒôcza (Rainbow). The first mention of the stronghold is dated 24 September 1308, when king W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, who was hunting in the woods \\"in Thanczin\\", issued a diploma to the Cistercian monastery in Sulej√≥w. It is believed that the first wooden structure was erected around 1319 by Jan Naw√≥j of Morawica, Castellan of Cracow. He also built the largest of the castle towers, called today the Nawojowa tower. The medieval castle included three additional round Gothic towers. Further expansion was carried out by Jan's son Jƒôdrzej, governor of Cracow and Sandomierz. He erected the north-east part of the structure, where he lived, dying there in 1368; he is also known as the first to take the name Tƒôczy≈Ñski. Jƒôdrzej's son Jasko renewed and significantly expanded the castle, and founded a chapel. The first recorded mention relating directly to the castle dates from this period. The king W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço imprisoned some important Teutonic prisoners, captured during the Battle of Grunwald, in the castle. To commemorate this event one of the castle's turrets was called Grunwaldzka. Portrait of Stanis≈Çaw Tƒôczy≈Ñski by Tommaso Dolabella, 1633. The painting is one of the portraits from the castle's gallery. Within a short period of time the Tƒôczy≈Ñski family rose to a great importance in Poland, holding 45 estates, of which 15 were near the castle. Around the middle of the sixteenth century, the castle was frequented by Miko≈Çaj Rej, Jan Kochanowski, Piotr Kochanowski and other important figures of the Polish Renaissance. According to Bartosz Paprocki, in 1570 Jan Tƒôczy≈Ñski, Castellan of Wojnicz \\"at great cost built a new castle in Tƒôczyn\\". The new mannerist structure had three wings with a central courtyard open to the west and adorned with Renaissance attics, cornices and arcades. It was also surrounded by a curtain wall on the north, strengthened with a bastion entry (barbican). Two pentagonal bastions were erected on the south. After the reconstruction the castle took the shape of an irregular polygon, measuring over 140 meters from east to west, and 130 meters from north to south. Italian gardens and vineyards stretched out below the castle. The last big expenditure on the castle was a thorough reconstruction of the castle chapel, completed in the early 17th century by Agnieszka Firlejowa n√©e Tƒôczy≈Ñska. In 1637 Jan Magnus Tƒôczy≈Ñski, the last representative of the family, died in the castle. His only daughter Izabela married ≈Åukasz Opalinski. In 1655, during the Deluge, the rumor was spread that Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, Grand Marshal of the Crown had hidden the Polish Crown Jewels in Tenczyn Castle. The Swedish- Brandenburgian forces led by Kurt Christoph von K√∂nigsmarck captured the castle against a defence led by captain Jan Dziula and slaughtered all of its defenders. When they did not find treasure they left the fortress and burned it in July 1656. After the Deluge the castle was for the most part rebuilt and partially inhabited. At the beginning of the 18th century the Tenczyn estates passed to Adam Miko≈Çaj Sieniawski, later to Prince August Aleksander Czartoryski who had married with Sieniawski's only daughter Maria Zofia, eventually passing to his daughter Izabela Lubomirska. After the fire in 1768 the structure increasingly fell into disrepair. In 1783, the remains of Jan Magnus Tƒôczy≈Ñski were moved from the castle chapel to a new tomb in St. Catherine's Church in Tenczynek. In 1816, the castle became the property of the Potocki family and remained in their hands until the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Plan of the castle Hypothetical reconstruction of the castle full layout was drawn according to research of W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åuszczkiewicz, Nikodem Pajzderski, Stanis≈Çaw Polaczek, Bohdan Guerquin, Marian Kornecki, Teresa Ma≈Çkowska-Holcerowa and Janusz Kurtyka.

History  The city was located in the northeastern corner of the district of Phthiotis at the northern end of the ancient Krokian Plain, to the north of the Pagasetic Gulf, at the distance of 300 stadia from Larissa. Evidence of human habitation on the site dates back to the Stone Age, but the city is not mentioned by name until the 4th century BCE. Strabo placed it at 20 stadia distant from Pyrasus and near Phylace. Its territory was bounded on the north by Pherae, on the northeast by Amphanae, on the east by Pyrasus, on the south by Halos, southwest with Peuma, and west with Eretria and Pharsalus. There was a sanctuary of Athena in the border territory with Halos, a city with which Thebes shared it. An inscription of the late fourth century BCE attests to the presence of a cult of Athena Polias.Inscriptiones Graecae IX.2 1322 Furthermore, Athena Ileia, Demeter Panachaea,Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum 25, 643. Protesilaus,Pindar, Isthmian Odes I, 58. Nike, and Leucothea were worshiped. In the late 4th century BCE, the city was joined (synoecism) with the neighbouring cities of Phylace and Pyrasos. The new conurbation retained the name of Phthiotic or Thessalian Thebes, and became the main city of the Phthiotic Achaean League until it joined the Aetolian League in the late 3rd century BCE. Professor John Grainger of the University of Birmingham concluded, from evidence relating to the election of men from Thebes to office in the Aetolian League, that the city became a member of the League in the 220s BCE.John D. Grainger, The League of the Aitolians (p.239), Brill (1999) It is not mentioned in the Iliad, but it was at a later time the most important maritime city in Thessaly, till the foundation of Demetrias, by Demetrius Poliorcetes, about 294 BCE.\\"Thebas Phthias unum maritimum emporium fuisse quondam Thessalis quaestuosum et fugiferum,\\" In the war between Demetrius Poliorcetes and Cassander, in 302 BCE, Thebes was one of the strongholds of Cassander. It is mentioned in 282 BCE, as the only Thessalian city, except Pelinnaeum, that did not take part in the Lamian War. It became at a later time the chief possession of the Aetolians in northern Greece; but it was wrested from them, after an obstinate siege, by Philip V of Macedon in 217 BCE, who changed its name into Philippopolis. Its inhabitants were enslaved, and the city became a Macedonian colony.Getzel M. Cohen, The Hellenistic Settlements in Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor, p. 118, University of California Press (1995) Polybius tells how Philip laid siege to the city, first building three camps and then joining them up with lines of circumvallation. Though initially the city offered determined resistance the citizens surrendered when a section of the wall that Philip had mined collapsed.Polybius ‚Ä¢ Histories ‚Äî Book 5 It was attacked by the consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus, previous to the Battle of Cynoscephalae, 197 BCE, but without success. Following Philip's defeat by the Roman Republic in the Second Macedonian War, in 189 BCE Phthiotic Thebes again became capital of the restored Phthiotic Achaean League. The name of Philippopolis was gradually dropped, though both names are used by Livy in narrating the transactions of the year 185 BCE. It continued to exist under the name of Thebes in the time of the Roman Empire, and is mentioned by Hierocles in the sixth century.\\"Thebae Thessalae,\\" \\"Œò·øÜŒ≤Œ±Œπ œÜŒ∏ŒπœâœÑŒØŒ¥ŒøœÇ,\\" Under the Roman Empire, the city was moved from the inland site of the old Phthiotic Thebes back to Pyrasos. The old site was not abandoned, but for the remainder of the city's existence, its centre lay at the site of Pyrasos, where the harbour was also located. In Late Antiquity, it became part of the province of Thessaly, of which it was the third-most important city and main harbour. The city's prosperity from the 4th through the 6th centuries is attested by the number of its Early Christian monuments, but was brought to an end in a great fire in the late 7th century that destroyed the city. The city was rebuilt and apparently continued to be of some note in the early Byzantine period‚Äîits bishop is last mentioned in the 8th/9th century‚Äîbut never recovered and was eventually eclipsed by the nearby port city of Halmyros.  Archaeological remains  Capital from Basilica A of Phthiotic Thebes According to the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, the site \\"is best known because of the many churches excavated there (nine basilicas have been found)\\". These include: * Basilica A, a three-aisled basilica from the late 5th/early 6th century, dedicated to Saint Demetrius, which served as the cathedral church. * Basilica B, or \\"Elpidios Basilica\\", also dating roughly to the late 5th/early 6th century. * Basilica C, also known \\"Church of the archiereus Peter\\" based on a mid-6th century inscription, although it dates to the late 4th/early 5th century. It features \\"elaborate floor mosaics and is part of a vast ecclesiastical complex\\". * Basilica D, a 7th-century cemetery church outside the city walls. The original acropolis of Phthiotic Thebes was ringed by a Cyclopean wall. The later wall of the lower city is still largely extant, although in a ruined state. It features 40 towers and dates, according to Friedrich St√§hlin (Das hellenische Thessalien, 1924), to the 4th century BCE. Excavations on the acropolis have produced the foundations of a 9√ó12 m Classical-era temple, possibly dedicated to Athena Polias. This in turn was built with material from an earlier temple. In the lower city, the remains of the ancient theatre and a Hellenistic stoa can still be seen. Most of the finds are in the Archaeological Museum of Volos, with a few in the Almyros Museum.

Hardy was born in the Islington district of North London, and went into business in the City of London. He was a member of the Greenwich Vestry, and later served as a councillor on Camberwell Borough Council. In the March 1901 elections for the London County Council, Hardy was elected as a Progressive Party councillor for the Dulwich division of Camberwell. He was re-elected in 1904, but at the 1907 elections, the Municipal Reform Party made sweeping gains and Hardy lost his seat on the council. He was elected at the 1906 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stowmarket division of Suffolk. At that time he was a deacon of the Camberwell Green Congregational Church, president of the south- east London Free Church Council, chairman of the Dulwich Society of Public Morality and a member of the London Missionary Society. The Times reported in January 1910 that although he was \\"a good worker and a good speaker\\", Hardy was likely to lose the seat at the January 1910 election to his unionist opponent Frank Goldsmith, who had been working hard to cultivate the support of agricultural workers. Hardy's majority in 1906 had been only 2.2% of the votes, and Goldsmith took the seat on a swing of 4.3%. After his defeat, Hardy did not stand again in Stowmarket, but on 15 November 1910 he was adopted as one of the two Liberal candidates for the borough of Bath, a marginal constituency where the Liberals had lost both of the two seats in January 1910.Craig, page 66 At the general election, in December 1910, the Conservatives held both seats. He stood for the London County Council again at the 1913 elections, this time in Stepney, but did not win a seat. However he was nominated by the Progressive Party as an alderman, and at the new Council's first meeting on 13 March 1913, he was elected to serve as an alderman until 1919. He was elected again as an alderman in 1919, but died the following year at his home on Champion Hill in East Dulwich, aged 68.

Early life and education  Chang was born into a Manchu Bannermen family of the Irgen Gioro clan in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. His family was accorded a minor noble title of a Knight Commandant in the Qing Dynasty. Chang graduated from the Industrial School of Zhejiang (now Zhejiang University) in 1923. Two years later, in 1925, he became an instructor in the fine arts at his alma mater. Pursuing further education in the arts, Chang left China for Lyon, France in June 1927. He initially enrolled in l'institut Franco-chinois de Lyon, where he met his wife, fellow art student Chen Zhixiu. Their daughter, Chang Shana, was born in Lyon in 1931. In 1928, Chang moved to Paris to attend the prestigious √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts (ENSBA, the National School of Fine Arts). Chen Zhixiu was also admitted to the ENSBA, studying sculpture.  Return to China and journey to Dunhuang  While a student at the ENSBA in Paris, Chang supposedly stopped at a second-hand book stall where he was invited to peruse a copy of Paul Pelliot's \\"Dunhuang Caves Catalogue\\" (Êï¶ÁÖåÁü≥Á™üÂõæÂΩï) documenting the ancient Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, China. The next day, he discovered a large collection of Asian artwork being exhibited at the Guimet Museum which had been plundered by Western explorers from various sites in Dunhuang. These discoveries instigated Chang's lifelong interest in the Mogao Caves and would precipitate his decision to return to China despite the protestations of Chen Zhixiu, who hoped her husband would pursue his highly promising career as an artist in France. In 1936, after returning to China, Chang began teaching at the National Art Institute in Beijing. In 1943, he moved his family to remote Dunhuang to pursue his dream of exploring Mogao Caves. He began over 40 years of rural life, tending to the Mogao Caves and creating his own artwork while at Dunhuang.  Dunhuang Research Institute  By 1945 Chen Zhixiu felt that their rural lifestyle was unbearable, separating from Chang and leaving Dunhuang. Their daughter Chang Shana remained with her father, growing up among the Mogao Caves. She would eventually follow his path to become a renowned artist and Dunhuang scholar. Chang Shuhong's artworks and steadfast determination to the caves garnered public attention in China, and he became renowned as the ‚ÄúGuardian of Dunhuang‚Äù.

Barger (born 1958) is one of the co-founders of JetBlue Airways. He also served as the airline's chief executive officer of the airline until his ouster in February 2015. He had been part of JetBlue's founding team and served on the corporation's board of directors. Barger is currently an Operating Partner at Connor Capital SB.  Career  Dave Barger's interest in airlines came from his father, who was a United Airlines pilot for 37 years. From 1982 to 1988, Barger served in a number of positions with New York Air, such as the Director of Stations. In 1992 he joined with Continental Airlines and held various management positions including Vice President of Continental's Newark Liberty International Airport hub. Barger was one of the first employees of JetBlue Airways in 1998, and served as the Chief Operating Officer until March 2007. Following a February 2007 incident in which the airline was forced to cancel nearly 1,700 flights due to winter storms, JetBlue's board of directors replaced founder and Chief Executive Officer David Neeleman with Barger. He had politicked the board, while Neeleman was busy publicly apologizing. Barger's ascendancy caused widespread demoralization in the ranks. He became JetBlue's new Chief Executive Officer on May 10, 2007. Neeleman, the company's founder and largest individual investor, became a nonexecutive chairman as a result of the change. On June 1, 2009, Barger became the president of JetBlue. On September 18, 2014, Barger announced his resignation from the company effective February 16, 2015, following several reports that investors and the board were unhappy with the lagging stock price and Barger's performance. He was replaced on the board and as CEO by Robin Hayes. The stock price increased rapidly after Barger's removal was announced. Barger has been a Non-Executive Director of AIM Aviation Ltd since February 2014. He has been a Director of gategroup Holding AG since April 2015, and serves as a Director at The Partnership for New York City, Inc. He also serves as a Member of the Board of Governors at International Air Transport Association (IATA). He joined the Boards of Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. in May 2017, serving as a member of the Governance, Accountability and Nominating Committee, as well as the Finance Committee.

The site is now used by Haven Holidays for a caravan park and has been renamed Hafan y M√¥r. When originally opened in 1947, it was named Butlins Pwllheli, but in 1990 was renamed Starcoast World. Butlins During World War II the Admiralty, who had already taken over his camp at Filey, asked Billy Butlin to construct two new camps; one in North Wales and the other in Scotland. Butlin found 150 acres of farm land on the Ll≈∑n Peninsula in Wales. The camp opened in 1940 as HMS Glendower, an overflow training camp to HMS Royal Arthur.The National Archives, Kew. ADM 1/10431 The Admiralty contracted with Butlin's to extend the camp in 1942.The National Archives, Kew. ADM 1/10431 In 1946, after the war, Butlin took back ownership of the camp from the Admiralty and Butlins Pwllheli was opened to the public after some reconstruction work. The holiday camp expanded during the 1950s and 1960s with additional chalet lines and facilities. At the peak in the late 1960s it could accommodate 12,000 campers, serviced by 1,500 staff.Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, maps 1953 to 1970 On 9 August 1963 Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh paid an official visit to the holiday camp.The National Archives, Kew. HO 290/74 Pwllheli holiday camp contained established Butlins ingredients: the Butlins Redcoats, funfair, early morning wake up, dining hall (with the cheers going up when a waitress drops a plate), indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a ballroom, a boating lake, tennis courts, a sports field (for the three legged and egg & spoon races and the donkey derby), table tennis and snooker tables, an amusement arcade, a medical centre, a theatre, arcades of shops, a chairlift system and a miniature railway. There were many bars and coffee bars. A ¬£1 million entertainment complex at the camp, constructed in 1962, was destroyed by fire in the early hours of 9 August 1973. No one died, although some campers suffered minor injuries. The cause was identified as faulty electrical wiring. During the 1989 summer season, chalets were damaged by a tornado, and the 3,500 guests present had to leave. The estimated ¬£2 million damage was a contributing factor in the later transfer of the camp to the Haven brand. Railway station Penychain railway station, formerly known as (and still sometimes referred to as) Butlins Penychain railway station, is located at an overbridge on an unclassified lane just west of the camp. This railway station is an unstaffed halt on the Cambrian Coast Railway with passenger services to Pwllheli, Porthmadog, Harlech, Barmouth, Machynlleth and Shrewsbury, the station still serves the camp but trains only call by request. Haven Holidays In 1999, the camp became part of Haven Holidays along with the Heads of Ayr camp as part of an internal reorganisation within The Rank Group who, at the time, owned both Butlins and Haven (both have since been purchased by the owner of British Holidays, Bourne Leisure, in 2000). Since being taken over by Haven Holidays it was renamed Hafan y M√¥r (Sea Haven) and the focus of operations was transformed from predominantly chalet accommodation to mostly static caravan accommodation. Most of the attractions were also removed including the chairlift, miniature railway, roller coaster and funfair.

Originally a double LP, it was reissued by Virgin Records in 1997 on one CD, with the closing track \\"Golgatha and the Circle Closes\\" missing. Froese has since remixed the album and released it on his own Eastgate label in 2005. This version also omitted a track, but not the same one as before, and another song, \\"Metropolis\\", was shortened. The album was recorded in Autumn 1977 at Amber Studios in Berlin. The drums and percussion were played by Klaus Kr√ºger (aka Klaus Krieger) who was in Tangerine Dream at the time. Some parts of songs on the album were later reused on Tangerine Dream's albums, most notably \\"Nights of Automatic Women\\", which is very similar to \\"Madrigal Meridian\\" from Cyclone. Before the album was released, \\"Ode to Granny A\\" was released in an abridged form as the b-side to Tangerine Dream's live single \\"Encore\\", under the title \\"Hobo March\\". Reception On its initial release, the album failed to chart in any territory. A review on the AllMusic website by Jim Brenholts awarded the album 4.5 stars stating \\"Edgar Froese is a great musician and a shrewd businessman. Realizing that he and his associates would need money to fund the progress of Tangerine Dream, he took advantage of both of those qualities and launched his solo career while Tangerine Dream was still in their infancy. That solo career has contributed many gems and classics to the e-music community. Ages is one of those classics. This album has all of Froese's virtuosity and something that his listeners rarely hear -- a sense of humor. Froese does not show that side of himself to his listeners very often, so it is a treat. Putting that positive energy into play does much for this album; it makes it a classic.

The film was selected as the official Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards. It made it to the penultimate round of nominations and competed with eight other films. Plot Simon is an 18-year-old man with Asperger Syndrome. Incapable of living independently, he is cared for by his endlessly loving and patient brother, Sam, and Sam's girlfriend, Frida. He lives by an unchanging daily routine and finds any change in his life very stressful. He spends his day working as a groundskeeper in a special program for mentally disabled people, tending athletic fields and roadsides. He imposes routine on his two housemates with a wall chart that allocates chores and schedules leisure. When the world becomes too stressful, Simon seals himself in a large pot and imagines himself floating in space, where everything is perfectly quiet and predictable. These habits cause a lot of tension with his two housemates. One night, Simon interrupts Sam and Frida while they are having sex in order to ask for toilet paper. For Frida, this is the last straw, and the next day she dumps Sam and moves out. Simon returns home from work to find the house empty and dinner unprepared. When Sam returns home, he decides to order pizza for dinner, but this further distresses Simon as they usually eat tacos on Friday evenings. When Sam announces that Frida is definitely gone for good and that they must adapt, Simon suffers a meltdown. Sam, upset at Frida's departure, tries to rationalize away his pain by criticizing Frida's habits, such as being bad at sex and eating caviar sandwiches. Simon interprets these remarks literally and visits Frida's house, asking her to return and change her habits, since Simon is incapable of changing his. Frida angrily drives him off, telling him he ought to find another girl to take her place. Simon, as is his nature, takes Frida's remark seriously, and sets off to find Sam a new girlfriend who will better fit in with their lifestyle. Unaware of how love and courtship work, he compiles a list of Sam's tastes and habits and proceeds to look for women who match the profile. He stops random women in the streets and asks 13 certain questions (such as \\"do you prefer dogs to cats?\\" and \\"do you make noises when having sex?\\"), and when he finds a woman who answers all 13 questions correctly, he takes their details and photographs them. He presents to Sam an album of suitable matches he has found and asks him to choose his new girlfriend from them. Sam rejects the list, telling Simon it would be boring for him to have a girlfriend who matches his habits exactly, and suggests that a girl who differs from him would be more attractive, in the same way that the opposing poles of a magnet attract.

Independence The co-operative has maintained a strong independent history within the New Zealand dairy industry. In the 2001 mega-merger for the New Zealand dairy industry - which formed Fonterra - Tatua shareholders decided to remain independent. Given that New Zealand had over 500 dairy co-operatives in the 1930s, Tatua is unique in that it is the only New Zealand dairy co-operative remaining that has never been part of any merger throughout its history. Performance Tatua often records the highest payout for milksolids to the farmer shareholders in New Zealand. While the high level of payout is partly due to a small catchment area (which reduces processing costs), the excellent financial performance of Tatua is increasingly attributed to focusing on value-added milk products rather than traditional, mass-produced, commodity-based milk products such as milk powder, butter and cheese.

He was responsible for the Vickers Vimy, a heavy bomber designed during World War 1 and the first aircraft to cross the Atlantic non-stop. He was the chief designer of the Vickers Wellington bomber of World War 2. Early life Pierson was born on 9 February 1891 at Little Fransham, Norfolk, the son of the rector the Reverend Kirshaw T. Pierson and his wife Helen Mary. He was educated at the Felsted School in Essex. Career Vickers Vimy of Alcock and Brown, which landed at Clifden, at the Science Museum in June 2015 Vickers Although his father wanted him to work in a bank, young Rex started an apprenticeship in 1908 with Vickers at Erith. As soon as the company started an aircraft section in 1911 he joined that part of the company and learned to fly. He gained Royal Aero Club Aviator's certificate number 660 on 14 October 1913 at Brooklands. By 1917 he was the chief aircraft designer at Vickers based in its Knightsbridge offices in London. In 1917 he designed the twin-engined Vickers Vimy biplane heavy bomber which entered service with the Royal Air Force in 1919. A Vimy, flown by John Alcock and Arthur Brown, made the first non-stop crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in June 1919. Among his many other designs were the Vickers Vespa which held the world altitude record in 1932 and the Vickers Wellesley which held the world long distance record in 1938. 311 Sqn at RAF East Wretham in Norfolk Vickers Wellington He was also chief designer of the Vickers Wellington twin-engined bomber, of which nearly 11,500 were built between 1936 and 1945.

Pierson was promoted to chief engineer in 1946. His successor as chief designer was the engineer and industrial leader Sir George Edwards. Personal life After a long illness Pierson died at his home in Cranleigh, Surrey on 10 January 1948 aged only 56. His name and achievements are commemorated by an annual R K Pierson Lecture held by the Royal Aeronautical Society (Weybridge Branch) at Brooklands Museum, usually in November.

It occupies a triangular promontory of Colerne Down at the southern edge of the Cotswold Hills between two spurs of a river valley. The enclosed area of approximately 9.2ha is surrounded by a ditch 4m wide and up to 1m deep, and an outer rampart up to 1.5m high on the east and northwestern sides and up to 2m high on the southwestern side, across the neck of the promontory. The contours of the land provide excellent natural defences to the north and east sides. On the south western side, where there are no natural defences, there is a further ditch 4m wide and 1m deep and an outer rampart up to 2m high and 3m wide. These are crossed by many causeways, which could be interpreted as an indication that the construction of the monument was never fully completed. The entrance in the middle of the south western side is thought to be of modern origin. At the north eastern corner the inner bank turns inwards to form a funnel shaped entrance leading to a hollow way running down the steep scarp into the valley below. Another entrance about a quarter of the way along the north western side also consists of inward turning ramparts forming a funnel shaped entrance. A small enclosure within the camp is visible on aerial photographs. It is circular, 72m in diameter, with a bank and an outer ditch. The site is a scheduled national monument no.28993. Excavations carried out under Denis Grant King, from 1959 onwards, turned over some good examples of Iron Age drystone walling, and found remains of a much earlier structure that existed at the north east entrance, indicated by drystone revetments within the northern rampart. In a second stage the entrance was remodelled and widened. At the north west entrance, four staggered post holes were uncovered as well as a cylindrical cavity 0.66m deep, interpreted as a gate post hole. The general history of the fort, beginning with its initial building, can be dated to about 350 BC, however various Neolithic and Mesolithic flint tools were found, indicating a much earlier use. Flint artefacts including scrapers, cores and flakes were found within the camp. Rotary and saddle querns were also found, along with a possible axe polishing stone. In 1960, 175 shards of pottery were recovered. All except one was plain coarse ware without a trace of decoration. Of organic remains, only two fragments of human bones were found, whereas between 400 and 500 animal bone fragments were found. This included typical domestic animals such as sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, horses and dogs. Six specimens were of very large birds, probably swans or geese. Deer, fox, rabbit and vole bones were also found. The relative rarity of anything but domestic animals may suggest that the camp was based on stock keeping and that it was unlikely that hunting played a large part of the food economy of the camp. Location The site is located at , to the south of the village of North Wraxall, in the county of Wiltshire. The site has a height of 145m AOD. The Fosse Way Roman road passes close by to the west.

It was established in the early 8th century, once the first wave of the Muslim conquests ebbed, and lasted until the mid-10th century, when it was overrun by the Byzantine advance. It comprised the forward marches, comprising a chain of fortified strongholds, known as the al-thugh≈´r (; sing. al-thagr, , \\"cleft, opening\\"), and the rear or inner regions of the frontier zone, which was known as the al- øawƒÅ·π£im proper. On the Byzantine side, the Muslim marches were mirrored by the institution of the kleisourai districts and the akritai border guards. The term thugh≈´r was also used in the marches of al-Andalus and Mawara al-Nahr, and survived in historical parlance, to be revived by the Egyptian Mamluks in the 14th century, when the areas traditionally comprising the ' øawƒÅ·π£im and thugh≈´r in northern Syria and the northern Euphrates region came under their control.Honigmann (1987), p. 739  Arab‚ÄìByzantine frontier zone = Creation of the frontier zone  Already from late 630s, after the rapid Muslim conquest of Syria, a wide zone, unclaimed by either Byzantines or Arabs and virtually deserted (known in Arabic as al-·∏åawƒÅ·∏•ƒ´ (, \\"of the Outer Lands\\")) and in Greek as ta akra (, \\"the extremities\\") emerged between the two powers in Cilicia, along the southern approaches of the Taurus and Anti-Taurus mountain ranges, leaving the Anatolian plateau in Byzantine hands. Both Emperor Heraclius () and the Caliph  øUmar () pursued a strategy of destruction within this zone, trying to transform it into an effective barrier between their realms.Streck (1987), p. 515Kaegi (1995), pp. 236‚Äì244 Nevertheless, the ultimate aim of the caliphs remained the outright conquest of Byzantium, as they had done with its provinces in Syria, Egypt and North Africa, and it was only the failure of the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople in 717‚Äì718 that forced a revision of this strategic objective: although raids into Anatolia continued, the goal of conquest was abandoned, and the border between the two powers began to acquire more permanent features. For the next two centuries, border fortresses might change hands between Byzantines and Arabs, but the basic outline of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine border remained essentially unaltered.Kaegi (1995), pp. 246‚Äì247Toynbee (1973), pp. 108‚Äì109Whittow (1996), p. 212 Thus the term al-thugh≈´r, which initially meant \\"fissures, clefts\\" (cf. their Greek name ta Stomia, , \\"the mouths/openings\\") and designated the actual borderlands, came to mean \\"boundaries\\", employed in phrases like Thugh≈´r al- IslƒÅm ((, \\"Boundary of Islam\\") or Thugh≈´r al-R≈´mƒ´ya (, \\"Boundary of the Romans\\").El-Cheikh (2004), p. 84Honigmann (1987), p. 738 Map of the Byzantine- Arab frontier zone in southeastern Asia Minor, with the major fortresses This process was marked by a gradual consolidation of the previously deserted zone and its transformation into a settled and fortified borderland, especially after the Byzantines abandoned Cilicia during the reign of Caliph Abd al-Malik (). The Muslims began to move into the area, reoccupying and repairing the abandoned towns and forts. The process began under the Umayyads, but intensified under the first Abbasids, especially during the rule of Harun al- Rashid (). Thus a line of forts was gradually established, stretching from Tarsus (Ar. ·π¨ars≈´s) on the Mediterranean coast to Malatya (Ar. Mala·π≠iyƒÅ, Gr. Melitene) and Kamacha (Ar. ·∏§i·π£n Kamkh) on the upper course of the Euphrates.El-Cheikh (2004), p. 83Wheatley (2000), pp. 260‚Äì261Vasiliev (1935), pp. 94‚Äì96 These were located at strategic choke points, located at the intersections of major roads or at the mouths of important passes.Kazhdan (1991), p. 238  Administrative organization and settlements  The entire frontier zone was initially part of the jund (one of the military administrative divisions into which Muslim Syria was divided) of Homs. After 680 it formed part of the new jund of Qinnasrin (Gr. Chalkis), until Harun al- Rashid established a separate jund al- øAwƒÅ·π£im () in 786, covering the entire region from the Byzantine border in the north and west to the Euphrates in the east and a line running south of Antioch (Ar. An·π≠ƒÅkiya), Aleppo (Ar. ·∏§alab, Gr. Berroia) and Manbij (Gr. Hierapolis). Manbij and later Antioch were the new province's capitals.Wheatley (2000), p. 116 The al- øAwƒÅ·π£im proper served as the second defensive line behind the Thugh≈´r, stretching across northern Syria and comprising the towns of Baghras, BayƒÅs, Dul≈´k (Gr. Doliche or Telouch, modern Gaziantep), Alexandretta (Ar. Iskandarƒ´ya), Cyrrhus (Ar. ƒ∂≈´rus), Ra'bƒÅn and Tƒ´zƒ´n. The Thugh≈´r, the actual frontier zone, was divided into the Cilician or Syrian (al-Thugh≈´r al-Sha'mƒ´ya, ) and the Jaziran or Mesopotamian (al-Thugh≈´r al-Jazƒ´rƒ´ya, ) sectors, roughly separated by the Amanus mountains. There was no overall governor or administrative centre for the Thugh≈´r, although Tarsus and Malatya emerged as the most important towns in Cilicia and the Mesopotamian sector respectively. The towns of the Thugh≈´r came variously under the administrative control of the jund al- øAwƒÅ·π£im or functioned as separate districts; the situation is complicated by the fact that by the 10th century, the terms Thugh≈´r and al- øAwƒÅ·π£im were often used interchangeably in the sources.Honigmann (1987), pp. 738‚Äì739Wheatley (2000), pp. 116, 260 In addition, from the early 10th century, with the Byzantine advance into Armenia, the frontier around DiyƒÅr Bakr became a third sector, al-Thugh≈´r al-Bakrƒ´ya ().Honigmann (1935), pp. 42‚Äì43 In the Cilician sector, Mopsuestia (Ar. al-Ma·π£·π£ƒ´·π£a) was the first city to be re-occupied and garrisoned, already under the Umayyads, who settled 300 soldiers there in 703, a number raised under the first Abbasids to some 4,000. Adana followed in 758‚Äì760, and Tarsus in 787/8. Tarsus quickly became the largest settlement in the region and the Arabs' most important base of operations against the Byzantines, counting between 4,000 and 5,000 troops in its garrison. Other important fortresses in Cilicia, which however were little more than military outposts, were 'Ayn Zarba (Gr. Anazarbus), al-HƒÅr≈´niya, founded by Harun al- Rashid, Tall Gubair and al-Kanƒ´sat al-SawdƒÅ. These were complemented by smaller forts dotted across the Cilician plain, holding smaller garrisons of a dozen or so men.Kennedy (2001), pp. 82, 98 In the more mountainous terrain of the Mesopotamian frontier zone, the main strongholds were located in the fertile parts of relatively isolated valleys, controlling the entrances of passes over the mountains: Mar'ash (Gr. Germanikeia), rebuilt already under Muawiyah I () and again under Harun al-Rashid, al-·∏§adath (Gr. Adata), likewise refortified by the first Abbasid caliphs and provided with 4,000 troops, and Malatya, which had been colonized by the Umayyads, destroyed by the Byzantines and rebuilt again and likewise garrisoned with 4,000 men in 757/8. Further fortresses of lesser importance in the Mesopotamian sector were Salaghus, Kaisum, ·∏§i·π£n Ziba·π≠ra (Gr. Zapetra/Sozopetra), Sumaisa·π≠ (Gr. Samosata), ·∏§i·π£n Qalawdhiya and ·∏§i·π£n Ziyad. Some of the northern fortresses of the al- øAwƒÅ·π£im province, like Dul≈´k or Cyrrhus, were also sometimes included in it. Further north, the relatively isolated fortress towns of QƒÅlƒ´qalƒÅ (Gr. Theodosiopolis, modern Erzurum) and Kamacha formed the northernmost outposts of Muslim rule.Wheatley (2000), p. 261 The Thugh≈´r al-Bakrƒ´ya included, according to Qudama ibn Ja'far, Sumaisa·π≠, ·∏§ƒÅnƒ´, Malikyan, Gamah, ·∏§aurƒÅn and al-Kilis. The caliphs repopulated the area by bringing in colonists and regular soldiers from Syria but also Persians, Slavs, Arab Christians, and people from the eastern edges of the Muslim world: settlers from Khurasan, the Turkic SayƒÅbija tribe or Jatts (Ar. Zu·π≠·π≠) from India.Streck (1987), pp. 515‚Äì516Wheatley (2000), pp. 116‚Äì117, 261 The regular troops stationed there were favoured with lower taxes (the tithe or  øushr instead of the kharƒÅj land tax), higher pay and small land grants (qa·π≠ƒÅ'i). In early Abbasid times these troops numbered some 25,000, half of them drawn from Khurasan and the rest from Syria and Upper Mesopotamia. They were complemented by volunteers, drawn by the religious motivation of jihad against the Byzantines but often paid a salary by the state as well.Wheatley (2000), p. 262Toynbee (1973), p. 113 All this entailed a heavy financial burden on the Abbasid government. Under Harun al- Rashid, taxation from the Cilician sector brought in 100,000 gold dinars every year, which were all spent locally for public works, salaries, espionage etc. In addition, the costs of cross-border expeditions typically ranged between 200,000 and 300,000 dinars annually. The Mesopotamian sector's revenue amounted to some 70,000 dinars, to which the central government added 120,000‚Äì170,000 dinars each year for the upkeep of the fortifications and the salary of the frontier troops.Vasiliev (1935), pp. 96‚Äì97  Military operations  By the 9th century, the Arab raiding expeditions launched against Byzantium from the frontier zone had gradually assumed an almost ritual character and were strictly organized. According to Qudama ibn Ja'far, the conventional pattern of Arab incursions included a first expedition in spring (10 May‚Äì10 June), when horses could find abundant fodder, followed after about a month's rest by a summer raid (10 July‚Äì8 September), usually the main campaign of the year, and sometimes by a winter raid in February‚ÄìMarch.Toynbee (1973), p. 115Whittow (1996), pp. 212‚Äì213 The importance of these raids is summarized by Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy: \\"the ·π£ƒÅ øifa (summer raid) was as much a part of the symbolic and ritual functions of the Caliph as was organising and providing leadership for the annual hajj to Mecca\\".Kennedy (2001), p. 106 The frontier zone was fiercely contested between the Arabs and the Byzantines. Raids and counter-raids were a permanent fixture of this type of warfare. Forts on either side of the notional frontier were captured and razed, or sometimes occupied, but never for long. As a result, the region was often depopulated, necessitating repeated resettlement. There is nevertheless evidence of some prosperity, based on agriculture and commerce, especially during the second half of the 9th century, when the borderlands became a node in a commercial route linking Basra with northern Syria and even Constantinople.Wheatley (2000), pp. 116‚Äì117, 262‚Äì263 After 842 and for most of the later 9th century, the decline of Abbasid power meant that control over the Thugh≈´r gradually devolved to semi-independent border emirates, chiefly Tarsus, Malatya and QƒÅlƒ´qalƒÅ, which were left largely to fend on their own against a resurgent Byzantium. The Battle of Lalakaon in 863 broke the power of Malatya, altering the balance of power in the region, and signalled the beginning of a gradual Byzantine encroachment on the Arab borderlands.Streck (1987), p. 516Toynbee (1973), pp. 110‚Äì111, 113‚Äì114Whittow (1996), pp. 310‚Äì311 With the onset of the Abbasid Caliphate's terminal period of crisis after 928, control of the Muslim frontier cities shifted to the Ikhshidid and Hamdanid dynasties. In the 930s, under the leadership of John Kourkouas, the Byzantines broke through and conquered Malatya and most of the Mesopotamian sector of the Thugh≈´r. Although the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla (), managed to stem the Byzantine advance, his success was only temporary: in 964‚Äì965, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas () captured Cilicia, followed soon after by Antioch, while the Hamdanids of Aleppo became a tributary state.Kazhdan (1991), p. 1479Wheatley (2000), pp. 116, 261Whittow (1996), pp. 317‚Äì318, 326‚Äì329  Mamluk‚ÄìTurkmen frontier zone  After their conquest of Syria in the late 13th century, the Egyptian Mamluks re-established the al-thugh≈´r wa-l- øawƒÅ·π£im as a defensive zone to shield Syria from the Turkoman states of Asia Minor and the Caucasus, including at a later stage the Ottoman Empire. Like the earlier model, the thugh≈´r were divided into a Syrian and a Mesopotamian march, as well as a rear zone along northern Syria. The Mamluks entrusted the defence of the Syrian/Cilician march to the client Turkmen principality of the Ramadanids, while the Dulkadirid principality fulfilled the same role in the Mesopotamian thugh≈´r. To safeguard their control of the frontier zone, and to keep the two client beyliks separated and under control, the Mamluks also retained garrisons in seven strategically important sites: Tarsus, Ayas, Serfendikar, Sis, Darende, Malatya and Divriƒüi.Har-El (1995), pp. 43‚Äì47 Ahmad al- Qalqashandi gives the subdivisions (niyƒÅbƒÅt) of the Mamluk thugh≈´r as follows: eight for the Syrian sector (Malatya, Divriƒüi, Darende, Elbistan, Ayas, Tarsus and Adana, Serfendikar and Sis) and three on the Euphrates sector (al-Bira, Qal'at Ja'bar and al-Ruha).Har-El (1995), p. 44  See also  * Ghazi warriors * ribƒÅ·π≠ and ma·∏•ras, typical Muslim fortifications * Digenes Akritas * Karbeas  References  Sources      *  Further reading    Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars Category:Syria under the Abbasid Caliphate Category:History of Turkey Category:Subdivisions of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:Military history of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:States and territories established in the 8th century Category:Marches (country subdivision) ","title":"Al-Awasim"},{"id":"29130686","text":"Michael-Bruno, LLC is an American architectural design, engineering service and construction management firm.

The collection numbers around 10,000 works of art, housed since 1934 in the historic Vranyczany Palace in the centre of Zagreb, overlooking the Zrinjevac Park. A secondary gallery is the Josip Raƒçiƒá Studio at Margaretska 3. History The sculpture \\"Ranjenik\\" by Vanja Radau≈° in the courtyard of the Modern Gallery The Modern Gallery, originally the National Gallery for Croatian Art, dates from the early 1900s, when it was founded by the Art Society with paintings and sculptures acquired by their members, including a donation from Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer. In 1899, Izidor Kr≈°njavi, gave a presentation to the Art Society in Zagreb, with the idea of establishing the Gallery. His proposal was recorded in the Social Exhibitions Statute () of 1901. In the spring of 1905, to mark the Society‚Äôs 30th anniversary, three works of art were bought for the future holdings of the Modern Gallery. That year, 1905, is considered to be the official date the Gallery was founded, due to the holdings which were put together at the time. However, the collection grew gradually and it was not open for public viewing until 1914, in a single room of today‚Äôs Museum of Arts and Crafts building, where it was available only to those who showed a special interest in it. As the collection expanded, the Gallery moved to its current building, the Vranyczany Palace on Zrinjevac Park in 1934 and it has been there, with a pause during World War II, up until the present day. The Vranyczany Palace was designed by the Viennese architect Otto Hofer, and constructed in 1882 by Ferdo Kondrat for Baron Lujo Vranyczany. Since the end of 19th century the building has changed ownership frequently, and has been restored several times. Through the years, the Vranyczany building has entertained some well-known figures in Croatia's cultural, political and economic life. From its balcony in November 1884, Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer watched the celebrations organised in his honour on the occasion of the opening of the gallery named after him. The splendid receptions of the past have now been replaced by the contemplative atmosphere of Zagreb's gallery of modern art. The Palace underwent a complete renovation between 1993 and 2005, when the current exhibition was opened to the public. Two floors of the palace have become a modern-equipped gallery showing the permanent collection of Croatian modern painting and sculpture. In the completely refurbished historic rooms, the Modern Gallery presents \\"Two Hundred Years of Croatian Fine Arts (1800-2000)\\", a representative selection of 650-700 of the best works by painters, sculptors and medal makers. The Modern Gallery has become the best known, and most complete Croatian modern art museum. Retrospectives and monographic exhibitions of works by the most prominent Croatian artists have been taking place there since the end of the 1960s, as well as theme exhibitions of Croatian and European modern art. Collection The Modern Gallery in Zagreb holds the richest and most important collection of Croatian art of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today the holding numbers around 10,000 works of art including paintings, sculptures, drawings and graphics, medallions and medals, as well as photographs and new media. More than 700 Croatian works of art belonging to the 19th and 20th century are on display. The exhibition extends across two floors of the Palace and the main staircase, displaying the works of individual artists, and also showing their place in the Croatian modern art scene and within modern Croatian society in general. According to Biserka Rauter Planƒçiƒá, the current Director of the Modern Gallery, \\"The Gallery‚Äôs mission is to record, as much as possible, the events and changes in Croatian art which took place over the two centuries of building and breaking down the perception of the world, as well as the perception of workmanship.\\" In addition to its permanent collection, the Modern Gallery also holds special exhibits. In 2009, a multi- sensory Tactile Gallery MG, was opened to help vision-impaired visitors experience major Croatian modern paintings and sculptures through touch and sound. The Modern Gallery‚Äôs holdings continue to expand and once a year, a New Acquisitions exhibition is held. A new multi-media exhibition entitled ‚ÄúIkonografija grada u hrvatskom slikarstvu u prvoj polovici 20 st.‚Äú (Iconography of Towns in Croatian Paintings from the First Half of the 20th Century), was opened to the public in April 2010. It presents the viewer with a motif of a town in paintings, drawing, graphics, art photography; on posters and film, and in literature and music. The exhibit covers over 150 artefacts including works of the most significant Croatian artists of the 20th century, from the Munich circle to socialism and the beginnings of the abstract art.

The Suburban, September 22, 2010. The concept of Acoustic Nights was first created by Melina Soochan.Call & Response: Melina Soochan. Midnight Poutine, July 7, 2010. The first three such events were organized in association with Artists Alliance Productions and Global NTT. Subsequent events have been organized and produced solely by Soochan. These events have had fairly good coverage in the local English media, including radio interviews on K103 and CJAD, podcasts on Midnight Poutine, and articles in newspapers like The Suburban. Each acoustic night event usually features 5-6 acts, either solo artists or small groups, who perform mostly original material, in an acoustic setting, i.e. no drums, no tracks, no distorted guitar. Some percussion is allowed. A special event in the series was the Acoustic Nights Montreal Teen Songwriting Competition 2011, which aims to become an annual event, to discover and promote young talent. The winners are offered opportunities to perform with a professional band, among other interesting prizes (recording session, professional video, professional website and EPK, etc.).

The film's action covers the entire span of World War I, from the months before the outbreak of hostilities to the declaration of peace. Background Comradeship was the first feature production by the Stoll Pictures, founded in April 1918 by theatrical manager Oswald Stoll. Stoll was a well-known philanthropist who had been instrumental during World War I in setting up a charity to create homes for disabled soldiers, and campaigned to publicise the plight of blinded ex-servicemen. The film's storyline mirrored these interests, and was also one of the first to examine the social impact of the war on Britain in the respect that common cause and experience had caused a sea-change in British society, challenging and eroding traditional class-based assumptions. Filming on Comradeship began in the summer of 1918 while the war was still in progress, and it was still in production when the Armistice was signed in November. Elvey took the opportunity to incorporate authentic footage of victory celebrations in London and some of his characters in the setting of the city in the immediate aftermath of war, lending these sections of the film a historical documentary feel.Comradeship (1919) BFI Screen Online. Retrieved 9 October 2010 Plot Pacifist John Armstrong (Ames) runs a drapery store in the small town of Melcombe, helped by his apprentice Peggy (Peggy Carlisle) and German assistant Otto (Dallas Cairns), who are having an affair. Local landowner Lieutenant Baring (Newall) finds Otto a suspicious character, but is angrily assured by John that he is trustworthy. Armstrong is attracted to Baring's cousin Betty (Elsie), who plans to turn their home, Fanshawe Hall, into a wounded soldiers' hospital on the inevitable outbreak of war between Britain and Germany. Otto leaves John a note stating his allegiance to Germany, and fails to return to work after the 1914 August bank holiday. Peggy is distraught as she is carrying his child. She is disowned by her family, but Betty hears of the situation and offers shelter to Peggy at Fanshawe. War breaks out, and injured serviceman start to arrive at Fanshawe. John visits to offer a charitable donation, and starts to tell Betty how he feels about her, but is deflated when Betty explains that running the hospital takes up all of her time and she cannot think of romance. Despite his pacifist inclinations, John finally enlists in the army. At the training camp he becomes fast friends with the cheery working-class Ginger (Teddy Arundell) and the pair admit their trepidation to each other. As the regiment leaves for the front, Betty turns up to wish John goodbye and good luck, and they embrace. While John fights in the trenches, Peggy suffers a miscarriage. She decides to become a nurse and help Betty at Fanshawe. John comes home on leave and is upset to see Betty handing her locket to Baring as a keepsake. Ginger arrives in Melcombe to visit. As he is out walking, he sees Peggy being harassed by a man and steps in to rescue her. They begin to fall in love, but before Peggy can be honest with Ginger about her past, Ginger and John are recalled to action. On the battlefield Baring is attacked by Otto, who is killed by Ginger. Ginger is shocked when he finds a picture of Peggy in Otto's pocket. John is moving the badly-wounded Baring to safety when he finds Betty's locket. For a moment he considers leaving Baring to die, but comes to his senses and continues dragging Baring to shelter. A shell explodes nearby, and John is blinded. He is repatriated and sent to Fanshawe to be nursed. The Armistice is signed. Ginger visits Melcombe again, but refuses to have anything to do with Peggy. Baring reveals that Betty gave him her locket for him to pass on to John, but for one reason or another he forgot about it. John now realises that Betty does not love Baring, but refuses to advance his own suit as he does not want her to feel she has to commit herself to a blind man out of sympathy. Betty is hurt by John's apparent lack of interest. Peggy intercedes, telling John he must be honest with Betty about his love for her. He refuses, but manages to effect a happy reconciliation between Peggy and Ginger. As society begins to recover from the war, John feels adrift and unsure what to do with his future. He learns of a network of Comrades Clubs set up by ex-serviceman, and finds purpose by setting up a branch in Melcombe. Ginger and Peggy have married, and come down for the grand opening of the club. On the big day, Betty decides that if John will not make the running, she will ask him to marry her. He agrees, and later receives the good news that he can have an operation which will restore his sight. Cast * Lily Elsie as Betty Mortimer * Gerald Ames as John Armstrong * Guy Newall as Lt.

While BBC, ITV and Channel 4 only have one or two of their channels in DVB-T2, Europa 7 HD transmits all of its eleven channels with this technology; it has been announced as \\"the first broadcaster in the world to broadcast with this new technology.\\" The DVB-T2 technology is comparable to the one used by the UK service company Freeview HD, which also has only one multiplex. Freeview HD hosts five fixed HD channels, while E7HD has twelve channels with alternating schedules, of which eight HD and four SD. As for Freeview HD, bandwidth is dynamically allocated between channels, depending on the complexity of the images - with the aim of maintaining a consistent quality, rather than a specific bit rate; video for each channel can range between 3 Mb/s and 17 Mbit/s. Like for United Kingdom's channels BBC HD, BBC One HD, ITV HD and Channel 4 HD, a tuner box compatible with the DVB-T2 standard is necessary.

Located on Place Augusta-Holmes, rue Paul Kl√©e, near Gare d'Austerlitz in the 13th arrondissement, it was designed by French-Chinese sculptor Chen Zhen, who died in 2000, and was completed by his wife Xu Min in 2008. Description The fountain is designed to resemble a dragon winding its way around the square, emerging and submerging from the pavement. Constructed of stainless steel, glass and plastic, the dragon's transparent skin shows the water flowing within. The fountain is in three parts. An opaque bas-relief dragon appears to emerge from the water-supply plant wall and plunge underground. The transparent second and third parts show the dragon seeming to arch out of the pavement. Water under pressure flows within and is illuminated at night. History The fountain was commissioned by the City of Paris in 1999 and inaugurated on February 6, 2008. Although the artist died in 2000, he left sketches showing how the fountain should look. The project was relaunched by the City of Paris in 2001 and finished by Xu Min, the sculptor's spouse and collaborator. The fountain was financed by the City of Paris and the Ministry of Culture of France.

She studied medicine in London, Edinburgh and Paris, pursuing higher studies at the latter's universities, and is one of the Edinburgh Seven, the first seven matriculated undergraduate female students at a British university. She travelled to Japan, where she opened a school for midwives, and was an author of anthropological studies. Early life Matilda Chaplin was born at Honfleur, France,1871 Scotland Census the daughter of English parents John Clarke Chaplin, a solicitor from Watlington, Norfolk, and Matilda Adriana Ayrton from Chelsea, London.London, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754-19321861 England Census The family lived in Edgbaston, where several of her elder siblings were born, and returned to England shortly after her birth. She was baptised at St George's Church, Edgbaston in December 1846 before the family moved to Kensington.1851 England Census1861 England Census Education and career After beginning her studies in art she commenced the study of medicine in 1867, and continued to do so until her death. She spent two years at the Ladies' Medical College, and having passed the preliminary examination at Apothecaries' Hall in 1869, she presented herself for the later examination, but was refused admission on the ground of her gender. Recognised as one of the heroic 'seven against Edinburgh' women, also known as the Edinburgh Seven, (Mary Anderson, Emily Bovell, Helen Evans, Sophia Jex-Blake, Edith Pechey, Isabel Thorne as well as Chaplin) she eventually matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, but was barred from instruction in higher branches of medicine. Legal intervention allowed her to gain high honours in anatomy and surgery at the extramural examinations held in 1870 and 1871 at Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh, before a judgment in 1872 finally prohibited women students. In 1871, when she found the chief medical classes in England and Scotland closed to her, she resolved to complete her education at Paris, where every facility was afforded her. The University of Paris recognised her abilities by bestowing upon her the degrees of Bachelier √®s-Sciences and Bachelier √®s-Lettres. During her studies, Chaplin maintained connection with Edinburgh, attending some of the classes open to her there. In 1872, she married her cousin, the noted scientist William Edward Ayrton, an Edinburgh student, and a distinguished pupil of Sir William Thomson. Early in the following year, she obtained a certificate in midwifery from the London Obstetric Society, the only medical qualification then obtainable by women in England. Shortly afterwards she accompanied her husband to Japan, where he had been appointed to a professorship in the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo. Child Life in Japan While in Japan, she pursued anthropological researches, and opened a school for Japanese midwives, in which she lectured with the aid of an interpreter. In 1877, she developed tuberculosis forcing her return to Europe. In 1879, she took the MD at Paris, and presented as her thesis the results of her Japanese studies, which were printed under the title of Recherches sur les dimensions g√©n√©rales et sur le d√©veloppement du corps chez les Japonais (Paris, 1879). In 1880, she became a licentiate of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, where she was the only female candidate at the examinations. She headed the pass lists in medicine and midwifery. In 1880, she lived in London, chiefly studying diseases of the eye at the Royal Free Hospital. As a result of her tuberculosis, her health continued to decline and for the next two winters, she continued her studies abroad in a warmer climate. The first year winter, she spent at the hospital of Algiers and then second at the physiological laboratory at Montpellier. Author The Dictionary of National Biography records: \\"From the time of her journey to Japan Mrs. Ayrton contributed to The Scotsman and other periodicals a large number of articles on very various topics, including Japanese politics and customs, and the educational problems of the West.\\" She took a keen interest in the Japanese people and never wearied of studying them and their country. She became more and more interested in the home life of the Japanese and in the pictures and stories which delighted the children of the Mikado's Empire. After her return to England, she wrote a book entitled Child Life in Japan which was illustrated from her own sketches. Personal life and legacy Ayrton always took a lively interest in attempts to improve the educational opportunities and social position of women. She actively aided the establishment of a club for women students in Paris, and helped to organise the Somerville Club for women in London.\\" Chaplin and Ayrton's daughter was the feminist and author Edith Ayrton, wife of Israel Zangwill and mother of Oliver Zangwill. Ayrton died in London on 19 July 1883, aged 37. The Edinburgh Seven were awarded the posthumous honorary MBChB at the University of Edinburgh‚Äôs McEwan Hall on Saturday 6 July 2019.

Extending roughly along Water and Church Streets between the Naugatuck River and Prospect Street, the district includes factory and commercial buildings, as well as the former Torrington Fire Department Headquarters and the civic Knights of Pythias building. Developed between about 1885 and 1920, the district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The Naugatuck River, where it passes through what is now downtown Torrington, was long recognized as a potential source of industrial power, and was first dammed for a sawmill in 1751. Water Street is an early road, joining that sawmill in the west to Main Street in the east. The city's major industries in the 19th century came to be the rolling of brass and the manufacture of brass objects. Growth was spurred by the arrival of the railroad, and in 1857 Charles Hotchkiss established a lumber parts mill, which eventually became a major manufacturer of window sashes and blinds. Although Water Street was at first lined with a combination of houses and commercial buildings, it was transformed into a primarily commercial and industrial area between about 1880 and 1920. The present streetscape is largely the product of that period, altered in part by the loss of some of the industrial buildings to fire and flood. The historic district is abutted on its eastern end by the Downtown Torrington Historic District. Its southern boundary is the Naugatuck River, extend from the railroad bridge west and northerly to Church Street. It includes a few buildings on Church Street, as well as Railroad Square, which is bounded on the north by Mason Street. There are 34 historically significant buildings in this area, which is about in size. The oldest buildings include the American Brass Company office, a fine Second Empire building on Water Street which was built in 1881. The railroad depot, built in 1898, is a good example of Renaissance Revival architecture.

Life It is not known when Chen Yan was born, but it is known that he was from Jian Prefecture ( now Nanping).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. In or around 878, when the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao was pillaging the Fujian region on his way south toward Guang Prefecture (Âª£Â∑û in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. Chen gathered several thousand men around him to protect their home territory, and named the army Jiulong Army (). Then-governor of Fujian, Zheng Yi () thus made Chen his deputy in his position as the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø Tuanlianshi) of Fujian's capital Fu (now Fuzhou). While Chen was serving as deputy military prefect, there was an occasion when Li Lian () the prefect of Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) was found guilty of a crime. Fearful of punishment, Li hid in mountainous caves and gathered troops to attack Fu Prefecture. Chen led his army and repelled Li's attack. Zheng became apprehensive of Chen's hold on the army, and he made a recommendation to then-reigning Emperor Xizong that Chen be made the governor instead. In 884, Emperor Xizong approved of the request, and Chen became governor. It was said that Chen ruled with authority and grace, and that the people of the region were pacified. His rule extended over the entire Fujian region, with such places as Ting Prefecture (Ê±ÄÂ∑û modern Longyan, Fujian) and Jian Prefecture falling under his command of the circuit government in Chen's later life. At some point, his family and that of Dong Chang, the military governor (Jiedushi) of neighboring Weisheng Circuit (Â®ÅÂãù headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), entered into a marriage relationship.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. In 886, Wang Chao, the leader of a roving army that had originated from Guang Prefecture (ÂÖâÂ∑û in modern Xinyang, Henan), captured Quan Prefecture and killed its then-prefect Liao Yanrou (). However, hearing of Chen's might, Wang did not dare to attack Fu Prefecture, and sent messengers to submit to Chen. Chen made Wang the prefect of Quan Prefecture. In 891, Chen Yan fell ill. He sent messengers to summon Wang Chao, intending to entrust the circuit to him. However, before Wang could arrive, Chen died. Chen's brother-in-law Fan Hui () persuaded the soldiers to support him,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. and Fan and Wang subsequent engaged in several years of warfare. In 893, Fu Prefecture fell to the siege by Wang's cousin Wang Yanfu () and brother Wang Shenzhi, and Fan was killed in flight. Wang took over the circuit governorship. He buried Chen with respect, and gave a daughter in marriage to Chen's son Chen Yanhui ().

It was declared redundant on 1 June 1982, and was vested in the Trust on 30 October 1984. The church, which was built in a chequerboard pattern of flint and stone, sits on a hill overlooking the River Wylye. It was built on the site of a Norman church in the 14th century and was substantially rebuilt in the 19th century. In the 1830s and 1860s John Davis organised the work including the demolition and rebuilding of the chancel under the supervision of W. Hardwick, a Warminster surveyor. It has a two-stage tower which is supported by diagonal buttresses. Inside the church is a Minton tiled reredos which may date from the 1861 rebuilding. The screen was designed by Frederick Charles Eden and installed in 1912 while carrying out other work on the church. Because of local objections the screen was never painted. The 12th century cylindrical font dates from the 12th century.

It is the second single from their debut album as a duo First Album (2001). The song was originally included on the duo's 1998 EP Champagne and became an anthem of the electroclash scene. Miss Kittin included the song on her DJ mix album On the Road. Writing and inspiration Miss Kittin explained in an interview that the song was inspired by her love of Frank Sinatra and jazz music. > \\"I love Frank Sinatra and the American crooners and romantic jazz in > general. I was looking for a rhyme to \\"area\\" and here it came. What you > don't know, is when I said \\"He's dead\\", I really thought he was... A friend > told me it was funny because he's still alive... I couldn't believe it and > felt guilty, especially when he died three months later...\\" Composition \\"Frank Sinatra\\" is credited as an electroclash and techno song, and is noted for its use of deadpan. In the song, Miss Kittin discusses having sex in limousines. According to Terry Sawyer of PopMatters, \\"In a deadpan cadence done in the accent of Ilsa the She-Wolf of The SS, Miss Kittin [...], created decadent club music for people too arch and smart for typical white label fare. It was a deader and more desolate take on tired convention of the house beat and unknown diva repeating a pithy chorus ad nauseum [sic], an alleged elevation of clich√© through the detachment of kitsch. Critical reception Adam Bregman of Allmusic described the song as \\"undoubtedly the standout cut on the album.\\" Ed Gonzalez, writing for Slant Magazine, said, \\"Backed by The Hacker's happy-to-be-cheap retro production, Miss Kittin provides the ultimate electroclash statement: she makes social climbing sound so stupid and empty, while reveling in it.\\" Slant Magazine placed \\"Frank Sinatra\\" at number eighty-six on its 100 Greatest Dance Songs list. Rock De Lux placed the song at number thirteen on the Songs of the Year list for 2001. The Village Voice included the song on its Pazz & Jop Singles list for 2002. Cultural impact \\"Frank Sinatra\\" was included on compilation albums Global Underground 010: Athens by Danny Tenaglia, American Gigolo by Tiga, Dirty Dirty House Vol. 1 by Junior Sanchez, Lektroluv by Dr Lektroluv, and GU10.

He was previously a United States Magistrate Judge of the same court. Early life and education Pitman was born in Fort Worth, Texas in 1962, the youngest of five children. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Abilene Christian University, where he was student body president. Pitman then obtained a Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law. After completing law school, Pitman served as a law clerk for Judge David Belew Jr. of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in Fort Worth. Pitman holds a Master of Studies degree in International Human Rights Law from the University of Oxford. Career Following his judicial clerkship, Pitman began his career at the international law firm of Fulbright and Jaworski. In 2001, Pitman briefly served as interim United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas. As United States Attorney on September 11, 2001, he formed the first anti-terrorism task force in the district, uniting local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies in their counter-terrorism efforts and in their work to better secure Texas' international border. He was replaced by George W. Bush appointee Johnny Sutton, who asked Pitman to remain in the office as his chief deputy. In October 2003, Pitman was selected to serve as a United States Magistrate Judge for the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. As Magistrate Judge, Pitman consistently ranked highest among all local, state, and federal judges in the judicial poll conducted annually by the Austin Bar Association. In 2009, Republican Senators John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison sent Pitman's name to Democratic President Barack Obama as one of two candidates for United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas. The recommendation of Pitman, who is openly gay, was publicly opposed by a social conservative group in Texas. On June 27, 2011, almost two years after Pitman was recommended for the post, Obama notified members of Congress that he would nominate Pitman to be United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas. He was formally nominated the following day. Citing his credentials and experience, and expressing a desire to fill the position with the most qualified candidate, he was supported by Texas' two United States Senators, both Republicans. With their support, the United States Senate confirmed Pitman to be the chief federal law enforcement officer in the Western District of Texas on September 26, 2011. He took office on October 3, 2011. He left office on December 19, 2014 upon receiving his judicial commission.  Federal judicial service  On June 26, 2014, President Obama nominated Pitman to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, to the seat vacated by Judge William Royal Furgeson, Jr., who took senior status on November 30, 2008. He received a hearing before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary for September 9, 2014. On November 20, 2014 his nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote. On Saturday, December 13, 2014, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed a motion to invoke cloture on the nomination. On December 16, 2014, Reid withdrew his cloture motion on Pitman's nomination, and the Senate proceeded to vote to confirm Pitman in a voice vote. He received his federal judicial commission on December 19, 2014. Personal life Pitman is a sixth-generation Texan and lives in Austin. He is an avid outdoorsman and horseman. Pitman was the first openly gay United States Attorney in Texas. He was one of four openly LGBT U.S. Attorneys, alongside Jenny Durkan of the Western District of Washington, Laura Duffy of the Southern District of California and Anne Tompkins of the Western District of North Carolina. Upon receiving his judicial commission, Pitman became the first openly gay judge to sit on the federal bench within the Fifth Circuit of the federal court system, which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

Early life  Mu√±oz was born in 1730, probably in Matamoros, a city of Castile, Spain. He joined the Royal Spanish Army in his youth where he ascended the ranks, serving as Captain in the Spanish Army. In 1759, Manuel temporarily settled in Texas as the first commander of the newly formed \\"Presidio del Norte\\". The following year, when the Presidio was attacked by Apache Native Americans, Mu√±oz aided in the repelling of the attack. Later, in 1775, he participated in the war between the troops of Colonel Hugo Ocon√≥r and the American Indians, commanding the troops of Nueva Vizcaya. Due to his leadership during the war, Mu√±oz was appointed Lieutenant Colonel in 1777 and Colonel in 1780. In the 1770s and 1780s, Mu√±oz won several stalls along the Rio Grande and did businesses with the Mescalero Apaches and carried out several campaigns against the Native Americans of the frontier who resigned the Christian religion.Handbook of Texas Online ‚Äì Mu√±oz, Manuel. Posted by Marion A. Habig, O.F.M., on November 26, 2008. Accessed on October 9, 2010  Texas Governor  In 1790, Mu√±oz became governor of Texas. In 1792, at the same time that the Count of Sierra investigated his management, Mu√±oz served as Acting governor. The following year, Munoz fulfilled the Decree of Secularization of the Mission San Antonio de Valero and in 1792 he did the same with the decree of \\"partial secularization\\" directed to the other four Spanish missions that were carried out in San Antonio.Bremer, Thomas S. (2004). Blessed with Tourists: The Borderlands of Religion and Tourism in San Antonio. University of North Carolina Press. Mu√±oz supervised trade among the settlers and the Native Americans and investigated illicit trade among the Spanish and French of Louisiana that existed before his term. In addition, he regulated the work of the Amerindians in their work on the churches and priestly quarters and declared that these works could only be carried out with permission from the commander general. He also \\"checked the mission and presidio accounts\\".Phares, Ross (1976). The Governors of Texas. Pages 41 - 42. Firebird Press. Native Americans gained greater autonomy: Munoz converted Native Americans who had acquired the Christian religion into independent owners of lands, upending social structure based on race that had been established by the Spanish. In addition, the sacred ministry was the only one institution in which the missionaries could work \\"and placed the common property of the mission Indians\\". This property \\"was supervised by the alcalde\\", a Spanish politician figure who administrated the Spanish municipalities. In 1793, he founded the mission Refugio. In 1795, Mu√±oz rose to Colonel in the Army. The Crown ordered him to avoid the entrance of people from the then United States (East of the modern United States) to Texas. They believed the government of United States wanted to send people to Texas to promote a rebellion against the government.Campbell, Randolph B. (2003). Gone to Texas: A History of the Lone Star State. Oxford University Press, New York. However, in 1796, Mu√±oz fell ill and asked King Philip IV for permission to resign as governor. While Mu√±oz awaited the king's decision, Juan Bautista Elgu√©zabal was selected to help Mu√±oz. In January 1797, Mu√±oz received news that the governor of Coahuila, (Mexico), Manuel Antonio Cordero y Bustamante, had been chosen by the king as his successor. However, at that moment, Bustamante was commanding a war against the Apaches and he could not attend to his duties as governor, so Munoz continued governing Texas \\"until further notice\\". In March of that year, Cordero sent a letter saying that he had been appointed lieutenant governor of Nuevo Santander, and that therefore he could not govern Texas. Finally, a year and a half later, in June 1798 Jos√© Irigoyen was appointed interim governor, but also did not serve. Elgu√©zabal finally took the position. Mu√±oz died on July 27, 1798, in San Antonio.

Life Kowalski was born in Poland. His parents, members of the Polish Communist Party (the precursor of Polish United Workers' Party), decided to emigrate to the Soviet Union in 1932. In Moscow, they continued in their careers as an engineer and nurse. His father was arrested in the night during the Great Purge in 1938 as an \\"enemy of the people,\\" never to be seen again by his family. Kowalski and his mother lost their home and lived briefly in the polyclinic where his mother worked, then moved to the Dedenievo settlement, some 30 miles north of Moscow, where his mother worked in a nursing home. Kowalski joined the Red Pioneers in elementary school. He learned that his father had died in a Siberian camp some two years later, aged 36. In June 1941, when Nazi Germany attacked the USSR, the Red Army retreated from Dedenievo, but the German army halted in nearby Jachroma (Yakhroma). However, the Germans bombed the settlement, killing many residents. Kowalski survived this period in the basement of an old church where peasants had stored vegetables from collective farms. In 1943, Kowalski's mother became a nurse in a Polish orphanage near Moscow, while Kowalski relearned Polish in the attached elementary school. In 1946, the orphanage moved to Warsaw and merged into the existing Nasz Dom orphanage. His mother worked there as a nurse, and Kowalski attended a progressive gymnasium (high school). His mother re-joined the Polish Communist Party, and he joined the Union of Polish Youth. Kowalski then attended the Warsaw Polytechnic Institute (now the Warsaw University of Technology) and then also joined the Party. As an engineer, Kowalski specialized in electro-medicine. He learned how to design electrical instruments for doctors. He obtained a graduate degree based on research at Warsaw's Radium Institute (now the Curie Institute, Warsaw). In 1956, his application to work in a nuclear laboratory in the Soviet Union was rejected, and he traveled to Paris, where his father's sister lived. He hoped to be able to pursue doctoral studies in France. A written recommendation from Cezary Pawlowski, director of the Radium Institute and a former assistant of Marie Curie, helped him join the laboratory of Joliot-Curie, where he worked for the next seven years. In 1963, having obtained his doctorate in Physics from the Sorbonne, he returned to Poland to work in an academic research laboratory. In 1964, Kowalski attended a scientific conference in the US‚Äîand stayed on, becoming a research associate with Professor Jack Miller in Columbia University's Chemistry department. In 1969, he began a 35-year career as a professor and researcher of Physics at Montclair State University. Since retiring in 2004, he has continued to work in two areas of personal interest‚Äîconducting Physics experiments and writing about experience under the Communism of the Soviet Union from an anti-communism viewpoint. Works Kowalski has authored and co-authored nearly 100 scholarly papers on Physics, a textbook on Physics, and two books on Stalinism. In January 2011, Hoover Institution archived his original notebook diaries (in Polish), letters, and personal documents and photographs. His papers can be found online.

He began his career as the leader of a local militia at Hang Prefecture (Êù≠Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang) and gradually increased in power to control most of modern Zhejiang. Not satisfied with the titles that the Tang emperors bestowed on him, he claimed an imperial title in 895 as the emperor of a new state known as Luoping of the Great Yue (Â§ßË∂äÁæÖÂπ≥). His vassal Qian Liu turned against him and killed him, seizing his territory, and eventually becoming the founder of the new state of Wuyue.  Background  It is not known when Dong Chang was born, but it was known that he was from Lin'an (Ëá®ÂÆâ, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang), which was part of Hang Prefecture (Êù≠Â∑û).New Book of Tang, vol. 225, part 2. During the rebellion of the army officer Wang Ying in 876‚Äì877,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. Dong joined a local militia to defend against Wang's raids. After Wang's rebellion was defeated, Dong, for his contributions during the campaign, was made the defender of Shijing Base (Áü≥Èè°, in modern Hangzhou). In 878, when the agrarian rebel Cao Shixiong (ÊõπÂ∏´ÈõÑ) was pillaging both Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), which Hang Prefecture belonged to, and Zhedong Circuit (ÊµôÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), the Hang Prefecture government tried to resist the pillages by recruiting 1,000 men from each of the counties in the prefecture. Dong and seven others became the militia commanders, and their troops became known as the \\"Eight Corps of Hang Prefecture\\". Among the men serving under Dong at the time was Qian Liu, who became a key officer under him.  Seizure of Hang Prefecture  In 881, after the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao captured the imperial capital Chang'an, forcing then-reigning Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu, Gao Pian the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) gathered troops in the nearby regions and claimed that he was going to launch troops to recapture Chang'an. As part of that, he summoned Dong to Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture (ÊèöÂ∑û) as well. However, Qian discerned that Gao had no real intentions to attack Huang, and he advised Dong to claim that he needed to return to Hang Prefecture to defend it. Dong did so, and Gao agreed to let him leave. Meanwhile, the imperial government had just recently commissioned a new prefect of Hang Prefecture, Lu Shenzhong (Ë∑ØÂØ©‰∏≠). Before Lu could get to Hang Prefecture, however, Dong took his troops from Shijing into Hang Prefecture to intimidate Lu. Lu, fearful of Dong, did not take office. Dong then claimed the title of acting prefect, and had his officers submit petitions to the military governor of Zhenhai, Zhou Bao, to have Dong be officially commissioned. Zhou, believing that he could not control Dong otherwise, made Dong the prefect of Hang Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. In 882, Liu Hanhong the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Zhedong, who wanted to take over Zhenhai, sent his brother Liu Hanyou (ÂäâÊº¢ÂÆ•) and officer Xin Yue (ËæõÁ¥Ñ) to attack Hang Prefecture. Dong sent Qian to resist the Zhedong army, and Qian defeated them, forcing them to flee. Liu made another attack in 883, and Dong's army, under Qian, again defeated the Zhedong army, killing Xin and Liu Hanhong's brother Liu Hanrong (ÂäâÊº¢ÂÆπ).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255.  Seizure of Yisheng Circuit  In 886, Dong Chang and Qian Liu were discussing what to do with Zhedong ‚Äî which by this point had been renamed Yisheng Circuit (Áæ©Âãù) ‚Äî when Dong made the offer to Qian, \\"If you can capture Yue Prefecture [(Ë∂äÂ∑û, Yisheng's capital)], I will yield Hang Prefecture to you.\\" Qian agreed, responding, \\"You are right. If Yue were not captured, it will eventually be harmful to us.\\" Qian thus launched the Hang Prefecture army and attacked Liu Hanhong, repeatedly defeating his army. By winter 886, Qian had captured Yue Prefecture, and Liu Hanhong was captured by his own subordinate Du Xiong (ÊùúÈõÑ) the prefect of Tai Prefecture (Âè∞Â∑û, in modern Taizhou, Zhejiang). Dong executed Liu, and moved his headquarters to Yue, claiming the title of acting governor, while making Qian the prefect of Hang Prefecture. In 887, Emperor Xizong commissioned Dong as the governor of Zhedong and Qian as the prefect of Hang Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Later, Dong was made the military governor of Yisheng, which was then renamed to Weisheng (Â®ÅÂãù). It was said that at the beginning of Dong's rule, he was frugal and fair, and the people were comforted. He ended the heavy salt taxes. Further, Dong was considered faithful to the imperial government because, while the warlords in the other circuits were all largely withholding proper revenue payments to the imperial government by that point, he was delivering tributes at a frequent interval ‚Äî once every 10 days, and the imperial government greatly depended on his tributes in continuing to function. Therefore, Dong eventually was given the titles of acting Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â, one of the Three Excellencies), honorary chancellor (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi), and the Prince of Longxi. However, Dong eventually grew cruel and harsh in his rule, caning and whipping people at will, or even slaughtering families for relatively minor offenses. At one point, he threatened to kill some 5,000 households unless they would yield all of their assets to him, and they agreed to do so. It was said that when judging civil lawsuits, he would simply have the litigants gamble; the winning side would win the case, while the losing side would be killed. He also built a temple dedicated to himself modeled after the temple of Yu the Great (the mythical founder of the Xia Dynasty) ‚Äî prohibiting people from worshipping at Yu's temple, only at his own.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. In 893, after the death of Chen Yan the governor of neighboring Fujian Circuit (Á¶èÂª∫, headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian), whose family had a marital relationship with Dong's family, Chen's brother-in-law Fan Hui (ËåÉÊöâ) and Chen's subordinate Wang Chao the prefect of Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) vied for control of Fujian, and Wang put Fujian's capital Fu Prefecture (Á¶èÂ∑û) under siege. Fan sought aid from Dong, and Dong sent troops. However, before the Weisheng troops could arrive, Wang captured Fu Prefecture, and Fan was killed in flight; Dong then withdrew his troops. As of 894, Dong petitioned then- reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor), seeking to be created the greater title of Prince of Yue. The imperial government did not agree immediately, and Dong became displeased. His followers, wanting to please him, encouraged him to take the next step and become the Emperor of Yue. In spring 895, he declared himself the emperor of a new state of Luoping of the Great Yue, after killing every staff member who dared to speak against it.  Defeat and death  Dong Chang sent messengers to Qian Liu to inform Qian that he had become emperor and that he was making Qian the commander of the forces of the \\"Two Zhes\\" ‚Äî i.e., Zhenhai and Weisheng, which were on the opposite banks of the Qiantang River (Zhe River). Qian, disagreeing with Dong's decision to claim imperial title, wrote back: \\"Rather than closing up your gates to try to be the Son of Heaven, so that your entire clan and the people will all fall into fire, why not open your door to be Jiedushi, so that you will have honor and wealth the rest of your life? It is still not too late to repent.\\" Dong refused Qian's suggestion, so Qian advanced to Yue Prefecture with 30,000 men, bowing down to him outside the Yue city gates, and stating to him that he brought soldiers to force Dong to repent. Dong, in fear, rewarded Qian money and delivered several sorcerers who advocated his taking the throne to Qian, claiming that he would soon submit a confession to Emperor Zhaozong. Only then did Qian withdraw and report the matter to Emperor Zhaozong. Emperor Zhaozong, however, believed that Dong had made great contributions over the years and that he must have just been afflicted with a mental illness. He thus pardoned Dong but ordered him to retire. However, the ambitious Qian, who was hopeful that the imperial government would declare a campaign against Dong so that he could turn on Dong without appearing to be ungrateful,Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 63 [895]. then submitted an accusation against Dong, pointing out that Dong had committed the unpardonable crime of treason. Emperor Zhaozong thus issued an edict ordering Qian to attack Dong. Meanwhile, Yang Xingmi, who had taken over Huainan Circuit by this point and who did not want to see Qian take over Weisheng, sent messengers to Qian to point out that Dong had already repented and should be pardoned, but Qian did not relent. Yang thus tried to relieve Qian's pressure on Dong by sending his officer Tai Meng (Ëá∫Êøõ) to attack Su Prefecture (ËòáÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), which was then Qian's territory. Qian did not let up his attack, however, and Yang further sent Tian Jun the military governor of Ningguo Circuit (ÂØßÂúã, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui) and An Renyi (ÂÆâ‰ªÅÁæ©) the military prefect of Run Prefecture (ÊΩ§Â∑û, in modern Zhenjiang) to attack Qian as well. The Huainan attack was bogged down for some time, however, allowing Qian to continue his attack of Weisheng, even after, in spring 896, because of Yang's request, Emperor Zhaozong pardoned Dong completely and restored his titles. Qian's forces repeatedly defeated Dong's, and Dong exacerbated the matter by killing anyone who dared to give him accurate information about Qian's military strength. By summer 896, Qian's officer Gu Quanwu (È°ßÂÖ®Ê≠¶) had reached Yue and put it under siege. Only then did Dong become fearful. He abandoned the title of emperor and referred to himself as military governor again, but the siege continued. Qian considered abandoning the siege after Huainan forces captured Su Prefecture about the same time, but Gu pointed out that capturing Yue should be the first priority, and Qian agreed. Soon thereafter, the outer city of Yue fell, and Dong withdrew into the inner city to continue to defend it. Qian then sent Dong's old subordinate Luo Tuan (Èß±Âúò) to Dong, stating that there were imperial orders for Dong to retire to Lin'an. Dong thus agreed to surrender. Gu delivered Dong toward Hang Prefecture, but executed him and his family on the way, as well as some 300 subordinates who had supported his imperial claim. Qian delivered Dong's head to Chang'an and took over his territory.

Structure  FOXA2 belongs to a subfamily of the Forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors, the other members being FOXA1 and FOXA3. This subfamily of mammalian FOX proteins was first identified because of their ability to bind DNA in rat liver nuclear extracts. The proteins were therefore originally named hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 alpha, beta and gamma. These transcription factors contain a forkhead domain (also known as the winged-helix domain) flanked by sequences necessary for nuclear localization Their N- and C-termini are also conserved and serve as transactivation domains.  Functions  FOXA transcription factors have ‚Äúpioneering‚Äù property, i.e. they can directly bind to condensed chromatin. This feature has been observed both in vitro and in vivo, where FOXA transcription factors can bind nucleosome- bound target DNA sequences. The pioneering property is conferred by the factors‚Äô highly conserved DNA-binding domain, which is structurally similar to the linker histones H1 and H5 This feature enables FOXA2 to access closed chromatin and displace linker histones. In this way, FOXA2 promotes local chromatin opening, permits the recruitment of alternative histones and facilitates the subsequent binding of other transcription factors. Thus, FOXA2 have important roles in cell type specification by promoting chromatin accessibility for the binding of lineage- or tissue-specific factors The FOXA factors also facilitate the maintenance of cell identity by bookmarking cell type-specific genes so that these genes can be rapidly reactivated after cytokinesis. One example is that ectopic expression of FOXA2 together with HNF4A drives transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells. Consistent with its role as a pioneering transcription factor, FOXA2 is expressed in early development and essential for the development and homeostasis of various cell types and tissues. In mice, Foxa2 expression emerges in the primitive streak and node at embryonic day (E) 6.5, and in the mesoderm and definitive endoderm at E7.5. Its expression is subsequently maintained in endoderm-derived tissues, including the pancreas, liver, prostate, thyroid and lung, throughout development and in mature tissues. In addition, Foxa2 is expressed in ectoderm-derived neural tissues. Foxa2 knockout is embryonically lethal to mice, which die between E10 and E11 and show defects in all three germ layers. Mice with heterozygosity for Foxa2 knockout are viable and exhibit a phenotype similar to Parkinson‚Äôs disease upon aging. Conditional knockout studies show that Foxa2 is important for the formation of pancreatic islets and maturation of alpha and beta cells, thereby being essential for glucose homeostasis. Dysregulation of FOXA transcription factors have been linked to several types of human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia and cancer of the esophagus, lung, thyroid, pancreas, breast and prostate. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the FOXA2 gene are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in males. This association has been replicated in mice and may depend on androgen receptor-mediated regulation  References  External links  * Category:Forkhead transcription factors ","title":"FOXA2"},{"id":"29131245","text":"Oxytropis lambertii is a species of flowering plant in the legume family known by several common names, including purple locoweed, woolly locoweed, and Lambert crazyweed.

Testa distributed Zyklon B, a pesticide consisting of inert adsorbents saturated with hydrogen cyanide, a volatile liquid extremely toxic to animals and humans. For legitimate use as a pesticide, Zyklon B included a warning odorant as not everyone can smell cyanide or recognize its faint almond-like odor. The company sold Zyklon B to the Wehrmacht and the SS in Auschwitz-Birkenau without the odorant, clearly showing that it was intended for use on humans. Two directors of Testa were convicted and executed after being accused of assisting the mass murder of Jews during the Second World War.  Company history A can of Zyklon B with adsorbent granules and original signed documents detailing ordering of Zyklon B as \\"materials for Jewish resettlement\\" (on display at Auschwitz concentration camp museum) Tesch & Stabenow was founded in 1924 in Hamburg. In 1925 the firm became the only distributor of Zyklon B on behalf of Degesch east of the Elbe. In 1927 Stabenow left the firm; Dr. Bruno Tesch became 45% owner, Degesch had 55% of the shares; in June 1942 Tesch became the sole owner. Testa distributed a growing amount of the gas to the German army. In 1941 Tesch instructed the SS in Sachsenhausen in the use of the pest control gas. Starting in 1941 Testa sold Zyklon B to Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, Sachsenhausen, Ravensbr√ºck, Stutthof, Neuengamme, Gro√ü-Rosen and Dachau. The highest turnover of cyanide was in 1943. The company continued in Hamburg after the war as Testa Gmbh until 1979, when it merged with Heerdt-Lingler GmbH (HeLi).  Prosecution  On 3 September 1945 the British arrested Bruno Tesch, director Karl Weinbacher and employee Joachim Drosihn. They were brought before a military tribunal and charged with distributing the gas to concentration camps with the intent to kill humans. An employee even stated that Bruno Tesch himself suggested the idea to the SS. Tesch and Weinbacher were convicted in the Curiohaus trial, and executed on 16 May 1946. Drosihn was acquitted.

ABC- CLIO Companion to the Disability Rights Movement. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO. p. 97. . Adam Benjamin, author of Making an Entrance: Theory and Practice for Disabled and Non-Disabled Dancers (2002), has written about the perhaps unnecessary labelling of a dance performance as \\"integrated\\" or \\"inclusive\\" dance when advertising it to the public, calling it, \\"a bit like a roadsign warning the unwary theatre-goer of possible encounters with wheelchairs‚Äîit tells us that we can expect to see a disabled person on stage, which can only leave us asking, 'Is that really necessary? Who is it that needs to be warned?'\\" Part of the reason for this practice may be the breaking of a taboo for some audience members to see bodies in many conditions performing on stage, an event that may create astonishment, among other reactions. Audiences in Western cultures are accustomed to seeing only dancers in peak physical condition when they attend performances at top theatres. Integrated or inclusive dance also must rise to the artistic challenges that face any dance performance. Modern integrated or inclusive dance was first explored during the late 1960s. Dance instructor Hilde Holger taught dance to her son, who had Down Syndrome, and went on to stage a performance that included intellectually disabled dancers at Sadler's Wells in 1968. Among Holger's students was Wolfgang Stange, who was inspired to found a company to perform integrated dance works, the Amici Dance Theatre Company. Integrated dance gained a higher profile with the mainstream public during the 1980s. In 1986, DV8 Physical Theatre was founded in London, England, and in 1987, the AXIS Dance Company was founded in California. A number of other dance companies around the world now perform with physically or mentally disabled dancers. There are also companies that are founded or led by people who identify as disabled, and disabled choreographers, many of whom challenge conceptions of 'dance', 'stage,' and 'artistry' in their work. Examples include Kim Manri (Taihen), Gerda Koenig (DIN A 13), Petra Kuppers (The Olimpias), Raimund Hoghe, Claire Cunningham, Neil Marcus, Bill Shannon and Marc Brew. Some physically integrated dance companies are: AXIS Dance Company AXIS Dance Company AXIS Dance Company is a professional contemporary dance company and dance education organization based in Oakland, California. It was founded in 1987 and was one of the first contemporary dance companies in the world to consciously develop choreography that integrates dancers with and without physical disabilities. Their work has received seven Isadora Duncan Dance Awards and nine additional nominations for both their artistry and production values. Candoco Dance Company  Candoco Dance Company is a British contemporary dance company of disabled and non-disabled dancers, founded in 1991 by Celeste Dandeker and Adam Benjamin. Dandeker, who had previously trained with the London Contemporary Dance Theatre, suffered a fall whilst dancing on stage. The resulting spinal injury prevented her from dancing until choreographer Darshan Singh Buller persuaded her to dance again, albeit from her wheelchair, for the subsequently award-winning dance film The Fall. From this, Dandeker took inspiration to create Candoco Dance Company, which, since its inception, has been creating an inclusive dance practice. Dancing Wheels The Dancing Wheels Company is a professional dance company based in Cleveland, Ohio. Founded in 1980, it was the first in America to stage performances involving dancers with and without disabilities. The company uses its performances to enhance public awareness of disability issues and promote social change. DV8 Physical Theatre DV8 Physical Theatre was formed in 1986 by an independent collective of British dancers who, they claim, had become frustrated and disillusioned with the preoccupation and direction of most dance. The company has produced 16 dance pieces, which have toured internationally, and 4 award-winning films for television. They are performing works that break down the barriers between dance, theatre, and personal politics and, above all, communicate ideas and feelings clearly and unpretentiously. Dancers and production staff include people with disabilities, for example in the company's film The Cost of Living.  Full Radius Dance  Full Radius Dance is an American company based in Atlanta, Georgia composed of professional dancers with and without physical disabilities.  The GIMP Project  The GIMP Project is a New-York based modern dance project by the Heidi Latsky Dance company.  Indepen-dance  Indepen-dance is a Scottish inclusive dance organisation founded in 1996 by Karen Anderson. Based in Glasgow the organisation is primarily based around the delivery of weekly classes and a service provider for learning disabled dancers and their carers. The organisation also runs three performing companies ‚Äì Adult Performance Company, Young1'z and Indepen-dance 4.

He aims to carve a third path between secularists who say morality is subjective (e.g. moral relativists), and religionists who say that morality is given by God and scripture. Harris contends that the only moral framework worth talking about is one where \\"morally good\\" things pertain to increases in the \\"well-being of conscious creatures\\". He then argues that, problems with philosophy of science and reason in general notwithstanding, 'moral questions' will have objectively right and wrong answers which are grounded in empirical facts about what causes people to flourish. Challenging the traditional philosophical notion that humans can never get an 'ought' from an 'is' (the so-called Hume's law), Harris argues that moral questions are best pursued using not just philosophy, but the methods of science. Thus, \\"science can determine human values\\" translates to \\"science can tell us which values lead to human flourishing\\". It is in this sense that Harris advocates that scientists begin conversations about a normative science of \\"morality\\". Publication of the book followed Harris's 2009 receipt of a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles with a similarly titled thesis: The moral landscape: How science could determine human values. Synopsis Sam Harris's case starts with two premises: \\"(1) some people have better lives than others, and (2) these differences are related, in some lawful and not entirely arbitrary way, to states of the human brain and to states of the world\\".The Moral Landscape, pg. 15 The idea is that a person is simply describing material facts (many about their brain) when they describe possible \\"better\\" and \\"worse\\" lives for themselves. Granting this, Harris says we must conclude that there are facts about which courses of action will allow one to pursue a better life. Harris attests to the importance of admitting that such facts exist, because he says this logic applies to groups of individuals as well. He suggests that there are better and worse ways for whole societies to pursue better lives. Just like at the scale of the individual, there may be multiple different paths and \\"peaks\\" to flourishing for societies‚Äîand many more ways to fail. Harris then makes a case that science could usefully define \\"morality\\" according to such facts (about people's wellbeing). Often his arguments point out that problems with this scientific definition of morality seem to be problems shared by all science, or reason and words in general. Harris also spends some time describing how science might engage nuances and challenges of identifying the best ways for individuals, and groups of individuals, to improve their lives. Many of these issues are covered below. Philosophical case Harris says science requires that one acknowledge certain values (e.g. curiosity)Although Harris's book discusses the challenges that a science of morality must face, he also mentions that his scientific argument is indeed philosophical. Furthermore, he says that this is the case for almost all scientific investigation. He mentions that modern science amounts to careful practice of accepted first philosophical principles like empiricism and physicalism.The Moral Landscape, pg. 180 He also suggests that science has already very much settled on values in answering the question \\"what should I believe, and why should I believe it?\\".The Moral Landscape, pg. 144 Harris says it should not be surprising that normative ethical sciences are, or would be, similarly founded on bedrock assumptions (basic norms). Harris says: The way he thinks science might engage moral issues draws on various philosophical positions like ethical realism (there are facts worth calling 'moral facts'), and ethical naturalism (these facts relate to the physical world). Harris says a science of morality may resemble utilitarianism, but that the science is, importantly, more open-ended because it involves an evolving definition of well-being. Rather than committing to reductive materialism, then, Harris recognizes the arguments of revisionists that psychological definitions themselves are contingent on research and discoveries. Harris adds that any science of morality must consider everything from emotions and thoughts to the actual actions and their consequences. To Harris, moral propositions, and explicit values in general, are concerned with the flourishing of conscious creatures in a society. He argues that \\"Social morality exists to sustain cooperative social relationships, and morality can be objectively evaluated by that standard.\\" Harris sees some philosophers' talk of strictly private morality as akin to unproductive discussion of some private, personal physics. \\"If philosophers want to only talk about some bizarrely unnatural private morality, they are just changing the subject...\\"The Moral Landscape, pg. 147 Harris also discusses how interchangeability of perspective might emerge as an important part of moral reasoning. He alludes to an 'unpleasant surprise principle', where someone realizes they have been supporting an ineffective moral norm (e.g. reported cases of Jew-hunting Nazis discovering that they themselves were of Jewish descent).The Moral Landscape, pg. 81 Science and moral truths Harris identifies three projects for science as it relates to morality: (1) explaining why humans do what they do in the name of \\"morality\\" (e.g. traditional evolutionary psychology), (2) determining which patterns of thought and behaviour humans actually should follow (i.e. the science of morality), and (3) generally persuading humans to change their ways.The Moral Landscape, pg. 49 Harris says that the first project is focused only on describing what is, whereas projects (2) and (3) are focused on what should and could be, respectively. Harris's point is that this second, prescriptive project should be the focus of a science of morality.The Moral Landscape, pg. 42 He mentions, however, that we should not fear an \\"Orwellian future\\" with scientists at every door‚Äîvital progress in the science of morality could be shared in much the same way as advances in medicine. Harris says it is important to delineate project (1) from project (2), or else we risk committing a moralistic fallacy.The Moral Landscape, pg. 101 He also highlights the importance of distinguishing between project (2) (asking what is right) from project (3) (trying to change behaviour). He says we must realize that the nuances of human motivation is a challenge in itself; humans often fail to do what they \\"ought\\" to do even to be successfully selfish‚Äîthere is every reason to believe that discovering what is best for society would not change every member's habits overnight.The Moral Landscape, pg. 92 Harris does not imagine that people, even scientists, have always made the right moral decisions‚Äîindeed it is precisely his argument that many of them are wrong about moral facts.The Moral Landscape, pg. 42‚Äì44 This is due to the many real challenges of good science in general, including human cognitive limitations and biases (e.g. loss aversion can sway human decisions on important issues like medicine). He mentions the research of Paul Slovic and others to describe just a few of these established mental heuristics that might keep us from reasoning properly.The Moral Landscape, pg. 69 Although he mentions that training might temper the influence of these biases, Harris worries about research showing that incompetence and ignorance in a domain leads to confidence (the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect).The Moral Landscape, pg. 123 Harris explains that debates and disagreement are a part of the scientific method, and that one side can certainly be wrong.The Moral Landscape, pg. 88 He also explains that all the debates still available to science illustrate how much work could still be done, and how much conversation must continue.The Moral Landscape, pg. 67 Harris's positive beliefs The book is full of issues that Harris thinks are far from being empirically, morally grey areas. That is, besides saying that 'reasonable' thinking about moral issues amounts to scientific thinking. For instance, he references one poll that found that 36 percent of British Muslims think apostates should be put to death for their unbelief, and he says that these individuals are \\"morally confused\\".The Moral Landscape, pg. 90 He also suggests it is obvious that loneliness, helplessness, and poverty are \\"bad\\", but that these are by no means as far as positive psychology has taken, and will take us.The Moral Landscape, pg. 183 In one section, called The illusion of free will, Harris argues that there is a wealth of evidence in psychology (e.g. the illusion of introspection) or specifically related to the neuroscience of free will that suggests that metaphysically free will does not exist. This, he thinks, is intuitive; \\"trains of thought...convey the apparent reality of choices, freely made. But from a deeper perspective...thoughts simply arise (what else could they do?)\\".The Moral Landscape, pg. 105 He adds \\"The illusion of free will is itself an illusion\\".The Moral Landscape, pg. 112 The implications of free will's non-existence may be a working determinism, and Harris warns us not to confuse this with fatalism. One implication of a determined will, Harris says, is that it becomes unreasonable to punish people out of retribution‚Äîonly behaviour modification and the deterrence of others still seem to be potentially valid reasons to punish.The Moral Landscape, pg. 109 This, especially because behaviour modification is a sort of cure for the evil behaviours; Harris provides a thought experiment: Harris acknowledges a hierarchy of moral consideration (e.g. humans are more important than bacteria or mice). He says it follows that there could, in principle, be a species compared to which we are relatively unimportant (although he doubts such a species exists).The Moral Landscape, pg. 210 Harris supports the development of lie-detection technology and believes it would be, on the whole, beneficial for humanity. =Religion: good or bad?= Consistent with Harris's definition of morality, he says we must ask whether religion increases human flourishing today (regardless of whether it increased it in the distant past).The Moral Landscape, pg. 148 He argues that religions may largely be practiced because they fit well with human cognitive tendencies (e.g. animism).The Moral Landscape, pg. 150 In Harris's view, religion and religious dogma is an impediment to reason, and he discusses the views of Francis Collins as one example. Harris criticizes the tactics of secularists like Chris Mooney, who argue that science is not fundamentally (and certainly not superficially) in conflict with religion. Harris sees this as a very serious disagreement, that patronizingly attempts to pacify more devout theists.The Moral Landscape, pg. 175 Harris claims that societies can move away from deep dependence on religion just as it has from witchcraft, which he says was once just as deeply ingrained. Promotion In advance of publication, four personal and professional acquaintances of the author offered their praise for the book,See, for example, Krauss, \\"God and Science Don't Mix\\", The Wall Street Journal (describing Harris and Dawkins as his \\"friends\\") (accessed on Harris's personal website, Nov. 7, 2010) including biologist and science popularizer Richard Dawkins, novelist Ian McEwan, psycholinguist Steven Pinker, and theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss. They each serve on the Advisory Board of Harris's Project Reason, and their praise appears as blurbs (released by the book's publisher on Harris's website and reproduced on the book's dust jacket). Dawkins said, McEwan wrote that \\"Harris breathes intellectual fire into an ancient debate. Reading this thrilling, audacious book, you feel the ground shifting beneath your feet. Reason has never had a more passionate advocate.\\" Pinker said that Harris offers \\"a tremendously appealing vision, and one that no thinking person can afford to ignore.\\" Krauss opined that Harris \\"has the rare ability to frame arguments that are not only stimulating, they are downright nourishing, even if you don't always agree with him!\\" Krauss predicted that \\"readers are bound to come away with previously firm convictions about the world challenged, and a vital new awareness about the nature and value of science and reason in our lives.\\" Reception The Moral Landscape reached 9th in The New York Times Best Seller list for Hardcover Non-Fiction in October 2010. Reviews and criticism ECSU Associate Professor of Philosophy James W. Diller and Andrew E. Nuzzolilli wrote a generally favorable review in a journal of the Association for Behavior Analysis International: In his review for Barnes & Noble, Cal State Associate Professor of Philosophy Troy Jollimore wrote that the book \\"has some good, reasonable, and at times persuasive things to say\\" to people who are unfamiliar with moral skepticism, but \\"has little to say to those people who actually do know what the arguments are, and it will not help others become much better informed.\\" Jollimore also worried that Harris wrongly presents complex issues as having simple solutions.Jollimore, Barnes & Noble Review, Oct. 22, 2010. Kwame Anthony Appiah wrote in The New York Times \\"when [Harris] stays closest to neuroscience, he says much that is interesting and important...\\".K.A. Appiah, \\"Science Knows Best\\", The New York Times, Oct. 1, 2010 He later criticized Harris for failing to articulate \\"his central claim\\" and to identify how science has \\"revealed\\" that human well-being has an objective component. Appiah argued that Harris \\"ends up endorsing ... something very like utilitarianism, a philosophical position that is now more than two centuries old, ... that faces a battery of familiar problems,\\" which Harris merely \\"push[es] ... aside.\\" Harris responded to Appiah in the afterword of the paperback version, claiming that all of Appiah's criticisms had already been addressed in the chapter \\"Good and Evil\\". Cognitive anthropologist Scott Atran criticized Harris for failing to engage with the philosophical literature on ethics and the problems in attempting to scientifically quantify human well being, noting that Critiquing the book, Kenan Malik wrote: David Sexton of the London Evening Standard described Harris's claim to provide a science of morality as \\"the most extraordinarily overweening claim and evidently flawed. Science does not generate its own moral values; it can be used for good or ill and has been. Harris cannot stand outside culture, and the 'better future' he prophesies is itself a cultural projection. \\" John Horgan, journalist for the Scientific American blog and author of The End of Science, wrote \\"Harris further shows his arrogance when he claims that neuroscience, his own field, is best positioned to help us achieve a universal morality. ... Neuroscience can't even tell me how I can know the big, black, hairy thing on my couch is my dog Merlin. And we're going to trust neuroscience to tell us how we should resolve debates over the morality of abortion, euthanasia and armed intervention in other nations' affairs?\\"J. Horgan, \\"Be wary of the righteous rationalist: We should reject Sam Harris's claim that science can be a moral guidepost\\", Scientific American blog, Oct. 11, 2010. Russell Blackford said \\"The Moral Landscape is an ambitious work that will gladden the hearts, and strengthen the spines, of many secular thinkers\\" but that he nonetheless had \\"serious reservations‚Äù about the book. The philosopher Simon Blackburn, reviewing the book, described Harris as \\"a knockabout atheist\\" who \\"joins the prodigious ranks of those whose claim to have transcended philosophy is just an instance of their doing it very badly\\", pointing out that \\"if Bentham's hedonist is in one brain state and Aristotle's active subject is in another, as no doubt they would be, it is a moral, not an empirical, problem to say which is to be preferred.\\"Morality without God Prospect magazine 23 March 2011 And H. Allen Orr in The New York Review of Books finds that \\"despite Harris's bravado about 'how science can determine human values,' The Moral Landscape delivers nothing of the kind.\\" Steve Isaacson wrote Mining The Moral Landscape: Why Science Does Not (and cannot) Determine Human Values. Isaacson concludes, \\"The largest objection to Harris' argument is still Moore's open-question argument. Harris dismisses the argument as a word game easily avoided, but he never explains the game nor how to avoid it. He just ignores it.\\", page 38 American novelist Marilynne Robinson, writing in The Wall Street Journal, asserted that Harris fails to \\"articulate a positive morality of his own\\" but, had he done so, would have found himself in the company of the \\"Unitarians, busily cooperating on schemes to enhance the world's well being, as they have been doing for generations.\\"M. Robinson, \\"What Unitarians Know (and Sam Harris Doesn't)\\", The Wall Street Journal, Oct. 2, 2010 At the Moving Naturalism Forward workshop, Nobel Prize- winning physicist Steven Weinberg described how in his youth he had been a utilitarian but had been dissuaded of the notion that \\"the fundamental principle that guides our actions should be the greatest happiness for the greatest number\\" by reading Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Weinberg went on to say: \\"Now, Sam Harris is aware of this kind of counter argument [to utilitarianism], and says it's not happiness, it's human welfare. Well, as you make things vaguer and vaguer, of course, it becomes harder and harder to say it doesn't fit your own moral feelings, but it also becomes less and less useful as a means of making moral judgements. You could take that to the extreme and make up some nonsense word and say that's the important thing and no one could refute it, but it wouldn't be very helpful. I regard human welfare and the way Sam Harris refers to it as sort of halfway in that direction to absolute nonsense.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebuve4INdAU&list;=PLrxfgDEc2NxYQuZ5T6CSdS8uafdh0kmDL Response to critics from Harris A few months after the book's release, Harris wrote a follow-up at The Huffington Post responding to his critics. On August 31, 2013, in response to the negative reviews of his book, Harris issued a public challenge for anyone to write an essay of less than 1,000 words rebutting the \\"central argument\\" of the book.The Moral Landscape Challenge : : Sam Harris The submissions were vetted by Russell Blackford, with the author of the essay judged best to receive $2,000, or $20,000 if they succeeded in changing Harris's mind.

Under the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Libya has moved towards a legal system based on sharia, but with various deviations from it. Ottoman and Italian law When Libya was ruled by the miguel moreno , the civil law was the Majallat al-ah Kam al-ad Liyat. In 1830, the Ottoman Empire adopted the Napoleonic Code as its commercial code. However, Islamic law continued to influence other areas, for example, the 1858 Ottoman Land Code, which comprised a mix of Turkish traditional practises and Islamic law. By 1870, the Senussi movement of Sufi- and Salafi-influenced jurist Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi had also effectively established an alternative legal system, more purely based on Islamic law, for the tribes of inland Libya. The coastal portion of Libya was also administered as an Italian colony from 1911 to 1943, bringing Italian law into Libya as well. Law under the federal monarchy In the 1950s under King Idris, completely new codes based on French and Italian civil law were drafted, including the Commercial Code of 1953 and the Civil Code of 1954. The latter was written by Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri, the author of the 1948 Egyptian Civil Code, which itself was based on the French civil law, but also recognised sharia and Arab customs as a source of law. Arab customs were ranked by Article I of the Libyan code as third as a source of law in Libya, behind sharia; this compares to its ranking of second, ahead of sharia, in other countries adopting Sanhuri codes such as Egypt and Iraq. European laws were imported and applied in fields where sharia law was less developed, namely commercial law, procedural law, and penal law. Islamic influence remained in some areas of commercial law too, however; Libya was the first country adopting the Sanhuri code to prohibit riba (usury). Libya maintained a dual system of courts during this period: sharia law, of the Maliki school, was applied by sharia courts in matters of personal status. However, the establishment of this system of dual courts in practise meant power was taken away from the traditional sharia courts, leading to a backlash and the growth of Islamic opposition movements. Post-revolutionary law When Muammar Gaddafi came to power in the Libyan Revolution, he promised to reinstate sharia law and abrogate imported laws which contradicted Islamic values. Initially, however, Article 34 of the 1969 constitution stated that all old laws remained in effect, except for those which contravened the new constitution. In 1973, Gaddafi suspended all legislation, and stated that sharia would be the law of the land, however Gaddafis sharia was based only in the quran and not in a classical Muslim legalistic source of fiqh. It could hence be considered a new form fiqh. The dual-court system was also abolished that year, replaced by a single court system which aimed to bring together Islamic and secular principles. However, by 1974, progress in the Islamicisation of the law had come to a halt. The Green Book, Gaddafi's outline of his political and economic philosophy for Libya, officially accepts religion and customary law as sources of law for society. In 1977, the Libyan government promulgated the Declaration of People's Power, which superseded the constitution; this also stated that the Qur'an was the source of legislation for Libya. However, throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Gaddafi repeatedly emphasised in speeches that Islamic law was an insufficient basis for modern economic and social relations, and that the traditional Islamic guidelines for property and commerce had no legal standing. In practise, secular policies overrode religion as a source of law. Thus, by 1990, Ann Elizabeth Mayer of the University of Pennsylvania described Gaddafi's actual progress towards the Islamisation of Libyan law as \\"very modest\\", and largely aimed not at reviving specific sharia rules, but enforcing public morality consistent with Libyan values. One area in particular in which Libyan laws are inconsistent with sharia is in the penal law, where the punishments are lighter than those mandated by traditional hudud, especially in the case of needy offenders. Mayer analyses this as leniency inspired by the Libyan government's socialist principles. The Libyan government also viewed sharia's protection of private property, along with principles of Islamic law regarding contracts and commerce, as incompatible with a socialist economic programme. However, Libyan law follows the sharia rules of evidence; the testimony of women and non- Muslims is not accepted in criminal matters. The Maliki school continued to be used as the source of Islamic law; however, if Maliki sources do not cover a certain question, reference is made to the Libyan Penal Code and the Libyan Code of Penal Procedure, rather than other schools of sharia law. The practical aim of this procedure seems to have been to limit the number and scope of sharia laws applied.

Phelps, 562 U.S. 443 (2011), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court ruling that speech on a matter of public concern, on a public street, cannot be the basis of liability for a tort of emotional distress, even in the circumstances that the speech is viewed or interpreted as \\"offensive\\" or \\"outrageous\\".. The case brought up the issue of whether or not the First Amendment protected public protestors at a funeral against claims of emotional distress, better known as tort liability. It involved a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, claimed by Albert Snyder, a man whose son Matthew Snyder, a U.S. Marine, was killed during the Iraq War. The claim was made in response to the actions of the Phelps family as well as the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) who were also present at the picketing of the funeral. The Court ruled in favor of Phelps in an 8‚Äì1 decision, determining that their speech related to a public issue was completely protected, and could not be prevented as it was on public property.  Background =Incident On March 3, 2006, U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Matthew A. Snyder was killed in a non-combat-related vehicle accident in Iraq. On March 10, Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) picketed Snyder's funeral in Westminster, Maryland, as it had done at thousands of other funerals throughout the U.S. in protest of what they considered an increasing tolerance of homosexuality in the United States. Picketers displayed placards such as \\"America is doomed\\", \\"You're going to hell\\", \\"God hates you\\", \\"Fag troops\\", \\"Semper fi fags\\" and \\"Thank God for dead soldiers\\". Members of the Patriot Guard Riders, a group of motorcyclists who separate WBC protesters from those who attend military funerals, were present in support of the Snyder family. WBC published statements on its website that denounced Albert Snyder and his ex-wife for raising their son Catholic, stating they \\"taught Matthew to defy his creator\\", \\"raised him for the devil\\", and \\"taught him that God was a liar\\". District Court of Maryland Albert Snyder, Matthew Snyder's father, sued Fred Phelps, Westboro Baptist Church and two of Phelps's daughters, Rebekah Phelps-Davis and Shirley Phelps-Roper, for defamation, intrusion upon seclusion, publicity given to private life, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy. The claim of defamation arising from comments posted about Snyder on the WBC website was dismissed, on the grounds that the contents were \\"essentially Phelps-Roper's religious opinion and would not realistically tend to expose the Plaintiff to public hatred or scorn\\". The claim of publicity given to private life was similarly dismissed since no private information was made public by the Defendants: they learned that Snyder was divorced and his son was Catholic from his son's newspaper obituary. The case proceeded to trial on the remaining three counts. The facts of the case were essentially undisputed at trial. Albert Snyder testified: Snyder described his emotional injuries, including becoming tearful, angry, and physically nauseated to the point that he would vomit. He stated that the Defendants had placed a \\"bug\\" in his head, so that he was unable to think of his son without thinking of their actions, adding, \\"I want so badly to remember all the good stuff and so far, I remember the good stuff, but it always turns into the bad\\". Snyder called several expert witnesses who testified that worsening of his diabetes and severe depression had resulted from the Defendants' activities. In their defense, WBC established that they had complied with all local ordinances and had obeyed police instructions. The picket was held in a location cordoned off by the police, approximately 1000 feet (300 m) from the church, from which it could be neither seen nor heard. Mr. Snyder testified that, although he glimpsed the tops of the signs from the funeral procession, he did not see their content until he watched a news program on television later that day. He also indicated that he had found the WBC's statements about his son on their webpage from a Google search. In his instructions to the jury, Judge Richard D. Bennett for the United States District Court for the District of Maryland stated that the First Amendment protection of free speech has limits, including vulgar, offensive and shocking statements, and that the jury must decide \\"whether the defendant's actions would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, whether they were extreme and outrageous and whether these actions were so offensive and shocking as to not be entitled to First Amendment protection\\".See also Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, a case where certain personal slurs and obscene utterances by an individual were found unworthy of First Amendment protection, due to the potential for violence resulting from their utterance. WBC unsuccessfully sought a mistrial based on alleged prejudicial statements made by the judge and violations of the gag order by the plaintiff's attorney. An appeal was also sought by the WBC. On October 31, 2007, the jury found for the Plaintiff and awarded Snyder $2,900,000 in compensatory damages, later adding a decision to award $6,000,000 in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and an additional $2,000,000 for causing emotional distress (a total of ). The Phelpses said that despite the verdict, the church would continue to picket military funerals. On February 4, 2008, Bennett upheld the verdict but reduced the punitive damages from $8 million to $2.1 million, to take into consideration the resources of WBC. The total judgment then stood at . Court liens were ordered on church buildings and Phelps' law office in an attempt to ensure that the damages were paid. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit An appeal by WBC was heard on September 24, 2009. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the jury verdict and set aside the lower court's $5 million judgment. The Fourth Circuit ruled that the lower court had erred by instructing the jury to decide a question of law rather than fact (specifically, whether or not the speech in question was protected by the First Amendment). It also ruled that the protest signs and language on WBC's website were rhetorical hyperbole and figurative expression, rather than assertions of fact, so they were a form of protected speech. On March 30, 2010, the Court further ordered Albert Snyder to pay the court costs for the defendants, an amount totaling $16,510. People all over the country, including political commentator Bill O'Reilly agreed to cover the costs, pending appeal. O'Reilly also pledged to support all of Snyder's future court costs against the Phelps family. Final appeal A writ of certiorari was filed on March 8, 2010. Arguments were heard beginning on October 13, represented by three of Phelps' daughters, including Margie Phelps.  Issues  The questions presented were as follows: # Whether the prohibition of awarding damages to public figures to compensate for the intentional infliction of emotional distress, under the Supreme Court's First Amendment precedents, applies to a case involving two private persons regarding a private matter; # Whether the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment trumps its freedom of religion and peaceful assembly. # Whether an individual attending a family member's funeral constitutes a \\"captive audience\\" who is entitled to state protection from unwanted communication.  Briefs  Several news and civil rights organizations filed amicus briefs in support of Phelps, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and twenty-one other media organizations, including National Public Radio, Bloomberg L.P., the Associated Press, the Newspaper Association of America, and others. Other briefs were filed in favor of Snyder, including one by Senate Majority and Minority Leaders Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid, and forty other members of the United States Senate, a number of veterans groups, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion, the John Marshall Veterans Legal Support Center and Clinic, and another by Kansas which was joined by District of Columbia and every other State except Delaware and Maine.  Ruling  Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion. In an 8‚Äì1 decision (with the justices ruling the same way as they did in United States v. Stevens in 2010), the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Phelps, upholding the Fourth Circuit's decision. Chief Justice John Roberts (as in the Stevens case) wrote the majority opinion stating \\"What Westboro said, in the whole context of how and where it chose to say it, is entitled to 'special protection' under the First Amendment and that protection cannot be overcome by a jury finding that the picketing was outrageous.\\" The court's opinion also stated that the memorial service was not disturbed, saying, \\"Westboro stayed well away from the memorial service, Snyder could see no more than the tops of the picketers' signs, and there is no indication that the picketing interfered with the funeral service itself.\\" The decision also declined to expand the \\"captive audience doctrine\\", saying that Snyder was not in a state where he was coerced to hear the negative speech. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a concurring opinion, emphasizing his view that the decision related only to picketing, and did not take into consideration Westboro Baptist Church's on- line publications that attacked the Snyder family.  Alito's dissent  Justice Samuel Alito was the lone dissenting justice in this case, beginning his dissent with, \\"Our profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case.\\" He sternly criticized the Church's conduct writing: He concluded, \\"In order to have a society in which public issues can be openly and vigorously debated, it is not necessary to allow the brutalization of innocent victims like petitioner.\\" In a July 2011 speech, Justice Ginsburg called Alito's dissent \\"heart-felt\\" and said that it \\"underscored the incomparable distress suffered by the Snyder family,\\" noting that \\"although no member of the Court joined him, his opinion aligned with the views of many Court-watchers, including one of the nation's newest‚Äîretired Justice Stevens, [who] recently told the Federal Bar Council he 'would have joined [Justice Alito's] powerful dissent'.\\" (Justice John Paul Stevens had retired in 2010.)

She was working in the country as regional director for Development Alternatives Incorporated, a contractor for US and other government agencies. The group were taken to the nearby Dewegal Valley area. United States and Afghan forces began a search of the area, placing roadblocks to prevent the group from being moved east into Pakistan. Norgrove's captors demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui in exchange for her return. The Taliban released the three Afghans on 3 October 2010 during negotiations. The United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group conducted a predawn rescue attempt five days later on the Taliban mountain hideout where Norgrove was held captive, amid concerns that she would be killed or moved by her kidnappers. US forces killed several kidnappers and three local farmers during the assault. They subsequently located Norgrove, badly wounded in a nearby gully, and she died later from her injuries. Initial reports said that she had been killed by an explosion set off by one of her captors. A joint official investigation by the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that her fatal injuries were inflicted by a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. A February 2011 coroner's narrative verdict reported that Norgrove died during the failed rescue attempt. In October 2012, one of her colleagues said in an interview that the captors had told Norgrove that they had no intention of killing her. Early life, education and work The Isle of Lewis, Scotland, where Norgrove grew up Norgrove was born in Altnaharra, Scotland, in 1974 to John and Lorna Norgrove. She grew up on a croft on the Isle of Lewis in the Western Isles, attending a primary school in Uig. She later attended the Nicolson Institute in Stornoway. Norgrove attended the University of Aberdeen, receiving a first- class honours degree in tropical environmental science; her coursework included postgraduate research at the University of Chiapas in Mexico and a year of study at the University of Oregon (1993‚Äì94). She attended the University of London, receiving a MA with distinction in rural resources and environmental policy in 1997. In 2002, Norgrove received a PhD from the University of Manchester in development policy and management. From 2002 to 2005, she worked for the World Wide Fund in Peru, supporting (and later supervising) the WWF's Forest Program in the Peruvian Andes. At the time of her death, in addition to her aid work, Norgrove was working towards an MBA from the University of Warwick through distance learning. She worked in Afghanistan for the United Nations from 2005 to 2008, and as regional director of an international development company based in Jalalabad beginning in February 2010. She also worked in Laos as an environmental specialist for the U.N. in 2008‚Äì09, Mexico, and Uganda where Norgrove researched the effects of national park management on the indigenous population near Mount Elgon National Park. Kidnapping Map of Afghanistan, with Kunar Province in red On 26 September 2010, Norgrove and three Afghan colleagues were travelling in the Chawkay District (also known as Tsawkay and Sawkay) of eastern Kunar Province when they were kidnapped by local insurgents. They were ambushed while driving on the main highway from Jalalabad to Asadabad, in the Dewagal valley, in two unarmoured, unmarked Toyota Corollas. A US military convoy was ambushed two months earlier on the same stretch of road. Norgrove wore a burqa to disguise her foreign appearance. According to four sources within the United States military and intelligence services, at the time Norgrove was working for Development Alternatives Incorporated and was secretly employed by MI6. Dressed in men's clothing by her captors, she was taken first into the mountains and then brought to the Dewegal Valley in Chowkai District (which crosses the Korengal Valley). US Army troops from Bravo Company, 2/327 Infantry, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division began a 12-day search supported by Afghan army, police and commando units under the codename \\"Enterprise\\". A house-to-house search was conducted and roadblocks posted at the valley entrance to prevent Norgrove's captors from transferring her eastward into Pakistan. The difficult terrain (with few roads) complicated and slowed the process; the search efforts succeeded in containing the kidnappers in the vicinity and several local Taliban members were killed. Negotiations It was unclear at first who had kidnapped Norgrove and her colleagues. A Taliban commander, the Pakistan-based Mohammed Osman, was reported to demand the release of Aafia Siddiqui in return for Norgrove's freedom. Siddiqui, known as \\"Lady al-Qaeda\\", had received an 86-year prison sentence in the US on 26 September. \\"We are lucky that we abducted this British woman soon after the ruthless ruling by an American court on Aafia Siddiqui. We will demand the release of Aafia Siddiqui in exchange for her\\", said Osman. Other Afghan sources denied any link to Osman. US military sources identified Norgrove's captors as Kunar Taliban, and British Foreign Secretary William Hague said they were from a Salafist group affiliated with the local Taliban, known as Jamaat al Dawa al Quran. An Afghan intelligence official later identified her captors as local commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan. Negotiations for Norgrove's release were conducted through local tribal elders. The three Afghans captured with Norgrove were released on 3 October. British Prime Minister David Cameron said that the primary fear was that she \\"was going to be passed up the terrorist chain, which would increase further the already high risk that she would be killed.\\" The British foreign office asked the media not to release details about Norgrove's personal life while she was in captivity to avoid attaching \\"trophy value\\" to her kidnapping. Rescue attempt and death Intelligence reports indicated that a group of local elders were calling for Norgrove to be executed \\"like the Russian\\" (a possible reference to the Russian war in Afghanistan). The intelligence prompted Cameron and Hague to approve a United States special operations effort to rescue Norgrove during her 13th night of captivity. The operation was spearheaded by \\"SEAL Team Six\\", Navy SEALs from the Naval Special Warfare Development Group. The SEALs staged a predawn raid on the Taliban hillside compound hideout, where Norgrove was held in a shack, on 8 October 2010. The stronghold was surrounded by high, thick perimeter walls in a densely wooded area in the village of Dineshgal, up a steep mountain in the Korengal Valley. At approximately 3:30 am, 20 SEALs and about 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired on from the compound and from a nearby position by Taliban armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US troops on the ground with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed. During the gunfight, Norgrove's captors dragged her outside the building where she was being held, but she apparently broke away from them. Video footage of the raid showed an explosion in her vicinity; Norgrove was then found, injured, in a fetal position in a gully. Norgrove was removed from the scene via helicopter and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are in danger of being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded. Joint investigation Major General, later General, Joseph Votel, led the investigation. The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, announced Norgrove's death. In a written statement, he said that after receiving information on her location it was \\"decided that, given the danger she was facing, her best chance of safe release was to act on that information.\\" David Cameron, the UK Prime Minister, defended the rescue attempt: \\"Decisions on operations to free hostages are always difficult. But where a British life is in such danger, and where we and our allies can act, I believe it is right to try\\". On 10 October, an unnamed Afghan intelligence officer said that Norgrove was killed by a grenade thrown by one of her captors. The following day, Cameron said that new information indicated Norgrove may have accidentally been killed by a US grenade. A US military statement read: \\"Subsequent review of surveillance footage and discussions with members of the rescue team do not conclusively determine the cause of her death\\". US President Barack Obama promised \\"to get to the bottom\\" of the failed rescue attempt. General David Petraeus, commander of the NATO security force in Afghanistan, ordered an investigation into the incident. US Major General Joseph Votel (then Chief of Staff of the US Special Operations Command) and British Brigadier Robert Nitsch (Head of Joint Force Support, UK Forces Afghanistan) were appointed to lead a joint UK and US investigation. It was reported on 12 October that the results were expected within days, and Norgrove's family was kept informed of the investigation's progress. While the military investigation was conducted, Norgrove's body was returned to the United Kingdom on 14 October on a Royal Air Force flight to RAF Lyneham. A humanist funeral ceremony, attended by hundreds of people, was held on 26 October at the Uig Community Centre in the Western Isles. Norgrove was buried at Ardroil cemetery. On 2 December, Hague announced the results of the joint investigation, which concluded that Norgrove was accidentally killed by a grenade thrown by a US sailor. Navy SEALs did not immediately notify senior officers about throwing the grenade; this breached military law, and a number of sailors were disciplined. A post-mortem examination of Norgrove's body was conducted by British coroner Russell Delaney on 19 October 2010. Detective Chief Inspector Colin Smith of the Metropolitan Police told an inquest, opened 22 October in the Salisbury coroner's court, that the examination identified the cause of death as \\"penetrating fragment injuries to the head and chest.\\" In February 2011, the coroner recorded a narrative verdict confirming the earlier military investigations' findings that Norgrove was killed by a member of the US rescue team, noting that a gunshot wound to the leg Norgrove received during the rescue did not contribute to her death. In October 2012, Abdul Wadood, Norgrove's colleague and fellow captive, told the BBC that she asked the kidnappers if they were going to kill her and that they assured her they would not. Tributes James Boomgard, regional director for Development Alternatives Inc. (the company employing Norgrove when she was kidnapped), released a statement: \\"We are saddened beyond words by the death of a wonderful woman whose sole purpose in Afghanistan was to do good ‚Äì to help the Afghan people achieve a measure of prosperity and stability in their everyday lives as they set about rebuilding their country\\". United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator Robert Watkins praised Norgrove: \\"She was a true advocate for the people of Afghanistan and was dedicated to bringing improvements to their lives\\", and \\"her spirit and compassion will be greatly missed\\". First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond said: \\"Ms Norgrove was a dedicated aid worker who was doing everything she could to help people in Afghanistan‚Äîhopefully that legacy of service in a humanitarian cause can be of some comfort to her loved ones in their time of grief\\". Norgrove received the 2011 Robert Burns Humanitarian Award posthumously for her work in Afghanistan. Her family has established the Linda Norgrove Foundation to continue her relief work.

Father Whelan previously served as a missionary in North Carolina and pastor of Georgia's first Catholic parish, and twice served as administrator of the entire diocese of Savannah. He initially ministered to Confederate troops including the Montgomery Guards, an Irish company established in Savannah for the First Georgia Volunteer Regiment. He remained with them during the Union siege of Fort Pulaski which guarded Savannah harbor, and volunteered to remain with them during their imprisonment in New York in 1862. About a year after his release in a prisoner exchange, he was assigned to minister to the Union prisoners-of-war held at Andersonville, Georgia, where he became known as the \\"Angel of Andersonville.\\" Nonetheless, according to a biographer in 1959, Father Whelan \\"never received a lasting place in the history of the Southland he loved so well.\\"  Early life and ministry  Peter Whelan was born in 1802 in Loughnageer, Foulkesmills (parish of Clongeen), County Wexford, Ireland. Little is known about his early life. From 1822 to 1824 he attended Birchfield College in Kilkenny, where he received a classical and mathematical education before coming to America. Whelan heard about an appeal for priests made by John England, the popular and dynamic bishop of the new diocese of Charleston, South Carolina, the See that also embraced the states of North Carolina and Georgia. Whelan was incardinated on April 6, 1829, and was ordained in Charleston on November 21, 1830. For the next two years he served as secretary to the bishop before beginning his duties in communities throughout North Carolina, including New Bern, Washington, Greenville, Fayetteville, Lincolnton, Salisbury, Wilmington, Long Creek, and Raleigh. He was said to have celebrated the first Mass ever offered in Raleigh, in 1832, at the boarding house of Matthew Shaw, a Presbyterian. His zeal also played a key role in the erection of the capital city's first Catholic church. Although Whelan occasionally visited Georgia, it was not until February 21, 1837, that he became pastor of the Church of the Purification of the Most Pure Heart of Mary at Locust Grove, which is near modern-day Sharon, Georgia. He spent nineteen years in this small parish, which was the first planned, Catholic community in the state. Located on an old stagecoach road running from Sparta through Double Wells to Raytown and Washington, the original place of worship, constructed of hand-hewn logs, was also the first Catholic Church built in Georgia. Father Whelan had offered the first Mass in the home of Thomas G. Semmes in the town of Washington in 1835. At Bishop England's death, Ignatius A. Reynolds was appointed to the position. On a visit to Locust Grove in 1844, he expressed deep satisfaction with the religious proficiency of the children. Two years later another report summed up Whelan's whole pastorate: \\"In the diocese‚Ä¶there is not a congregation, remote and rural as it is, in which, taking proportionate numbers into the scale, we find the youth are more moral, orderly and better instructed.\\"  The Diocese of Savannah  In 1850 the new diocese of Savannah, encompassing all of Georgia and part of Florida, was established, and Francis Xavier Gartland became its first bishop. In 1854 Father Gregory Duggan of Augusta became ill during a yellow fever epidemic. Whelan journeyed to Augusta to help handle Duggan's affairs. He was then summoned to Savannah when Bishop Gartland, while ministering to victims of yellow fever, caught the disease himself and died. Father Whelan would be stationed here for the rest of his life. The young diocese was without a bishop until the Reverend John Barry, the interim administrator, was consecrated in August 1857, and Whelan was appointed his vicar general. However, tragedy struck again in November 1859 when Barry died on a trip to France. Soon, Whelan became administrator of the whole diocese. Although he purportedly had been recommended for the Episcopal dignity, Bishop Patrick Lynch of Charleston and the priests of Savannah had to pressure Whelan to accept the office of administrator until a new bishop could be appointed. This duty was unusually difficult for Whelan. In a report of January 25, 1861, to the Propagation of the Faith, he indicated that Barry's sudden death had left the diocese in disarray. Distance between missions, lack of good communications, and a scarcity of priests increased the burden. Debt payments were due on various projects, such as the schools and churches so vitally needed for the poor Irish immigrants. One priest visiting Savannah in 1859 said that he witnessed the bishop, priests, and thirty orphans \\"huddled together in a shanty through which the wind whistled as through a basket.\\" Relief finally came for Whelan in September 1861, when Bishop Augustin Verot arrived from Florida to fill the vacant See. By then Savannah was caught up in the Civil War. People of all faiths in the South had favored secession. One missionary, who had previously visited Savannah, complained that, \\"Father Whelan with all the priests tried to make [him] a secessionist.\\" Whelan had even jokingly warned of \\"tar and feathers.\\" Civil War= Fort Pulaski  Fort Pulaski, located on Cockspur Island, about seventeen miles from the city of Savannah was manned by five companies of Confederates, guarded the port of Savannah. Bishop Verot asked for a volunteer priest to go to Fort Pulaski and serve the needs of all the Catholic troops stationed there, especially the Montgomery Guards, composed almost exclusively of Irish Catholics from the surrounding area. The sixty-year-old Father Whelan answered the call. As one of only eleven priests in all Georgia, he had to return occasionally to the city. Bishop Verot, who was about to depart on church matters, placed Whelan in charge of whole diocese on January 7, 1862. Upon the bishop's return four weeks later, the telegraph lines to Cockspur were cut by the Federals, and the fort was isolated. Whelan could not attend the annual clergy retreat or the diocesan synod, nor would he see his Savannah friends again for six months. The isolation of Fort Pulaski came gradually. The Federals slowly severed it from Savannah as part of their planned blockade of all southern ports. While the encirclement was in progress, the defenders grew troubled. Lack of communication with Savannah added to their tension. As they readied the fort for action, Federal ordnance was being landed in the darkness and stealthily put into place behind sand dunes a mile away. During a time of such apprehension, the pastoral duties of the Irish chaplain took on an added dimension. Sharing the everyday life of the men in all ways, save military duties, he now had to bring consolation to the hard-pressed, weary soldiers. Whelan soon became a favorite of the men of every faith, and his religious direction provided inspiration for the Catholics. Organized on August 20, 1861, and quickly mustered into service, the Montgomery Guards was still without its own colors. With some fabric located by Captain Lawrence J. Guilmartin, the Sisters of Mercy in Savannah constructed a handsome banner. On St. Patrick's Day, 1862, after morning Mass, Major John Foley of the garrison formally presented the flag to Private Bernard O'Neill, the appointed standard bearer. Following the custom of Catholic chaplains throughout the war, Whelan called down God's blessing on the banner and the company. On the morning of Thursday, April 10, 1862, the Federal forces began to bombard the fort. During this period Father Whelan experienced what few chaplains ever faced: direct, heavy fire from the enemy. The new rifled cannons proved to be a most effective advantage for the Union Artillery, providing greater distance and accuracy than that of their Confederate counterpart. For thirty hours the Union batteries pounded the fort. Conical steel-pointed shot soon began to bore through the walls of the brick and mortar fortress. After the crumbling officers' quarters became uninhabitable, the priest had to stay in the northeast casements while tending the wounded. The walls of the fort were receiving serious damage and it was only a matter of time before artillery rounds would penetrate the main powder magazine. In order to preserve the lives of his men, the garrison's commander, Colonel Charles H. Olmstead, agreed to surrender.  Castle William  On April 13, two days after Fort Pulaski was surrendered, the captured Confederates were divided into groups for transportation north. Father Whelan was offered his freedom but chose to remain with the men in order to continue his ministry among them. Now a prisoner of war, the priest endured the harsh voyage to Governor's Island, New York, where he shared the rigors of prison life with the men. This place of detention, which was under the command of an elderly colonel, Gustavus Loomis, was one of several Atlantic forts pressed into use by the Commissary General of Prisoners, Colonel William Hoffmann. The officers were quartered in barracks and granted freedom of the island on their word not to escape; they were also issued blankets and limited supplies and money from home. Their quarters were cleaned regularly and meals were cooked for them. The enlisted men, on the other hand, were not so fortunate. Many needed clothing, and some even had to go barefoot. They were confined in an old fort known as \\"Castle William.\\" It had few toilet facilities, poor ventilation, no conveniences for cooking the meager meals, and inadequate heating. The men soon began to suffer severely from pneumonia, typhoid, and measles. Whelan's first step to alleviate this situation was to procure food and clothing. On May 3, he wrote to the Reverend William Quinn, pastor of St. Peter Church on Barclay Street in New York. In the letter he indicated that he had received provisions from Baltimore. In a humorous vein, Whelan asked that no more rich food be sent, lest he become an epicure in his later years. He added that he had successfully applied for a position as chaplain at the prison and had been granted the opportunity to offer Mass each morning in Castle William. Two days later, Fr. Quinn, in the name of all the clergy of New York, requested that Whelan be released on parole and be allowed to live at St. Peter's due to his age and his misfortune in having been captured while temporarily visiting Fort Pulaski. Quinn expressed fear that confinement in the damp, cold prison would seriously injure the priest's health. The appeal achieved its desired effect. On May 10, Loomis sent Whelan to Assistant Provost Marshal Hunt, who brought him before General John A. Dix and Judge Edwards Pierrepont. They discharged the priest and put him on parole. Although he was allowed to leave, Whelan chose instead to remain with the men, who now needed him more than ever. Except for an occasional trip to the city to procure necessities for the men, Whelan remained at the prison, saying Mass in the morning, visiting the sick, giving encouragement and spiritual guidance for those in need, help for new prisoners when they arrived, and making burial arrangements for the deceased. While at Castle William, he became accustomed to taking walks on the ramparts early each morning. There he often met the Confederate officers. It was through these encounters that he and Colonel Charles Olmstead became very close. On June 16, the sick and wounded that had been left at Pulaski, after its capture, now arrived. Although it had been agreed upon in the surrender terms that these men would be transported to Savannah for care, General David Hunter now refused this request. General Quincy Gillmore, the original author of the surrender, was embarrassed and protested, but to no avail. When they arrived, the men looked like skeletons, and immediately Father Whelan had more clothing and food rushed from New York. On June 20, 1862, a prisoner exchange was arranged. The officers were sent to Ohio and were home by September. The others had to wait until July 10 before leaving for Fort Delaware. The sick were temporarily left behind. Pea Patch Island, the site of this recently completed fort was marshy, easily flooded, and malarial. The Georgians were quartered in tents on swampy ground filled with ditches and shoals. A few had to stay in the open without cover, because an insufficient number of wooden barracks had been constructed. The poor men soon named the place \\"Starvation Island.\\" Whether Whelan came at this time with his company or stayed behind with the sick until July 26 is not known, but he did, in fact, spend time with the men at Fort Delaware, which left a lasting impression upon him. After about four weeks, word came for the Confederate prisoners to prepare to embark for Fort Monroe, Virginia, on July 31. They were then to proceed up the James River on shallow draft boats and finally go to Aiken's Landing for exchange. They could walk the last thirteen miles to Richmond. The ill would be transported to the City Point and taken by rail to the capital. All went as planned. The prisoners were on the James River by August 3 and knew they would soon be heading home. Whelan arrived at City Point with the sick and on August 8 was unconditionally released. He then went to Aiken's Landing to join those of his company who were being exchanged on August 12. Despite numerous searches in the course of his travels, the flag of the Montgomery Guards had been faithfully concealed by the color-bearer, Bernard O'Neill. As the exchange drew near, some prisoners, including O'Neill, decided to take the oath of allegiance to the Union rather than return to Georgia. Six other members of the Irish Company resolved to recover the banner quickly beforehand. On the night before O'Neill's departure, the men stole into his quarters as he slept and retrieved the banner. While passing through the lines at Aiken's, one of the Confederates improvised a staff and triumphantly hoisted the unfurled flag amid the loud cheers of the whole company. The flag survived the war. Years later, when it was exhibited at the Georgia Historical Society, a picture of Whelan was displayed with it in the corner of the case. Before returning to Georgia, the chaplain visited Mount Hope Hospital near Baltimore to thank the Sisters of Charity for their gifts to the imprisoned soldiers.  Return to Savannah  Upon his return to Savannah, Whelan resumed his post as Vicar General. In addition, Bishop Verot assigned him the task of overseeing the religious needs of the Confederate military posts in Georgia. As the spring of 1864 arrived, the Federal army was preparing to invade Georgia. Consequently, in addition to his regular round of work at the cathedral, Whelan had to supervise the religious needs of the many new Confederate camps in the diocese. The Reverend James Sheeran of the Fourteenth Louisiana, gives a portrait of Whelan at this time: > [He] stands nearly six feet with drab hair, coarse, ill shaped countenance, > round or swinging shoulders, long arms, short body and long legs, with feet > of more than ordinary size. He may comb his hair sometimes, but if so, it > shows no indication of it, as it is generally in a standing condition. His > coat is not of the latest nor approved fashion: the sleeves exposing some > inches of the lower part of his arm, and a large rough hand. His pants > extend only a little below the knees, exhibiting a considerable portion of > his stockings and unpolished or ash-colored shoes... He is fully sensible of > his personal exterior. One day he met a brother priest, to whom nature was > no more liberal than to himself. \\"Well,\\" said he, \\"...your mother and mine > must have been women of great virtue...because they did not drown us when > they first saw us. None but mothers of great...patience would have raised > such ugly specimens of humanity.\\"  Andersonville Prison  Andersonville, GA In May 1864, the Reverend William Hamilton, pastor of Assumption Church in Macon and the man responsible for the Catholic missions in southwestern Georgia, was visiting Americus, Georgia. He accidentally came upon Andersonville prison, which was officially known as \\"Camp Sumter,\\" and stopped to learn how many Catholics were there. What he saw led him to write a report to the bishop about the condition of the stockade and hospital and to suggest that a priest be provided immediately. Bishop Verot asked Whelan to go. Before departing, the sixty-two-year-old priest, along with Father Hamilton visited Major General Howell Cobb, a Georgian with close ties to the Confederate administration. Hamilton described the terrible conditions that he had seen and recommended that a parole be arranged for the prisoners. Cobb promised to inform the authorities in Richmond, but, as he had feared, nothing was done to help. Whelan arrived at Andersonville on June 16, 1864. While other priests and even the bishop would come for brief periods, Whelan alone remained for nearly four months during the hottest season of the year and the period of the highest mortality. He departed in October after many of the prisoners had been removed to other locations. Although the priest did not leave a record of the shock of his first entry into Andersonville, Father Hamilton described his impressions of subsequent visits vividly: > I found the stockade extremely filthy; the men all huddled together and > covered with vermin (lice).‚Ä¶ I found [the hospital] almost as crowded as the > stockade. The men were dying there very rapidly from scurvy‚Ä¶diarrhea and > dysentery‚Ä¶They were not only covered with the ordinary vermin but also > maggots‚Ä¶they had nothing under them at all except the ground. Into this nightmare came Whelan to begin a ministry unlike any that he had performed or would ever encounter again. After a restless night on his bunk in a little twelve-by-eight foot hut about a mile from the prison, he rose each day at dawn, took a scant breakfast and said his prayers. Then he walked the hot, dusty path to the stockade, where he stayed from 9 a.m. until nearly sundown; then it was back to the hut for night prayer and some food. He fell asleep exhausted and \\"full of sorrow for what he had seen all day.\\" The stockade sloped down on both sides to a small stream about a yard wide and foot deep. Since no arrangement had been made for sewage disposal, this one creek had to provide drinking, cooking, and bathing water, while also serving as the latrine. Into the creek was thrown the waste of two nearby Confederate camps as well as the grease and garbage from the cookhouse. Soon the slow- flowing stream became a mass of thick, liquid pollution. As thousands more prisoners came and milled about its banks, some of the very sick were unable to extricate themselves from the mire; others who could not reach the \\"sinks,\\" as they were called, had to relieve themselves in the mud. The creek soon became a new source of disease for the entire stockade. Father Whelan and his fellow priests had to exert an almost \\"superhuman effort\\" passing through this area in order to get from one side of the camp to the other. All this was too much for Father Henry Clavreul, who had joined Whelan in August. He became sick with continual vomiting and later wrote: \\"Whelan decided that I should leave, so I took the trains back to Savannah whilst the‚Ä¶old priest retraced his steps to the stockade.\\" As the number of prisoners grew steadily to about 33,000, Whelan requested more help. He was joined first by the Reverend John Kirby of Augusta, and then, by the multilingual Jesuit, the Reverend Anselm Usannez, from Spring Hill College near Mobile. Each worked for two weeks before leaving the camp. = Trial of the Raiders = The lack of streets and the hodgepodge of dwellings in the stockade made it impossible to police the area properly. Stealing, brutality, and even murder by well-organized armed \\"raiders\\" became common. After many protests the prisoners were allowed to organize for defense, to have the suspects arrested, and to give them a fair trial. Twenty-four were caught, tried and convicted, and six were sentenced to death. Whelan visited the men in the stocks on July 10, the night before their execution. The next morning, as the scaffold was being constructed, the priest tried in vain to obtain a stay of execution. = \\"Whelan's Bread\\" = In late August, as Sherman was about to enter Atlanta, Union prisoners were being transferred to Savannah and Charleston. By late September, Whelan decided that he could leave. Before he left, the priest contacted Henry Horne, a devout Catholic and successful restaurant owner in Macon. From him Whelan borrowed $16,000 in Confederate money, the equivalent of $400 in gold. With this, he went to the town of Americus, purchased ten thousand pounds of wheat flour, had it baked into bread and distributed at the prison hospital at Andersonville. The prisoners referred to it as \\"Whelan's bread.\\" This much-needed gift was enough to provide the men with rations for several months. = \\"The Angel of Andersonville\\" = The prisoners never forgot the priest. When they returned home and wrote their memoirs, Father Whelan and his work were often recalled. Some mentioned that he had brought clothing, food, and money from Savannah. One added, \\"without a doubt he was the means of saving hundred of lives.\\" Another described Whelan's ministering to the sick: \\"All creeds, color and nationalities were alike to him‚Ä¶He was indeed the Good Samaritan.\\" A sergeant, John Vaughter, in his memoirs remarked that, \\"of all the ministers in Georgia accessible to Andersonville, only one could hear this sentence, 'I was sick and in prison and you visited me,' and that one is a Catholic.\\"  Back In Savannah  When the elderly priest returned to Savannah he faced internal and external changes. He was then suffering from a lung ailment he contracted at Andersonville. In Savannah, despondency was everywhere. Many families had lost loved ones, and the end of the Confederacy seemed close at hand. Federal prisoners, by the thousands, began arriving in the city and were in need of care. Whelan was still Vicar General when Sherman's forces arrived in December. Immediately east of Savannah's Catholic cemetery on the Thunderbolt Road, the federal engineers began reconstruction of the old Confederate earthworks. While digging the new trenches, they invaded the cemetery, opened some graves, and destroyed or covered up some monuments. Among the graves that were disturbed was that of the first bishop of Savannah, Francis Gartland. To prevent desecration, some women removed his remains and buried them temporarily in the convent garden of the Sisters of Mercy. The bodies of another bishop, two priests, and four nuns were also rescued. Whelan was the first to protest with a letter to General Quincy Gillmore, whom he had known at Fort Pulaski: \\"It must be‚Ä¶an extreme military necessity when the ashes of the dead are disturbed‚Ä¶. Might can effect it, but does Right sanction it?\\" His appeal for the situation to be corrected was followed with messages from Bishop Verot to Gillmore and Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton. Investigations took place, more letters were exchanged, and eventually the matter was resolved. Post-war= Trial of Henry Wirz  As Federal ex-prisoners were gradually returning to their homes in the North. The details of the horrors of Andersonville quickly circulated, and the leaders of the Confederacy came under fire. Since General Winder, the commandant, was dead, the cry for expiation began to focus on Captain Wirz, who had been in charge of affairs within the stockade. On May 7, 1865, the accused was arrested and brought to Washington, where a military tribunal placed him on trial, convicted and sentenced him to death. Among the 160 witnesses summoned to testify were Fathers Hamilton and Whelan. Hamilton described conditions in the prison, but both priests said that Wirz had even seemed anxious to have their services. He had received them with kindness and had always given them the necessary passes without restrictions. They testified under oath that, although Wirz used profane language and occasionally spoke harshly to some of the prisoners, they had not seen him inflict any personal harm that caused death, nor had they heard of such injury. Whelan added that it was highly probable that during his four months there he would have heard of any violence had it occurred. It seems that Whelan regarded Wirz as merely a symbolic scapegoat, made to pay for all the suffering endured by the citizens and soldiers of the North during the war. During the trial, Wirz, a Catholic, asked that Hamilton and Whelan be allowed to visit him. When they saw his broken condition, they appealed, unsuccessfully, that he be granted a few days rest from the harsh trial, which had already dragged on for more than two months. In spite of their positive testimony, along with that of many ex-prisoners, Captain Wirz was executed by hanging. He was the only officer in the Civil War executed for war crimes.  Final days  On March 10, 1866, Whelan became ill with a severe attack of \\"congestion of the lungs.\\" Before this outbreak he had written to Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, asking for $400 to pay back his loan from Henry Horne to procure bread for the Federal prisoners. Horne, who was very sick himself, needed the money. Stanton replied late in October, asking for sworn vouchers and bills of purchase for the wheat flour. The priest told Stanton to keep the money because he had, \\"neither the health nor the strength ...to run over Georgia to hunt up vouchers and bills of purchase.\\" Unable to make any headway, the priest informed the Secretary that the \\"good God\\" had provided him with another way to repay this debt. Because of his worsening lung condition, his doctors had recommended that he go north to escape the humid air. His friends in Savannah provided him with the necessary funds in order to make the trip to New York. Instead, the priest informed Stanton that, preferring justice to health, he used the money he had been given to refund Mr. Horne. When his health improved slightly, Whelan became pastor of St. Patrick's in Savannah and served there until 1868. He was never his former self, however. The cathedral register in Savannah shows that Whelan administered his last baptism on January 15, 1871. Two weeks later he took a bad turn, and his imminent death was announced. The priest received the sacraments, and died a little after five o'clock on the evening of Monday, February 6, 1871, at the age of sixty-nine.  Funeral  The Savannah Evening News described the funeral procession four days later as the longest ever seen in the city and added that seldom was so large a gathering of people found in the streets of Savannah. The Mass began at 10 a.m. where Whelan's body rested in a splendid iron casket, ornamented with full-size silver roses. A wreath of laurel, emblematic of his devotion to the South, was placed at the coffin's head. Eighty-six carriages and buggies escorted the body through the crowded avenues to the Catholic cemetery. People from all over the city turned out to bid farewell to this beloved priest, including many non-Catholics. Colonel Olmstead led members from the old garrison, followed by various religious societies and Irish organization.  References  Sources  * Rev. Peter J.

Biography=Early life Sergei Shtemenko was born to a peasant family in the village of Uryupinsk. His original surname was Shtemenkov with the suffix \\"-ov\\" like other local people, but after the death of his father, his mother changed the surname to Ukrainian style: Shtemenko. Shtemenko volunteered for the Red Army at 1926. In 1930 he joined the Communist Party, and he graduated from the Anti-Aircraft School in Sevastopol at the same year. After several years in the Artillery, he moved to the Armored Corps, completing his studies in the Mechanization and Motorization Academy in 1937. He commanded a tank regiment until September 1938, when he was summoned to the General Staff Academy.Sergei Shtemenko entry in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, translated to English. In late August 1939, with other cadets, Shtemenko was assigned as a staff officer to the Soviet forces preparing for the Invasion of Poland, and took part in the operation. During the Soviet-Finnish War he served as an assistant in the General Staff. After matriculating from the Academy at autumn 1940, Shtemenko's request to be transferred to the new Tank Corps was rejected and he was posted as an aide to General Mikhail Sharokhin, a department chief in the Operations Directorate. World War II In August 1941, soon after the German invasion, Shtemenko was appointed as Sharokhin's deputy, an office he held until after the Battle of Moscow, when he was assigned as chief of the Near East department. As such, Shtemenko monitored the conditions of the Soviet troops stationed in the recently occupied Iran. In June 1942, he replaced Sharokhin as the department chief. Shtemenko took part in the operational planning of the Battles for Crimea, the Caucasus and Stalingrad. In May 1943, he was promoted to be the chief of the Operations Directorate, serving directly under Marshal Alexander Vasilevsky. In November of that year he escorted Stalin to the Tehran Conference. During February and March 1944, Shtemenko served as the Stavka representative in the 2nd Baltic Front during the campaign to relieve the Siege of Leningrad. During the Spring of 1944, he toured between the different fronts fighting in Belarus and coordinated their operations.Sergei Shtemenko on VIF2.ru. After the German surrender, Shtemenko was among the organizers of the Victory Parade. In August 1945, he took part in the planning of the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War.Seweryn Bialer, Stalin and his Generals, Westview Press, 1984, . Post-war career In April 1946 Shtemenko was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief of the General Staff. In November 1948, the 41-year-old Shtemenko was made a Chief of the General Staff and the Deputy Minister of Defence.

However, Shtemenko again fell out of grace after Zhukov was removed as Defense Minister, and was demoted again to Lieutenant General in 1957. He was sent to occupy the position of deputy commander of the Volga Military District. Shtemenko slowly regained his status. In June 1962 he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Ground Forces, and in April 1964 he became Chief of the Main Organizational-Mobilization Department of the General Staff. In August 1968 he was promoted to be the Chief of Combined Staff of the Warsaw Pact under the Pact's forces Supreme Commander Marshal Ivan Yakubovsky, and granted the rank of Army General once more.

In geometry, a Cartesian oval, named after Ren√© Descartes, is a plane curve, the set of points that have the same linear combination of distances from two fixed points. Definition Let and be fixed points in the plane, and let and denote the Euclidean distances from these points to a third variable point . Let and be arbitrary real numbers. Then the Cartesian oval is the locus of points S satisfying . The two ovals formed by the four equations and are closely related; together they form a quartic plane curve called the ovals of Descartes. Special cases In the equation , when and the resulting shape is an ellipse. In the limiting case in which P and Q coincide, the ellipse becomes a circle. When m = a/\\\\text{d}(P,Q) it is a lima√ßon of Pascal. If m = -1 and 0 the equation gives a branch of a hyperbola and thus is not a closed oval. Polynomial equation The set of points satisfying the quartic polynomial equation : [(1-m^2)(x^2 + y^2) + 2m^2 cx + a^2 - m^2 c^2]^2 = 4a^2 (x^2+y^2) where is the distance \\\\text{d}(P,Q) between the two fixed foci and , forms two ovals, the sets of points satisfying the two of the four equations : \\\\operatorname d(P,S) \\\\pm m \\\\operatorname d(Q,S) = a \\\\, : \\\\operatorname d(P,S) \\\\pm m \\\\operatorname d(Q,S) = -a \\\\, that have real solutions. The two ovals are generally disjoint, except in the case that or belongs to them. At least one of the two perpendiculars to through points and cuts this quartic curve in four real points; it follows from this that they are necessarily nested, with at least one of the two points and contained in the interiors of both of them.. For a different parametrization and resulting quartic, see Lawrence.. Applications in optics As Descartes discovered, Cartesian ovals may be used in lens design. By choosing the ratio of distances from and to match the ratio of sines in Snell's law, and using the surface of revolution of one of these ovals, it is possible to design a so-called aplanatic lens, that has no spherical aberration.. Additionally, if a spherical wavefront is refracted through a spherical lens, or reflected from a concave spherical surface, the refracted or reflected wavefront takes on the shape of a Cartesian oval. The caustic formed by spherical aberration in this case may therefore be described as the evolute of a Cartesian oval.. History The ovals of Descartes were first studied by Ren√© Descartes in 1637, in connection with their applications in optics. These curves were also studied by Newton beginning in 1664. One method of drawing certain specific Cartesian ovals, already used by Descartes, is analogous to a standard construction of an ellipse by stretched thread. If one stretches a thread from a pin at one focus to wrap around a pin at a second focus, and ties the free end of the thread to a pen, the path taken by the pen, when the thread is stretched tight, forms a Cartesian oval with a 2:1 ratio between the distances from the two foci. However, Newton rejected such constructions as insufficiently rigorous.. He defined the oval as the solution to a differential equation, constructed its subnormals, and again investigated its optical properties.. The French mathematician Michel Chasles discovered in the 19th century that, if a Cartesian oval is defined by two points and , then there is in general a third point on the same line such that the same oval is also defined by any pair of these three points. James Clerk Maxwell rediscovered these curves, generalized them to curves defined by keeping constant the weighted sum of distances from three or more foci, and wrote a paper titled Observations on Circumscribed Figures Having a Plurality of Foci, and Radii of Various Proportions. An account of his results, titled On the description of oval curves, and those having a plurality of foci, was written by J.D. Forbes and presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1846, when Maxwell was at the young age of 14 (almost 15)..The Scientific Letters and Papers of James Clerk Maxwell, Edited by P.M.

Early life Nickerson was born on a farm near Coldspring in San Jacinto County, Texas on January 26, 1879, the son of William Nickerson and Emma Poole. After graduating from high school, he attended Bishop College in Marshall, Texas where he studied economics. Later he received a teacher's certificate at Prairie View Industrial and Normal School (later Prairie View A&M; University) in Prairie View, Texas and subsequently taught public school for four years in San Jacinto County. Career On April 15, 1905, a chance encounter would forever change his life. On his way to breakfast, Nickerson passed a well-lit and inviting restaurant. Because of segregation, it was restricted to whites only. Instead, Nickerson was forced to eat in a dimly lit, unsanitary restaurant with poor service that catered to African Americans. He wondered if there were any modern facilities that could be patronized by blacks. His thoughts were interrupted by a man who offered Nickerson the opportunity to become an insurance agent. Nickerson accepted the job, which was as an underwriter for the Dallas-based Southern Mutual Benefit Association, an insurance company. After a slow, but steady increase in clients, Nickerson became one of the top agents at the company. However, when Southern Mutual was taken over by American National Insurance of Galveston, Texas, this disrupted the firm which prompted Nickerson to consider another career. He took and passed the civil service examination to become a mail carrier. Despite the encouragement of his wife to take advantage of the relative security of civil service, Nickerson instead chose to continue with insurance, which by now had become a passion for him. Unfortunately, a labor dispute developed between management and the agents at the re-organized company. As a result, Nickerson and several other agents at the firm decided that greater opportunities were to be gained outside of the company. On July 1, 1908, Nickerson left Southern Mutual. He along with J. B. Grisby, Forrest T. Perkins, London Franks, W. H. Parker and C. H. Green received a charter from the state of Texas to form the American Mutual Benefit Association. Their offices were located at 409¬Ω Milam Street in Houston, Texas. Nickerson served as secretary of the new company. W. B. Cogle served as president, Perkins as vice president, and Franks as treasurer of American Mutual. Their company aggressively sold \\"fraternal\\" insurance to Texas blacks and quickly grew to one of the largest black-owned businesses west of the Mississippi. In the wake of American Mutual's success, American National sued them because of the similarity in their names and also because they were not operating under the fraternal system as their charter stipulated. As a result, Nickerson and the other officers were called before the insurance commissioner. The night before the meeting, Nickerson drafted a formal ritual for policyholders to comply with the requirement that they be a \\"lodge\\" or fraternal order. The Department of Insurance ruled in American Mutual's favor on both counts, but the incident caused Nickerson to re-examine the direction of American Mutual. After extensive research in the law, Nickerson decided that industrial or fraternal insurance schemes were not in the best interests of black insurance firms or their policyholders. Instead, Nickerson advocated the establishment of traditional, whole life insurance policies, but the other officers did not share his enthusiasm. While still working in his capacity at American Mutual, Nickerson set up a south Texas office for Standard Life Insurance Company of Atlanta, Georgia, an ordinary life insurance company, recently organized by Herman Edward Perry. This provided Nickerson with valuable experience in whole life insurance and also demonstrated to him the advantages of operating in more than one state. However, when he presented his associates at American Mutual with a proposal to open offices in Oklahoma and California, they were indecisive. Nickerson added publishing to his growing list of enterprises, when he founded the Houston Observer newspaper in 1916. Three years later in a partnership with Clifton H. Richardson and H.F. Edwards established the Informer Publishing Company, which published the Houston Informer newspaper. In the wake of the Longview, Texas Riots of 1919 (and perhaps the Tulsa Riots two years later), Nickerson grew concerned about the racial climate in the Southwest. After members of the Ku Klux Klan allegedly burned a cross in front of his home, he finally moved to Los Angeles and established a branch of the American Mutual Benefit Association. While there Nickerson said he needed a \\"live wire\\" or someone with local connections to get the new branch off of the ground. That person was Norman O. Houston, a young insurance salesman originally from northern California. Houston was made superintendent of agents, who supervised three young men who were recently hired as agents. This included George A. Beavers Jr., a Georgia-born businessman. Under Nickerson's leadership, the branch prospered. Despite nearly 40,000 African Americans in California at the time, insurance companies regarded them as either uninsurable or extremely high risk. As a result, the few policies that were written for blacks were done so at exorbitant rates. Nickerson shared his outrage over this blatantly racist policy with Houston and Beavers. In November 1924, when American Mutual chose not to renew its contract with Nickerson, he decided to form his own company. However, the road to starting his own insurance company would not be easy. To obtain a charter from the state of California, Nickerson needed to secure a $15,000 guarantee fund and obtain applicants for five hundred pre- paid life insurance policies that he could not promise to issue. He consulted an attorney, who said he had the solution to his problem, but for a $1,500 fee. Paying the fee was not a viable option, so Nickerson instead invested $27 for a set of law books. For several days, Nickerson studied the intricacies of insurance regulations to uncover a law that was sufficiently flexible to accommodate his situation. The resourceful Nickerson found a loophole in the law that would solve his problem. He proposed to the Department of Insurance, that he would issue \\"certificates of contribution\\" to his subscribers instead of stock certificates, which were not allowed for a mutual company. This had never been done before. While there was no law specifically authorizing it, there was also no law forbidding it. With the assistance of an actuary named John H. Upton, the California Department of Insurance approved the plan. However, several additional hurdles had to be overcome including a move by the California Legislature to increase the financial requirements for a mutual life insurance company. Nickerson met every challenge and on February 24, 1925, the articles of incorporation were filed for the Golden State Guarantee Fund Insurance Company. Starting in a small one-room office at 1435 Central Avenue, the initial officers of Golden State were Nickerson (president), Beavers (vice president) and Houston (secretary/treasurer). Under Nickerson's leadership, the firm expanded throughout California, Texas and Illinois. By the time of his death in 1945, the company, now known as Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company was the seventh largest black insurance firm in the United States and the largest black-owned business west of the Mississippi. The Political Graveyard shows that William Nickerson Jr. was a candidate for presidential elector on the Republican ticket of Dewey-Bricker in 1944. Death Nickerson died from pneumonia complicated by a heart condition. He was 66 years old. Personal In 1906, Nickerson married the former Bertha B. Benton of Carthage, Texas.

Early life He was born in Cheltenham in 1924, the son of a clerk on the Great Western Railway. He won a scholarship to Pembroke College, Oxford and graduated in Engineering Science in 1944. Career=Bristol Engines He joined the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1944 and was put to work on stress calculations of the Theseus engine. In 1946 he was entrusted with the design of the Olympus engine, which performed flawlessly on its very first test bed run, largely as a result of the discipline that Gordon Lewis brought to its design. [See Pegasus The Heart of the Harrier, by Andrew Dow.] The Olympus was later developed to power the Avro Vulcan, TSR-2 and Concorde. He was given responsibility for compressor design generally, and among other projects worked on transonic compressors, this being well ahead of equivalent work in America. He also examined the virtues of two-spool engines with contra-rotating spools, and hypersonic designs. In 1956 he was asked to comment upon the proposal made by Michel Wibault for a Vertical takeoff fighter powered by an engine of Wibault's conception, using vectored thrust. Gordon Lewis simplified and lightened the design, incorporating axial compressors and pairs of rotatable nozzles for the cold and hot gas streams. This was evolved into the BE53/2, later named the Pegasus. The master patents for this engine were in the names of Michel Wibault and Gordon Lewis. The Pegasus powered, successively, the Hawker P.1127, Kestrel, Harrier and Harrier II. It remains in service with the US Marine Corps. Pegasus engine Rolls-Royce Gordon Lewis spent some years as Managing Director of Turbo-Union, which developed the Turbo-Union RB199 engine for the Panavia Tornado. His patented devices cover a forty-year span, and he remained active in many aspects of turbine engine work well into the 21st century.Andrew Dow, Pegasus: The Heart of the Harrier.

Project is planned upstream from Birnin Kebbi to Argungu The Zauro polder project is an irrigation scheme that has long been planned for the Rima River floodplain in Kebbi State, Nigeria. The project is controversial, and would demand careful management to achieve the planned benefits. Location Kebbi State is mainly covered by Sudanian Savanna, open woodland with scattered trees. It is intersected by the lowlands of the Rima and Niger rivers, which are seasonally flooded. There is a wet season between May and September, with little rain in the remainder of the year. Mean annual rainfall is about . Average temperatures are about , ranging from between April and June. Dams and irrigation schemes have often been proposed to make the abundant water of the rainy season available for farming in the dry season. Plan The project was originally conceived in 1969 as a joint venture between the state government and the federal ministry of agriculture and water resources. The dam would be situated in the floodplain of the Rima River between Argungu and Birnin Kebbi, irrigating of farmland. Crops would include rice, maize, wheat, barley and vegetables such as cow peas, onions, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and Irish potatoes. The dam would also benefit the fishing industry, important in the state. The project would include construction of a reservoir and canals used to irrigate and drain polders, areas of farmland protected from flooding by dikes. After a review of the original design, it was changed to reduce water loss from evaporation in the dry season, and also reduce costs, by replacing the open channels with an aquifer recharge system, using wells to draw water from the aquifer for irrigation. The risk of damage from flooding would be mitigated by the Goronyo Dam upstream in Sokoto State, which would also provide water in the dry season. There have been repeated delays. A July 1995 report noted that the project was in \\"standstill\\" status. In March 2003, while campaigning for reelection in Birnin Kebbi, President Olusegun Obasanjo pledged to complete the project. In October 2006 the Federal and Kebbi state governments signed a memorandum of understanding for execution of the project, at an estimated cost of N15 billion. In May 2008 President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua ordered work to start immediately on the first phase of the project, which was now estimated to cost over N18.5 billion. In January 2009 Kebbi State governor Sa'idu Dakingari said work would soon commence. Pilot project A pilot project was inaugurated in 1982 covering 100 hectares in the northern part of Birnin Kebbi. A study of the project issued in 2009 stated that conditions have steadily deteriorated during the project lifetime, with water-logging causing loss of productive farmland due to salinity and alkalinity. The causes include lack of site leveling to allow outflow of surface water, poor maintenance of drains and canals and over-irrigation by farmers. These issues would have to be addressed for the full project to succeed. In 2000 the Federal Ministry of Water Resources said that it was planning to rehabilitate the pilot project. An audit of Federal Government accounts for the year 2007 showed that a 2002 contract worth almost N84 million with 25% advance payment had been awarded for rehabilitation of the dikes and drainage. However, the project seemed to have been abandoned after payment of the mobilization fee. Controversy In July 2008, over 1,000 farmers protesting the siting of the project tried to lynch the Kebbi State Deputy Governor, Alhaji Ibrahim Aliyu and the Emir of Argungu, Alhaji Samaila Mera at the Emir's palace. One concern is that the reservoir will flood the area where the Argunga fishing festival is held, an important source of income from tourists. There were threats to disrupt to 2009 Argunga fishing festival, but the Emir promised to provide a solution after the festival was held. When none was forthcoming, the people of Argunga started throwing stones at the Emir whenever they saw him. Some farmers are concerned that the project will flood their farmland, although they have been assured that they will be paid compensation and helped to relocate. Others blame resistance on fear of the unknown, and are confident that the project will improve agricultural productivity, saying they are confident that the government is doing the right thing. Conflicts over irrigation and flood control projects such as the Zauro polder project are unavoidable. Farmers with low-lying fields want less flooding while farmers higher up want more. Fishermen want early flooding, farmers want later flooding and pastoralists want an early dry season so they can access grazing lands. With proper management, these problems can be solved.

World War I service Born in 1892, from 1898 to 1912, Appler attended the elementary and advanced training school in Urphertshofen in Middle Franconia. In 1912 he joined the 10th \\"King\\" infantry regiment of the Bavarian Army and fought in the First World War from August 1914 to 1918, where he took part as a platoon leader and received several war awards. In 1920 he was released from the Reichswehr and from 1922 to 1935 worked as a Reich finance officer. Also, until 1928 as a customs officer in the border service, then as a tax secretary in the Gunzenhausen revenue service. Joining the Nazi Party Between 1925 and 1928 Appler was a member of the V√∂lkisch-Social Bloc, a right-wing electoral alliance in post World War I Germany. On August 1, 1928, he joined the Nazi Party (membership number 95.219) and took over the leadership of the Gunzenhausen group in the Gau Franconia region until 1930. He headed the Nazi Party's district of Gunzenhausen until 1932, then the district there until November 1940. He was also Gauredner (Speaker) of the party and a member of the SA in the rank of a storm leader. In 1931 Appler founded the SS-group in Gunzenhausen and was its commander as Untersturmf√ºhrer. On January 21, 1933, Appler moved into the Reichstag for politician Wilhelm Stegmann, who had left the parliament. He retained his mandate even after the Nazis seized power in that year, until the end of the war. Already honorary second mayor of Gunzenhausen since April 28, 1933, Appler became first mayor on October 1, 1935 and remained so until April 1945. Escape, later life and death According to documents from the central office in Ludwigsburg, Appler managed to escape to Spain in 1945, from where he left for Cairo, Egypt in 1946. There he converted to Islam and lived under the name Salah Chaffar. After returning to Germany, he was charged with breaching the peace in September 1949 and sentenced to six months in prison, presumably for his significant participation in the Kristallnacht of 1938. Two further criminal proceedings ended in November 1949 and September 1950 with acquittals. Appler lived in Gunzenhausen until his death on December 21, 1978.

He was a close companion to Cornelius Jansen and corresponded with Ren√© Descartes. Life Meteorologicorum libri sex, 1627 Froidmont was educated by the Jesuits in his native Haccourt, near Li√®ge, and studied philosophy in Louvain at the Falcon college. He became friends with Jansenius but did not pursue his studies and instead went to teach first at Antwerp and later back at Louvain. As a young professor there he was excited about Galileo's discoveries and introduced them to his students. His scientific interests led him to publish on physics and mathematics. Acknowledging him as an authority on meteors, Descartes sent him his Discourse on the Method, which Froidmont received rather critically. The scientific revolution may have been underway but Froidmont, who was well informed on many scientific matters, kept a traditionalist Aristotelian view. Nevertheless, he sought to co-opt rather than reject new approaches.Davide Cellamare, and Paul J.J.M. Bakker, Libertus Fromondus' Christian Psychology: Medicine and Natural Philosophy in the 'Philosophia christiana de anima', (1649), Lias, 42:1 (2015), pp. 37-66. While teaching philosophy he also started studying theology and obtained a doctorate in 1628. Meanwhile, he had become close to Jansenius who entrusted him with the posthumous publication of the Augustinus. Froidmont succeeded him in the chair of Scripture at Louvain.
