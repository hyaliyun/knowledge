SCO42944 in Scotland) based in London, England, that promotes literacy. It was founded by Sir Simon Hornby, former chairman of the major national retail chain, WHSmith PLC. Its current Chief Executive is Jonathan Douglas. The charity campaigns to make literacy a priority for politicians and parents, supports children and families to improve their literacy skills and conducts research on issues relating to literacy. It also works with teachers, literacy professionals and librarians, and establishes literacy projects in disadvantaged communities across the UK. Since 1993, the National Literacy Trust has raised over ¬£10million from the business sector to support its work, and has directly worked with 2 million children. The National Literacy Trust is based in Vauxhall in the London Borough of Lambeth. History of the National Literacy Trust The idea for a charity specifically promoting literacy emerged after Sir Simon Hornby became aware, in his capacity as a trustee for the British Dyslexia Association, of the ‚Äúhighly fragmented approach to literacy in the UK, which had a direct impact on the effectiveness of programmes directed at people with dyslexia at all ages‚Äù. With encouragement from his fellow trustees, Sir Simon commissioned research from the public relations department of WHSmith into the need for a national literacy agency. After a year of interviews with educational specialists, government officials, and the statutory and voluntary agencies whose work had a literacy component, the study‚Äôs conclusion was unequivocal: ‚ÄúNo agency existed whose specific remit was to promote the issue of literacy, in its many social, political and cultural dimensions, to stimulate new literacy initiatives, and to promote public awareness of the significance of the issue and of practical means to improve literacy standards in all age groups‚Äù.Needs verification Along with Usha Prashar (now Baroness Prashar of Runnymede), Sir Simon worked to establish the core objectives of the new organisation and to secure the voluntary funding necessary for the first years of its operation. Following pledges of core funding from WHSmith PLC, from Pearson PLC and from Book Tokens PLC, Sir Simon pushed for the formal establishment of a new charitable organisation, the National Literacy Trust. The National Literacy Trust was legally registered as a charity on 19 November 1992 by Sir Simon.The Charity Commission for England and Wales http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ Its strategic remit was to ‚Äúadvance public education in Reading, Writing and other literacy skills‚Ä¶ and to cooperate and collaborate with voluntary bodies and statutory authorities operating in similar charitable fields and to exchange information and advice‚Äù. Following an extensive selection process, Neil McClelland was appointed to the role of full-time Director in September 1993, in time for the press launch of the charity in October 1993. At the end of 2006 Neil McClelland retired from his position as Director and was succeeded by Jonathan Douglas in January 2007. Douglas was previously Head of Policy Development at the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, where he also worked as Head of Learning and Access. He had also worked as a librarian and in children‚Äôs services for Westminster Libraries. Douglas is on the Advisory Committee of the Man Booker Prize and the Chair of Governors at his local primary school. Campaigning work The National Literacy Trust campaigns to improve public understanding of the vital importance and impact of literacy. The charity is the secretariat of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Literacy which launched in 2011. As the secretariat, the charity holds meetings and runs commissions that address major policy issues and profile literacy among key policymakers. The National Literacy Trust also convenes the National Literacy Forum, a group of voluntary and community sector organisations who meet twice a year to discuss key literacy policy themes and joint projects. The National Literacy Trust also runs a number of targeted campaigns in specific local areas, known as National Literacy Trust Hubs. National Literacy Trust Hubs bring together local partners to tackle literacy issues in communities across the UK where low levels of literacy are seriously impacting on people‚Äôs lives. The charity currently has six active National Literacy Trust Hubs: in Bradford, Peterborough, Middlesbrough, Nottingham, Swindon and Stoke-on-Trent. Research The National Literacy Trust conducts its own research into literacy attitudes, habits and skills across the UK. The charity runs an annual literacy survey into the attitudes towards reading and writing of eight to 18 year olds across the UK, from which most of its research reports are created. In 2017, 47,786 schoolchildren across the UK took part in the survey. Research produced from the annual literacy survey has examined issues including book ownership and reading outcomes, the link between literacy and life expectancy and reading enjoyment. Programme delivery The National Literacy Trust runs a number of projects and networks and works with a range of professionals to deliver support for the development of literacy skills. Working with schools, nurseries, libraries and football clubs, it runs a number of initiatives to motivate and inspire more reluctant readers, as well as a book-gifting programme, the Young Readers Programme, which targets children, young people and their families in disadvantaged areas and has been running since 1997. Working with the Premier League, the National Literacy Trust has run the Premier League Reading Stars programme since 2003, which gets reluctant readers interested in books and literacy using football as inspiration. Premier League players share their favourite books and deliver online literacy tasks for pupils to complete. The programme now forms part of the Premier League Primary Stars initiative, and the National Literacy Trust also runs a number of other sport-based programmes.

His mother, A.A. Hanson (Leeds College of Art), is a potter and former art teacher. He sang in a church choir (St. Edmund's, Roundhay, c.1980). After schools in Leeds and York, he moved from home at age 17, holding happenings in the basement of a shared house in the Harehills area of Leeds. Around the same time he attended courses with the National Youth Theatre and performed in productions at Leeds University Workshop Theatre. His first exhibited work (photo montages) shown at Leeds City Art Gallery in a group display about new surrealism. He left the formal education system early (after a brief period at a local arts college) and moved to London in 1989. Later that year he travels to Berlin and witnesses and documents the historic collapse of the Berlin Wall.  1990s work  First published imagery features in i-D magazine (1991) of nightclubbers at a rave. His social and performance based photos appear in various music, scene and listings publications throughout the early to mid '90s, sometimes using the moniker 'Alex Sparks', and form print folios. Appears in a French TV commercial (1993), playing a catwalk photographer, for a Mod's Hair product. He makes film stills and appears in the award-winning short A Smashing Night Out (dir: M. Glamorre, 1994 BBC 10 x 10 series). His photo series includes an early picture of designer Alexander McQueen on the verge of fame, alongside other progressive characters, at a time when London was witnessing the so-called Brit Art Brit Pop cultural explosion. Prints from this period later featured in QueerNation, a large 20th-century group retrospective of polysexual London nightlife (Elms Lesters Painting Rooms, London 2002). Hanson was the only photographer to record performance artist and cultural icon Leigh Bowery's legendary last show at the Freedom Cafe in London in late 1994. Some of the work was later exhibited (including at The Fine Art Society, London 1995) and published, firstly in the 1998 monograph Leigh Bowery Leigh Bowery (Violette Editions, London, 1998) prompting publisher Robert Violette to say that the photographs; \\"represent a crucial, defining moment of London in the 1990s\\". An audio/visual book, featuring collaborations between artists and musicians, We Love You We Love You (Booth Clibborn, Candy Records, London, 1998) shows his photo work, of Bowery's Minty collaborator Richard Torry and his Soho living studio space, alongside that of more established art world figures such as Gilbert & George, Tracey Emin and Marc Quinn. He sometimes performs with The Offset and The Paper People collectives, often singing a song about a 'side kick' Susan Tripod, first in shows in his kitchen and at LUX Centre London, 1998. Drawings based on aerial photos turned into island maps, with related travel ephemera, are displayed at Vexed Generation in Soho (London, April 1999).  2000's  A collaborative venture Alexcalledsimon projects forms to produce and present work based around a concept 'photo-related family' of made up characters and scenarios. These performance and mixed media works and recordings are exhibited, form part of live events, web based videos, screenings and in publications.

A boyhood friend, and later political adversary, of Joseph Stalin, he is primarily known for his book Stalin und die Trag√∂die Georgiens (\\"Stalin and the Tragedy of Georgia', Berlin, 1932), the first memoir of Stalin's childhood.  Biography  Both Stalin and Iremashvili grew up in Gori, Georgia (then part of the Tiflis Governorate, Imperial Russia), where they attended a local church school. Later, they studied together at Tiflis Theological Seminary. A member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, Iremashvili was involved in the revolutionary activities in Transcaucasia and joined the Menshevik faction which quickly became a dominant political force in Georgia. After 1917, he worked as a teacher at Tiflis and was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Georgia in 1919. In February 1921, the Soviet Russian Red Army invaded Georgia and put an end to its three-year independence. Iremashvili, like several other Georgian Mensheviks, was placed in the Metekhi prison, but was then released through the efforts of his sister who negotiated with Stalin during his visit to Tiflis in July 1921. In October 1921, sixty-two arrested Mensheviks, including Iremashvili, were deported to Germany where he was granted a political asylum. Having settled in Berlin, he engaged in Georgian √©migr√© activities aimed at enlisting Europe‚Äôs support to the Georgian independence cause.  Memoirs  In 1932, he published, in German, his memoirs, Stalin und die Trag√∂die Georgiens (\\"Stalin and the Tragedy of Georgia\\"). Published in emigration and immune to Soviet censure, the book, although hostile to Stalin, is considered the only independent contemporary account of Stalin's youth and his early years in Georgia, and has proven a vital source for Stalin biographers. In his memoirs, Iremashvili relates many details of the Gori life of Soso (Stalin's childhood name), with particular emphasis of his brutal treatment at the hands of his father, Vissarion Dzhugashvili. The primary deduction made by Iremashvili based upon his account was followed by several psychobiographers, most notably by Gustav Bychowski and Daniel Rancour-Lafferiere, which consider beatings the key psychological determination of the future dictator.Suny, Ronald Grigor (Spring, 1991), Beyond Psychohistory: The Young Stalin in Georgia. Slavic Review, Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 48-58. Iremashvili also reports that the young Stalin voluntarily terminated his studies at the Seminary, and was not expelled for his revolutionary activity as stated in the Soviet leader‚Äôs official biography. In addition, he claims that Soso‚Äôs parents were ethnic Ossetians, thus explaining Stalin‚Äôs particularly hard-line policy towards independent Georgia and his excessive harshness in suppressing anti-Soviet opposition in the Georgian SSR in the 1920s.

The group did not despair of returning to television following the failure of its first trial in 1986 when it joined forces with Publicis, the advertising agency Gilbert Gross, and Gaumont to create the music channel TV6 on the sixth analogue terrestrial network, which appeared in February 1986 and disappeared on Saturday 28 February 1987 at midnight after Jacques Chirac's government cancelled the concession contract signed between the State and the channel for M6.

In 2015, NRJ 12 set out to become a more generalist channel. The channel cut much of its former magazine and reality programming. Hosts like Matthieu Delormeau, Clara Morgane and Cauet were dismissed. New presenters like Benjamin Castaldi, Karima Charni and Val√©rie Damidot were introduced.

He came up with the name by taking his first full name and the last two letters of his last name, coming up with the name ARTGO. The first race was held on September 7, 1975, at the Grundy County Speedway in Morris, Illinois. The inaugural Wayne Carter Classic was won by Tom Reffner. Frigo sold the series to John & Sue McKarns in 1979. In 1998 the McKarns licensed the name to NASCAR and NASCAR took full control of the series. The series went through different name changes with different title sponsors, including the RE/MAX Challenge Series, International Truck & Engine Midwest Series, and finally the AutoZone Elite Division, Midwest Series. Under the NASCAR era, the series had identical rules to three other NASCAR regional series (Northwest, Southeast and Southwest). In 2006, after dwindling car counts and lack of races on the schedule NASCAR finally shut down the AutoZone Elite Division.

The Broadway musicians strike of 2003 resulted in the attempted banning of the technology and the blacklisting of the Bianchi & Smith partnership by the New York Musician‚Äôs Union. In 2004, the British Musician‚Äôs Union threatened to strike over the use of Virtual Orchestra technology in the remount of Les Mis√©rables at the Queen‚Äôs Theater in London‚Äôs West End. The walkout was eventually thwarted when the Musician‚Äôs Union conceded that it could not prevent producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh from using the technology. In 1998, Bianchi co-founded RealTime Music Solutions in New York City. Bianchi‚Äôs Virtual Orchestra work includes over 400,000 performances worldwide and collaborations with Lucent Technologies and Cirque du Soleil. He has been on the music composition faculty of the College-Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati, is currently Professor of Music at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, Director of the Bar Harbor Project Center in Maine, Director of the Glacier National Park Project Center in Montana, and a former member of the faculty at Boston University's Center for Digital Imaging Arts.

This is because the ground loses heat due to radiation. It radiates its heat to the sky/space. When you \\"feel\\" a very cold surface, it is because you are radiating your heat to that cold surface, the cold surface becomes warmer, and you become colder. The amount of heat that radiates is proportional to the difference in temperature between the two objects. At night, the atmosphere is not being warmed by the sun and the sky/space can approach absolute zero (-469 degrees F, -273 degrees Celsius). On a clear night the ground can become colder than the air because it radiates its heat to the sky, and frost can form. Frost and hoar frost Hoar frost In the English language, these terms are sometimes used in a confusing way. For example, frost is used sometimes to indicate ice which forms on the ground during cold nights, but other times to indicate air temperature below freezing point. Hoar frost should be used for any frosted surface but it is sometimes reserved to indicate big ice crystals forming on very cold surfaces. The WMO uses hoar frost in every case.

His brother, Alexander Nikuradse, was also a Germany-based physicist and geopolitician known for his ties with Alfred Rosenberg and for his role in saving many Georgians during World War II. He was born in Samtredia, Georgia (then part of the Kutais Governorate, Imperial Russia) and studied at Kutaisi. In 1919, through the recommendations of the conspicuous Georgian scholar Petre Melikishvili, he went abroad for further studies. The 1921 Sovietization of Georgia precluded his return to homeland and Nikuradse naturalized as a German citizen. As PhD student of Ludwig Prandtl in 1920, he later worked as a researcher at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Flow Research (now the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization). He succeeded in putting himself in Prandtl's favour and thus advanced to the position of department head. In spite of his close ties with the Nazi Party, Nikuradse came, in the early 1930s, under fire of the Institute's National Socialist Factory Cell Organization whose members accused him of spying for the Soviet Union and of stealing books from the institute. Prandtl initially defended Nikuradse, but was eventually forced to dismiss him in 1934. He then served as a professor at the University of Breslau (1934‚Äì1945), and an honorary professor at the Aachen Technical University since 1945. Nikuradse lived mostly in G√∂ttingen and engaged in hydrodynamics. His best known experiment was published in Germany in 1933. Nikuradse carefully measured the friction that a turbulent fluid experiences as it flows through a rough pipe. He used grains of sand with varying roughnesses and discovered that, the rougher the surface the greater the friction, and hence a greater pressure loss. He discovered that: :In range I, for small Reynolds number the resistance factor is the same for rough as for smooth pipes. The projections of the roughening lie entirely within the laminar layer for this range. :In range II (transition range), an increase in the resistance factor was observed for an increasing Reynolds number. The thickness of the laminar layer is here of the same order of magnitude as that of the projections. :In range III, the resistance factor is independent of the Reynolds number (quadratic law of resistance). Here all the projections of the roughening extend through the laminar layer and the resistance factor \\\\lambda . :\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{1}{(1.74+2 log(\\\\frac{r}{k}))^2} References Category:1894 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Collaborators with Nazi Germany from Georgia (country) Category:German physicists Category:Physicists from Georgia (country) ","title":"Johann Nikuradse"},{"id":"10912741","text":"Historical editions form part of a category of printed music, which generally consists of classical music and opera from a past repertory, where the term can apply to several different types of published music. However, it is principally applied to one of three types of music of this sort: * Scholarly or critical editions are music editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the music contained within is as close to the composer's original intentions as possible. Such editions are sometimes called urtext editions. * Collected Works or Complete Works, generally in multi- volume sets, are devoted to a particular composer or to a particular musical repertory. This is sometimes referred to in German as GesamtausgabeLiterally: \\"whole edition\\" when containing the works of one particular composer. * Monuments or Monumental Editions (or the German Denkm√§ler)Literally: \\"memorials\\" when containing a repertory defined by geography, time period, or musical genre.  The origins of historical editions  Up until the 18th century, music performance and distribution centered around current compositions. Even professional musicians rarely were familiar with music written more than a half century before their own time.Moser, p. 7 In the second half of the 18th century, an awakening of interest in the history of music prompted the publication of numerous collections of older music (for example, William Boyce's Cathedral Music, published around 1760-63, and Giovanni Battista Martini's Esemplare, ossia Saggio... di contrappunto, published around 1774-5).Sydney Robinson Charles, \\"Editions, Historical\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy. Accessed 17 April 2007 Around the same time, the proliferation of pirated editions of music by popular composers (such as Haydn and Mozart) prompted respected music publishers to embark on \\"oeuvres complettes,\\" intended as uniform editions of the entire musical output of these composers. Unfortunately, many of these early complete works projects were never finished.Lang, p. 337 In the 19th century, the emergence of romantic hero worship of composers, sometimes described as the \\"cult of genius,\\" fired the enthusiasm for Complete Works series for important composers.Lang, p. 377. The development of the academic field of musicology also contributed to an interest in more accurate and well-researched editions of musical works. Finally, the rise of Nationalism within music circles influenced the creation of Monumental Editions devoted to geographical regions, such as Denkm√§ler deutscher Tonkunst begun in 1892 and Denkm√§ler der Tonkunst in √ñsterreich begun in 1894.  Editing historical editions  In creating a scholarly or critical edition, an editor examines all available versions of the given piece (early musical sketches, manuscript versions, publisher‚Äôs proof copies, early printed editions, and so on) and attempts to create an edition that is as close to the composer‚Äôs original intentions as possible. Editors use their historical knowledge, analytical skills, and musical understanding to choose what one hopes is the most accurate version of the piece. More recent scholarly editions often include footnotes or critical reports describing discrepancies between differing versions, or explaining appropriate performance practice for the time period. In general, editing music is a much more challenging endeavor than editing text-based works of literature, as musical notation can be imprecise, musical handwriting can be difficult to decipher, and first or early printed editions of pieces often contained mistakes.James Grier, \\"Editing\\" in Grove Music Online Accessed 24 April 2007 By comparison, what are known as performers‚Äô editions do not rely on a thorough examination of all known sources, and often purposely include extraneous markings not written by the composer (dynamics, articulation marks, bowing indications, fingerings, and so on) to aid a musician playing from that score. Scholarly or critical editions=Opera For information on critical editions of operatic works, see critical edition (opera) Collected Works or Complete Works  The German music publisher Breitkopf & H√§rtel initiated many of the earliest complete works series of major composers. A few of these include: * Johann Sebastian Bach: Werke (1851-1900; supplemental volume [revised edition of The Art of Fugue] 1926) * George Frideric Handel: Werke (1858-1902) * Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina: Werke (1862-1907) * Ludwig van Beethoven: Werke (1862‚Äì65, supplemental volume 1888) * Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy: Werke (1874-1877) * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Werke (1877-1883, supplements until 1910) Many of these early complete works series were edited by music scholars or composers famous in their own right, such as Johannes Brahms, Guido Adler, Julius Rietz, Friedrich Chrysander, and others. After the upheavals of World War I and World War II, which slowed the output of musical scholarship and publishing, renewed activity led to many new series as well as to a reassessment of the older complete works series. New techniques in photographic and other types of reproduction allowed scholars to consult many more early sources, either in microfilm or facsimile copies. Entirely new series were published for several major composers for whom complete works sets already existed. These updated editions incorporated new scholarship in their editing and allowed for a broader definition of complete works, often including early versions of pieces, sketches, and so on.Charles, Grove Music Online. Many of these new series have been published by the German music publisher B√§renreiter, and include: * Bach: Neue Bach-Ausgabe (1954-) * Handel: Hallische H√§ndel-Ausgabe (1955-) * Mozart: Neue Mozart-Ausgabe (1955-) In addition to the reworking of older Complete Works series, many new series have been initiated for composers not previously featured in this way. Some examples include: * Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek: Complete Critical Edition (1978-) * Edward Elgar: Elgar Complete Edition (1981-) * Alban Berg: S√§mtliche Werke (1984-) * Claude Debussy: Oeuvres compl√®tes (1985-) * Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach: The Complete Works (2005-) * Johann Christian Bach: Collected Works (1984‚Äì99) It would be impossible to list here all of the new Complete Works series that have been initiated in the last century. Some of the major publishers of these series include Breitkopf & H√§rtel, B√§renreiter, Stainer & Bell, and G. Henle Verlag. Monuments or Monumental Editions Many of the early Monumental Editions were devoted to geographic regions, and often had the support of their respective governments. For example, the series Denkm√§ler deutscher Tonkunst,Literally: Memorials of German Musical Art begun in 1892 by a group of German musicians that included Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim, and Philipp Spitta, was supported by the German government. Examples of other monumental editions (still ongoing) include: * Samfundet til udgivelse af dansk musik (1872-) * Denkm√§ler der Tonkunst in √ñsterreich (1894-) * Monumenta Musicae Belgicae (1932-) * Music of the United States of America (1988-) Some recent projects include not only those focusing on geographic regions, but also many devoted to particular time periods or repertory, such as: * Monumenta Musicae Byzantinae (1935-) * Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century (1956‚Äì58) * Recent Researches in Music (1962-) * Italian Opera, 1640-1770 (1977-) It would be impossible to list all of the Monumental Editions currently ongoing. Several of the major publishers of these series include the American Institute of Musicology, A-R Editions, B√§renreiter, Istituto Italiano per la Storia della Musica, Instituto Espa√±ol de musicologia, √âditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre, and others. Characteristics of complete works and monumental editions Publication of these multi-volume series is usually spread over many years, sometimes decades. Depending on the financial state of the publisher, some projected sets are never finished, and some sets are taken over by other publishers. There are often different editors for individual volumes, with a general editor or committee of editors to oversee the entire series. Complete Works series are often organized by genre, for example grouping all symphonies together, or all piano sonatas. Several of the complete works sets have complicated, multi-tiered systems for numbering the volumes. Monumental Editions have varying organizational schemes, but several of them include numerous sub-series, some of which are devoted to the music of single composers. These publications are often sponsored by musicological research bodies or by civic organizations. Many of these endeavors also value international cooperation, creating editorial boards that include scholars from various countries.Lang, p. 380.  Finding pieces within historical edition sets  Finding a particular piece of music within one of these multi- volume sets can often be difficult, as many of the series do not have general indices. For pieces within a composer's complete works set, researchers often consult the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (Second Edition, 2001), either online or in its printed version. Articles on composers will list the title and publisher of any complete works sets that exist, and within the list of compositions by that composer, will include volume numbers of the complete works set in which each piece is found. To find pieces within older Monumental Editions, the best resource is still the 3rd edition of Anna Harriet Heyer's Historical Sets, Collected Editions, and Monuments of Music: A Guide to their Content, published in 1980. A more up to date description of newer complete works and monumental edition sets can be found in the work of George Hill and Norris Stephens, but there is no index to find individual pieces. An online database, called the \\"Index to Printed Music: Collections & Series,\\" is currently underway, but it is accessible by subscription only, and is not yet complete.

Music  Opening of No. 1 The tempo markings of the three pieces are: The first two pieces, dating from February 1909, are often cited as marking the point at which Schoenberg abandoned the last vestiges of traditional tonality, implying the language of common-practice harmony that had been inherent in Western music, in one way or another, for centuries. The functionality of this language, to Schoenberg at least, had by this time become stretched to bursting point in some of the more chromatically-saturated works of Wagner, Mahler, Richard Strauss and indeed some of Schoenberg's own earlier tonal works such as the string sextet Verkl√§rte Nacht, Op. 4 of 1899. Although there are vestigial, superficial remnants of tonal writing, such as lyrical melody, expressive appoggiaturas, and chordal accompaniment, tonal hearing and tonal analysis are difficult to sustain. Nevertheless, at least three attempts at tonal analysis of the first piece have been made, by three respected authorities. One of them says it is in E, another says it is a prolongation of F as the dominant of B, and the third concludes that it is in G. While all three are persuasive in their own way, other keys may also be heard here, but all are insubstantial. Any complete analysis must take these ghostly remnants of tonality into account, but no one key reliably shapes the structure . Atonal analyses of this first piece are also divided in opinion. Allen Forte describes its pitch organisation as \\"straightforward\\" and based on hexachords . George Perle is equally certain that it is constructed instead from three- note \\"intervallic cells\\" . The three pieces are given a unity of atonal musical space through the projection of material from the first piece into the other two, including recurring use of motivic material. The first of the three motivic cells of the first piece is used throughout the second, and the first and third cells are found in the third . The third piece is the most innovative of the three. In its atomisation of the material and its agglomeration of the motivic cells through multiple connections, it isolates its musical parameters (mode of attack, rhythm, texture, register, and agogics) and employs them in a structural though unsystematic manner that foreshadows the integral serialism of the 1950s . This use of the term expression is especially pertinent when applied to the third of the Three Pieces, written in August 1909, whose violent emotional language, juxtaposing extremes of mood and dynamic, can be seen in the context of Schoenberg's other expressionist works of that year such as the last of the Five Orchestral Pieces, Op. 16 and, most revealingly, the monodrama Erwartung. Characteristic of these pieces is a lack of motivic repetition or development and a rejection of traditional notions of balance and cadential, goal-oriented movement, supposedly deferring the musical discourse to a kind of stream-of- consciousness, or subjective, emotional expression. Probably because of this radical abandonment of traditional parameters, Busoni found the third piece rather harder to digest than the first two, and indeed its language does set it apart from its companions somewhat. In likening these developments to contemporary styles in visual art (Schoenberg was himself a painter), notably Kandinsky's, with whom he had contact, the composer tellingly describes painting \\"without architecture ... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods\\" . The violence and suddenness of this emancipation from tradition was influenced by turbulent events in Schoenberg‚Äôs life at the time: his wife Mathilde had recently eloped with the painter Richard Gerstl (who committed suicide when Mathilde returned to her husband), and in the professional sphere, his work was increasingly being met with hostility or incomprehension, as at the premiere of the Second String Quartet in 1908. However, Schoenberg at this time saw no contradiction in pursuing more seemingly traditional projects, such as the orchestration of his hyper- Wagnerian Gurre-Lieder (completed in 1911), bearing out his contention that the new style was, for him, an extension of previous practice, not a rejection of it.

The first recorded bearer was John de Birchall de Birtles in 1401. The surname is less commonly found in other areas of the former British Empire, including Canada and the United States. Only one early migrant to Australia was recorded with this name, a convicted criminal, James Stanley Birchall, a Protestant from Chorley in Lancashire; on 10 April 1851 he was sent to Norfolk Island for committing forgery. The surname is also found in Sussex where it appears to have originated from the village of Billingshurst, where it can be found in the sixteenth century in its original form of Burchfold; this changed to Burchall in the mid-seventeenth century.

He is the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, succeeding Susan Hockfield on July 2, 2012. Reif previously served as the Institute's provost, as the head of MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and as the director of the MIT Microsystems Technology Laboratories. Background Leo Rafael Reif was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela, to Eastern European Jewish parents who immigrated to Venezuela in the late 1930s through Ecuador and Colombia. His father was a photographer, and the family spoke Yiddish and Spanish at home. Education Reif received his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from the Universidad de Carabobo, Valencia, Venezuela in 1973. He then served for a year as an assistant professor at Universidad Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in Caracas. He went to the United States for graduate school, earning his doctorate in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1979. He then spent a year as a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford. Research, teaching, and administration Reif joined the MIT faculty in January 1980 as an assistant professor of electrical engineering. He was promoted to associate professor in 1983, earned tenure in 1985, and became a full professor in 1988. In 2004 he was named the Fariborz Maseeh Professor of Emerging Technology. In 2012, Reif was elected the president of MIT. Before his appointment as Provost in 2005, his research centered on three-dimensional integrated circuit technologies and on environmentally benign microelectronics fabrication. Reif was director of MIT's Microsystems Technology Laboratories, then associate department head for Electrical Engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), MIT's largest academic department, and then served as EECS department head in 2004-2005. An early champion of MIT's engagement in micro- and nanotechnologies, Dr. Reif is the inventor or co-inventor on 13 patents, has edited or co-edited five books and has supervised 38 doctoral theses. As MIT‚Äôs provost, he spearheaded an effort to promote online learning for both on- campus students and learners around the world. The effort paved the way for edX, a massive open online course provider that MIT and Harvard University co- founded in 2012. As of 2020, 24 million unique users have taken a class on edX. Reif was named co-chair of the administration's Advanced Manufacturing Partnership Steering Committee \\"2.0,\\" part of a continuing effort to maintain U.S. leadership in the emerging technologies that will create high-quality manufacturing jobs and enhance America's global competitiveness, on September 26, 2013. To promote innovation in ‚Äútough-tech‚Äù science and engineering fields, in 2015 he presented an idea for an ‚Äúinnovation orchard,‚Äù which would provide the space, mentorship, and bridge-funding for entrepreneurs to turn new science into workable products. The idea became the basis for The Engine, an accelerator aimed at fostering scientific and engineering breakthroughs. In 2018, in response to the ubiquity of computing and the rise of artificial intelligence across disciplines, Reif announced the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing. The College aims to prepare students to harness the power of AI while weighing its ethical and social implications. In 2019, in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's indictment on child sex trafficking and subsequent suicide it came to light that Epstein had contributed over $800,000 to MIT, much of it beginning in 2013 and well after he was convicted of child sex trafficking the first time. In August 2019 Reif ordered an investigation into Epstein's connections with the university.Boston Globe article on Epstein-MIT issues In a September 12, 2019 letter to the MIT community on the institute's website, Reif admitted he signed a 2012 thank you letter to Epstein for a gift to professor Seth Lloyd. In the open letter to the community, Reif said, \\"I apparently signed this letter on August 16, 2012, about six weeks into my presidency. Although I do not recall it, it does bear my signature.\\" On September 18, he explained, \\"Many students have asked how I could have signed that acknowledgment letter without asking questions, and how I could fail to remember it. The answer is simple: I did not recognize the name, and I sign many standard thank-you letters every week. That includes several hundred letters every year thanking individuals for contributions to the Institute.\\" In 2020, Reif announced that MIT will donate $850,000 to four nonprofits that support survivors of sexual abuse. Honors and awards Reif is a fellow of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers, an elected member of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and is a member of Tau Beta Pi and the Electrochemical Society. The Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) awarded him the 2000 Aristotle Award for \\"his commitment to the educational experience of SRC students and the profound and continuing impact he has had on their professional careers.\\" For his work in developing MITx, MIT's initiative in developing free online college courses available to learners anywhere with an Internet connection, which was launched in December 2011, he received the 2012 Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Award. In October 2015, the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation honored him with the Frank E. Taplin, Jr. Public Intellectual Award. In 2015 was recognized as one of the Top 20 Most Influential, Outstanding, Creative and Talented Hispanic professionals working in the US Technology Industry by @CNET @CNET-ES @CBS Interactive.

The Archdiocese of Kampala is the Metropolitan See for the Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical province of Kampala in Uganda. History The present Kampala Archdiocese is the result of territorial changes: * Victoria Nyanza Vicariate (1883). It was established by the Holy See in 1883 and was entrusted to the Missionaries of Africa commonly known as the White Fathers. Rubaga became the seat of the Bishop. * Upper Nile Vicariate (1894). On July 13, 1894, the Holy See erected the Upper Nile Vicariate dividing it from Victoria Nyanza Vicariate and entrusted it to the Mill Hill Missionaries. Nsambya became the seat of the Bishop. The name of Vicariate Nyanza Vicariate was also changed to Vicariate Apostolic of Northern Victoria Nyanza. * Vicariate of Uganda (1915). After the erection of vicariates in territories beyond the Nile on the southern side, the name of Northern Victoria Nyanza Vicariate became the Vicariate of Uganda on January 15, 1915. * Vicariate of Kampala. On June 10, 1948, the name of Upper Nile Vicariate was changed to the Vicariate of Kampala which later became the diocese of Kampala in 1953. * Archdiocese of Rubaga (1953-1966). The Catholic hierarchy in Uganda was established on March 25, 1953. The former Vicariates of Uganda became the dioceses of Uganda. Rubaga became the Archdiocese with 5 suffragan dioceses namely: Gulu, Masaka, Kampala, Mbarara and Tororo * Archdiocese of Kampala (1966-). On August 5, 1966, the Holy See joined together what was part the Diocese of Kampala and the Archdiocese of Rubaga and created the Archdiocese of Kampala. It was covering most parts of Central Uganda. Since, three other new dioceses have been carved out of it: Kiyinda- Mityana (July 17, 1981), Kasana-Luweero (December 16, 1996) and Lugazi (December 16, 1996).

In 1889, the reigning monarch, Mwanga II of Buganda, donated them land on Lubaga Hill itself where they built Saint Mary's Cathedral Rubaga, beginning in 1914 until 1925, with the assistance of monetary contributions from Roman Catholic congregations abroad. The early missionaries had problems pronouncing the word Lubaga. They instead pronounced it with an \\"r\\" as in Rubaga. In Luganda, there is no word that starts with an \\"R\\". (Other Bantu languages from western Uganda and the African Great Lakes Area have words starting with \\"R\\".) Later, the missionaries built a hospital and a nursing school on the hill. Today, Lubaga remains the seat of the headquarters of the Catholic Church in Uganda. It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kampala. The remains of the first African Catholic bishop in Uganda, Bishop Joseph Nakabaale Kiwanuka and those of the first African Catholic Cardinal, Cardinal Emmanuel Kiwanuka Nsubuga are kept in the Catholic Mission on the hill.

Born in Belgrade on 31 January 1956, he has lived in New York City since 1999. Balkan Years Radovan‚Äôs career began at the end of the seventies, when he established Zana, the first Balkan band that successfully combined new wave sound with commercial pop. Helped by keyboardist Zoran ≈Ωivanoviƒá, singer Zana Nimani (his high school girlfriend) and Marina Tucakoviƒá (the most successful lyricist in Yugoslav pop/folk music), Radovan paved the way of commercial success for many other young new wave bands in Yugoslavia. Although Zana‚Äôs first album Lo≈°e vesti uz rege za pivsku fla≈°u was experimental with sound, the second, Dodirni mi kolena, was pop-oriented and sold in over 500,000 copies. Songs from this album are still being covered by contemporary pop-rock bands in the Balkans. Their third album Natrag na voz was another success thanks to the song that topped the charts ‚Äì \\"Jabuke i vino\\": a duo by Zana Nimani and ≈Ωeljko Bebek (singer of Bijelo dugme). After Zana Nimani left the band for a solo career in the mid-eighties, Joviƒáeviƒá and ≈Ωivanoviƒá changed a few female singers, but continued in the same musical directions, adding Balkan ethno elements to their songs. In \\"Vejte snegovi\\" (1987) they collaborated with a legendary folk clarinetist, Boki Milo≈°eviƒá. As a multi-talented artist, together with music composing/producing, Joviƒáeviƒá got involved in the production of Zana‚Äôs music videos. He also composed for the most popular Serbian folk singers and had top chart hits. New York Years Distracted by the Yugoslav political/economic crisis in the nineties and challenged by his international career Joviƒáeviƒá, his wife Gordana, and their son, Nikola, left for New York City in 1999. His American career started in the field of computer animation/web design further developing into a movie soundtrack production. Until then, he had composed music for Bought and Sold (2003), The Meeting (2005), Recalled (2006), And Then Came Love (2007). Working in the movie industry, in 2005 he met actor/musician Manu Narayan. Realizing that they share similar musical ideas, Joviƒáeviƒá and Narayan formed the duo Darunam and soon after published CD All That‚Äôs Beautiful Must Die (2007). Darunam‚Äôs music can be defined as a blend of modern pop sounds and world beats. In their 2010 studio release, Joviƒáeviƒá and Narayan joined forces with Serbian/Canadian clarinet virtuoso Milan Milo≈°eviƒá on the world music/theatrical project The Last Angel on Earth. Created mostly in cyberspace from different sides of the continent (Milo≈°eviƒá lives in Vancouver), songs are inspired by/dedicated to angels and deities originated from the world‚Äôs major religions. In a year-long creative process, Joviƒáeviƒá draw skeletons for the eclectic musical pieces in his NYC studio, while Milo≈°eviƒá and Narayan have given them wings by sending their sound parts through the Internet.. Currently, Jovicevic is working with Narayan and Playwright Aditi Kapil on a new theatre project with music.

Opened on 24 May 1928, this station was located only south of the station at New Romney. However, there were extensive contemporary plans for the development of a new community of Greatstone-on- Sea. It was with this possible future traffic in mind that the station was built, and heavily equipped. Some records imply that the station may have been erected at the specific request of the building company contracted to construct the local houses, although the evidence remains ambiguous. The station was equipped with two platforms, with waiting rooms on each, including a ticket office, a signal box, and a water tower. Photographs taken in the 1920s and 1930s show a footbridge between the platforms, as does a 1930s railway advertising poster, but contemporary eye-witness accounts record that this footbridge was never completed, with no steps installed on either side. Photographic evidence from 1936now in the 'Real Photographs Co.' collection shows a tearoom on the seaward platform. 1930s railway poster Although bungalows were constructed at Greatstone-on-Sea, the size of the development was considerably smaller than originally expected. When the railway re-opened after World War II, 'Greatstone Dunes' was renamed 'Greatstone Halt' unstaffed, with its buildings closed. The waiting room on the inland platform had been incorporated into an army pillbox during hostilities. In 1950, tourist trade picked up, and travellers sought out the beaches at Greatstone. The halt was upgraded again to full station status, now known simply as 'Greatstone' (without the 'Dunes' suffix). The buildings were renovated or replaced, and staff were reinstated. This new lease of life lasted for 14 years. At some point (date unknown), the remaining original station buildings (on the original 'down' side of the line) were demolished and replaced with a modern shelter of breeze-block and timber design, with concrete platform and corrugated roof. Hythe - Dungeness RH&DR; train at Greatstone Dunes Halt, 1962 In 1964, staff were withdrawn and in 1970, the buildings were demolished. However, full station status was technically maintained right through until final closure. The publication \\"A Miniature Guide\\" was issued in 1981, and became the final official publication listing Greatstone station as fully operational. The station closed in 1983, despite the bizarre fact that it was still listed in the 1984 timetable, but with no times in any of the train columns. The 1985 timetable was the first one to have no mention of Greatstone station. The site of the station is marked by the army pillbox, an access footpath from the nearby road (still open), and two poles which held the final station nameboard, the nameboard itself having been removed. Although the station is still listed on the railway's computer ticket issuing systems, machines are barred from issuing such tickets, and there are no plans for the station to reopen.

Travel the Road is a part of the non- profit organization Challenge for Christ Ministries located in Los Angeles. They are also partnered with Overland Missions. Controversy in Afghanistan In December 2008, the program attracted criticism from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, a watchdog group whose stated goals are to ensure that religious freedom is maintained in the United States military. The MRFF claimed that Scott and Decker were embedded with American troops stationed in Afghanistan, despite the fact that, according to MRFF president Mikey Weinstein, the military exercises a \\"complete prohibition of the proselytizing of any religion, faith, or practice...You see [Scott and Decker] wearing American helmets. It is obvious they were completely embedded.\\" When ABC News contacted the U.S. Army in Afghanistan about Scott and Decker's alleged embed, which had taken place four years previously, they said that they no longer have the documentation of the missionaries' status with the troops.Missionaries Face Death, Criticism to Preach, ABCNews.com, 2 February 2009 Scott defended the trip to Afghanistan, telling ABC, \\"It wasn't like we were hiding in the back saying we're going to preach. [The military] knew what we were doing. We told them that we were born again Christians, we're here doing ministry, we shoot for this TV station and we want to embed and see what it was like. We were interviewing the chaplains and we talked to them. We spoke at the services and things like that. So we did do our mission being over there as far as being able to document what the soldiers go through, what it's like in Afghanistan. So I could say that we were on a secular mission as well as far as documenting. I would say we were news reporters as well, we were delivering news of what was actually happening there, but we were also there to document the Christian side.\\" Scott argued that since the pair were acting as Christian journalists, they had the same right to cover the war in Afghanistan as secular networks.

The Norwegian Board of Health Supervision is an independent supervision authority, with responsibility for general supervision of child protection, health and social services in the country. The Norwegian Board of Health Supervision directs the supervision authorities at the county level: the Offices of the County Governors. Supervision of health and social services in Norway means ensuring that legislation is complied with In Norway there are many acts relating to health and social services that: *lay down requirements for the quality of services *regulate the practice of health care personnel who have professional authorization *give users of health and social services rights, for example those laid down in the Patients‚Äô Rights Act. Supervision is carried out for all statutory services, including services that are provided by publicly owned hospitals, municipalities, private organizations, and health care personnel who run their own practice. However, the supervision authorities are independent of political direction, and to a large extent decide themselves about priorities for which services to supervise and which areas supervision shall include. Priorities are decided, among other things, on the basis of information about risk and vulnerability. The supervision authorities contribute to ensuring that: *the needs of the population for health and social services are met *services are run in accordance with statutory requirements and acceptable professional standards *deficiencies in provision of services are prevented *resources are used effectively and efficiently.  Methods used by the supervision authorities = General supervision  General supervision is supervision with an overall perspective, and involves collecting, organizing and interpreting information about health and social services from the perspective of supervision. This information forms the basis for evaluating supply and quality of services.  Planned supervision of health and social care institutions  System audits are used for supervision of health and social care institutions (municipalities, nursing homes, hospitals etc.), based on internationally accepted methodology. The institutions are investigated by reviewing documents, carrying out interviews, inspecting premises, and carrying out random checks. Conditions that are in breach of laws or regulations (nonconformities) are documented in supervision reports. The supervision authorities follow up nonconformities with the owners and management until the conditions meet the statutory requirements. Each year, the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision designates between two and four areas for countrywide supervision.  Individual cases concerning deficiencies in services  The Offices of the County Governors information about possible deficiencies in services from many sources (patients, relatives, employers, the police, the mass media). About 2 000 cases are investigated each year to determine whether there has been a breach of laws or regulations. If a breach has occurred, the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision can give an administrative reaction against the institution, in the form of instructions to correct the conditions, or an administrative reaction against health care personnel with authorization, in the form of a warning, revocation of the right to requisition medicinal products, or withdrawal of authorization.  Complaints about health and social services and failure to meet statutory rights  The Patients‚Äô Rights Act gives the population many rights regarding health services. The Act covers the following: *the right to essential health care *assessment by a specialist physician within 30 days *free choice of hospital *access to medical records and corrections to records *patient participation *information *special rights for children *consent to medical treatment *individual plans for people who require several different services. The Social Services Act covers the duty of the municipalities to provide services for the population, such as: *information, advice and counselling that can help to solve or prevent social problems *practical help and instruction for people who have special needs for assistance because of illness, functional disabilities, age etc. *relief for carers and salary for families and people who care for a person with extensive need for care *support persons and families *places in institutions and sheltered accommodation *accommodation for people with special needs. Each year, the supervision authorities deal with 6000 to 8000 complaints about these services and rights.  Use of the findings and experience gained from supervision  The supervision authorities work actively to ensure that agencies that provide health and social services use available sources of information in their work with developing management systems and with improving the quality of services. These sources include: supervision reports, decisions made in individual cases, reports about adverse events, and publications of the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision. The findings and experience gained from supervision, other sources of information and supervision methodology are available to the public. Most of this information is available on the web site www.helsetilsynet.no.  Organization  The supervision authorities are the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision (the central office) and the Offices of the County Governor in the counties. The Norwegian Board of Health Supervision has about 85 employees, lawyers, doctors, other types of health care personnel, child welfare and social care personnel and social scientists. The Director General MD of the board is Jan Fredrik Andresen. He was appointed to the role in 2012.

After a ban on symbols similar to the Nazi swastika or the Soviet hammer and sickle in 2003, members of the organization protested outside the Latvian parliament with ethnographic symbols bearing reversed versions of the swastika.

Colleges and university =Mid- Western University, Birendranagar Nepal Government appointed Dr. Padam Lal Devkota, an anthropology professor, as the Vice-Chancellor (the chief executive) of the Midwestern University on 8 August 2011. This appointment can be regarded as the official beginning of the university in the Midwestern region of Nepal. Prior to this, a team of self-motivated and active educationists in Surkhet had been working hard for more than seventeen years to establish this university. This university has come into existence after a long and untiring efforts of the team. Collaborating with the existing political parties, building partnerships with adjacent districts, lobbying with the government, and fundraising campaigns had been a norm for this team built up by the people's bottom-up initiation and known in the region as the Preparation Committee of the Mid-Western University. Since an independent institution of higher education was a cherished dream of the people of this area, the team was able to garner a tremendous political support from the existing parties as well as a wide enthusiastic participation of the people of this region. People of Surkhet particularly showed an amazing example of contribution to the fundraising program geared to the establishment of this university. Mid-Western University is still in the making and has much to do before coming fully into function. The land, property, human resource, and the students of the existing TU-affiliated campuses in the region are likely to come under this university to give it a life to begin with. There is strong support to this university from the existing campuses throughout the region. Supposed to be catering for the regional higher education need of the youth, this university is also expected to serve as a partner and a vehicle of the development of the whole Midwestern Development Region of the country. The headquarters of the university is in the process of opening soon in Birendranagar. It is also hoped that this university will bring about a significant change of strategy over the education system of this geographically largest region of the country.

A higher outflow from Langdon could lower the phosphorus level, but its water clarity remains poor, despite the fact that it was treated with Alum in 1998. Wildlife Fish in the lake include bass, crappies, sunfish, and numerous carp and catfish. During the warmer months, Blue Heron and White Egrets fish the shoreline. Beavers are present on the western part of the bay as evidenced by the downed trees.

Being an important actor of the national economy, TPAO achieved many ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù of the Turkish oil industry. The company, its history reaching back over a half century, has given rise to seventeen major companies, including Petkim, T√ºpra≈ü and POA≈û to Turkey. Until 1983, as an integrated oil company, it was engaged in all the activity fields of oil industry from exploration to production, refinery, marketing and transportation. Today, TPAO is a national oil company involved in merely upstream (exploration, drilling, well completion and production) sector. Operations The core activities of TPAO are: * Exploration, drilling, production and well completion * Natural gas storage * Participation to oil and natural gas pipeline projects * Fuel products distribution (by TPPD) Exploration TPAO building in Ankara In accordance with the company's vision and mission for meeting Turkey‚Äôs continuously increasing oil and natural gas demand through domestic and international sources, with the new exploration strategy, the company extends its activities in unexplored basins of Turkey, especially Black Sea and Mediterranean offshore areas. With seismic surveys held since 2003, it has attained substantial information about the hydrocarbon potential of Turkey offshore. The first economical natural gas discovery made the region the focus of many oil companies. TPAO continues farm-out activities covering Mersin and ƒ∞skenderun Bays licenses following Antalya Bay. In 2013, the company purchased the seismographic research/survey vessel RV Barbaros Hayreddin Pa≈üa worth US$130 million for gas and oil field exploration in Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Production=Domestic oil production In 2013, TPAO produced 12.3 million barrels of crude oil from its fields, which constituted 73% of the total crude oil production of Turkey. 72% of its total oil production is from Batman Region, 27% is from Adƒ±yaman Region and 1% is from Thrace Region. The average daily production for 2013 is 33,758 barrel/day. 488.1 thousand barrels of oil was produced in 2013 from 47 new oil wells that were put into production. It is 4% of the total production for 2013. Domestic natural gas production In 2013, TPAO's total natural gas production was 307 million sm¬≥. 96% of this gas production is from Thrace Region, 3% is from Batman Region and 1% is from Adƒ±yaman Region. The oil equivalent of the gas output is 1.8 million barrels. 16.2 million sm3 of natural gas was produced in 2013 from 9 new natural gas wells that were put into production. It is 4.7% of the total production for 2013. Thus, the total hydrocarbon production of TP is 14.13 million barrels.

The cathedral of the see is the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the national capital Addis Ababa. It has three suffragan eparchies. Also in Ethiopia are nine Latin jurisdictions (Apostolic Vicariates and Apostolic Prefectures), which, not being of diocesan rank, are not organized as parts of an ecclesiastical province and are instead immediately subject to the Holy See. The Ethiopian Catholic Church reports to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, while the Latin jurisdictions depend on the missionary Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. The Catholics in the Latin jurisdictions are about six times as numerous as those in the Ethiopic jurisdictions.Ethiopia: Statistics by Diocese Unlike some other countries, where jurisdictions of the Latin Church and of one or more Eastern Catholic Churches overlap, all ecclesiastical jurisdictions in Ethiopia are geographically distinct and each territory has a single hierarch or ordinary. All the hierarchs and ordinaries are members of the interritual Episcopal Conference, which until the foundation of the Eritrean Catholic Church in 2015 also counted the Eritrean hierarchy as members and, from the 1993 declaration of the independence of Eritrea until 2015, was called the Episcopal Conference of Ethiopia and Eritrea.See for instance, Annuario Pontificio 2013, p. 1080 and the address of Pope Francis to \\"the bishops of the Episcopal Conference of Ethiopia and Eritrea\\" in 2014, as opposed to Annuario Pontificio 1992, p. 1065 and the address of Pope John Paul II to \\"the members of the Episcopal Conference of Ethiopia\\" in 1987. The episcopal conference is now again named without mention of Eritrea.Ethiopian Catholic Secretariat, 28 March 2017Vatican Radio, \\"Ethiopia's Cathedral of the Vicariate of Meki inaugurated\\", 26 May 2017 The Metropolitan Archeparch of Addis Abeba is Cardinal Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel, who is also president of the episcopal conference.  Statistics  As per 2014, the Metropolitan Archeparchy of Addis Abeba pastorally served 27,713 Catholics (0.1% of Ethopia's population of 30,302,000 total) on 253,000 km¬≤ in 23 parishes and 7 missions with 187 priests (26 diocesan, 161 religious), 494 lay religious (176 brothers, 318 sisters) and 64 seminarians.

Before 1839, the area of the present Archeparchy and the rest of the territory of the Apostolic Prefecture of Abyssinia belonged to the still vaster Apostolic Vicariate of Syria, Egypt, Arabia and Cyprus. On 4 May 1846, the Apostolic Prefecture of Abyssinia lost much territory to the south on the establishment of the Apostolic Vicariate of the Galla (see below). Next year, it was raised to the rank of Apostolic Vicariate and therefore given a titular bishop as its head. On 19 September 1894, it lost territory to the north to the new Apostolic Prefecture of Eritrea. The 1847 loss to the Apostolic Vicariate of the Galla involved a vast territory but no established missions; the smaller territory lost in 1894 to the Apostolic Prefecture of Eritrea contained 25 of its 28 parishes.The Catholic Church in Ethiopia: A brief history of evangelisation (Fides dossier), p. 6 On 25 March 1937, in a general reorganization of Catholic jurisdictions in Ethiopia that followed its military conquest by Italy, the Apostolic Vicariate of Abyssinia was suppressed (see below). A 2008 dossier published by the Fides News Agency of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples spoke of the Eparchy of Adigrat, with 33 parishes and a far smaller territory, as the present-day continuation of the Apostolic Vicariate of Abyssinia.  Apostolic Vicariate of the Galla  On 4 May 1846, the Apostolic Vicariate of the Galla, headed by Guglielmo Massaia, was founded, extending from 4¬∞ to 10¬∞ North and from 34¬∞ to 44¬∞ East.Andreas Jarosseau, \\"Galla\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York, 1909) The city of Addis Ababa, founded forty years later, in 1886, is situated at 9¬∞N, 39¬∞E. The site of Addis Ababa was thus in the Apostolic Prefecture of Abyssinia for only seven years and remained 91 years in the Apostolic Vicariate of the Galla. The Apostolic Vicariate of the Galla lost territory on 28 January 1913 with the creation of the Apostolic Prefecture of Southern Keffa. In 1937, its boundaries were changed and it was renamed Apostolic Vicariate of Harar (see below).  Reorganization under Italian rule  A year after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia, the Apostolic Vicariate of Abyssinia was suppressed on 25 March 1937.Apostolic constitution Quo in Aethiopiae regionibus (Acta Apostolicae Sedis 1937, pp. 357‚Äì358 From its territory three new apostolic prefectures were formed (Gondar, Tigray and Dessie), while Danakil was annexed to the (Latin-Church) Apostolic Vicariate of Eritrea. The territory of the Apostolic Vicariate of the Galla was altered on 25 March 1937 to coincide with that of Harrar Governorate and its name was changed to Apostolic Vicariate of Harar.Apostolic constitution Quo in Aethiopia (Acta Apostolicae Sedis 1937, pp. 362‚Äì363 A new Apostolic Vicariate of Addis Abeba was created, with territory corresponding to that of Shewa Governorate.Apostolic constitution Quo in Aethiopia (Acta Apostolicae Sedis 1937, pp. 363‚Äì364. Note that this papal bull and the one that renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of the Galla have identical incipits. Unlike the other vicariates and prefectures, which were placed in the care of missionary institutes, the Addis Abeba jurisdiction was entrusted to its secular clergy.  Ethiopic-Rite ordinaries in Ethiopia  After the defeat of the Italian forces in the East African Campaign (World War II), clergy of Italian nationality, including the apostolic vicars and prefects, were expelled from Ethiopia. Pastoral care of the Catholics in Ethiopia was attended to by Ethiopian and Eritrean clergy, almost all of whom followed the Ge'ez Rite. Those that came to Addis Ababa were natives of the Apostolic Prefecture of Tigray.The Catholic Church in Ethiopia: A brief history of evangelisation (Fides dossier), p. 7 Accordingly, at the end of 1942, all the Catholic faithful in Ethiopia were made subject to Kidan√®-Maryam Cass√†, Titular Bishop of Thibaris, Ordinary for Ethiopic-Rite indigenous Catholics in Eritrea.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 1952, pp. 253‚Äì254 In 1950, Hailemariam Kahsay (Italian form: Hail√© Mariam Cahsai), a native of the then Apostolic Prefecture of Tigray, which within a decade was to be replaced by the Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat, was made Apostolic Administrator of the Ethiopic-Rite faithful resident in all of Ethiopia,Acta Apostolicae Sedis 1952, p. 254 and on 24 February 1951 he was appointed Titular Bishop of Sozusa in Libya.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 1951, p. 283 On 31 October 1951, a new apostolic exarchate for Ethiopic-Rite Catholics (the Eastern equivalent of a Latin apostolic vicariate), to be called that of Addis Abeba, was established, coextensive with the Ethiopian Empire. (Eritrea, then federated with Ethiopia, was not annexed to the Empire until 1960,) This is presented in the Annuario Pontificio as the first origin of today's Metropolitan Archeparchy of Addis Abeba.See, for instance, Annuario Pontificio 1964, p. 16, and Annuario Pontificio 2013, p. 10. Hailemariam Kahsay became its first exarch. On 20 February 1961, the year after Eritrea became part of the Ethiopian Empire, Pope John XXIII established an ecclesiastical province for Ethiopic-Rite Catholics living in the Empire. The apostolic exarchate of Addis Abeba became its metropolitan see and thus an archeparchy. It was given two suffragan eparchies: that of Asmara (previously, like Addis Abeba, an apostolic exarchate) and the eparchy of Adigrat. The jurisdictional area of Addis Abeba was reduced to the territories that had been assigned in 1937 to the Latin apostolic vicariate of Addis Abeba and the apostolic prefectures of Gondar, Dessie and Endeber.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 1961, p. 648 From then on, there have been in Ethiopia (excluding Eritrea) no overlapping of Latin and Ethiopic jurisdictions. On 9 April 1961, Hailemariam Kahsay was appointed the first Eparch of Adigrat, his native area, and his successor in Addis Abeba was Asrate Mariam Yemmeru, transferred from the see of Asmara. On 25 November 2003, the Eparchy of Emdeber was established on territory taken from the archeparchy as a second Ethiopian suffragan see. By then the Eparchy of Asmara had been divided into four eparchies, so that the suffragan sees of the Archeparchy of Addis Abeba were six. On 19 January 2015, the number of suffragan sees was reduced to three through, on the one hand, the setting up of a third Ethiopian eparchy, that of Bahir Dar-Dessie, with territory taken from that of the metropolitan archeparchy, and, on the other hand, the separation of the four Eritrean eparchies to form the distinct Eritrean Catholic Church.

He started off as an author and journalist, but moved on to be an active writer in the Indian film industry for 7 years. He worked as a drama producer in All India Radio between December 1953 and May 1956. At this point he realised that a regular job would always be a hindrance to his literary life, so he devoted himself to freelance writing. Often cited as the true literary heir of Premchand, Amritlal Nagar created his own independent and unique identity as a litt√©rateur and is counted as one of the most important and multi-faceted creative writers of Indian literature. In the words of famous critic, Dr. Ram Bilas Sharma,\\"Undoubtedly, Amritlal Nagar will be remembered as an important novelist. For me, he is a very major sculptor of fiction. He has revealed the power of both standard [manak] Hindi, as well as the non-standard [ghair- manak] Hindi of the ordinary\\" (Sharma, Amritlal Nagar Rachnavali, Vol 1, p. 47). Amritlal Nagar's real genius lay in the art of developing a range of characters in his stories and novels. Commenting on his distinctive ability to operationalise a story at many levels in complex and multi-dimensional ways, another prominent writer and critic of Hindi, Shreelal Shukla notes, \\"Rather than imposing his own personality on his character, Nagar ji dissolves himself in the character and in the process, he absorbs at the experiential level, all of those complexities that even the simplest characters nurture in the forms of anxieties and knotted puzzles. This work can only be done by a major creative writer\\" (Shukla, 10 Pratinidhi Kahaniyan: Amrilal Nagar, p. 10). Biography Nagar was born on 17 August 1916 in Chaurahe Wali Gali, Gokulpura, in a prominent Gujarati Nagar Brahmin Family in Agra, India. He died on 23 February 1990 in Chowk, Lucknow, India. His parents were Rajaram and Vidyawati Nagar. He first published a poem in the fortnightly Anand in December 1928. The poem was inspired by a protest against the Simon Commission in which Amritlal was suffered injury during lathi charge. He married Pratibha (original name Savitri Devi alias Bitto) on 31 January 1932. They had four children (Late Kumud Nagar, Late Sharad Nagar, Dr. Achala Nagar and Smt. Aarti Pandya). Employment Nagar worked as a dispatch clerk in the Lucknow office of All India United Insurance Company for 18 days. He provided voluntary services to the publication division of the Nawal Kishore Press and the editorial office of Madhuri in 1939. From December 1953 to May 1956 he worked as a drama producer in Akashvani (All India Radio), Lucknow, but resigned from this position so that he could focus all of his time and attention to his literary pursuits. Films From 1940 to 1947, Nagar wrote screen plays and dialogues for the film industry in Bombay (now Mumbai), Kolhapur, and Chennai (Madras). He was one of the early pioneers specialising in cinematic dubbing that involved the art of translating films of one language into another. He dubbed Naseeruddin in Buhkara and Zoya from Russian and M.S. Subbulakshmi's Meera from Tamil into Hindi.

The Swedish Ardennes has a muscular, compact body with stout legs, some feathering on its legs and blue, open hoofs. The predominant colors are black, blood bay, and chestnut.Swedish Ardennes horse. Accessed February 8, 2011. It can withstand extremes in weather; Swedish Ardennes horses are very strong and willing workers and easy keepers. They are also known for their longevity, an even but not sluggish temperament, and good overall health. History Swedish Ardennes horses were developed by crossing imported Ardennes horses (a heavy draft breed from Belgium and northern France) with the North Swedish Horse. In 1872, Count C.G. Wrangel began importing Ardennes horses and by 1880, Ardennes imports and crossbreds had made inroads across south and central Sweden. The goal was to improve on the size and strength of native Swedish horses; to this end, a studbook was established in 1901.  Uses  Although farming is now done with machinery (except on remote hill farms), the Swedish Ardennes is still popular as a cart horse; it is also used for hauling timber in mountain areas inaccessible by machinery. Despite the increasing mechanization of agriculture and forestry, the Swedish Ardennes still makes up the largest proportion of Sweden's registered purebred stallions.

Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking. Typical Panamanian foods are mildly flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama's Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are maize, rice, wheat flour, plantains, yuca (cassava), beef, chicken, pork and seafood.  Dishes  Carima√±olas The corn-based tortilla de maiz viejo Corn-based dishes come from the kernel, cooked in water and then ground in order to obtain a dough (as opposed to using corn flour to obtain the dough). Fresh corn is also used in some dishes. Due to the multicultural background of the Panamanians, many of its dishes are heavily influenced by the cuisine of other Latin American countries and also the Caribbean as well as European. Some of the main meals, dishes and specialties include: * Almoj√°banos ‚Äì \\"S\\" shaped corn fritters. * Arroz con camarones y coco ‚Äì rice with shrimp and coconut milk. * Arroz con chorizo y aj√≠es dulces * Arroz con pollo * Arroz con puerco y vegetales * Arroz verde * Bistec de h√≠gado ‚Äì liver steak * Bistec picado ‚Äì chopped beefsteak. * Bollos ‚Äì corn dough wrapped in nahuala palm leaves, corn husk or plantain leaves and boiled.

The book explains the personal, religious, and political life of Preston Manning and explains the roots and beliefs of the Reform Party. At the time of its publishing in 1991, Reform had become a popular populist conservative party in Western Canada after the mainstream Progressive Conservative Party of Canada was collapsing in support and in 1991 decided to expand eastward into Ontario and the Maritime provinces. One year later the PC party collapsed in the 1993 federal election, allowing the Reform Party to make political history in Canada, displacing the PCs as the dominant conservative party in Canada. Reform, later renamed the Canadian Alliance, merged with the PC Party in 2003, to form a united right-wing alternative to the governing Liberal Party of Canada, named the Conservative Party of Canada which has dropped many of the populist themes that the Reform Party had. Main thesis The book's principal thesis was challenging the dominant notion at the time that Canada was always divided between English and French Canada. Manning claims that the two founding peoples thesis is flawed and the solutions to counter this division have caused more division and proposes a New Canada with a new identity that would solve existing problems, saying, Topics in The New Canada=History of the democratic populist reform movement in CanadaOntario, Nova Scotia, and Quebec= Manning credits the populist reform tradition in Canada as not having begun in the west, and mentions its early roots in the reform parties of Upper Canada (Ontario) Lower Canada (Quebec), and Nova Scotia that fought against the rule of colonial elites such as the Family Compact and Ch√¢teau Clique and sought to replace them with responsible governments. Manning praises the province of Quebec for being open to populist politics and populist third party politics. Manning mentions the Bloc Populaire Canadien, the Ralliement cr√©ditiste du Qu√©bec, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, and the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois as examples of populist third parties in Quebec. =Prairies= Manning links his political roots to the Canadian Prairies' tradition of democratic populism. In particular, Manning credits both the Alberta Social Credit Party led by his father, Ernest Manning, who served as Premier of Alberta, and the federal, Western Canada-based Progressive Party of Canada as both being major inspirations to the Reform Party. The author claims that while he came to accept populism as a positive political force, he also developed a \\"healthy fear of its darker side.\\" Manning also defends the political actions of Alberta's Social Credit Premier William Aberhart of the 1930s and says that Aberhart was a person dedicated to saving the common people from the disaster of the Great Depression and fought against big business elites to serve the people. Manning claims that the vilification of Aberhart is no different from that of other Western Canadians such as famous Manitoban M√©tis leader Louis Riel or Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, both of whom were initially vilified but eventually \\"rehabilitated... about seventy-five years after their death\\" by historians. Manning claims that the same will be the same for Aberhart. Manning commends the Alberta Social Credit government's policies of working with local M√©tis as part of the Metis Population Betterment Act to create new M√©tis colonies throughout the province. Manning notes the words of Albertan M√©tis leader Adrien Hope of Kirkino Colony who commended Riel as \\"the first western Reformer\\" for having led a grassroots uprising against the federal government to demand the creation of the province of Manitoba in 1870. Manning identified the Progressive Party of the 1920s as being a highly influential and successful federal Western populist party, which he argues may \\"have perhaps been the most successful third party to emerge on the Canadian federal scene during this century\\". Manning credits the Progressives for their miraculously fast rise to prominence as well as for their policies of calling for reforms to agricultural policy, tariff policy, transportation policy, and parliamentary practices. Manning claims that the social democratic Cooperative Commonwealth Federation as led by Tommy Douglas in the province of Saskatchewan is an example of prairie populism. Dangers of extremist politics Manning addresses the dangers of political extremism in response to claims that he and the Reform Party harboured extreme and intolerant views. Manning claims that, Manning claims that as a consultant he occasionally encountered \\"zealous ideologues of both the right and the left\\" to whom he advised that they temper their political passions. To ideologue conservatives, Manning recommended that they read The Politics of Cultural Despair: A Study in the Rise of the Germanic Ideology by Fritz Stern who describes \\"how conservative ideologues in the 1920s inadvertently prepared the way for Hitler and the rise of fascism\\". To ideologue socialists, Manning recommended that they read The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or read stories about the massacres committed by Pol Pot regime in Cambodia \\"to get a feel for socialism run amok\\". Manning recognizes the prevalence of anti-Semitism which rose in the Alberta Social Credit Party and describes how his father as Social Credit leader actively purged anti-Semites from the party that later resulted in his efforts to purge racists from politics being recognized by receiving the B'nai Brith Humanitarian Award in 1982. Manning claims that like his father, he was seeking to purge racists from the Reform Party. Manning describes his October 1990 speech to Jewish community leaders in Calgary, Alberta, where he assured them that the Reform Party actively sought to purge racial extremists from the party through racially neutral policies. On the issue of episodes of racism and extremism within the Reform Party, Manning spoke of the serious need to repel the party from absorbing such racism and extremism, saying that, Meech Lake Accord Manning describes the reasons for why the Reform Party opposed the Meech Lake Accord that involved granting distinct society status to Quebec. Manning claims that he and the Reform Party went against the Meech Lake Accord because it was discriminatory advocating special powers for the province of Quebec while not advocating similar powers to the other provinces of Canada. Manning points out the hypocrisy of the Meech Lake Accord's advocacy of distinct society for Quebec while ignoring aboriginal Canadians that Manning claims justified aboriginal Manitoba New Democratic Party MLA Elijah Harper's decision to act in the interests of his aboriginal people and in the interests of the popular will of the people of Manitoba in opposing the Meech Lake Accord. Manning condemns then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and then-Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa of being deceitful for accusing opponents of Meech Lake such as Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells, Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon and Elijah Harper of \\"rejecting Quebec\\". Manning states that the rejection of Meech Lake was not a rejection of Quebec and that such claims were lies. Manning notes that the Reform Party stood out against the traditional federal political parties (the Liberal, New Democratic, and Progressive Conservative parties) in opposing the accord. Reviews and responses In his 1994 Canadian Journal of Political Science article entitled \\"Preston Manning and the Politics of Postmodernism in Canada\\", political scientist, Richard Sigurdson, wrote that Manning agreed with Ruben Nelson's 1991 statement that industrial societies' \\"categorized, institution-based programs delivered by professionals\\" were \\"nightmares\\". The postindustrial New Canada that Manning called for \\"would involve a shift away from doctors and health-care systems to healthy lives, from schools and educational systems to societal learning, from human rights to responsible relations, from daycare and homemakers to community creators, from bilingualism and multiculturalism to a living Canadian culture, and from inputs measures to desired outcomes.\\"jstor Sigurdson wrote that Manning was part of the new economic service class that were \\"knowledge-based, technologically oriented\\", and \\"entrepreneurial.\\" In The New Canada, Manning repeatedly referred to his 20 years of work experience as a consultant specializing in \\"systems analysis techniques\\" where his focus was not on products but on \\"marketing ideas and concepts.\\" Manning called for Parliament's use of these technocratic \\"marketplace mechanisms\\" for \\"allocating scarce resources\\", \\"fiscal responsibility, international competitiveness, and national recognition.

The Heywood family came to California in the 1850s, settling on the east shore of San Francisco Bay in an area which became the unincorporated town of Ocean View, and later, West Berkeley. Zimri established a lumber yard at a small pier at what is now the foot of Delaware Street in the 1850s. He joined with the original builder of the pier, sea captain James H. Jacobs, to improve and enlarge it into a full-fledged freight wharf, thenceforth called the Heywood and Jacobs Wharf. Samuel Heywood married Emma Frances Dingley on May 4, 1874.

She is one of the main characters of the show and is portrayed by Catherine Tate. She has since gone on to be the main character of a number of specials. In 2020, she is going to be the main character in a big-screen movie entitled Nan: The Movie, featuring Matthew Horne reprising his role as her on-screen grandson Jamie from the original sketch series.  Character history =The Catherine Tate Show Joanie is most often referred to as \\"Nan\\". She is an obnoxious cockney woman in her seventies who frequently swears at and criticises other people. She is often visited by her well-mannered grandson, Jamie (Mathew Horne), whom she refers to when visitors come \\"'e ain't got a job\\", even though Jamie is in fact at university. His visits usually start off well enough, with Nan showing how grateful she is that he has come to see her. However, the situation usually takes a turn for the worse after she starts to make unfavourable comments about her neighbours, family, or home help visitors. Nan is mostly very pleasant to visitors, but after they leave, she criticises and rants about them. Sketches in series one show Jamie taking her to a pound shop, which ends with shambolic consequences. Joanie complains to her grandson about her home help visitor, whom she refers to as a \\"fucking MƒÅori\\". She also calls her new great-grandchild ugly. Her catchphrase, delivered at the crucial point of each sketch, is \\"What a fucking liberty!\\" In series two, Nan spends less time in her flat. She makes a disastrous visit to the doctor and spends two weeks in hospital. True to form, she does not suffer in silence, complaining about her fellow patients, accusing a nurse of stealing from her and caustically surveying the food menu. While in hospital, her grandson brings his first girlfriend to visit her. Unfortunately, his girlfriend has an abnormally large nose, provoking Nan's insulting behaviour as she becomes fixated with it, even offering her some old sheets to use for tissues. Another sketch sees Joanie arrive home from her friend Lena's funeral, where she is very upset, until she realises that the deceased actually owed her ¬£15. She quickly gets over her grief and is overcome with rage, coupled by the fact she had spent another ¬£25 on a wreath. In the last episode of Series 2, Peter Kay guest stars as one of Nan's friends who thinks Jamie is gay and describes it as a disability. In the 2005 Christmas special, a sketch features Nan attending a Christmas party in an old people's care home. Charlotte Church makes a guest appearance as herself, where she starts to sing a Christmas song for the guests, which prompts Nan to exclaim, \\"what a load of ole' shit!\\" In series three, Leslie Phillips plays another of Nan's friends, who is himself very much like her, evident when he says \\"What a fucking liberty\\" after Nan visits him in hospital and leaves him a present which he did not like, she had also used the phrase after receiving the same gift, which she re-gifted. Sheila Hancock appears as Nan's sister June, who lives in Spain and is equally as foul-mouthed as Nan. They reveal that most of their family were London gangland career criminals and mass murderers, with nicknames such as \\"Clownface\\", \\"Wallopnuts\\" and \\"Longsocks\\". Nan also made a characteristic appearance on The Paul O'Grady Show, in which she was pleased to discover his show had bought her a new armchair, but soon got annoyed when she learned that they had entered her house without her permission to deliver it, upon which she stormed off the set, exclaiming \\"Paul O'Grady? What a load of old shit!\\" Nan has at least one daughter, Diane, who is the mother of Jamie and a granddaughter, Gail, who bore Nan's \\"ugly\\" great-grandchild, Francesca. She initially believes the child to have been named Tesco's. The Christmas 2007 special introduced us to Diane herself, played by Kathy Burke, who was exactly like Nan in that she swore at and criticized people behind their backs. The sketch ends with both of them saying \\"What a fucking liberty!\\" together. Charity sketches In a sketch made especially for Comic Relief 2007, Nan appears on the game show, Deal or No Deal, hosted by Noel Edmonds. In the sketch, Nan plays a game of Deal or No Deal, in which she uncovers the five highest amounts of money in the first five boxes. As the boxes are opened, she makes an offensive comment about the player opening it, targeting their weight, earrings, and glasses. Being given an offer of ¬£199 by the Banker, Nan accepts the offer happily, having already cheated and looked in her box and found that it only contained ¬£50. Later in 2007, she did a Sport Relief sketch, about the World Cup. In 2010, she appeared on Comic Relief, receiving a cheque for her local community centre. Nan has also appeared in Holby City's hospital, because of her ingrown toenail, a 2013 Children in Need sketch.

Gordon Head lies north of McKenzie Avenue and east of the Blenkinsop Valley. The University of Victoria is located partly within Gordon Head along the southeast boundary. Finnerty Road separates Gordon Head from the adjacent neighbourhood of Cadboro Bay. The local area is dominated physically by Mt. Douglas, a coastline along Haro Strait, and the central plateau. History For 4,000 years the Songhees people inhabited the lands between Sooke and the Saanich Peninsula, which includes Gordon Head. In 1852, with the signing of the Douglas Treaties, farmers began settling the hitherto densely forested Gordon Head area. By 1860, 13 men, including Michael Finnerty and John Work, owned all of the land. The region would become famous for its strawberries and later its daffodils. City water service was introduced in 1921, leading to a proliferation of greenhouses and vegetable farming. Agriculture dominated the landscape until about the 1950s, when Gordon Head began gradually developing into a residential neighbourhood. During World War II, a Special Wireless Station was established at Gordon Head in June 1940. It played a significant role in the Royal Canadian Navy's radio intelligence operation against the Japanese. Messages were intercepted here and bearings on enemy transmissions were provided using direction finding techniques. The station closed in 1946; however, the building that housed the station still stands in a remote corner of the University of Victoria, having been moved from its original location. Today, many homes in Gordon Head have secondary suites in order to both improve housing affordability and meet the housing demands of the local student population. Name The neighbourhood shares its name with the small strip of land that juts out into Haro Strait, east of Margaret Bay, in the community's north-east corner. Gordon Head is named after Admiral John Gordon, who in 1845 commanded in the North Pacific. Parks Gordon Head has 27 parks ranging in size from the minuscule Balmacarra Park () to the magnificent Mount Douglas Park (), the largest park in Saanich. Several parks offer beach access. The half-rocky, half-sandy beach located between Arbutus Cove Park and Hollydene Park is Gordon Head's most frequented beach. Schools Six schools belonging to the Greater Victoria School District (SD 61) call the community home: Elementary * Hillcrest * Torquay Middle * Arbutus * Gordon Head Secondary * Lambrick Park * Mount Douglas Maria Montessori Academy and ArtsCalibre Academy are the only independent schools in Gordon Head. Gordon Head Recreation Centre GHRC is centrally located and features a pool, sauna, steamroom, whirlpool, weightroom, dance and fitness studio, as well as a skateboard/rollerblade park. Recent eco-friendly updates to the centre include UV pool filtration (in addition to the existing chlorine-based system) and solar-powered showers. Retail locations * Torquay Village * Tuscany Village * University Heights Shopping Centre Pedestrian shortcuts Sprinkled across the community are dozens of pedestrian shortcuts.

Kalotina lies at , 282 metres above sea level. Kalotina is known for the Kalotina-Gradinje border checkpoint, one of Bulgaria's busiest and best-known due to the proximity to Sofia. The Nishava River, a tributary of the South Morava, flows nearby. The village was first mentioned in 1453 with its present name. In a 1576 source, it was referred to as Kalotine. Kalotina's name is the feminine form of an adjective derived from the personal name Kalota (–ö–∞–ª–æ—Ç–∞); it is an ellipse, as no noun is part of the name. The village has a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox church dedicated to Saint Nicholas built in the 14th century, during the rule of Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria (as indicated by an inscription in the church). It was richly decorated with murals, although they have been badly preserved.

Fed by Silver Springs, it connects the springs to the Ocklawaha River, passing through a pristine woodland environment. The river was probably named for its silvery appearance.  Geography and hydrology  The Silver River drains Silver Springs, located in the Silver Springs Nature Theme Park in Silver Springs, Florida approximately east of Ocala, Florida. The river flows east from the springs, being joined by an unnamed tributary creek from the north just east of the park, for approximately before joining the Ocklawaha River just south of the Bert Dosh Memorial Bridge.Boning 2007, p.160.  Ecology  The Silver River flows through an undeveloped woodland just to the west of the Ocala National Forest; the water quality is considered excellent, and the river is regarded as being in pristine condition. Many types of turtles are found in the Silver River, while ospreys and anhingas breed along its banks.Boning 2007, p.161. Rhesus monkeys were released at Silver Springs in the 1930s, and became feral; they remain present along the river's run and can be seen when traveling the river. The Silver River is designated under the Outstanding Florida Waters program.  History and recreation  A feral rhesus macaque along the river The first known human settlement in the Silver River area was by the Timucua people; Europeans arrived in the 1820s, with Fort King being established near the Silver Springs in 1827. The springs became a tourist attraction in the 1870s; the first glass-bottom boat was built to provide views of the springs in 1878. The river steamer Metamora sank near the Silver River's mouth in 1903. The parks around the river's source, Silver Springs State Park and the historic Silver Springs attraction, are noted tourist destinations; the river itself is considered to be excellent for exploration by canoe and kayak.

James studied geographic variation in the size and shape of birds, leading to transplant experiments with red-winged blackbirds and to tests of the theoretical assumptions underlying selection models. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. James originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was immersed in the stream of biology at an early age being involved in the Academy of Natural Sciences Expeditions for Everyone. In 1984 James was the first woman to become president of the American Ornithologists Union serving for two years until 1986. She was awarded the Eminent Ecologist Award in January 1997; in the same year she also received the Outstanding Leadership Award from the American Institute of Biological Sciences. She was awarded the 1999 Margaret Morse Nice Medal by the Wilson Ornithological Society. She has served on The Nature Conservancy Board of Governors and the Board of Directors for the World Wildlife Fund. Academic career James completed her A.B. (Bachelor of Arts) in zoology at Mount Holyoke College and went on to do her M.S. (Masters) at Louisiana State University. She then finished her Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Arkansas in 1970 at the age of 40 after raising a family of three daughters with her then husband ornithologist Douglas A. James. Her dissertation involved observing patterns of intraspecific size variation in 12 species of birds found in areas of the United States. James looked specifically at Bergmann‚Äôs rule hypothesizing that temperature may not be the most important factor determining body size patterns across gradients. In 1996 Frances James and her colleague at the University of Florida, statistician Charles McCulloch published an article titled: New Approaches to Population Trends in Land Birds. They proposed novel approaches to analyzing the data from the Breeding Bird Survey, data showed no general decline but significant declines in species from certain regions. In 2009, with John Pourtless, she published an Ornithological Monograph entitled \\"Cladistics and the Origin of Birds: A Review and Two New Analyses\\". In this monograph they argue that both the ‚Äúearly-archosaur‚Äù and ‚Äúcrocodylomorph‚Äù hypotheses are at least as well supported as the BMT (birds are maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs) hypothesis. Also, the Kishino-Hasegawa tests they performed revealed no statistical difference between the hypothesis that birds were a clade nested within the Maniraptora and the hypothesis that core clades of Maniraptora (oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and dromaeosaurs) were actually flying and flightless radiations within the clade bracketed by Archaeopteryx and modern birds (Aves). James and Pourtless concluded that because Aves might not belong within it, Theropoda as presently constituted might not be monophyletic. They further cautioned that a verificationist approach in the BMT literature may be producing misleading studies on the origin of birds.

The film, written and directed by Emanuele Crialese, opens on location in Sicily and concludes in the United States. (The Ellis Island sequences were shot at a studio in Rome and in Buenos Aires, Argentina.) Vincent Schiavelli, whose character was originally planned to play a major part, died during the filming, forcing his role to become a supporting character. The movie premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 8, 2006 to critical praise and seven nominations (with six wins) at the festival. Many praised the director's focus on sound and visual composition. Others focused on the lack of typical iconography of the time (such as the Statue of Liberty). Martin Scorsese was involved in the marketing,Scorsese on the Immigrant Experience on Film NPR interview with Liane Hansen, 10 June 2007 and introduced the film at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.  Plot  The first major segment of the film introduces the poor Mancuso family (headed by the widowed Salvatore, Vincenzo Amato), from Sicily, Italy, at the turn of the 20th century residing in a rural mountainous region, who decide to emigrate to the United States after receiving a sign from God in the form of American postcards depicting giant produce and chickens. Their dreams about the land of opportunity where giant vegetables are grown, people swim in milk, and coins fall from the sky propel their decision, which gives the viewer insight into the unrealistic expectations that many immigrants held about America. Salvatore takes his family consisting of his two sons as well as his old mother, Fortunata, who we learn is the village witch doctor and involved heavily in mystique (Aurora Quattrocchi). The dramatic scene that opens up the next segment of the film, the boat trip, visually depicts a sea of people being separated , those on the dock and those on the boat metaphorically representing the departure of the old and the new world respectively. While aboard the ship to America, a red-headed British woman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who is traveling alone, stands out as both an attractive and elusive woman, catching the attention of the men for her beauty and the women for her classiness and independence. Salvatore is immediately smitten with this woman throughout the journey. Upon arrival at Ellis Island, Lucy asks Salvatore to marry her purely for administrative reasons, as being a woman she is unable to enter the United States alone. He agrees; he understands that she is not in love with him yet, but expects that will come with time. Their complex relationship highlights the troubling dynamic of the time, as women must still submit to male authority in the new world in order to even hope for the lesser freedom they so desire. At Ellis Island, the final major segment of the film, the family join the rest of the immigrants on board to undergo extensive and humiliating physical and psychological examinations and questioning. The value of class that separated the immigrants on the ship becomes irrelevant in this final segment, as all of the immigrant's places in the new world are not guaranteed; they are all deemed equal. The ending of the movie reveals a surprising transfer of power between Pietro and Fortunata, as Pietro voices to Salvatore that his grandmother wishes to return home. After the tests are conducted, Salvatore is informed that Pietro (Filippo Pucillo) is about to be sent back for being mute, and Salvatore's mother for insufficient intelligence. The viewers are then left with the dilemma of whether Salvatore chooses to return home with his family or enter the United States.  Critical response  The film received generally favorable reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 72% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 74 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 74 out of 100, based on 22 reviews. Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post and Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe named it the 7th best film of 2007.  Awards  The film won six awards at the Venice Film Festival, including two awards for Best Film (the CinemAvvenire and Pasinetti Awards), along with the FEDIC, SIGNIS, Silver Lion, and UNICEF awards. It was also nominated for a Golden Lion award. The film was also nominated for a European Film Award, for the Film of the Year. The film was Italy's submission for the 79th Academy Awards, but was ultimately passed over in final nominations.

This differs from purebred animals of known bloodlines and also differs from deliberately crossbred animals that are produced with an intent of either creating a new breed of horse or an animal with characteristics that deliberately combine the strengths of two different breeds. Many grade horses are the result of unintentional or accidental breedings, though in some cases, they are the result of a planned breeding of a stallion and a mare, but animals who themselves are of uncertain bloodlines. Experienced horsepeople can usually spot a breed type in most grade horses.Pavia, Audrey, Horses for Dummies, 1999. Some grade horses may have at least partially known breeding, but may not have been registered by their breeder, particularly if the product of an unintended mating, or may have been sold without papers. Unless a horse has been permanently marked with a brand, implanted microchip or lip tattoo, a once-registered animal sold without papers is often unidentifiable after it has passed through the hands of several owners. A horse that is registered is one recorded with a breed registry or stud book, having written documentation of its pedigree. A grade horse has no registration papers, and usually sells for significantly less money than a registered horse. However, some grade horses with special talent or a proven performance record in a given discipline may become valuable on their individual merits. A case in point was Snowman, a workhorse who became a show jumper and was eventually inducted into the United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame. A crossbred horse is sometimes called a \\"grade\\" horse, but this usage is not entirely correct: crossbreds with known ancestry and a pedigree on both sides are often quite valuable for their mix of breed characteristics‚Äîsome to the point that a new breed registry is created for them, and the \\"crossbred\\" eventually becomes a separate, new breed with true-breeding characteristics. Popular crossbreds that in time obtained their own breed registry include the Irish Sport Horse (Irish Draught/Thoroughbred), Quarab (American Quarter Horse/Arabian horse), Anglo- Arabian (Thoroughbred/Arabian), German riding pony (Assorted pony breeds crossed on assorted light saddle horse breeds) AraAppaloosa (Arabian and Appaloosa), and the National Show Horse (American Saddlebred/Arabian).

It is situated approximately south-west of Bridlington town centre and north of the village of North Frodingham. The civil parish is formed by the villages of Foston on the Wolds and Brigham and the hamlet of Gembling. According to the 2011 UK census, Foston on the Wolds parish had a population of 263, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 253. In 1823 Foston inhabitants numbered 300. Occupations included ten farmers, two wheelwrights, two blacksmiths, two grocers who were also drapers, a coal dealer, a corn miller who was also a coal dealer, a boot & shoemaker, a butcher, a tailor, a tanner, and the landlady of the Cross Keys public house. Carriers operated between the village and Hull on Mondays and Thursdays, Driffield and Gembling on Thursdays, and Bridlington on Saturdays. In the village was a Methodist and a Calvinist chapel. The church at the time was dedicated to All Saints. History The village consists largely of a single road running in a north-east to south-west direction, with the buildings grouped on either side. The road continues to the south-west to Bridgham. To the north-east, the road splits into two, one road leading to the hamlet of Gembling, and a second road turning towards the south-east and then the south to reach Beeford. To the west of the village, Foston Beck runs along the western edge of the settlement, while Old Howe Drain runs along the eastern and then the southern edge. Both then turn to the south-west, and join together at Frodingham Bridge, to become part of Frodingham Beck, once part of the Driffield Navigation.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map, Sheet 295, Foston Beck provided a source of water for milling for centuries. A mill is known to have been in operation in 1086, and the mill pond may possibly have been created by diverting Kelk Beck during the period of Danish settlement. Kelk Beck now becomes Foston Beck near the village. A new mill was built on the site in 1747. The open fields around Foston were enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1780, and special provision was made for the miller. This allowed him to divert the beck into a drainage ditch to allow him to carry out repairs to the mill or to scour the beck. Sir William St Quintin, 5th Baronet, the son of Sir William St Quintin, 4th Baronet, bought the mill in 1792, and spent some ¬£1,500 over the next four years on repairs and improvements. By the time he had finished, two water wheels drove four pairs of grinding stones. Equipment also included two flour cylinders, four bolting mills, two corn-screens, a fan and a corn-drying kiln. Access to the mill was possible by boat along Foston Beck from the Driffield Navigation. Water power was supplemented by a steam engine by 1854, the mill being one of only eleven in the county to be modernised in this way. It was also one of only four in the county to be fitted with rollers, which were used to produce fine white flour, of a quality which could not be produced by stones. The water wheels were subsequently replaced by a turbine, but the building burnt down in 1895‚Äì6. A new building was erected, and milling was recorded in 1925 and 1929. In 1970, the building was used by the adjacent farm, although it still contained a turbine. Although the manufacture of cloth was not significant in the area following the decline of the Beverley industry in the thirteenth century, a fulling mill was recorded at Foston in 1565, and three fulling mills were later recorded there. In addition to water power, there is the stump of a windmill close to the water mill. Foston was also the scene of development work following the passing of the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Act in 1798. In order to relieve flooding in the valley of the River Hull, water from the north of Foston, which formerly drained into the Hull, was diverted to a sea outfall at Barmston. In order to ensure that the water flowed in the opposite direction to the new outfall, various channels were made deeper, and a barrier was constructed at Foston, to prevent the water following its former course. Old Howe Lane, the road that runs from Foston to Beeford crosses the barrier, which is still labelled The Barrier on modern maps. The ditch to the north- east of the road flows northwards to the sea, and is called the Barmston Main Drain; that to the south-west is now the Old Howe Drain and flows to Frodingham Beck, the River Hull and the Humber to reach the sea. Two building within the village have been listed as being of architectural merit. The first is the church of St Andrew, which has been Grade II* listed since 1966. It consists of a nave dating from the twelfth century, a chancel dating from the early thirteenth, and the west tower, which dates from the late fourteenth century. There are various other early features, including a twelfth century tub font and an effigy of a knight which has been defaced. Nearby is a medieval cubical sandstone cross base, which is also listed. The other listed building is the Mill House, which forms part of Mill Farm. It is an early nineteenth century brick structure, with a pantiled roof, consisting of two storeys and a basement.

Mobster In 1975 or 1976, Agro became a \\"made man,\\" or full member, of the Gambino crime family. Agro was sponsored for membership by Joseph N. Gallo, the family consigliere and worked under Joseph Armone, one of Paul Castellano's most trusted associates. While Agro was never promoted above street-level soldier, he enjoyed a privileged relationship with family boss Paul Castellano. During this period, Agro was sent to prison for bookmaking. By 1976, Agro was dividing his time between New York and Palm Beach County, Florida. Relations with Joseph Iannuzzi In Florida, Agro chose mobster Joseph Iannuzzi as his representative. Iannuzzi enjoyed the attention and respect he received when Agro was in Florida. The two mobsters frequented the top nightspots and betting tracks. It was while at the greyhound racing tracks that Agro coined Iannuzzi's nickname, \\"Joe Dogs\\". Iannuzzi was given free rein to operate on behalf of Agro and the Gambino crime family. Iannuzzi operated bookmaking and loansharking while engaging in the occasional robbery and burglary. When Agro's sponsor, Joe N. Gallo, visited Florida, Iannuzzi would look after him. In 1980, the Agro/Iannuzzi relationship began to fizzle. Agro had previously lent Ianuzzi a sizeable amount of money to be used to facilitate a loanshark book. Ianuzzi was supposed to pay Agro several percentage basis points (\\"points\\") a week. Ianuzzi would then offer loans to fellow criminals and gamblers at several additional points. The difference, called the \\"spread,\\" would be Iannuzzi's profit. Ianuzzi would hold several weeks' or months' worth of interest (\\"vig\\"), delivering it to Agro whenever he visited New York. At other times, Agro would visit Iannuzzi in Florida to collect the interest. Agro had plans to invest the illegal interest into legitimate businesses. However, Ianuzzi soon fell several months behind in delivering the money to Agro. Later in 1980, while visiting New York, Ianuzzi deliberately snubbed Agro. On January 19, 1981, the enraged Agro found Ianuzzi at the Don Ritz Pizzeria on Singer Island, Florida and severely beat him with a baseball bat. After surviving this attack, Ianuzzi decided to start working as an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Since Ianuzzi had been assaulted with a bat, the FBI agents appropriately dubbed the case Operation Home Run. Ianuzzi now paid Agro the delinquent money (with funds supplied by the FBI), and Agro welcomed him back to the family. Ianuzzi now wore a hidden listening device whenever he met with Agro and other Florida mobsters. On one tape, Agro told Iannuzzi that he had survived the January attack only because the pizzeria owner's wife entered the room. On one occasion, Agro confessed to the murders of Lucchese associates Anthony DeSimone and Thomas DeSimone. However, Ianuzzi was not recording at that moment, so Agro was never convicted of these murders. Later years In 1984, Agro was prosecuted at the Home Run trials in Florida for loan sharking, extortion, and attempted murder. After being sentenced to fifteen years in a federal penitentiary, Agro fled to Quebec, where he was joined by LuAnn. The couple later moved to the Nuns' Island section of Montreal, where he deserted LuAnn for another woman, Ann Okcha. Later in 1984, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested Agro. He was soon repatriated to the United States and sent to prison. In 1986, Agro was released from prison due to an inoperable brain tumor. On February 11, 1987, Agro pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges in a court session held in his hospital room at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. Agro died later in 1987. In popular culture * In the 1990 film Goodfellas, the character \\"Vinnie\\" (played by Charles Scorsese, the father of director Martin Scorsese) is based on Agro.

Bridgers was the athletic director at Florida State University from 1973 to 1979 and at the University of New Mexico from 1979 to 1987. He also worked as an assistant coach in the National Football League with the Baltimore Colts (1957‚Äì1958) and Pittsburgh Steelers (1969). Coaching career Bridgers began his career as an assistant coach at the Sewanee: The University of the South (1947‚Äì1951), was head coach for the First Cavalry Division Artillery Team in Hokkaido, Japan in 1952 and was head football and track coach at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore from 1953 to 1956. In 1957 and 1958 he served as a coach/coordinator for the Baltimore Colts, where he developed their pro-style offense attack. He carried that style with him in 1959, coming to Baylor to replace the fired Sam Boyd. During his Baylor tenure, he compiled a 49‚Äì53‚Äì1 (.481) record. In his first five seasons, he led the Bears to three bowl games, winning two of them. He installed the Colts' wide-open passing game at Baylor, helping make All-Americans of quarterback Don Trull and wide receiver Lawrence Elkins after a record-breaking 1963 season. In the Bears' 1966 season opener against Syracuse at Baylor Stadium, Bridgers sent in John Hill Westbrook, making the sophomore running back the first black athlete to play for a Southwest Conference school. Bridgers spent a year on Chuck Noll's first Pittsburgh Steelers staff, where he urged the coach to consider drafting a player he tried to recruit for Baylor, a quarterback named Terry Bradshaw. After the Steelers took Bradshaw with the first overall pick in the 1970 NFL Draft they won four Super Bowls in the next decade. Administrative career After Bridgers left Pittsburgh for an assistant's job at the University of South Carolina, he became athletic director at Florida State University in 1973. Despite inheriting a $1 million athletic deficit, he turned the program around with the single most important hire in school history, convincing another talented coach from Alabama, Hall of Famer Bobby Bowden to leave West Virginia for the Seminoles. Turning around another struggling athletic program, Bridgers left Florida State for the University of New Mexico in 1979, where his win brother Frank was a principal of a major engineering firm. He encountered a program where major NCAA infractions had surfaced in the basketball program under Norm Ellenberger, prompting an FBI investigation into transcript-rigging. Bridgers turned the scandal-ridden program around by hiring Gary Colson, and headed the athletic department as the football Lobos under Joe Morrison enjoyed a 10‚Äì1 season in 1982. Death Bridgers died in Albuquerque, New Mexico of congestive heart failure at the age of 84.

Biography At the age of 10, he was sufficiently advanced in his training for the rabbinate to follow the elaborate lectures of Jonathan Eybesch√ºtz. Later, Carmoly studied successively at Frankfurt, under the direction of Jacob Joshua Falk (author of Pene Yehoshu'a), and at Metz, under Samuel Helman, who conferred upon him the title of rabbi. On returning home, in compliance with the wish of his father, Carmoly began the study of medicine under the direction of Jacob Assur, a physician of Nancy, but had to give it up, being engrossed with his Talmudical studies. The only benefit he derived from his tutor was a fair knowledge of mathematics, of which he made use later. Carmoly married the daughter of a rich banker named Joseph Raineau. The latter persuaded the bishop of Sulz to create a rabbinate in his see; and Carmoly was appointed rabbi of Sulz. Carmoly was the author of a commentary on the Tosefta to the treatise Betzah, published, together with the text, under the title Yam Yissakhar (Sea of Issachar; Metz, 1769).

They form around 13.8% of the total population (2010).Global Religious Landscape. Pew Forum. History Many of the inhabitants of Qatar were introduced to Christianity after the religion was dispersed eastward by Mesopotamian Christians from 224 AD onwards. Monasteries were constructed in Qatar during this era. During the latter part of the Christian era, Qatar was known by the Syriac name 'Beth Qatraye'. A variant of this was 'Beth Catara'.PROCEEDINGS OF THE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE PROTESTANT EPISCOPA; CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AT MEETING HELD IN PHILADELPHIA IN AUGUST AND SEPT. 1835, p. 65 The name translates to 'region of the Qataris'. The region was not limited to Qatar; it also included Bahrain, Tarout Island, Al-Khatt, and Al- Hasa. In 628, most of the Arab tribes converted to Islam. It is likely that some settled populations in Qatar did not immediately convert to Islam. Isaac of Nineveh, a 7th-century Syriac Christian bishop regarded as a saint in some churches, was born in Qatar. Other notable Christian scholars dating to this period who hailed from the Qatari Peninsula include Dadisho Qatraya, Gabriel of Qatar and Ahob of Qatar. In 674, the bishops of Beth Qatraye stopped attending synods; although the practice of Christianity persisted in the region until the late 9th century. Religious Complex, Doha In May 2005, representatives of Christian churches in Qatar signed an agreement with the Qatari Government for a fifty-year lease on a large piece of property in Mesaimeer on the outskirts of Doha on which they intended to erect six churches at their own expense. The churches were expected to pay nominal lease fees of a few hundred dollars a year, renewable after ten years. The property was expected to include an Anglican church that may also be used by other Protestant denominations, a church to serve thirty four Indian-Christian congregations, a church for the country's small but influential Coptic community, and a site for two Orthodox churches, one Greek and one Eastern Rite. In December 2005, the foundation stone for the Catholic Church was laid and the ground-breaking took place at the end of April 2006. A board composed of members of all the Christian churches liaises directly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding church matters. Each church has been granted permission to apply for visas for visiting clerics to preside over and assist in church services. Previously, Catholics and other Christians were limited to informal group meetings in homes. The Anglican Church of the Epiphany, was officially opened on 21 September 2013 and consecrated on 28 September 2013. The church sanctuary can accommodate up to 650 worshipers. The Anglican Centre, managed by the Anglican Church in Qatar, accommodates 59 additional Evangelical, Pentecostal and Protestant congregations. The St Issac and St George Greek Orthodox Church serves the orthodox communities numbering about 10,000 people from the Middle East, Asia, Syria and Africa.

Operation The Night of the Trains (or Operation Party) was a sabotage operation, targeting the British railways in Palestine on November 1, 1945. The operation was one of the first carried out by the Jewish Resistance Movement, before its official establishment, and symbolized its founding. During the operation Palmach units sabotaged a network of railways around the country and blew up three British guard boats in Jaffa port and in Haifa, and a combined Irgun‚ÄìLehi unit attacked Lydda railway station, which is the key junction between the Haifa ‚Äì El Kantara main line and the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem railway. An estimated 1,000 men were involved in the operations.Horne, Edward (1982). A Job Well Done (Being a History of The Palestine Police Force 1920‚Äì1948). The Anchor Press. . p. 289. Approximately fifty Palmach units, which included sappers and guard, severely damaged 153 points along the railway system in Mandate Palestine, primarily at railway junctions and bridges above them. The operations took place around 11:00 p.m., fully synchronized, in order to prevent a British response. In only two places did shootings occur, and they both ended with no casualties. Over 242 breaks in the railway lines were made, and a stationmaster's office, telephone installation, and petrol wagon were bombed. At the same time, the Palmach's marine unit, the Palyam, sank three British guard boats; two in Haifa and one in Jaffa. These boats were part of the closure imposed on the shores in order to prevent Jewish immigration. In Haifa Yohai Ben-Nun led the operation and in Jaffa, Yossi Harel and Zalman Cohen did, after a briefing by Yitzhak Sadeh. In both cases the sappers arrived in boats, dived under the British boats and attached explosives with a delay mechanism to the boats. That same night an Irgun unit, led by Eitan Livni, raided a train station in Lod. While exchanges of fire were going on the fighters destroyed a train engine and damaged six others. During the raid an Irgun fighter, two British (one soldier and one policeman) and four Arabs were killed. The operation took relatively heavy toll, most likely because the raiding team was late in arriving at the target, meaning the British were already on high alert.Horne. p. 289. Gives the number of locomotives put out of action as 5, and that two staff, a soldier and a policeman were killed. A Lehi unit launched a sabotage operation against the oil refinery in Haifa, but the explosives detonated prematurely as they were being carried, killing the Lehi member carrying them. Severe damage was caused to the facility, but the oil tanks, which were the intended target, were left untouched. A subsequent confrontation at Ramat Hakovesh lead to the area becoming a \\"No Go\\" area for British forces. Two weeks later the District Office in Tel Aviv was set on fire and in the riots that followed, involving 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, six Jews were killed.Horne. p. 290. Aftermath The operation raised morale in the Yishuv, after the heavy restrictions by the British on Aliyah and settlement. The operation mostly created satisfaction within the Yishuv leadership and Palmach and Haganah members that saw that they were able to simultaneously operate a large number of units in a large number of locations. David Ben-Gurion wrote to the leadership of the Haganah that this operation has its rewards‚Äîthough they may not be immediate. The response in Britain was great as well. Government officials condemned the operation and the press published detailed articles about the sabotage actions.

An academic research paper pointed out some weaknesses of two popular P2P networks in protecting user's privacy. The research analyzed Gnutella and eMule protocols and found weaknesses in the protocol; many of the issues found in these networks are fundamental and probably common on other P2P networks. Users of file sharing networks, such as eMule and Gnutella, are subject to monitoring of their activity. Clients may be tracked by IP address, DNS name, software version they use, files they share, queries they initiate, and queries they answer to. Much is known about the network structure, routing schemes, performance load and fault tolerance of P2P systems in general and Gnutella in particular. This document concentrates on the user privacy that reveals by the Gnutella and eMule networks. It might be surprising, but the eMule protocol does not provide much privacy to the users, although it is a P2P protocol which is supposed to be decentralized.  The Gnutella and eMule protocols = The eMule protocol  eMule is one of the clients which implements the eDonkey network. The eMule protocol consists of more than 75 types of messages. When an eMule client connects to the network, it first gets a list of known eMule servers which can be obtained from the Internet. Despite the fact that there are millions of eMule clients, there are only several hundred servers. The client connects to a server with TCP connection. That stays open as long as the client is connected to the network. Upon connecting, the client sends a list of its shared files to the server. By this the server builds a database with the files that reside on this client. The server also returns a list of other known servers. The server returns an ID to the client, which is a unique client identifier within the system. The server can only generate query replies to clients which are directly connected to it. The download is done by dividing the file into parts and asking each client a part.  The Gnutella protocol  Gnutella protocol v0.4 = In Gnutella protocol V0.4 all the nodes are identical, and every node may choose to connect to every other. The Gnutella protocol consist of 5 message types: query for tile search. Query messages use a flooding mechanism, i.e. each node that receives a query forwards it on all of its links. A node that receives a query and has the appropriate file replies with a query hit message. A hop count field in the header limits the message lifetime. Ping and Pong messages are used for detecting new nodes that can be linked to the actual file download performed by opening TCP connection and using the HTTP GET mechanism. = Gnutella protocol v0.6 = Gnutella protocol V0.6 includes several modifications: A node has one of two operational modes: \\"leaf node\\" or \\"ultrapeer\\". Initially each node starts in a leaf node mode in which it can only connect to ultrapeers. The leaf nodes send query to an ultrapeer, the ultrapeer forwards the query and waits for the replies. When a node has enough bandwidth and uptime, the node may become an ultrapeer. Ultrapeers send periodically a request for their clients to send a list with the shared files they have. If a query arrives with a search string that matches one of the files in the leaves, the ultrapeer replies and pointing to the specific leaf.  Tracking initiators and responders  In version 0.4 of the Gnutella protocol, an ultrapeer which receives a message from a leaf node (message with hop count zero) knows for sure that the message was originated from that leaf node. In version 0.6 of the protocol, If an ultrapeer receives a message from an ultrapeer with hop count zero then it knows that the message originated by the ultrapeer or by one of its leaves (The average number of the leaves nodes that are connected to an ultrapeer is 200).  Tracking a single node  Many clients of Gnutella have an HTTP monitor feature. This feature allows sending information about the node to any node which supports an empty HTTP request, and receiving on response. Research shows that a simple crawler which is connected to Gnutella network can get from an initial entry point a list of IP addresses which are connected to that entry point. Then the crawler can continue to inquire for other IP addresses. An academic research performed the following experiment: At NYU, a regular Gnucleus software client that was connected to the Gnutella network as a leaf node, with distinctive listening TCP port 44121. At the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel, a crawler ran looking for client listening with port 44121. In less than 15 minutes the crawler found the IP address of the Gnucleus client in NYU with the unique port.  IP address harvesting  If a user is connected to the Gnutella network within, say, the last 24 hours, that user's IP address can be easily harvested by hackers, since the HTTP monitoring feature can collect about 300,000 unique addresses within 10 hours.  Tracking nodes by GUID creation  A Globally unique identifier (GUID) is a 16 bytes field in the Gnutella message header, which uniquely identifies every Gnutella message. The protocol does not specify how to generate the GUID. Gnucleus on Windows uses the Ethernet MAC address used as the GUID 6 lower bytes. Therefore, Windows clients reveal their MAC address when sending queries. In the JTella 0.7 client software the GUID is created using the Java random number without an initialization. Therefore, on each session, the client creates a sequence of queries with the same repeating IDs. Over time, a correlation between the user queries can be found.  Collecting miscellaneous information users  The monitoring facility of Gnutella reveals an abundance of precious information on its users. It is possible to collect the information about the software vendor and the version that the clients use. Other statistical information about the client is available as well: capacity, uptime, local files etc. In Gnutella V0.6, information about client software can be collected (even if the client does not support HTTP monitoring). The information is found in the first two messages connection handshake.  Tracking users by partial information  Some Gnutella users have a small look-alike set, which makes it easier to track them by knowing this very partial information.  Tracking users by queries  An academic research team performed the following experiment: the team ran five Gnutella as ultrapeer (in order to listen to other nodes‚Äô queries). The team revealed about 6% of the queries.  Usage of hash functions  SHA-1 hashes refer to SHA-1 of files not search strings. Half of the search queries are strings and half of them are the output of a hash function (SHA-1) applied on the string. Although the usage of hash function is intended to improve the privacy, an academic research showed that the query content can be exposed easily by a dictionary attack: collaborators ultrapeers can gradually collect common search strings, calculate their hash value and store them into a dictionary. When a hashed query arrives, each collaborated ultrapeer can check matches with the dictionary and expose the original string accordingly.  Measures  A common countermeasure used is concealing a user's IP address when downloading or uploading content by using anonymous networks, such as I2P - The Anonymous Network. There is also data encryption and the use of indirect connections (mix networks) to exchange data between peers. Thus all traffic is anonymized and encrypted. Unfortunately, anonymity and safety come at the price of much lower speeds, and due to the nature of those networks being internal networks there currently still is less content. However, this will change, once there are more users.

It runs from the Red River (where it crosses into Texas as State Highway 78) to Tishomingo. It has no lettered spur routes. Route description SH-78 crossing the Red River State Highway 78 enters Oklahoma across the Red River on the State Highway No. 78 Bridge at the Red River, near the unincorporated community of Karma. Near Yuba, SH-78 curves west to head toward Achille, where it meets State Highway 91. It curves back north here, meets State Highway 70E, and then passes through the east part of Durant, where it crosses US-70. In northern Durant, SH-78 has an interchange with the US-69/75 freeway. Three miles north of US-69/75, SH-78 turns west to head through Cobb and Brown before turning north to meet State Highway 199. It meets SH-22 for the first time at Nida. It then passes through Emet and turns back west at Milburn. It then meets SH-22 for a second time three miles (5 km) east of Tishomingo. It then joins SH-22 into Tishomingo, where it ends at US-377/SH-99. History The road that would become SH-78 was originally commissioned as SH-299 on 1938-11-22. SH-299 was renumbered to SH-78 in its entirety in 1955, most likely to match the route number of TX-78. Previous Routes SH-78 was originally designated as a route from Boise City to the Texas Border.

CRUM takes into consideration several theoretical approaches of understanding human cognition, including logic, rule, concept, analogy, image, and connection based systems. These serve as the representation aspects of CRUM theory which are then acted upon to simulate certain aspects of human cognition, such as the use of rule- based systems in neuroeconomics.

He remained loyal to James at the 1688 Glorious Revolution, accompanied him into exile and was appointed Major-General of Jacobite forces in Scotland after the death of Viscount Dundee in July 1689. He was replaced by Thomas Buchan in early 1690 but served as his subordinate until both were given safe passage to France in 1692. Little is known of his later career; he was mentioned as still being in Jacobite service in 1708 and died sometime after that.  Life  Arnmannoch Alexander Cannon or Cannan was born in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, in the western province of Galloway; his family were members of the small Scottish Catholic community and in 1640 when Alexander was born, they were recorded as 'delinquents' by the Covenanter government that ruled Scotland. Details of his background are scarce but the Cannan or Cannon family owned properties at Arnmannoch and Knocklea. This makes it likely they were involved in trading cattle between Ulster and Galloway, which may account for Alexander being referred to as 'Irish' by some writers.  Career  James VII and II Cannon spent much of his career in the Scots Brigade, a unit in Dutch service under William of Orange; despite the name, for much of this period it contained three English and three Scottish regiments. In July 1680, he became Colonel of one of the English regiments and accompanied it to England in 1685 when the Brigade was sent to help James II suppress the Monmouth rebellion. The revolt quickly collapsed and the Brigade returned to the Netherlands without seeing action but Cannon remained and in August 1685, he was appointed Lt-Colonel of the newly formed Queen Consort's Light Dragoons, the Duke of Somerset filling the largely ceremonial post of Colonel. In August 1687, Cannon succeeded Somerset as Colonel when the Duke fell from favour and was with James when William landed at Torbay on 5 November 1688, in the invasion known as the Glorious Revolution. The Royal army simply changed sides, including the majority of Cannon's regiment; he went into exile with James and on 31 December 1688, Richard Leveson replaced him as Colonel. In March 1689, Cannon accompanied James when he landed in Ireland in an attempt to regain his throne, initiating the Williamite War in Ireland. A simultaneous rising in Scotland was launched by Viscount Dundee; this relied on support from Jacobite-controlled areas in County Antrim, which was far more difficult after the loss of Kintyre in May. On 27 June 1689, Dundee wrote to Melfort, James' Secretary of State, asking for 3,000 to 5,000 troops and munitions of various kinds. However, this was impacted by the factional struggle between Jacobite Compounders and Non-Compounders who were reluctant to divert resources needed in Ireland. The Non-Compounders sought to replace Dundee with Thomas Buchan but he was needed for the siege of Derry. Instead, Cannon and 300 men were ferried across the Irish Sea in small boats, landing at Duart on 21 July and reaching Blair Castle on 26 July in time for the Battle of Killiecrankie, where Dundee was killed in the closing stages. Cannon assumed command but contemporaries like Lochiel considered him a poor choice, handicapped by his unfamiliarity with Highland customs and inability to speak Gaelic. Lochiel later claimed he also spent much of his time drinking with the Earl of Dunfermline, although heavy drinking was hardly unusual in this period. Dunkeld; the Cameronians repel the Highlander assault Victory at Killiecrankie did little to change the strategic position; in February 1690, Buchan and Lochiel mirrored Dundee's letter of June 1689 by requesting money, weapons plus 4,000-foot and 1,000 cavalry.Macpherson, pp. 375‚Äì376 These demands were unrealistic, while the lack of support from the Scottish nobility led to a request that James' illegitimate son the Duke of Berwick be appointed leader. Obtaining supplies still required access to a major port; since the Royal Navy had re-established control over the Irish Sea by breaking the Siege of Derry, Cannon headed for Aberdeenshire, an area dominated by the Catholic Gordons and an Episcopalian and Royalist stronghold since the 1630s.Robertson. pp. 25‚Äì53 Bridge over the Spey at Cromdale; the Jacobites were taken by surprise and retreated across the river here in May 1690 However, an advance on Edinburgh was blocked by Stirling Castle which the Jacobites failed to capture in 1746 with considerably better siege equipment, while lack of cavalry made them vulnerable in the open. Even experienced leaders like Dundee found it hard to keep a Highland army in the field, while the increase in numbers after Killiecrankie to 4,000 ‚Äì 5,000 did not necessarily improve fighting capacity. Supplying a force of this size was far more difficult and the new recruits included many like the MacGregors who saw it primarily as an opportunity for raiding.Lenman, p. 45 Once Cannon was prevented from reaching Aberdeen, his options were limited; the Battle of Dunkeld on 21 August makes little strategic sense since Highland tactics were unsuited to urban warfare and they were repulsed with heavy losses. The Jacobite army now effectively disbanded itself by going home while Cannon and his remaining Irish troops spent the winter on the Island of Mull. In February 1690, Thomas Buchan assumed command but their force of 800 men were scattered at the Battle of Cromdale in May, although Cannon, Buchan and several others escaped. They now retraced Cannon's route the previous year by heading for Aberdeenshire and managed to assemble several hundred men but lacked the means to attack Aberdeen itself, while the government army continued to pursue him and his forces once more dwindled away. Effective Jacobite resistance ceased with the surrender of Kenneth Mackenzie, 4th Earl of Seaforth; Cannon and Buchan took refuge first in Mull, then Lochaber, where they were protected by the MacDonald chief Glengarry. After the Highland chiefs swore allegiance to the new government in January 1692, Cannon and Buchan were given safe conduct passes to leave Scotland, landing at Le Havre in April. Details of his later life are scarce but the exiled Jacobite politician and agent George Lockhart records being accompanied by Cannon on a visit to Scotland in March 1708.

Kwabena Nketia Profile\\" , GhanaWeb. In 1949 he began three years' study at Birkbeck College, University of London, and Trinity College of Music, London, obtaining a B.A. degree. In 1958 a Rockefeller Fellowship allowed him to go to the United States, where he attended Columbia University (studying with Henry Cowell), the Juilliard School, and Northwestern University, studying musicology and composition. He was a professor of music at UCLA and the University of Pittsburgh, and lectured in many prestigious universities worldwide, including Harvard University, Stanford University, University of Michigan, City University London, the University of Brisbane in Australia, the University of Kansas, Lawrence, and the China Conservatory of Music, Beijing.K. Gyan- Apenteng, \\"Nketia and Nrican Nketsia at PAWA Pan-African Lecture on Wednesday\\" , 25 February 2013. He was a professor of music at the University of Ghana, Legon, Accra, where he began teaching in 1952. He directed the International Centre for African Music and Dance (ICAMD). He taught at the Presbyterian Training College, Akropong, serving as the Acting Principal in 1952. According to GhanaWeb: \\"His concept and interpretation of time and rhythmic patterns in Ghanaian and other African folk music were revolutionary, and became standard for researchers and scholars around the world.\\" He introduced, for example, the use of the more readable time signature in his compositions as an alternative to the use of duple () time with triplets that was used earlier by his mentor and teacher, Ephraim Amu. Although this practice undermined Amu's theory of a constant basic pulse in African music, and generated debate, Nketia pointed out that the constant use of triplets in a duple time signature was misleading. Many scholars nowadays have found his theory useful in transcribing African music. He composed for both Western and African instruments, and wrote more than 200 publications, including his world- acclaimed The Music of Africa, which was translated into German, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese. Awards and honours Nketia was honoured with many awards in Ghana, including the Companion of the Order of the Star of Ghana, the Grand Medal of the Government of Ghana (Civil Division), a DLitt (Honoris Causa) of the University of Ghana, the Ghana Book Award, ECRAG Special Honour Award (1987), Ghana Gospel Music Special Award (2003), and the ACRAG Flagstar Award (1993). He was a Member of Honour of the International Music Council.

Midstar-1 was launched into a 492km low earth orbit (LEO) on March 8, 2007, aboard an Atlas V expendable launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, along with FalconSat 3, STPSat 1, and CFESat as secondary payloads. The primary payload was Orbital Express. CFTP Purpose The Configurable Fault Tolerant Processor Project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for spacecraft computer processing by applying various fault tolerance techniques to the designs. CFTP provides a valuable testbed for on-orbit evaluation of various fault tolerant concepts. The use of FPGAs provides added flexibility, allowing on-orbit upgrades and rapid development cycles. Using Commercial off the shelf (COTS) technology allows the engineer to produce more technologically advanced designs at a lower cost and in a shorter time than using more traditional space-grade components. Space-based FPGA design also provides the Naval Postgraduate School students with unique challenges in developing for and configuring the system. Remotely accessing the platform over a limited downlink and uplink provides challenges not seen on ground-based systems. CFTP Versions=CFTP-1 The CFTP-1 board utilizes Xilinx Virtex I parts for both the control and experiment FPGAs. The complete CFTP payload, as delivered to MidSTAR-1, consists of the CFTP board itself (shown in the spacecraft image above), an ARM processor board that communicates with the control FPGA on the CFTP board through a PC/104 bus, and a power supply board. The ARM processor board communicates with the spacecraft's Command and Data Handler (C&DH;) computer through a serial PPP link. CFTP-1 underwent radiation testing at the UC Davis' cyclotron facility prior to integration with the MidSTAR satellite. CFTP-2 The CFTP-2 system is currently an entirely ground based system. The CFTP-2 board itself is set up nearly identically to the CFTP-1 board, however it utilizes a Xilinx Virtex 2 part as the experiment FPGA, rather than the Xilinx Virtex I part on CFTP-1. This system was tested in a proton beam using the University of California at Davis' cyclotron.

Academic history In 1964 Luciano Maiani received his degree in physics and he became a research associate at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† in Italy. During that same year he collaborated with Raoul Gatto's theoretical physics group at the University of Florence. He crossed the Atlantic in 1969 to do a post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard's Lyman Laboratory of Physics. In 1976 Maiani became a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Rome, however he traveled widely during this period, holding visiting professorships at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure of Paris (1977) and CERN (1979‚Äì1980 and 1985‚Äì1986). Maiani also took an interest in the direction of particle physics research start on CERN's Scientific Policy Committee from 1984 to 1991. Then, in 1993, he became president of Italy's Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN). From 1993 to 1996 Maiani served as a scientific delegate in CERN council and then as that council's president in 1997. Thereafter he became director general of CERN, serving from 1 January 1999 through the end of 2003. From 1995-1997 Maiani chaired the Italian Comitato Tecnico Scientifico, Fondo Ricerca Applicata. At the end of 2007 he was proposed as president of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, but his nomination was suspended temporally after he signed a letter criticizing the rector of 'La Sapienza' University in Rome, who invited Pope Benedict XVI to give a lectio magistralis in 2008.Aprileonline.info: CNR, Maiani e il giudizio divino However he became the President of CNR since 2008. Luciano Maiani has authored over 100 scientific publications on the theory of elementary particles often with several co-authors. In 1970 he predicted the charmed quark in a paper with Glashow and Iliopoulos which was later discovered at SLAC and Brookhaven in 1974 and led to a Nobel Prize in Physics for the discoverers. Working with Guido Altarelli in 1974 they explained that the observed octet enhancement in weak non-leptonic decays was due to a leading gluon exchange effect in quantum chromodynamics. They later extended this effect to describe the weak non- leptonic decays of charm and bottom quarks as well and also produced a parton model description of heavy flavor weak decays. In 1976 Maiani analyzed the CP violation in the six-quark theory and predicted the very small electric dipole moment of the neutron. In the 1980s he started using the numerical simulation of lattice QCD and this led to the first prediction of the decay constant of pseudoscalar charmed mesons and of B mesons. A proponent of supersymmetry, Maiani once said that the search for it was \\"primary goal of modern particle physics\\".CERN Press Release ‚Äì Professor Luciano Maiani is chosen as next Director General of CERN He has not confined his interest to the theoretical side of physics either, with involvement in ALPI, EUROBALL, DAFNE, VIRGO and the LHC.

Biography Dominick Cataldo was born in Lower East Side, Manhattan in a small apartment on Essex Street, his father Samuel Cataldo was a Sicilian immigrant from San Cataldo and member of the Profaci crime family. Dominick and his brother Joseph Cataldo both joined the Colombo family. In 1972, Cataldo started an illegal bookmaking operation and casino out of an after- nights club located on 87th Street just across Atlantic Avenue, which was one block over and one block down from Salvatore Polisi's apartment on 95th Avenue and 88th Street. He lived a quiet life in Valley Stream, NY which was home to many Mafioso in the 60s,70s and 80s. The Gerard Pappa murder On June 16, 1980, Colombo/Genovese crime family associate/Soldier Gerard Pappa was shot to death in a Brooklyn luncheonette by a Colombo hit squad. It was for revenge of carrying out the murder of suspected Colombo police informant Ralph Spero, the uncle of mobster Angelo Sepe. He was murdered by Dominick and his nephews Nicholas and Joseph. Knowing how hard Gerard would be to kill, that he was always armed, very fast and very game, they were hiding in the luncheonette's rear kitchen when he arrived. They approached him from behind and shot him in the head with a sawed-off shotgun, literally blowing his head to pieces. He was killed instantly. Sammy Gravano later spoke of feeling great sadness and remorse for the loss of his childhood friend. Genovese crime family mob boss Vincent Gigante was suspected of handing down the murder contract, but was acquitted of his alleged involvement in the murder in 1997. Indictment and incarceration The \\"books\\" for membership into La Cosa Nostra had been officially closed since the late 1950s. Following the death of Carlo Gambino in 1976, the last remaining mob boss to have decried such a rule, the books for proposed members were reopened. Cataldo received his membership into the Colombo family in the late 1970s. In 1981, Cataldo was convicted of providing unlicensed 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol and a silencer to an undercover federal agent. On October 26, 1984, Cataldo was indicted on federal racketeering charges that included extortion, theft, loansharking, illegal gambling, bribery and drug trafficking. Because of the testimony and evidence gathered by Ianuzzi and also by his supposed protege, Sal 'The Rat' Polisi, during Operation Homerun, Cataldo was convicted for a host of racketeering crimes or Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act predicate acts. In 1985, Cataldo was sentenced to 35 years in prison. On April 27, 1997, Cataldo died in prison of cancer.

The aging process in Guyana is supposedly greatly increased by the high humidity and steady temperature ‚Äì resulting in an 8 year old rum, for instance, having a maturity claimed to be equal to that of a 16-year-old spirit produced in colder climates.

Many East Londoners by rigid slum clearance moved out into the new estates of the Home Counties (some of which is now outer Greater London). The study was carried out in the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, in the East End of London and a new housing estate in Essex. The research was carried out by Michael Young and Peter Willmott, who had been an integral part of building the welfare state in Britain during the tenure of Clement Attlee and the Labour government between 1945-51. The study itself has been acknowledged by many sociologists and in its authors' critiques as being one of the most influential sociological studies of the twentieth century.New York Times - obituary to Michael Young Margalit Fox. 25 January 2002. Retrieved 2013-07-09 It is argued by some that it has inspired British sociology to take new paths away from the more traditional broad Functionalist versus Marxist dichotomy. It used social observation as its means to do so, going away from statistical information that had been previously preferred. In this sense, it counters the Structuralist (Positivist) model that posits statistics can always be found to prove cause and effect within society. The idea was to interact and understand a post-war community, to determine its aspirations, worries, doubts and insecurities. This key understanding moves the study into a more Interactionist line, about each individual's role within society. Indeed, it could also be linked to Max Weber's idea of empathy and \\"going deep\\" to comprehend the complexity of communities. In 1992, Michael Young and the Institute of Community Studies he founded commenced on a new survey of the area to examine the changes to the area and in particular to examine the conflict between the white working class and Bangladeshi immigrants which had become a major feature of the area. This was eventually published in 2005 after his death as The New East End: Kinship, Race and Conflict by Michael Young, Kate Gavron, Geoff Dench. On Wednesday 25 April 2007, The Guardian society section reported on the 50th Anniversary of the study. Madeleine Bunting expressed how \\"the voices they found described a world rich in social relationships, networks of dependence and mutual support that were central to the people's resilience in facing the adversity of insecure and low paid employment.\\" Bunting also mentions how the pair were amongst the first to discover \\"social capital\\" and its role in shaping community life. It was the first British sociological study that really investigated deeply people's attitudes, beliefs and feelings. Using detailed prose and limited statistical analysis, it charted how decisions from the top affected ordinary people in their day-to-day and prospective lives. * References ;References Category:Sociology books Category:1957 non-fiction books Category:History of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets ","title":"Family and Kinship in East London"},{"id":"10914718","text":"Willie Dean \\"Deanie\\" Frazier (October 30, 1950 in Savannah, Georgia ‚Äì June 15, 2006) was the first African American woman sworn in under Judge Eugene Gadgsen as county commissioner in Savannah, and held the office of 5th district county commissioner for 14 years.

He is considered to be one of the greatest contemporary Chinese painters. Wu's artworks had both Western and Eastern influences, such as the Western style of Fauvism and the Eastern style of Chinese calligraphy. Wu had painted various aspects of China, including much of its architecture, plants, animals, people, as well as many of its landscapes and waterscapes in a style reminiscent of the impressionist painters of the early 1900s. He was also a writer on contemporary Chinese art.Michael Sullivan, Modern Chinese artists: a biographical dictionary, University of California Press, 2006, p175. Life Wu was born in a village in Yixing, Jiangsu province, in 1919. His family wanted him to become a teacher just like his father had been. In 1935, Wu passed the entrance exam and studied electrical engineering at Zhejiang Industrial School (ÊµôÊ±üÂÖ¨Á´ãÂ∑•‰∏ö‰∏ìÈó®Â≠¶Ê†°, a technical school of Zhejiang University) in Hangzhou. While in engineering school, Wu met an art student named Zhu Dequn who was studying at the National Hangzhou Academy of Art. During a trip to Zhu‚Äôs school, Wu got his first look at art and fell \\"madly in love\\" with it.Guanzhong, Wu, Lucy Lim, Xiong Bingming, Michael Sullivan, Richard Barnhart, James Cahill, and Chu-Tsing Li. Wu Guanzhong: A Contemporary Chinese Artist. San Francisco: Chinese Culture Foundation, 1989. Print. Against his father‚Äôs wishes, in 1936 he transferred to the art academy, studying both Chinese and Western painting under Pan Tianshou (1897-1971), Fang Ganmin (1906-1984), Wu Dayu (1903-1988), and Lin Fengmian (1900-1991). Wu went through many trials and challenges during his years in college before he could master his craft. In 1937 the Sino-Japanese War began and the campus had to pick up and relocate in order to get out of the way of the invading Japanese army. During the constant movement during the war, Wu was able to see many different locations. He considered the adventures as a necessary journey to becoming a man and building his character. Wu benefitted greatly from the many teachers who taught him to paint and the rough journey to becoming a man. In 1942 he graduated from Hangzhou National Academy of Art and tried to find a job. During the war jobs were hard to find and Wu took a part-time job as a substitute teacher. He later found a job as a water color and drawing teacher in the Architecture Department of Chongqing University. After Wu graduated he continued to hone his craft and studied with some of his old colleagues from school like Zhu Dequn, Li Lincan and Zheng Wei. Each of these friends continued their art careers and left their mark on the art scene. In 1946 Wu applied for one of the two art study abroad spots and was the best applicant who applied, this was in part to his French language studies. 1947 traveled to Paris to study at the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux Arts on the government scholarship. Even though France was still recovering from World War II, Wu was completely enthralled with the art. He visited all of the major museums within the first few days of his arrival. Wu was always a tremendous fan of French and European art. While in Europe, Wu realized the many cultural and religious differences between Europe and China. This was a difficult barrier for him to overcome to understand and appreciate some of the art. Wu found a great interest in the modern art of France despite his studying in European artistic traditions. He took a great liking to the Post- Impressionists like van Gogh, Gauguin and C√©zanne. Wu loved van Gogh the most because of van Gogh‚Äôs passion for art and the internal torment he endured. Wu also felt the hardships that Gauguin felt when he left Paris for a South Pacific island in order to find his own personal ideal. Gauguin eventually died on the island. This trip helped Wu grasp the idea of form and the basic meaning of art. The study abroad trip also led to formalism becoming the basic underlying element of his art and studying in France helped him better understand formalism. Wu returned to China in the summer of 1950 to the excitement that was brought by the new People‚Äôs Republic of China government. The government assigned jobs to all of the returning students who came back after the new government took control. Everyone felt anxious and excited to contribute to the building of a new nation. Wu introduced aspects of Western art to his students at the Central Academy of Fine Art in Beijing, where he taught from 1950 to 1953. He was excited to be the first Chinese artist to return from France with knowledge and theoretical framework for French modernism. While teaching, many peers criticized him because of jealousy over his job and because he was the only painter practicing formalism. The Academy was known to have been dominated by social realism and Wu was called \\"a fortress of bourgeois formalism\\". The issues became so bad he could no longer stay at the Central Academy and transferred. Between 1953 and 1964 he taught at Tsinghua University, Beijing and then Beijing Fine Arts Normal College. As a professor Wu was able to take many trips around the country and discover the expanse that was the new China. Wu was full of ambition and energy and travelled to many locations where his peers wouldn‚Äôt go. His life was going just how he wanted because he taught where his colleagues agreed on ideas, his students liked his approach and he could paint or sketch whenever he wanted. This is when Wu made a transition to landscape since he travelled all over the country. He was later appointed a Professor at the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts, Beijing in 1964. In August 1966, at the outset of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, Wu was prohibited from painting and writing about art, and many of his early works were destroyed. In 1970, at the age of 51, he and his wife were separated and assigned to almost 3 years of hard labor in the countryside as part of the Communist Party's vast re-education program. Wu stated, ‚ÄúLife was only planting rice, carrying coal, criticizing one another, and fighting one another‚Ä¶The only thing that no one was allowed to do was paint.‚Äù Following that period, he was only allowed to paint on Sundays (his day off from the fields) or on holidays. Wu didn‚Äôt suffer too much physical harm because he had destroyed many of his own paintings but this caused him much emotional harm. He heard of artists being persecuted and even killed so he knew he needed to burn the nude paintings since they would be severely criticized and frowned upon. Finally in 1972, he was allowed to return to Beijing to paint hotel murals and decorations. During the 1970s, Wu changed his style based on what others were doing at the time. Wu started painting with oil or watercolor in a Western style until he returned to Beijing and saw other artists using watercolor in the traditional Chinese style. In 1975 a Chinese art association in Japan wanted some paintings to exhibit but they wanted traditional Chinese ink paintings. Once again Wu changed his style to match the specifications and his work became a great hit. From here Wu moved on to another phase where he painted with oil and concentrated on the human body and the beauty of form. Wu also realized he could achieve the same beauty and form through landscape while using Chinese ink and color on paper. It was not until after Mao's death in 1976 that Wu, like many of his peers, was able to return to his art-making. This opened up the door for artists to branch out international. Unfortunately for most of the artists, there was an immense gap in artistic ideas between China and the rest of the world. The only one who seemed able to bridge this artistic gap was Wu. With the newfound freedom, Wu was able to break away from the old constraints and get back to the formalism style he originally loved. Along with being able to paint again, he was able to be more of a public figure in the art scene without fear of retribution. He wrote an essay for a May 1979 issue of Meishu titled ‚ÄúThe Beauty of Form in Painting‚Äù. He discussed his theory of formalism in the article as ‚ÄúA vast number of workers in art now hope for the opening of European modern painting to them, to discuss the scientific nature of the beauty of form. It is the microscope and surgical knife of formal art as a means to enrich and develop heritage. Oil painting must be nationalized; Chinese painting must be modernized. It seems that only after we have seen the Japanese painter Higashiyama Kai‚Äôs explorations have we come to have a clear understanding about the problems of uniting the East and West.‚Äù Wu has written many other articles based on his version of form and how it applies to modernism. He considered himself as primarily a painter and not as a theorist. Wu had the approach of going out and looking at nature to find something that piqued his interest. Then he would start with a preliminary sketch of what it was that he saw. Next he spent a great deal of time in the studio trying to figure out the best way to show the power of the form of the object. He would then paint quickly and impulsively with whatever European of Chinese brush felt right. Wu would go on painting for hours until he was too emotionally drained to continue. He had his first professional solo exhibition in 1979, and his career took off in the 1980s. He has been the solo exhibitionist in over 10 and been part of a joint exhibition in over 10 others. In 1991 Wu was made an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. Early in his career Guanzhong adopted the pen name Tu, which he used to sign his work. Wu died at the age of 90 on 25 June 2010 during night time in Beijing Hospital at Beijing.  Paintings = Twin Swallows  Among many of Wu Guanzhong‚Äôs paintings, Twin Swallows was the most outstanding and representative of his search for a synthesis of Western elements into traditional Chinese painting. It is a painting that captures both the static form of traditional Jiangnan architecture and the motion of two swallows as they fly toward a tree. Geometric shapes, especially rectangles, dominate half of the painting. For example, the front walls of the houses are horizontally placed white rectangles with simple black and gray lines to depict the edges and rooftop of each building. Doorways were painted in the same minimalistic manner, yet the contrast between the darkness inside the building with the lighter door frame is prominent enough to create a sense of depth. Wu‚Äôs attention to perspective and depth in Twin Swallow is a factor that distinguishes himself from many other traditional guohua painters. Although the white walls in Twin Swallows may seem like the dominating elements in this painting, it is in fact the pair of swallows that reveals Wu‚Äôs intention behind this painting. In the 1950s, Wu returned from France to his homeland. It was also a time when Chinese art entered the phase of socialist realism. This artistic movement had encouraged many artists to create artwork in order to contribute to the Chinese society. Similarly, Wu felt obligated to pass on the knowledge that he had gained in France to the younger generations in China in order to promote the idea of a synthesis among Western and traditional Chinese art.  Lion Grove Garden  Lion Grove Garden was painted in 1983. The subject of this painting, Lion Grove, is the largest rockery in Suzhou. Wu Guanzhong had successfully incorporated the use of lines, planes, and dots in this painting. The lines were used to express a sense of freedom, which was also what Chinese artists enjoyed after the Cultural Revolution. Unlike traditional guohua artists, Wu‚Äôs ink outlines no longer suggest the physical form of the rocks, but instead seem to suggest how Wu perceive this landscape. The forms of the rocks are shaped in diverse ways, some being round, uneven, and hollow. He paid careful attention to the ups and downs, concave and convex, caverns and peaks, and sizes of the rocks. Although the structure of the rockery is hardly identifiable in this painting, this sense of ambiguity further encourages viewers to use their imagination and look beyond what is presented in front of their eyes. About two-thirds of the paintings consist of sinuous lines and splashes of ink and colored dots, of green, yellow, purple and red, that reinforces the spontaneity and fluidity of the painting as each dot sparkles across the painting. Artistic element of planes, such as the rooftop of Suzhou-style pavilion, the bridge, and the cloister add a hint of realistic element. The foreground of this painting is a lightly shaded pale grey water where the fish reside. Although the foreground isn‚Äôt as eye- catching as the rockery, it grounds the complex elements in a stable dimension. Exhibitions Most of Wu‚Äôs early works were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. It is difficult to track down works from his early days. Wu had an exhibit in 1942 when he was in school and it was hosted by the Sha Ping Youth Palace.Farrer, Anne, Kuan-chung Wu, Michael Sullivan, and Mei- ch ªing Kao. Wu Guanzhong: A Twentieth-century Chinese Painter. London: Published for the Trustees of the British Museum by British Museum, 1992. Print. Wu Guanzhong has had solo exhibitions in major art galleries and museums around the world, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Taipei, Korea, France, England and the USA. His paintings were exhibited at the British Museum in 1992; Wu was the first living Chinese artist to have an exhibition there. One of his paintings, Seascape at Beidaihe (1977), was shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as part of an exhibition of paintings from the collection of art dealer Robert H. Ellsworth . His work may also be seen in the collection of the Hong Kong Museum of Art.Hong Kong Museum of Art: Exhibition spring 2010 In 2008, Wu donated 113 works to the Singapore Art Museum (SAM). This donation is the largest Wu Guanzhong donation to a public museum. In 2010, Wu donated works to the Hong Kong Art Museum. Quotes by Wu Guanzhong ‚ÄúThrough painting landscapes I have grown to love my motherland even more and wish to be forever intoxicated in her embrace.‚Äù This particular quote gives us deeper insight to the deep appreciation for China and the land that Wu Guanzhong had. ‚ÄúFor people‚Äôs hearts to communicate, there must be genuine emotion to strike a chord. Whether the feelings and perceptions of modern Chinese can find resonance in the West depends on the emotions, if they are true or false. Intelligent viewers can discern what is real and what is false.‚Äù Here, Wu Guanzhong explains that in order for people (such as those of the East and the West) to communicate there must be real emotions that can strike a chord with the other's audience. ‚ÄúAbstract beauty is the heart of the beauty of figurative art. It is a natural thing to which we all respond. As a child loves to play with a kaleidoscope, so everyone likes pure form and color.‚Äù Wu Guanzhong explains abstract beauty, which shows his appreciation for abstract art along with his traditional Chinese training. \\"So often there is conflict between them, and this is my greatest sorrow....Whatever I have written is to try to help our own people to understand and to get rid of their fear and suspicion of abstraction in Western art. So I can only start talking from a point of semi-abstract art, which is easier to understand. But even when I talked this away, recently there were lots of argument and objections.‚Äù This specific quote shows how difficult it was in China to integrate abstract Western art as a result of their fears and how this impedes Wu Guanzhong's ability to freely discuss it. ‚Äú‚ÄôImage‚Äô exists in the objective world. Not all images are beautiful. The discerning power of the artists eye lies in its ability to recognize the beauty in images, to grasp the elements that constitute this beauty, and to bring this beauty out in his expression, thus creating a sense of sympathy in the audience!‚Äù This quote explains Wu Guanzhong's belief that the audience should feel a sense of sympathy with the painting. ‚ÄúIn searching for all the marvelous peaks to make sketches, for thirty years during winter, summer, spring, and autumn, I carried on my back the heavy painting equipment and set foot in the river towns, mountain villages, thick forests, and snowy peaks ‚Äì from the farthest corner of the Eastern Sea to the border towns of Tibet, from the ruins of ancient Greek Gaochang (in Xinjiang) to the isles of seagulls, I stayed in truck stops, courtyards of fishermen‚Äôs homes, factory buildings, and broken temples....In all of these I trained myself to develop endurance.‚Äù We see through this quote Wu Guanzhong's struggles on his journey of becoming a landscape painter and how this resulted in him becoming stronger.

He combines traditional Newfoundland folk music with Manouche gypsy jazz similar to the way that gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt infused jazz with gypsy melody. He is also a composer for film and television. Biography Born in Carbonear, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada Andrews grew up exposed to the island‚Äôs m√©lange of cultural influences ‚Äì a mix of English, French, Irish, Scottish, Spanish and Portuguese - and his development as a guitarist reflects that. After graduating from the Jazz Studies program at St. Francis Xavier University with honours, Andrews spent several years studying contemporary music composition at the Conservatoire de Paris and at the Conservatoire National de Region in Marseille, France. It was during his time in France that Reinhardt's music had a profound impact on Andrews. Upon returning to his home province of Newfoundland and Labrador, he began combining traditional Newfoundland music with Reinhardt's style and his own original compositions. This work resulted in the 2004 release of his debut solo CD, titled Duane Andrews, the 2006 release of the multiple award-winning Crocus, the 2008 release Raindrops which features a collaboration with the Atlantic String Quartet and two albums in collaboration with Cape Breton master fiddler Dwayne C√¥t√©, Dwayne C√¥t√© and Duane Andrews (2010) and The Empress (2012). Other notable collaborations include Charlie‚Äôs Boogie (2013) with bluegrass guitarist/singer/songwriter extraordinaire Craig Young which evolved into Fretboard Journey (2016) with the addition of fellow Newfoundland guitarists Sandy Morris and Gordon Quinton.

Notable members of the family include clergy (Congregationalists), educators, authors and artists. Many of the family were Yale-educated and advocated for abolitionism, temperance, and women's rights. Some of the family provided material or ideological support to the Union in the American Civil War. The family is of English descent. Locations named after persons of this family include: Beecher, Illinois, named after Henry Ward Beecher and Beecher Island, named after Lt. Fredrick H. Beecher. History The American Beecher family began with John Beecher from Kent, England. Along with his wife and son Isaac, the Beechers embarked with a company of emigrants and arrived in Boston on the 26th of June, 1637. During its early days, Boston welcomed all Puritan emigrants, though many of these emigrants were not content to settle in the vicinity of Boston, owing, in part, to the difference in religious opinions. In September of that year, John was a member of an expedition party to explore the surrounding lands for plantation settlement. He was one of seven men left to winter in what would become New Haven, Connecticut. John died during that winter. His bones were discovered in 1750 in digging for a cellar of a stone house. The main body of settlers arrived in New Haven harbor in April, 1638.Hughes, Reuben Beecher. Genealogy of a branch of the Beecher family. New Haven, CT: Hoggson & Robinson, 1898.

At times Waking Hour has been loosely compared to Savatage, Fates Warning, and Queensryche. The spring of 2007 saw the release of Waking Hours much anticipated debut cd \\"Hollow Man\\". The disc was met with critical acclaim by many publications around the world including Metal Hammer and The Metal Observer. Later that year the song Hollow Man appeared on the ProgPower USA VIII sampler.

From 1923 to 1924/1925, he was Minister of the Interior and Vice- Chancellor of Germany. Jarres was also the long-serving mayor of Duisburg from 1914 to 1933. After the Nazis deposed him, he started a career in industry. Early life Karl Jarres was born on 21 September 1874 in Remscheid, in the Prussian Rhine Province. His father, Rudolf Jarres (1842-1922) was a merchant. His mother was Maria Jarres (1849-1936), n√©e Busch (daughter of merchant and Remscheid city treasurer Robert Busch). Karl studied law at London, Paris, Bonn and Berlin, and was awarded a Dr. iur. in 1897 at the University of Erlangen. After his legal clerkship, Jarres started working in municipal administration. He was Stadtassessor (1901) and then Beigeordneter (1903) at D√ºren. In 1907, he became Beigeordneter at Cologne. In 1910, he was elected mayor of Remscheid. Jarres was married in D√ºren in 1903, to Freya (1880-1945), n√©e Sch√ºll, daughter of a paper manufacturer. They had two daughters. Political career In 1911, Jarres became Oberb√ºrgermeister (Chief Burgomaster) of Remscheid. After 1914, he was the Oberb√ºrgermeister of Duisburg, located in the Ruhr region, a position he held until 1933. As representative for Duisburg, Jarres was a member of the Prussian upper chamber ‚Äî the Herrenhaus ‚Äî from 1914-18. During World War I he was successful in securing food supplies for the city. During and after the Revolution he opposed the establishment of a far-left R√§teherrschaft (rule by workers' and soldiers' councils), at the cost of being at times subject to physical violence. He joined the German People's Party (DVP) when it was created in 1918 (he was previously a member of the National Liberal Party) and remained a member until the DVP dissolved in 1933. However, Jarres never played a leading role in the party. From 1919 to 1933, Jarre was a member of the Prussian State Council. He was also active in the St√§dtetag. During the Occupation of the Ruhr in 1923 he was deposed as mayor by the military authorities and served a deportation order by the Belgians. Since he ignored it, a military court sentenced him to two months in prison. After he was released, the Prussian and German governments appointed him Vertrauensmann for the occupied territory. He had become known nationwide for his steadfast stance against the occupation. Strongly nationalistic feeling (he was a Burschenschaft member) and a dedication to liberty made him one of the most ardent supporters of the Versackungspolitik (leaving sole responsibility for the Ruhr to the occupiers). On 11 November 1923, Jarres followed the invitation by Gustav Stresemann and became Minister of the Interior in the second Stresemann cabinet. He kept that position under Chancellor Wilhelm Marx until 1925. In the first and second Marx cabinets, Jarres was also Vice-Chancellor. After the Ruhr crisis was over, Jarres loyally supported the policies of Stresemann (now Foreign Minister). The second Marx cabinet resigned on 15 December 1924, and was replaced on 15 January 1925 by the first cabinet of Hans Luther. Again urged by Stresemann, Jarres became the candidate of the DVP in the 1925 German Presidential election, the first direct election to the office of President of the Reich (Reichspr√§sident), following Friedrich Ebert's death. In the first round of the election he received the largest number of votes with over ten million and his plurality was at nearly 39%. The next major candidates were Otto Braun of the Social Democrats with nearly eight million votes (29%) and Wilhelm Marx of the Catholic Center Party with nearly four million votes (14.5%). Jarres withdrew his candidacy in the second round of voting in favor of Paul von Hindenburg, who would go on to win the closely fought second round of elections against Marx and Ernst Th√§lmann, the candidate of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Returning from Berlin to Duisburg in 1925, he worked towards a substantial increase in the size of the city in the territorial restructuring of the Ruhr, but achieved only the merger with Hamborn in 1929 (only in 1975 did Duisburg grow to the size he had envisaged). When the Great Depression hit the city, relying mostly on heavy industry (coal and steel), was severely affected and Jarres could do little to prevent unemployment from rising. After 1933 Reelected in 1930, Jarres was deposed as mayor by the Nazis in May 1933 and in November retired from public life (im Ruhestand). He spent the rest of his career in private industry, as a member of the supervisory board or management board of well-known Duisburg companies such as Demag. After 1945, he was instrumental in the rebuilding of the Ruhr industry. From 1942-51, he was chairman of the supervisory board of Kl√∂ckner. Jarres died on 20 October 1951 at Duisburg.

This is for the goal of accurizing the rifle and (to a lesser extent) prolonging the life of the stock. The bedding process is often an aftermarket improvement. Purpose=Increasing accuracy Bedding increases accuracy in part by relieving stress on the action. The rifle's action will rarely sit flush in the stock without bedding. This causes the action to flex when tightening the bolts holding the action to the stock. This flexing results in inconsistency during operation, which accumulates to a loss of accuracy over time. Bedding will create a flush surface for the action and prevent flexing. Bedding also reduces movement of the action in the stock. Without bedding, the action may be more likely to shift after a shot. If the action shifts and does not return to same spot in the stock the rifle will lose the ability to maintain zero. Prolonging stock life Bedding can help prolong the life of the stock. Repeated recoil forces can cause movement of the action in the stock. As the action moves, friction can create wear in the stock surface. Eventually the repeated wear can ruin the stock. Methods Bedding involves molding an epoxy-based material onto the stock recess to fill away the gaps within its contact surface with the receiver (known as glass bedding), and/or inserting a metal cylinders (which act as compression members) around the action screws to reduce compressive shifting (known as pillar bedding). The receiver and the stock are sometimes fastened indirectly through an intermediate piece (usually made of rigid materials such as aluminium alloy) known as a bedding block, which serves functionally as a larger pillar, a bedding surface and even recoil lugs. The contact interface on the stock may also be substituted by a metallic bedding frame known as a chassis, which is either embedded within the stock, or even completely replacing the stock like the lower receiver on many modern modular semi- automatic rifles. Skim bedding refers to an adjustment of a glass bedding job, usually after wear and tear from use, which consists of removing a small layer of the bedding material‚Äîusually up to around ‚Äîand adding new bedding material on top of that. Several different bedding methods can be used depending on the type of stock, desired results and level of experience of the person attempting to perform the bedding. Methods include: * Full contact bedding of the action with the barrel floated. * Full contact bedding of the action and the barrel. * Full contact bedding of the action with a pressure-bearing pad for the barrel. * Pillar bedding of the action with the barrel floated. * Full length aluminum action bedding block. Full contact bedding of the action with the barrel floated is a very common method for long range rifles with a heavy barrel. A free-floating barrel will generally produce the greatest accuracy. However, a pressure pad under the barrel just forward of the action can sometimes improve accuracy by acting on barrel harmonics and reducing stress on the action from the weight of the barrel. Pillar bedding can be used to float the action as well as the barrel, but the process is more difficult. Precautions If performed improperly, bedding can destroy a rifle. Mechanical locking occurs when bedding material is allowed to harden in holes or around protrusions on the action. If locking occurs, the action can be permanently fixed to the stock. Extreme measures may have to be taken to separate the stock from the action, possibly destroying one or both. Improperly applied or insufficient release agent can cause the bedding material to bind to the metal. If the trigger assembly is not removed prior to bedding, epoxy can seep into the trigger assembly and ruin it.

Highest Court of Iceland) is the final court of appeal in the judiciary of Iceland. It is also the oldest of the current courts of law in Iceland and the highest of the three Icelandic court branches, the others being the District Courts of Iceland and the Court of Appeal (Landsr√©ttur). Notwithstanding the fact that the Court is not mentioned by name in the Constitution of Iceland but only its justices, it is validated in the Courts Act No. 50/2016. The Supreme Court of Iceland is located at the D√≥mh√∫si√∞ (Courthouse) at Arnarh√≥ll in Reykjav√≠k, a building that was specially built for that purpose and that came into use in 1996. The current President of the court is Benedikt Bogason. History The court was founded under the Supreme Court Act of 1919 and held its first session on 16 February 1920.\\"H√¶stir√©ttur settur.\\" Morgunbla√∞i√∞ (in Icelandic) (85) 17 February 1920, p. 1 Previously, the National High Court had been the highest domestic court, but a line of appeal had been available to the Supreme Court of Denmark in Copenhagen. The establishment of the Supreme Court moved the final word in Icelandic cases home to Iceland. The first justices of the Supreme Court were Kristj√°n J√≥nsson (President), Halld√≥r Dan√≠elsson, Eggert Briem, L√°rus H. Bjarnason and P√°ll Einarsson. The first three men had been the judges of the old National High Court, which had operated throughout the 19th century but was abolished with the founding of the Supreme Court. Justices The court is composed of seven justices selected by the Qualifications Committee and nominated by the Minister of Justice for presidential confirmation. In cases where the minister wishes to make changes to the committee's selection, Parliament must approve of said changes with a simple majority vote. The Supreme Court justices elect a President and a Vice-President. The President of the Supreme Court manages the affairs of the court, directs court sessions and divides tasks among the justices and the employees of the court and maintains disciplinary supervision. They are responsible for the operation and finances of the court and represents the curt towards the public. Under article 8 of the Constitution of Iceland, the President of the Supreme Court is one of the three holders of the power of the President of Iceland in their absence, the others being the Prime Minister and the Speaker of Parliament. As of September 2020, the justices of the Supreme Court are: *Benedikt Bogason (President) *Ingveldur Einarsd√≥ttir (Vice-President) *Karl Axelsson *Sigur√∞ur T√≥mas Magn√∫sson *√ìlafur B√∂rkur √ûorvaldsson Procedure The court operates in two divisions, where either three or five justices sit to hear a case before the court. For especially important cases, the President of the court may decide that the bench be constituted by seven justices. The main rule is that cases are presented orally before the Supreme Court and the court sessions are generally open to the public. The President of the Supreme Court presides over the session or, in their absence, the Vice-President. If neither of them is hearing the case, the most senior justice in session will preside. Lawyers appearing before the court wear black robes with blue lapels, whilst the justices wear distinctive blue robes with black lapels, a custom which reputably began with the suggestion of the first lawyers to appear before the Supreme Court, Eggert Claessen and Sveinn Bj√∂rnsson (later President of Iceland). As soon as an oral case presentation is finished, the justices retire for a closed meeting to discuss and vote on the case. One justice will be held responsible for introducing the matter and proposing a solution of the case and he or she will usually write the opinion of the court. If the views of the reporting justice do not have the support of a majority of the justices, the President will ask another justice to write the court‚Äôs opinion, and the minority justices decide who will write a separate dissenting judgement. Finally, a complete judgement will be prepared, and the justices will sign a single copy which is filed in the Book of Opinions of the Court. For cases where members of the Cabinet are suspected of criminal behaviour, the Landsd√≥mur, which includes the five of the longest serving Supreme Court justices, sits instead of the Supreme Court. Building After the transfer of power from Denmark, the court was first housed in the Old Penitentiary Building on Sk√≥lav√∂r√∞ust√≠gur in Reykjav√≠k.\\"H√∫sn√¶√∞i H√¶star√©ttar 1920-1970.\\" T√≠marit l√∂gfr√¶√∞inga (in Icelandic) (1) 1 January 1970, p. 37 In 1949 it moved to the former court building on Lindargata. 1993 saw a competition to design a new home for the court, which was won by Margr√©t Har√∞ard√≥ttir and Steve Christer of Studio Granda, Reykjav√≠k. The Icelandic Minister of Justice dug the first spade of ground for the new courthouse of the Supreme Court at Arnarh√≥ll on 15 July 1994, laid the cornerstone of the building on the court‚Äôs 75th anniversary, 16 February 1995, and handed it over to the court for use on 5 September 1996.

Nachiapuram is a panchayat with elected members, and forms part of the Kallal Union. History The village of Nachiapuram was founded in the 1800s by Nagarthars migrating from Mekkudi, Kambanoor, Naduvikkottai, Siravayal, and other places. At that time the Amman Temple, Shivan Temple, and other facilities were built in the village. Nachiapuram gets its name from the deity 'Nachiar Amman', worshipped as the Goddess that protects the village and its citizens. Emigrants In colonial times, Nachiapuram Nagarathars emigrated to countries like Ceylon, Singapore, Burma, Vietnam amongst a few others. Many of its Nagarathar citizens emigrated to Singapore in the 1930s and 1940s and to many other countries in the 1990s and 2000s. Around the 1950s and 1960s, by virtue of most Nagarathars in Singapore having emigrated from Nachiapuram, Singapore was known as Chinna Nachiapuram amongst the Nagarathar residents of Singapore. Temples and festivals Besides The Nachiar Amman Temple, Nachiapuram also has the Kattu Nachi Amman Temple, a Sivan Kovil, a common Pillayar Kovil and Thandayuthapani Kovil. The annual Thiruvizha function at the Amman Temples is a ritual that all Nachiapuram Folks look forward to year after year. The Thiruvizha is a ten-day event, with Letcharchanai, Amman Oorvalam and many other events termed as MandagapPadi. 275px Arulmigu Nachiar Amman ~ ‡ÆÖ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ≥‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æö‡Øç‡Æö‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡ÆÖ‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æ©‡Øç Schools Nachiapuram has two schools - an elementary school, teaching children up to 5th standard and a high school teaching children up to the tenth standard exams, SSLC. The schools are named after Jeyamkonda Vinayagar: Jeyamkonda Vinayagar Elementary School and Jeyamkonda Vinayagar High School. Jeyamkonda Vinayagar literally translates to \\"Victorious Lord Ganesa\\". Children from nearby villages attend the schools. Jeyamkonda Vinayagar Elementary School has completed 100 years of service and Jeyamkonda Vinayagar High School has completed 50 years of service. The school is providing bus facility to villages around Nachiapuram Other facilities Nachiapuram has a bank (Indian Bank), ATM, a police station, a post office, panchayathu office, a small health dispensary and a few shops. Water supply for the village is from two village tanks named after the nearby temples - the Amman Kovil Oorani and Sivan Koil Oorani. Water from these sources is pumped into an overhead tank and distributed to households and to public places by a system of pipes. There is a single postal delivery each day. Most homes in the village are served by landlines. With the advent of cellular phones communication is excellent.

The great and abominable church is identified as being synonymous with the Whore of Babylon described in chapter 17 of the Book of Revelation. Although many Latter Day Saints have associated the great and abominable church with the Roman Catholic Church, official publications of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) have discouraged this interpretation. Usage in the Book of Mormon The major characteristics of the great and abominable church described in the Book of Mormon's First Book of Nephi are: # It persecutes, tortures, and slays the saints of God (see 1 Ne. 13:5); # It seeks wealth and luxury (see 1 Ne. 13:7‚Äì8); # It is characterized by sexual immorality (see 1 Ne. 13:7); # It has excised plain and precious things from the scriptures (see 1 Ne. 13:26‚Äì29); # It has dominion over all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people (see 1 Ne. 14:11); and # Its fate is to be consumed by a world war, when the nations that it incites against the Saints wage war among themselves until the great and abominable church itself is destroyed (see 1 Ne. 22:13‚Äì14). The great and abominable church is often equated with Babylon. Five of the six characteristics identified in 1 Nephi are also attributed to Babylon in the Book of Revelation:Stephen E. Robinson, \\"Warring Against the Saints of God\\", Ensign, January 1988. # Babylon is drunk with the blood of the saints, the martyrs of Jesus, and the prophets (see Rev. 17:6; Rev. 18:24); # She is known for her enjoyment of great wealth and luxury (see Rev. 17:4; Rev. 18:3, 11‚Äì16); # She is characterized by wanton sexual immorality (see Rev. 17:1‚Äì2, 5); # She has dominion over all nations (see Rev. 17:15, 18; Rev. 18:3, 23‚Äì24); and # Her fate is to be consumed by the very kings who, because of her deceptions, have made war on the Lamb (see Rev. 17:14‚Äì16; Rev. 18:23). LDS Church publications According to an article by Stephen E. Robinson in an official magazine of LDS Church, \\"no single known historical church, denomination, or set of believers meets all the requirements for the great and abominable church. ... Rather, the role of Babylon has been played by many different agencies, ideologies, and churches in many different times.\\" Regarding the popular identification of the Roman Catholic Church with the great and abominable church, Robinson states: > More often, some have suggested that the Roman Catholic church might be the > great and abominable church of Nephi 13. This is also untenable, primarily > because Roman Catholicism as we know it did not yet exist when the crimes > described by Nephi were being committed. In fact, the term Roman Catholic > only makes sense after A.D. 1054 when it is used to distinguish the Western, > Latin-speaking Orthodox church that followed the bishop of Rome from the > Eastern, Greek-speaking Orthodox church that followed the bishop of > Constantinople. ... Even if we use the term Catholic for the church > Constantine made the state religion in A.D. 313, the New Testament as we > know it was already widely circulating. That is, the plain and precious > parts had already been removed. The notion of shifty-eyed medieval monks > rewriting the scriptures is unfair and bigoted. We owe those monks a debt of > gratitude that anything was saved at all. More generally, Robinson notes: \\"Some Latter-day Saints have erred in believing that some specific denomination, to the exclusion of all others, has since the beginning of time been the great and abominable church. This is dangerous, for many will then want to know which it is, and an antagonistic relationship with that denomination will inevitably follow.\\" Rather than identifying an existing denomination or organization, Robinson hypothesizes that the \\"hellenized Christianity\\" of the first and second centuries is the most likely identity of Nephi's \\"great and abominable church\\". In a similar vein, the semi-official Encyclopedia of Mormonism states: \\"Though many Protestants, following the lead of Martin Luther, have linked this evil force described in Revelation 17 with the Roman Catholic church, the particular focus of these LDS and New Testament scriptures seems rather to be on earlier agents of apostasy in the Jewish and Christian traditions\\".Dennis A. Wright, \\"Great and Abominable Church\\" , Encyclopedia of Mormonism (Daniel H. Ludlow ed.) (Macmillan: New York, 1992). The canonical Doctrine and Covenants refers to the great and abominable church as both \\"the church of the devil\\" and the \\"whore of Babylon\\". Other Mormon publications The first edition of LDS Church general authority Bruce R. McConkie's Mormon Doctrine stated: \\"It is also to the Book of Mormon to which we turn for the plainest description of the Catholic Church as the great and abominable church.\\"Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research, \\"Book of Mormon/Great and abominable church\\". As McConkie's book became popular, the belief that the great and abominable church was the Catholic Church \\"became embedded in popular [Mormon] belief, despite the fact that this idea was never sanctioned or preached over the pulpit.\\" McConkie's book became controversial with the leadership of the LDS Church, and he was pressed into making significant changes in the second edition. The second edition of Mormon Doctrine removed the reference to the Catholic Church, and instead stated: \\"The titles church of the devil and great and abominable church are used to identify all churches or organizations of whatever name or nature‚Äîwhether political, philosophical, educational, economic social, fraternal, civic, or religious‚Äîwhich are designed to take men on a course that leads away from God and his laws and thus from salvation in the kingdom of God.\\" See also * Mormon folklore References Category:Book of Mormon words and phrases Category:Latter Day Saint doctrines, beliefs, and practices Category:Mormonism-related controversies Category:Whore of Babylon Category:Anti-Catholic slurs ","title":"Great and abominable church"},{"id":"10915152","text":"Gmina Frombork is an urban-rural gmina (administrative district) in Braniewo County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

At the Argentine national census of 2010 the total population was 40,117,096, of whom 149,493 (0.37%) identified as Afro-Argentine. The Afro-Argentine population resulting from the slave trade during the centuries of Spanish domination of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata had a major role in Argentine history. During the 18th and 19th centuries they comprised up to fifty percent of the population in some provinces, and had a deep impact on national culture. Some theories hold it that in the 19th century the Afro-Argentine population declined sharply due to several factors, such as the Argentine War of Independence (c. 1810‚Äì1818), high infant mortality rates, low numbers of married couples in this ethnic group, the Paraguayan War, cholera epidemics in 1861 and 1864, and a yellow fever epidemic in 1871. During his term, Sarmiento instituted highly oppressive and deadly policies to eradicate Black people. He segregated the Black community. This became a death sentence when cholera and yellow-fever outbreaks ravaged this community with no adequate measures to prevent or treat the illnesses. Sarmiento‚Äôs genocide also constituted, ‚Äúthe forced recruitment of Afro-Argentines into the military, mass imprisonment for minor or fabricated crimes, and mass executions.‚Äù By the late 19th century the Afro-Argentine population consisted mainly of women, who mixed with the large numbers of European immigrants. Despite the fact that in the 1960s it was calculated that Argentina owed two thirds of the volume of its population to European immigration, over 5% of Argentines state they have at least one black ancestor, and a further 20% state they do not know whether or not they have any black ancestors. Genetic studies carried out in 2005 showed that the average level of African genetic contribution in the population of Buenos Aires is 2.2%, but that this component is concentrated in 10% of the population who display notably higher levels of African ancestry. Today there is still a notable Afro-Argentine community in the Buenos Aires districts of San Telmo and La Boca. There are also quite a few African-descended Argentines in Merlo and Ciudad Evita cities, in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. Since 2013, November 8th has been celebrated as the National Day of Afro-Argentines and African Culture. The date was chosen to commemorate the recorded date for the death of Mar√≠a Remedios del Valle, a rabona and guerrilla fighter, who served with the Army of the North in the Argentine War of Independence. Importation of African slaves during colonial period Statue of \\"Slavery\\" also known as \\"The Slave\\", Francisco Cafferata, Sicily in Parque Tres de Febrero, Palermo, Buenos Aires, Argentina As part of the process of conquest, the economic regimes of the European colonies in the Americas developed various forms of forced labor exploitation of the indigenous peoples. However, the relatively low population density of some of the South American territories, resistance by some aboriginal groups to acculturation, and especially the high rate of mortality caused by the diseases introduced by Europeans caused the decline of the native population. Studies have shown that owing to their immunological isolation from the peoples of the Old World prior to the first contacts with Europeans from 1492 onwards, some 50-90% of the indigenous population throughout the Americas died from epidemic diseases,Brendan D. O'Fallon and Lars Fehren-Schmitz, \\"Native Americans experienced a strong population bottleneck coincident with European contact\\", PNAS, 20 December 2011, 108 (51) 20444-20448; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1112563108. exacerbated by the stresses brought on by violent conquest, dispossession and exploitation. This led the Spaniards to supplement aboriginal manpower with slaves from sub-Saharan Africa. Well into the 19th century, mining and agriculture accounted for the bulk of economic activity in the Americas. African slave labor held the advantage of having already been exposed to European diseases through geographical proximity, and African laborers readily adapted to the tropical climate of the colonies. In the case of Argentina, the influx of African slaves began in the colonies of the Rio de la Plata in 1588. Slave traders kidnapped Africans, who were then sold and shipped from West Africa to the Americas and the Caribbean. Trafficking flourished through the port of Buenos Aires when the city allowed English traders to import slaves through it. To provide slaves to the East Indies, the Spanish crown granted contracts known as Asientos to various companies from other countries, mainly Portuguese, English, Dutch and French. By 1713 Britain, victorious in the War of the Spanish Succession, had the monopoly of this trade. The last Asiento was drawn up with the Royal Society of the Philippines in 1787. Until the 1784 ban, African slaves were measured and then branded. Before the 16th century slaves had arrived in relatively small numbers from the Cape Verde islands. Thereafter the majority of Africans brought to Argentina were from ethnic groups speaking Bantu languages, from the territories now comprising Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. Relatively few Yoruba and Ewe were taken to Argentina; larger numbers of these groups were taken to Brazil It is estimated that 12 million African slaves reached Latin America, mainly arriving at the ports of Buenos Aires and Montevideo, with many transshipped to other regions through Valpara√≠so and Rio de Janeiro. An estimated 10-15% of slaves died during passage across the Atlantic. However, many more died during the process of enslavement, travel through the interior of Africa, and while awaiting shipment, with an estimated 40 deaths for every 100 slaves who reached the New World. The slaves were forced to work in agriculture, livestock, domestic work and to a lesser extent crafts. In urban areas, many slaves made handicrafts for sale, while revenues went to their masters. The Buenos Aires neighborhood of San Telmo and Monserrat housed a large quantity of slaves, although most were sent to the interior provinces. The 1778 census conducted by Juan Jos√© Salcedo of V√©rtiz showed very high concentration of Africans in provinces where agricultural production was greatest: 54% in Santiago del Estero Province, 52% in Catamarca Province, 46% in Salta Province, 44% in C√≥rdoba Province, 64% in the Tucum√°n Province, 24% in Mendoza Province, 20% in La Rioja Province, 16% in San Juan Province, 13% in Jujuy Province and 9% in San Luis Province. An important part of the African population also inhabited other provinces. Today one of the slums of the city of Corrientes is still known as \\"Camba Cu√°\\", from the Guarani kamba kua, meaning \\"cave of the Blacks\\". Although most of the gauchos were mestizos (of mixed indigenous and Spanish ancestry), some were also of African ancestry. In 1806-1807 the city of Buenos Aires had 15,708 Europeans, 347 indigenous and cholos (mestizos), and 6,650 Africans and mulattoes, while in 1810 there were 22,793 whites, 9,615 Africans and mulattoes, and only 150 indigenous and cholos. The area most densely populated by Africans was located in the neighborhood of Monserrat, also known as Barrio del Tambor (Drumtown), just a few blocks from the Congressional Palace. The nations The Casa M√≠nima, built by freedmen following the 1812 abolition of slavery in Argentina Slaves would group themselves in societies they called nations, some of which were Conga, Cabunda, African Argentine, Mozambique, etc. The commonalities among the meeting places of the nations included artificially flattened and sanded opened spaces for dancing; others were closed in with interior free space. In some cases the rooms were carpeted, and curtained, having been provided these items by the slave owner. The nation had its king and queen, previously chosen by democratic election, and a throne was erected where the flag of a particular nation was displayed. Every nation had a flag. There was also a platform, or dais, which among other things was used to receive great dignitaries such as Juan Manuel de Rosas, his wife, and his daughter, as portrayed in a painting by Mart√≠n Boneo. The headquarters was the site of social gatherings and dances. Often the Afro-Argentine societies centered around the barrios, such as the del Mondongo nation or the del Tambor society. The Mondongo nation was one of the most important in Buenos Aires and was composed of 16 blocks in the barrio of Monserrat. Its name derived from the large quantity of tripe (mondongo) consumed by its members. The name Tambor was quite common in many towns, as the drum was the favored African instrument for dances and songs. Sometimes slaves were purchased individually from abroad through an agent. For example, a letter sent from Rio de Janeiro says: Africans in the independence and early history of Argentina Despite widespread slavery, testimonies of the time argued that in Buenos Aires and in Montevideo slaves were treated with less cruelty than elsewhere. Jos√© Antonio Wilde, in Buenos Aires during Argentina's early independence period (1810‚Äì1880) said that: However, Wilde goes onto acknowledge that: Testimony regarding the treatment of Argentine slaves in contrast to that of other European colonies is most likely that of foreigners. For example, Alexander Gillespie, skipper of the British army during the British invasion of 1806, wrote in his memoirs that he was surprised how well African slaves were treated as opposed to those enslaved by British planters in the Caribbean, and in Guyana. He goes on to state: In 1801 the first Afro-Argentine militias were organised, under the auspices of the Compa√±√≠a de Granaderos de Pardos libres de Buenos Aires and Compa√±√≠a de Granaderos de Morenos libres de Buenos Aires. The pardos were comprised of free people of mixed European, African, and Native American, particularly Guaran√≠, descent, whereas the \\"morenos\\" seem to have been composed of soldiers of largely African ancestry. These forces were unified into the Batall√≥n de Pardos y Morenos, also known as the Batall√≥n Castas, at a strength of 9 companies, plus 4 auxiliary slave companies, at the time of the first British invasions of the River Plate. Regimental status was gained in 1810, and the new Regimento de Pardos y Morenos participated in the Argentine War of Independence. The British invasion of the R√≠o de la Plata of 1806 followed an uprising of Argentine's slave population in Buenos Aires encouraged by the rise of the movement for abolition of slavery in Britain. Afro-Argentines believed that the British expedition came mainly to give them their independence, but the British general, William Carr Beresford, had no sympathy with this movement. The spokesman for the Creoles in Buenos Aires, Juan Mart√≠n de Pueyrred√≥n argued that the region's economic base would be ruined if slavery were immediately abolished. He demanded action on behalf of their estates; General Beresford announced that slaves would not be freed, and Pueyrred√≥n said \\"they were stopped in time\\" (\\"se los ataj√≥ a tiempo\\") in July 1806, in a letter to his father-in-law in C√°diz. This measure contributed to the defeat of the British invasion, because it drove the slaves to fight against them. Following the defeat of the British, the Cabildo (administrative council) of Buenos Aires declared its main objective was to \\"see how to banish slavery from our soil.\\" In 1812 Bernardo de Monteagudo was not allowed as a member of the First Triumvirate, due to his \\"questionable mother\\"‚Äîi.e., African ancestry. Bernardino Rivadavia, also of African descent, was one of the objectors. The Assembly of the Year XIII, called to establish the new independent state of Argentina, passed the law of freedom of wombs, whereby children born to slaves thenceforth were automatically free citizens, but did not free those who were already slaves. Many blacks were part of militias and irregular troops that eventually became part of the Argentine Army, but always in segregated squadrons. Black slaves could, however, ask to be sold and even find a buyer if they were unhappy with their owners. The largest mass deaths of Afro-Argentines were during Domingo F. Sarmiento's term as President of Argentina from 1868 to 1874: the Paraguayan War of 1865‚Äì1870 and the 1871 Buenos Aires yellow fever epidemic. After the abolition of slavery, many Afro- Argentines lived in miserable conditions and faced widespread discrimination. The fourteen schools in Buenos Aires in 1857, only admitted two black children, although 15% of students that year were of color. In C√≥rdoba in 1829 Afro-Argentine children were entitled to only two years' secondary schooling, while white Argentine children studied for four years. Universities did not admit blacks until 1853. Afro-Argentines began to publish newspapers and to organize for their rights. One paper, The Unionist, published in 1877 a statement of equal rights and justice for all people regardless of skin color was published. One of its statements read: Other newspapers were The African Race, the Black Democrat and The Proletarian, all published in 1858. By the 1880s there were about twenty such Afro-Argentine-published newspapers in Buenos Aires; and some researchers consider these social movements integral to the introduction of socialism and the idea of social justice in Argentine culture. Some Afro-Argentines entered politics. Jos√© Mar√≠a Morales and Domingo Sosa were in action as senior military officers and held significant political posts.  Decline of the Afro-Argentine population  The bloody Paraguayan War (1865‚Äì70) and the Yellow Fever epidemic have been considered causes of the drastic diminution of the Afro-Argentine population. Causes of reduction * Heavy casualties caused by constant civil wars and foreign wars: Blacks formed a disproportionate part of the Argentine army in the long and bloody War of Paraguay (1865‚Äì1870), in which the loss of lives on both sides was high. *Heavy casualties among blacks led to a large gender gap among the black population, which led to black women increasingly forming interracial relationships. *Epidemics, especially the yellow fever epidemic of 1871. This epidemic, like most of its kind, affected mostly people without financial means to flee the epicenters or pay for doctors. * Massive immigration from Europe between 1880 and 1950, boosted by the Constitution of 1853, that quickly multiplied the country's population. The 1853 Argentine constitution states that, although immigration from all corners of earth shall be accepted into the country, European immigration will be prioritized. All children born after 1813 were automatically free and further import of slaves was forbidden. This early ban of trafficking also contributed to lower rates of afrodescendents. Afro-Argentines who were already slaves were not freed, and eventually were granted their freedom as a condition of fighting in Argentina's wars. For this reason, certain historians stated that African males had disproportionate losses in the Argentine war of independence from Spain. A much larger proportion of men of African descent were killed in the war than men of Spanish descent. Studies held it that, as in many other countries in the region, an Afro-Argentine had less chance of survival if free than if enslaved: free Afro-Argentines were left with menial jobs for low pay, or forced to become beggars. This caused much poverty in the Afro-Argentine community; many succumbed to disease because they could not afford proper medical care, in many cases during frequent plagues of diseases such as yellow fever. Present Today in Argentina, the Afro-Argentine community is beginning to emerge from the shadows. There have been black organizations such as \\"Grupo Cultural Afro,\\" \\"SOS Racismo,\\" and perhaps the most important group \\"Africa Vive\\" that help to rekindle interest into the African heritage of Argentina. There are also Afro-Uruguayan and Afro-Brazilian migrants who have helped to expand the African culture. Afro-Uruguayan migrants have brought candombe to Argentina, while Afro-Brazilians teach capoeira, orisha, and other African derived secula. It has been well over a century since Argentina has reflected the African racial ancestry in its census count. Therefore, calculating the exact number of Afro-descendants is very difficult; however, Africa Vive calculates that there are about 1,000,000 Afro-descendents in Argentina. The last census, carried on 27 October 2010, introduced the African ancestry survey. African influence in Argentine culture=Music Gabino Ezeiza, the most famous \\"payador\\". Perhaps the most lasting effect of black influence in Argentina was the tango, which contains and continues some of the features of the tangos, meetings in which slaves assembled to sing and dance. The modern term for a tango ball, milonga, has its roots in the Quimbanda language of Angola, and a large Afro-Argentine and Afro-Uruguayan contribution is also evident in the development of milonga and chacarera music. The song tradition of the payadores was also associated with Afro-Argentines, with some scholars, for example George Reid Andrews, arguing that it originated among the Afro-Argentine community, while others, such as Sylvain B. Poosson, view it as a continuation of the Andalusian traditions like the trovo. Whatever their origin, payadas provided an opportunity for black singers like Gabino Ezeiza to use music to articulate political consciousness and defend their right to exist within Argentina's increasingly white-dominated society. Important Afro-Argentine musical figures include the pianist and composer Rosendo Mendizabal, author of \\"El Entrerriano\\", as well as Carlos Posadas, Enrique Maciel (author of the music of the waltz \\"La Pulpera de Santa Luc√≠a\\"), Cayetano Silva, born in San Carlos (Uruguay) and author of the San Lorenzo march, and Zen√≥n Rol√≥n, who wrote the 1880 funeral march in honour of the Liberator Jos√© de San Mart√≠n on the occasion of repatriation of his remains. Colonial racial categories During colonial times the local population unofficially described different mixtures resulting from the union of Black African people with people of other ethnic origins as: *Mulato: Black and White parents. In English: \\"Mulatto\\". *Morisco or Tercer√≥n : Mulatto and White parents, although in the early phase of Spanish colonization the term \\"morisco\\" also denoted a Muslim who had converted to Catholicism. In English: \\"Quadroon\\". *Albino or Cuarter√≥n: Morisco and White parents. In English: \\"Octoroon\\". *Quinter√≥n: fifth-generation Black ancestry/one parent who is a Cuarter√≥n and one White parent. Quinterones were not distinguishable in complexion and facial features from whites as even some Quinterones were lighter than many Spaniards; the children of a Quinter√≥n with a White person was considered White \\"free of any Negro race\\". In English: \\"Hexadecaroon\\". *Zambo: Black/Amerindian mixed. In English: \\"Sambo\\". *Zambo Prieto: Black/Amerindian mixed with predominant Black. Socially, ancestors in one of these categories were a stain in the family tree. These classifications, and others common in the colonial culture such as \\"mestizo\\" or cholo, were used to stigmatize people and prevent their social advancement. In some cases, well- known historical personalities were found in this situation; figures such as Bernardo de Monteagudo and Bernardino Rivadavia, were described as \\"mulatto\\". Immigration after the 19th century=Immigrants from Cape Verde Between 12,000 and 15,000 descendants of immigrants from Cape Verde living in Argentina, of whom about 300 are native to the African continent. This immigration began in the late 19th century and became important from the 1920s. The busiest periods were between 1927 and 1933 and the third, after 1946. These migrations were mainly due to droughts in the African country that originated famine and death. They were expert sailors and fishermen, which is why most places settled in ports such as Rosario, Buenos Aires, San Nicol√°s, Bah√≠a Blanca, Ensenada and Dock Sud. 95% of them got jobs in the Military Navy, in the Merchant Navy in the Fluvial Fleet of Argentina and in YPF dockyards or the ELMA. Other immigrants from AfricaIn Buenos Aires= In the popularly called Barrio del Once there are Africans who have come to escape the conditions of their countries, particularly Senegal. According to the Agency for Refugees in Buenos Aires, they came by seeking asylum or getting a visa to travel to Brazil and then Argentina, sometimes traveling as stowaways on ships. When denied a residence permit, the African refugees remain in the country without status and become lawful targets of human trafficking network. On Sunday some of the Senegalese community comes together to eat traditional dishes of their country. Some places already have African food recipes. =In Rosario= Since 2004 Africans who were exploited in their home countries stowed away to Argentina, particularly the port of Rosario, Santa Fe. Although figures are inadequate the numbers increase every year: in 2008 70 refugees arrived, after some 40 the previous year; only 10 remained, the rest were repatriated. Many were children. They usually get on ships without knowing where they go, or believing they are going to a developed country in the northern hemisphere. They come from Nigeria, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Guinea. The first Africans to migrate in this way arrived in Rosario in 2004. They were adopted by a family, but most are not. Children have been housed in temporary homes and many adults live in rented rooms and earn money as street vendors. Some families formed and settled. Racism in Argentina related to skin tone In Argentina, as in other countries of the Americas, racism related to skin tone or against people of African origin dates back to the days of colonial rule. In the caste system imposed by Spain, the descendants of people from black Africa occupied a place still lower than the descendants of persons belonging to aboriginal peoples. The racist colonial went some way to the Argentine culture, as shown by some racist comments of the president Domingo F. Sarmiento. During the mid-19th century, were common to the death duels between gauchos and mestizos afroargentinos. In Argentine literature, these disputes are represented in a racist way in a stanza from the 1870 epic poem Mart√≠n Fierro (The way) by Jos√© Hern√°ndez, in which the title character Fierro is at a dance when a black couple enter; Fierro insults the woman, who responds in kind; Fierro then taunts the couple with the following verse: :\\"God made whites, :Saint Peter made mulattos, :the devil made blacks :as the smut of Hell\\".Literal translation of the Spanish original from Mart√≠n Fierro, verse 199: \\"los blancos hizo Dios,/a los mulatos san pedro,/a los negros hizo el diablo/para tiz√≥n del infierno.\\" Fierro then kills the man in a knife fight, and speaks disparagingly of the dead man. In 1878 Hernandez published the second part of Mart√≠n Fierro, in which is described a payada (song competition) with the son of the man he had killed, also a black gaucho, that debates philosophical topics (such as life, creation, existence, etc.). Showing the evolution of the character and probably of Argentine society in the process of receiving millions of European immigrants, this time Fierro avoids the apparently inevitable duel. The invisibility of deliberate Afro-Argentines and culture, is another striking manifestation of racism in Argentina, related to the tone of the skin or African origins. In 2006 the president of the National Institute to Combat Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI) recognized the invisibility of Afro-Argentines with the following words: Organizations The Forum of African Descent and Africans in Argentina was created on 9 October 2006, with the aim of promoting social and cultural pluralism and the fight against discrimination of a population in the country to reach the two million inhabitants. The National Institute to Combat Discrimination (INADI) is the public body responsible for combating discrimination and racism.

Fran√ßois Jacquier by Beno√Æt P√©cheux (?), after Laurent P√©cheux, first third of the 19th century, Lyon, mus√©e des Beaux-Arts. Fran√ßois Jacquier (7 June 1711 at Vitry-le-Fran√ßois - 3 July 1788 at Rome) was a French Franciscan mathematician and physicist. Life His early education was entrusted to an ecclesiastic, who recognized in him an inclination to science and mathematics. When sixteen years old, Fran√ßois, entered the Order of Friars Minor, and after profession was sent to Rome, to complete his studies in the French convent of the order, Trinit√† dei Monti. With the permission of his superiors he specialized in mathematics, and at the same time studied the ancient languages. He became proficient in Hebrew, and spoke Greek as though it were his mother-tongue. His learning gained for him the patronage of Cardinal Alberoni and Cardinal Portocarrero. He accompanied Cardinal Alberoni on his legation to Ravenna, and was appointed to inspect the work begun by Eustachio Manfredi to prevent the repeated floods of that territory. On his return he was given the chair of Sacred Scripture at the College of the Propaganda, and was also detailed by the general chapter of the Friars Minors, assembled at Marseilles, to work upon the annals of the order. The King of Sardinia named him professor of physics at the University of Turin in 1745, but Cardinal Valenti, prime minister of Pope Benedict XIV had him assigned to the chair of experimental physics at the Roman College. Here he was in demand for consultation on scientific matters. In 1763 he was appointed instructor in physics and mathematics to the young Prince Ferdinand at Parma. He was appointed in 1773 to the chair of mathematics at the Roman College, on the occasion of the suppression of the Jesuits. At his death he was connected with nearly all the great scientific and literary societies of Europe. He had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1741.

It features a variety of teaching and preaching programs. Additionally, it features a variety of music. The music is a mixture of hymns and Christian classics (1960s through 1980s). WFUR transmits with a power of 1,000 watts daytime and 307 watts nighttime. In May 2020 music was changed to 1970s to current and the \\"Classic\\" designation was mostly dropped. With the sale of sister station WFUR-FM (102.9) there is now only one WFUR on the radio dial. The separate music libraries are being merged. History=Beginning (1947‚Äì1950) WFUR 1570 was constructed and put on the air in 1947. It was licensed as a 1,000-watt, daytime-only station. A trio of war veterans operated WFUR from 1947‚Äì1950. The programing was typical for that time period: Weekdays playing secular music and programs and some paid church programs on the weekends. One of the paid programs was the \\"Hour of Praise\\". The \\"Hour of Praise\\" had aired weekly for about 10 years on a variety of stations throughout west Michigan. It featured live and/or recorded live hymn-sings and sermons from various area churches. Overseeing those weekly broadcasts was William Kuiper. Kuiper had a clothing store in the Grand Rapids area and did the \\"Hour of Praise\\" on a volunteer basis. After some time, the owners of WFUR suggested that perhaps William Kuiper would like to purchase WFUR. Upon thinking and praying about the matter, Kuiper decided to attempt it. Kuiper ownership (1950‚Äìpresent) Kuiper's vision for a non-denominational Christian radio station. His unique idea was that it could be supported through advertising. The few Christian radio stations on the air at that time were supported by a single church or on-air fund raising. He felt strongly that people should tithe to their church, not a radio station. Secondly, he wanted to allow various Christian groups to purchase airtime, which at that time was not the norm. WFUR-FM In 1960, sister station WFUR- FM 102.9 was put on the air at the same facility location. At 12 noon on May 12, 2020, WFUR-FM played its last sign-off announcement. This ends its history in west Michigan. The station later returned to the air as WYHA, part of the Bible Broadcasting Network. Translator In the summer of 2013, WFUR purchased an FM translator.

He was sentenced to life in prison, though the sentence was shortened on appeal and Ross was released in 2009.  Biography  Ross attended school at Susan Miller Dorsey High School in Los Angeles. He played for the tennis team but was unable to get a college scholarship because he was illiterate. Ross has said that when he first saw crack cocaine as a teenager in 1979, he did not immediately believe it was a drug because it looked different from other drugs he had seen. The nickname Freeway came from Ross owning properties along Los Angeles' Interstate 110, also known as the Harbor Freeway According to an October 2013 Esquire magazine article, \\"Between 1982 and 1989, federal prosecutors estimated, Ross bought and resold several metric tons of cocaine,\\" with Ross's gross revenue claimed to be more than $900 million (equivalent to $2.7 billion in ) and profits of almost $300 million ($ million in ). During the height of his drug dealing, Ross was said to have sold \\"$3 million in one day.\\" According to the East Bay Times, \\"In the course of his rise, prosecutors estimate that Ross exported several tons of cocaine to New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, and made more than $500 million between 1983 and 1984.\\" In 1996, Ross was sentenced to life imprisonment under the three- strikes law after being convicted for purchasing more than 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal agent in a sting operation. Later that year, a series of articles by journalist Gary Webb in the San Jose Mercury News revealed a connection between one of Ross's cocaine sources, Danilo Bland√≥n, and the CIA as part of the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. Having learned to read at the age of 28, during his first stint in prison, Ross spent much of his time behind bars studying the law. He eventually discovered a legal loophole that would lead to his release. Ross's case was brought to a federal court of appeals which found that the three-strikes law had been erroneously applied and reduced his sentence to 20 years. He was released from Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana on September 29, 2009. Ross was arrested in October 2015 on suspicion of possessing cash related to the sales of illegal drugs when police discovered $100,000 in his possession during a traffic stop. Ross later alleged that he had been racially profiled and stated that he was carrying a large amount of cash for the purchase of a home. Charges were ultimately dropped, and Ross explained he had earned the cash from book sales and speaking fees.Jack Morse (2015). Charges Dropped Against Former Crack Kingpin Pulled Over With $100K In Cash , SFist.com, October 26, 2015.  Cocaine use and business = Cocaine introduction  Ross began selling cocaine after his illiteracy prevented him from earning a tennis scholarship for college. He began spending time with an upholstery teacher at a Los Angeles community college who revealed he dealt cocaine and offered Ross a small amount to sell. Ross used his profit to purchase more cocaine to sell, expanding his small operation. Ross eventually began to ask for quantities to sell that exceeded what the teacher was willing to procure, so he turned to find a new dealer. The teacher referred Ross to his supplier, Ivan Arguellas, who offered to keep Ross supplied. Arguellas was able to provide larger quantities at a better price, and Ross quickly went from dealing in grams of cocaine to dealing in ounces. About eight months after becoming Ross's supplier, Arguellas was shot in the spine, resulting in months of hospitalization that forced him out of the cocaine business. His brother-in-law Henry Corrales took over the business, but was not enthusiastic about the trade and had failed to make any connections of his own to suppliers. A Nicaraguan exile and cocaine distributor named Danilo Bland√≥n was acquainted with Arguellas and Corrales, and although he did not know him personally, was impressed with the amount of cocaine that Ross was moving. Bland√≥n offered to supply cocaine to Corrales to sell to Ross, for a fifty-fifty split of the profit. Eventually, Corrales lost his appetite for the cocaine business and retired, at which point Ross became a direct customer of Bland√≥n. Through his connection to Bland√≥n, and Bland√≥n's supplier Norwin Meneses Cantarero, Ross was able to purchase Nicaraguan cocaine at significantly reduced rates. Ross began distributing cocaine at $10,000 per kilo less than the average street price, distributing it to the Bloods and Crips street gangs. By 1982, Ross had received his moniker of \\"Freeway Ricky\\" and claimed to have sold up to US$3 million worth of cocaine per day, purchasing 1,000 pounds of cocaine a week. Ross initially invested most of his profits in houses and businesses, because he feared his mother would catch on to what he was doing if he started spending lavishly on himself. In a jailhouse interview with reporter Gary Webb, Ross said, \\"We were hiding our money from our mothers.\\" He invested a portion of the proceeds from his drug dealing activities in Anita Baker's first album.  Drug empire  With thousands of employees, Ross has said he operated drug sales not only in Los Angeles but in places across the country including St. Louis, New Orleans, Texas, Kansas City, Oklahoma, Indiana, Cincinnati, North Carolina, South Carolina, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Seattle. He has said that his most lucrative sales came from the Ohio area. He made similar claims in a 1996 PBS interview. According to the East Bay Times, \\"In the course of his rise, prosecutors estimate that Ross exported several tons of cocaine to New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, and made more than $600 million in the process.\\" Adjusting for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, this becomes more than a billion dollars in 2013. Much of Ross's success at evading law enforcement was due to his ring's possession of police scanners and voice scramblers. Following one drug bust, a Los Angeles County sheriff remarked that Ross's men had \\"better equipment than we have.\\" According to the October 2013 Esquire article, \\"Between 1982 and 1989, federal prosecutors estimated, Ross bought and resold several metric tons of cocaine. In 1980 dollars, his gross earnings were said to be in excess of $900 million ‚Äì with a profit of nearly $300 million. Converted roughly to present-day dollars: $2.5 billion gross and $850 million in profit. As his distribution empire grew to include forty-two cities, the price he paid per kg of powder cocaine dropped from as much as $60,000 to as low as $10,000.\\"  Lawsuit against rapper Rick Ross  On June 18, 2010, Ross sued rapper Rick Ross (real name William Leonard Roberts II) for using his name, filing a copyright infringement lawsuit against Ross in a California Federal Court. Jay-Z had been called to testify in the lawsuit, as he was President of Def Jam when Ross was signed to the label. Ross sought $10 million in compensation in the lawsuit. After the lawsuit was dismissed on July 3, 2010, the album Teflon Don was released as scheduled on July 20, 2010. A federal judge ruled that the case should be refiled in California state court because it fell under California state law. Ross refiled the case with the State of California and the federal case is on appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The state case was filed in 2011 in California. Ross refiled in Los Angeles Superior Court with publicity rights claims. Trial was set for early May 2012. The case was dismissed by a judge in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The California State case was updated with a motion in Freeway Rick Ross's favor as to Warner Bros. Records and their use of the name and image Rick Ross in July 2012. The New York Post reported that a trial was set for August 27, 2013 in Freeway Rick Ross versus Rick Ross and Warner Music Group. On December 30, 2013, the court ruled in favor of the rapper Rick Ross, allowing him to keep the name based on a First Amendment ruling.  Book  In 2013, The Huffington Post reported that journalist and author Cathy Scott was co-writing Ross's autobiography with him, scheduled for release in 2014. The memoir, Freeway Rick Ross: The Untold Autobiography, was released at a book launch with author Scott at the Eso Won Bookstore in Los Angeles on June 17, 2014 to a standing- room only crowd. KCET TV in its review wrote, \\"(The book) is fascinating for its unsentimental, inside look at his career on the streets of South Central, which started for Ross with car theft and quickly shifted to drugs and the big time.\\"  Award  The memoir was nominated for ForeWord Reviews IndiFab Best Book of the Year Award 2014 in the true crime category. In June 2015, winners were announced, with the book named as a Foreword Reviews' 2014 INDIEFAB Book of the Year Award Finalist, True Crime. Ross was a key figure in filmmaker Kevin Booth's documentary American Drug War: The Last White Hope. The second episode of the first season of BET's American Gangster documentary series was focused on the story of Ricky Ross and his connection to the Iran‚ÄìContra scandal. Ross was a guest interview on VH1's Planet Rock History of Crack and Hip Hop Documentary. Ross is featured in the 2015 two-part documentary Freeway: Crack in the System, which details various levels of the drug trade, the Iran‚ÄìContra scandal, and mass incarceration. In 2016, the documentary was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Investigative Journalism: Long Form. Since 2013, Ross has been a regular guest on The Joe Rogan Experience. In the 2014 film Kill the Messenger, Ross is portrayed by Michael K. Williams.

One of the most prominent studies carried out to assess the relationship between fish farms and sea lice infestations on wild species was carried out in this archipelago in the spring of 2002. Additionally, the sediment and waste released from such industrial aquaculture has recently been shown to severely impact the health of glass sponge reefs, which are one of the most ancient forms of animal life on earth and remain unique to specific regions in the Pacific Northwest. Conservation The archipelago is rich in biodiversity and culturally significant sites. Protected areas include Broughton Archipelago Conservancy, Broughton Archipelago Provincial Park, Burdwood Group Conservancy, Cormorant Channel Marine Provincial Park, Echo Bay Marine Provincial Park, and Qwiquallaaq/Boat Bay Conservancy.

History Originally WFUR-FM and the sister station to WFUR, the station was constructed on the AM tower site in 1960. The primary reason for construction of WFUR-FM was the early morning and night time audience that WFUR could not reach because at that time, WFUR was only allowed daylight operation (sunrise to sunset). WFUR-FM was the third FM station in the Grand Rapids market. Through the years, WFUR-FM increased power as opportunities became available. The final increase took place in 1983. Agreements were signed with other 102.9 FM stations in Ann Arbor and Milwaukee to accept any interference caused by each of them going to 50,000 watts. WFUR-FM constructed a new, taller with the antenna at a height above average terrain of 490 ft., and installed a new transmitter (Continental) at that time. Effective May 11, 2020, WFUR-FM was sold to the Bible Broadcasting Network, and the station changed its call sign to WYHA.

Production  Ronstadt, a soprano, and Savoy, an alto, had previously recorded duets for the Savoy-produced album Evangeline Made: A Tribute to Cajun Music; here, they sing together as The Zozo Sisters on the album, which brings together a mixture of Louisiana Cajun sounds, popular music of the 20th century, and folk/rock classics. The album includes an interpretation of The Left Banke's 1966 hit \\"Walk Away Ren√©e\\", Harry Belafonte's 1950s hit by John Jacob Niles \\"Go Away From My Window\\" and the French classic \\"Parlez-Moi D'Amour\\". Ronstadt takes lead on Julie Miller's \\"I Can't Get Over You,\\" with Julie's husband Buddy Miller on guitar and Savoy takes lead on Richard Thompson's \\"Burns' Supper.\\" On her collaboration with Savoy, Ronstadt remarked: \\"We could have made a quilt, I guess, except we're musicians, so we're making a record together instead.

Plot The story begins with the exile of a young boy who grows up to meet his destiny as a great warrior. After his father, a Han loyalist and hero, is betrayed by the Emperor and sentenced to death, Yuan Chengzhi is spirited away to the reclusive master of the Lung Yau school of martial arts. Having grown into a righteous young man of considerable martial skill, Yuan sets out on his own. He discovers the hideout of a long-dead martial arts master known as Golden Snake Xia Xueyi and lays claim to his buried martial arts manual, sword, and collection of darts. He also discovers the whereabouts of a lost treasure and instructions to deliver a portion of it to a certain woman. Cheng-chih sets out to find her in order to honor the dead man's wishes and ends up meeting a spoiled and not-so- cleverly disguised young woman posing as a man named Wen Qingqing. It's enough to fool the naive Yuan Chengzhi, who befriends Wen after she takes a liking to him. She brings him into her household, which is home to a wealthy clan of martial artists known for their mastery of the Five Element Array. Yuan's stay grows unsettling, first when jealous quarreling sparked by his presence erupts between Wen and her cousin. Things get a lot more complicated when a trio of angry martial artists storm the household and accuse Wen of theft. It turns out that they are members of Yuan's school and just as the situation threatens to turn into a full-scale battle, he intercedes in order to find a peaceful solution. As a result of his intervention, Yuan's skills draw the attention of the master of the house, who recognizes the kung fu techniques of his arch- enemy. As hidden truths about the Wen clan and their dark part are revealed through flashbacks, Yuan finds himself forced to fight their infamous Five Element Array in order to complete his quest and escape in one piece.

The Merced River meanders through the long flat valley, draining out over Nevada Fall and Vernal Fall before emptying into the main Yosemite Valley. It can be reached by a day hike from the main valley, and is the most popular area in the Yosemite Wilderness. The Valley provides access to nearby destinations such as the back side of Half Dome, Clouds Rest and the High Sierra Camp at Merced Lake. Little Yosemite Valley is a tread on the glacial stairway of the Merced River that runs from Yosemite Valley up to Mount Lyell, gaining some of vertical elevation over and is situated some in elevation above Yosemite Valley proper. Geology North Wall of Little Yosemite Valley The north wall of Little Yosemite has not been subject to the same kinds of glacial planing as the south wall because the granite rocks of Moraine Dome and Sugar Bowl Dome are tougher and more resistant. This is remarkable considering that it is likely that Little Yosemite was not only scoured repeatedly by glaciers that were wholly contained by the canyon, but also overrun by glaciers that overflowed the Merced canyon and spread widely into surrounding uplands with occasional surges of ice contributed over the pass from the overflowing Tuolumne River basin. These rocks were thus subject to tremendous gravitational and flow forces yet retain a remarkable degree of integrity, eroding almost exclusively and superficially along exfoliation joints. The south wall of the valley has been subject to extensive glacial planing, with all jointed granite completely smoothed away, leaving a stark, featureless unjointed sheer cliff face, as is apparent in the image of Little Yosemite Valley from Washburn Point, above right. The west end and south wall of the canyon are \\"exceptionally massive, few cliffs anywhere in the Yosemite region exhibit a more complete absence of fractures.\\" This also leads to an almost complete absence of vegetation as well, as there are few opportunities for roothold. The north wall in contrast, and similarly to the north wall of Yosemite Valley, has been subject to much less glacial planing and is much more differentiated and vegetated. Features=Liberty Cap and Mount Broderick Mount Broderick and Liberty Cap Liberty Cap is a granite dome in Yosemite National Park, California, United States, which lies at the extreme northwestern margin of Little Yosemite Valley. It lies adjacent, to the north of Nevada Fall, on the John Muir Trail at . It rises feet from the base of Nevada Fall to a peak elevation of . A smaller, mesa-like dome called Mount Broderick stands immediately adjacent to Liberty Cap. Together, they form a barrier on the north side of the mouth of Little Yosemite Valley. Both Liberty Cap and Mount Broderick are roches moutonn√©es, features that protruded above or resisting being overridden by successive Merced River glaciers because they are made of massive unjointed granite sufficiently resistant to glacial erosive power, leaving them prominent in the post-glacial landscape. Both features are glacially polished on their glacier-facing side and ragged on their leeward side. Half Dome Half Dome from Little Yosemite Valley Half Dome is a granite dome in Yosemite National Park located at the northwestern end of Little Yosemite Valley at ‚Äî possibly Yosemite's most familiar rock formation. The granite crest rises more than above the Yosemite Valley floor at Tenaya Canyon and above the floor of Little Yosemite Valley. The trail to Half Dome branches to the north from the main Little Yosemite Valley trail near the ranger station, out houses and campground. Moraine Dome Granite Apron draping southwestern margin of Moraine Dome Moraine Dome is a granite dome in Yosemite National Park along the northern margin of Little Yosemite Valley at which rises to an elevation of AMSL, above the Merced River. Moraine Dome is notable because the presence of lateral moraines from the Merced Glacier. It is likely that these moraines represent the highest level attained by glacial ice in Little Yosemite Valley. Although it is about as high as Sentinel Dome Moraine Dome is dwarfed to relative insignificance by its proximity to the bulk and elevation of Clouds Rest to the north. The south western margin of Moraine Dome is wrapped by a broad, striped granite apron with an approximately 40¬∞ slope that appears to rise some from the valley floor. Sugar Loaf Sugar Loaf Dome Sugar Loaf Dome is a granite dome in Yosemite National Park at the northeastern head of Little Yosemite Valley at which rises to AMSL. Although Sugar Loaf Dome has been repeatedly subject to glaciation, the core of this spur has resisted the icy onslaughts because what remains today is massive throughout except for one master joint, horizontal in character. Post-glaciation, Sugar Loaf Dome retains a 1,300 feet rise over, and its shoulder perturbs the course of the Merced River and provides the relief over which the river descends into Little Yosemite via Cascade Fall. Cascade Fall Cascade Fall Cascade Fall at , elevation AMSL tumbles via a Water Wheel over the glacially polished granite saddle between Sugar Loaf and Bunnell Point into a delightful pool at the eastern head of Little Yosemite Valley. This cascade is often mistaken for Bunnell Cascade which is located between the Lost Valley and Echo Valley at . Bunnell Point Westward facing Bunnell Point Cliff from Little Yosemite Valley Bunnell Point is a granite dome summit in Mariposa County, California. Bunnell Point rises to AMSL. Bunnell Point is located at comprising the southeast margin of Little Yosemite Valley. Cascade Cliffs from Little Yosemite Valley Cascade Cliffs Cascade Cliffs is a wall of unjointed granite that rises to AMSL, above the Merced River and make up the southern wall of Little Yosemite Valley at , southwest of Bunnell Point and northeast of Mount Starr King, of which Cascade Cliffs comprises the northern flank. In few other places in the Yosemite region is the granite more continuously massive than in the Cascade Cliffs. Only one horizontal master joint divides the rock (in the lower left) The scales on the cliffs are merely surficial features due to exfoliation. The dark streaks indicate the paths followed by the ribbon cascades which descend from the upland in the spring, when the snow is melting, and from which the cliffs take their name. There are two wide, relatively short yet quite deep arches at the bottom of the cliff. The Quarter Domes The Quarter Domes are granodiorite domes rising between Half Dome and Clouds Rest. They comprise two domes, West Quarter Dome and East Quarter Dome. The higher of the two is East Quarter Dome, at ; West Quarter Dome stands at . Facilities=Trail The Merced River enters Little Yosemite Valley at at the pool at the base of the cascade and leaves the valley at for a total elevation difference of over a trail length of . The trail is largely forested, with two notable areas of exposure, the first on the approach to the southwest buttress of Moraine Dome and the second, of burned forest, at approximately above Nevada Fall, across from Cascade Cliffs. Campground The hike-in campground here is a little under 4 miles (6.5 km) from the trailhead in Yosemite Valley and about 3.5 miles (5.5 km) from the summit of Half Dome at . Fires are allowed in the two communal campfire rings just outside the campground. Potable (drinking) water is not available at the campground. River water is available nearby, at the Merced River. The river is the only water source for the area. Little Yosemite Valley Ranger Station is staffed during summer. A composting toilet is available for use near the campground The Park Service provides communal food lockers at the campground in which to store food, toiletries, and trash safe from abundant hungry black bears that frequent Little Yosemite.

The store and the chain were formed in 1954 through the merger of the separate Kroch's bookstore with the former Chicago branch of the New York-based Brentano's bookstore. The chain was closed in 1995 after suffering financial losses from increased competition. History Photograph of Kroch's & Brentano's sign Adolph Kroch, an Austrian immigrant to Chicago, founded a German-language bookstore on Monroe Street in 1907. He switched to English-language books during World War I. A few years, later he moved the store to a larger location at 22 N. Michigan. After 15 years at that location, Kroch's International Book Shop moved to 206 N. Michigan Avenue in 1927. This store became the largest bookstore in Chicago by the time this location was closed in 1953. In 1933, Kroch was able to purchase the Chicago branch of the New York-based Brentano's bookstore which had been in Chicago since 1884. To prevent Brentano's from re- entering Chicago, Kroch kept the Brentano name and operate this store as a separate business from his own Kroch's bookstore until his retirement. Adolf Kroch decided to retire in 1947 and to hand over the management of the company to his son Carl. In 1953, Carl announced that he would form the \\"World's Largest Bookstore\\" the following year by merging the separate Kroch's and Brentano's bookstores and by enlarging the space that was then occupied by Brentano's at 29 South Wabash Avenue to 40,000 square feet of retail space. In the basement of this store was another store that was called \\"Super Book Mart\\" which specialized in carrying paperbacks and low cost hardback reprints, the first of its kind in Chicago. Kroch's and Brentano's was said to have the finest selection of art books in the region, and its sales clerks were famously knowledgeable. One such individual was Henry Tabor, who ran the art department. There was seemingly nothing he didn't know in the world of art. The flagship store at 29 S. Wabash had several distinct departments including one run by Alice (Morimoto) Goda who was secretary to the vice-president which was a mail order center that tracked down obscure out-of-print titles for customers around the world. The store frequently exhibited noted painters' and photographers' work on the walls, and regularly hosted book signings by major authors. At its peak Kroch's had a total of 22 stores in the Chicago metropolitan area. Kroch refused to offer the sorts of discounts that other book chains did, even though the store suffered when large discount chains, such as Crown Books, opened up nearby. When Crown opened its downtown Chicago store a few blocks north of the 29 S. Wabash location, Kroch's management felt that it was not a serious threat, since it did not offer \\"full service\\". However, unable to compete with the discount bookstores, Kroch's and Brentano's closed its doors in 1995. Always known for major book signings through its entire history, its final major book signing was with heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman, who was promoting his autobiography By George. That event was hosted by Don Hailman, a long time manager with the company. Employee Hans Summers waited on the store's final customer at its flagship store on Wabash in downtown Chicago. At the age of 72, owner Carl Kroch decided to step down as president and CEO and sell the chain to his 700 employees in 1986. At the time of the transition the chain had 17 locations. Increased competition from Crown, Borders, Barnes & Noble, and other discount bookstores forced the company to close all 10 of its suburban mall locations and leaving the remaining 7 Chicago locations open in 1993. A few months later when the company was on verge of bankruptcy, Kroch bought back the company and then turned around and resold the company to Businesship International. After closing more stores, the new parent company was unable to turn the company around and was forced to file for bankruptcy in June 1995 and was liquidated. The remaining stores finally closed on July 31, 1995. Brentano's in Chicago During the late part of the Nineteenth and the early part of the Twentieth Centuries, the New York City-based Brentano's had a branch store in Chicago. This store had been operating for several decades before Adolph Kroch opened his bookstore. In 1884, Arthur Brentano open the Chicago branch of his family's New York bookstore at 101 State street. By 1930, Brentano's was the largest bookstore chain in the United States with 10 locations, 5 of which were outside of New York City, plus 2 additional affiliated locations in Europe. Unfortunately, Brentano's expanded too fast just prior to the start of the Great Depression and its creditors, mostly publishers and banks, forced the company to file for bankruptcy in March 1933. The creditors preferred to see the assets of the firm sold to a group willing to maintain the company as on going business enterprise instead of liquidating the firm and glutting the bookselling market by having a large number of books being at below costs and thus destroying the bookselling market for publishers and other dealers. At the bankruptcy sale, financier (and later U.S. ambassador) Stanton Griffis teamed up with Adolf Kroch to make the successful bid to purchase the firm. Their bid was successful since they were the only group that had included a successful bookstore owner, which probably influenced the decision made by the creditors. For his part in the bankruptcy sale, Kroch received the Chicago branch store and the exclusive right to use and control the Brentano's name within the states of Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin. Kroch kept his Brentano's store in Chicago as a separate subsidiary of his existing Kroch's bookstore until 1954 when both stores were combined to form Kroch's and Brentano's. When the first combined Kroch's & Brentano's bookstore opened in 1954, this became the largest bookstore in Chicago at 40,000 square feet. Kroch had succeeded in preventing MacMillan, Waldenbooks, and Borders from using the Brentano's name within the Chicago area market.

The station is licensed to broadcast with 5,000 watts of power during the daytime hours but must sign off at sunset to protect co-channel WRVA (AM) in Richmond, Virginia. It is rebroadcast on WSPB 89.7 FM; licensed to Bedford, it serves the Battle Creek area. In September 2009 WJNZ Radio was purchased at a public auction by Holy Family Radio with the intent of becoming a Catholic radio station with a talk format. The station was silent for several months pending the FCC‚Äôs authorization to transfer the license and during which time the call signs were changed to WVHF - Voice of the Holy Family. The sale was completed on December 8, 2010 and the station went back on the air Christmas Day, 2010 with the new Catholic format. WVHF is a non-profit, listener-supported radio station. History AM 1140 had a long history of serving the African-American community of Grand Rapids, originally as WKWM (the calls stood for the city of license, Kentwood, Michigan). WKWM began as a disco-formatted station in the late 1970s and migrated to Urban Contemporary in the early 1980s. In the 1980s, WKWM was a reporter to Billboard magazine's Hot Black/Soul/R&B; airplay panel. In the fall of 1998, WKWM tried a syndicated talk format as WXBV. Since Grand Rapids already had several talk-oriented stations, WXBV's talk format was unsuccessful and the station tumbled out of the ratings. Less than a year later, the heritage WKWM calls were restored and the station returned to music, airing Westwood One's satellite-fed \\"Groovin' Oldies\\" package. By the end of 2001, Westwood One had discontinued the \\"Groovin' Oldies\\" format, and WKWM had switched to adult standards with the Music of Your Life from Jones Radio Networks, to compete with 810 WMJH (which aired Westwood One's AM Only/Adult Standards feed). However, WKWM remained mired near the bottom of the ratings, and neither WKWM nor WMJH was ultimately able to make enough money to stay afloat. WMJH has since switched to a Spanish-language format. In June 2003, the WJNZ calls moved to AM 1140 from co-owned AM 1680, which switched to ABC's Radio Disney feed as WDSS (now talk radio station WPRR). The following year, Michael St. Cyr, under the licensee name of \\"WJNZ Radio, LLC\\", acquired WJNZ from Goodrich Radio. WJNZ \\"1140 Jamz\\" billed itself as \\"The Pulse of the City\\" and \\"Grand Rapids' Only R&B; Station.\\" Programming was a combination of local hosts and ABC Radio's syndicated Urban AC format known as \\"The Touch\\" (or \\"Today's R&B; and Old School\\"). WJNZ was also Grand Rapids' outlet for the popular Tom Joyner syndicated morning show. On June 9, 2009, WJNZ Radio, LLC was placed into involuntary receivership, according to FCC records. The Kent County circuit court assigned the license to Amicus Management, a company headed by Daniel J. Yeomans.FCC: WJNZ Public Notice Comment -- Involuntary Assignment of License, 6/9/2009. The Urban AC format and \\"Jamz\\" name were moved to 1530 WYGR. The station's callsign was changed to WVHF on April 13, 2010 while it was silent.

The company were based in Thetford, Norfolk and operated from the St Nicholas works on Minstergate and St Nicholas Street, some of which survives today. At their height they employed over 350 people and were the largest employer within the town. The company became known for producing reliable and good-looking traction engines which were always built to customers' requirements. The company declined after the First World War when internal combustion engines started to become a cheaper alternative to steam power. The company finally closed in 1928, with the final engines being built by Richard Garrett & Sons at Leiston, Suffolk. History=1770 to 1847: Early years In 1770 a Joseph Burrell, a master smith, established a small forge in Thetford, for the manufacture and repair of agricultural implements.Lane (1971), p. 23 In 1801 a Joseph Burrell was found to be advertising \\"Chaff Engines, Drill Rolls and Drill Machines\\", items of agricultural equipment, from his foundry on Kings Street Thetford. By 1805 Joseph had joined with his two brothers James and William and were advertising Threshing Machines for sale. In 1817 Charles Burrell was born. Charles was James Burrell's third child. William Burrell died in 1822 and Joseph died in 1831. The sole surviving brother James inherited the business; five years later he died, and control of the business passed to his son and Joseph's nephew, Charles, in 1836 when he was only 19 years old.Osbourne (1991), p. 8 1848 to 1906: Growth with steam Diamond Queen traction engine, manufactured by Charles Burrell & Sons, 1897 Charles Burrell built the company's first steam engine in 1848. Initially like most other manufacturers they built portable engines but they gradually moved into self-moving agricultural engines and later engines built specifically for road transport. In 1856 they built the first road haulage engine in conjunction with James Boydell. Boydell had invented a system where flat boards were attached to a wheel loosely at their centers, as the wheels revolved they were capable of spreading the weight of an engine over the surface of the board, versions of these became known as Dreadnaught Wheels. The wheels were not unlike the continuous track used in tanks today. The company was converted to a Limited Liability Company in 1884. In 1906 Charles Burrell died at his home St. Mary's House on Bury Road in Thetford. His son Robert, a talented engineer, had died two years earlier in 1904. The success of the company has undoubtedly due to the fine partnership between Charles and his three sons, Frederick, Robert and Charles Jnr. In 1900 after 64 years control of the company was handed over by Charles to his third son Charles Jnr who ran day-to-day operations until the company's closure. 1907 to 1913: At their height A 1909 Burrell general purpose engine Production grew gradually throughout the early 20th century; this culminated in 1913, the company's most successful year, with over 104 engines completed in 12 months.Osbourne (1991), p. 6 Construction of portable engines ended in 1908. By this time the company was focusing on the production of traction engines for agricultural use and engines built for the needs of traveling showmen. 1914 to 1918: First World War Like many engineering companies at the time, production was turned over during the First World War to the construction of various munitions, some of which survive to this day. Engine production continued, however, and a large number of engines left the factory despite the war effort. 1919 to 1932: AGE and decline Burrell 'Busy Bee' Steam Tractor. Sales declined after the war had ended, and these were difficult years for the company. The company suffered resulting from the economic situation but also from increased competition from other manufacturers. The depression caused many orders for equipment worn out during the war to be cancelled, to compound this there was a glut of secondhand engines which had been produced for war use that were being sold cheaply to Showman and Haulage Contractors, two of the company's key markets. For a time the workforce at the St Nicholas Works was reduced to a four-day week.Lane (1971), p. 111 In 1919 Burrell joined the formation of the Agricultural & General Engineers (AGE).Gilbert (1991), p. 17 Like many of the companies who joined, this proved to be a disastrous move. 1923 and 1924 showed an improvement in sales but by this time the writing was on the wall with other technologies coming to the fore. On 4 June 1928 the company closed its doors at Thetford for good, with the final engines being built at Leiston by Richard Garrett & Sons.Lane (1971), p. 257 The original plans to many of the Burrell engines are held privately by the Palmer family of Haughley in Suffolk through the marriage of Mrs Annie Palmer to Mr Thomas Doran whom with his brother founded Doran Bros of Thetford at Haughley House in Croxton Road, Thetford. Products=Portable engines The first portable engine produced by Charles Burrell & Sons and their first steam engine of any kind was completed in 1846. This engine survived in a derelict form in the St Nicholas works yard until the 1920s before being scrapped. Three engines of this early design with wrought iron boilers were produced and exhibited at the RASE in the late 1840s. Following this development was rapid and in only five years by 1851 the design of portable engines had matured into a form that was to remain unaltered for the rest of the steam era.Lane (1994), pp. 7‚Äì8 Portable engines were very simple with no gearing connected to the road wheels, no tanks were fitted, water was drawn to the engine from a barrel placed alongside, and the majority had single cylinders; however compound versions were produced. Charles Burrell & Sons produced portables in a range of sizes, these were rated by the company in NHP.Gilbert (1991), p. 23 Around 670 portable engines were completed by the firm; however by the turn of the 20th century production of portables had slowed to a crawl as the company became more occupied with production of self-moving steam engines, and the final portable engine was sold in 1908.Engine Resources Steam tractors Charles Burrell & Sons 1913 'Gold Medal' Steam Tractor now in preservation The first steam tractor was produced by Charles Burrell & Sons in 1905 following changes in Parliamentary legislation which allowed one-man operation of traction engines on the public highway, engines however could weigh no more than five tons unladen and were limited to a top speed of .Lane (1994), p. 256 The prototype steam tractor was a single-cylinder design but in 1906 a compound-cylinder version was produced, and this proved to be by far the most popular version with customers.Lane (1994), p. 257 In 1908 the RAC organised a trial of competing makers' steam tractors to ascertain the best. Charles Burrell & Sons entered engine number 2932, a standard example of their range, but this engine was fitted with special patented wheels constructed of steel but with wooden blocks on the outer rim. After 22 days and Charles Burrell & Sons' entry was declared the winner. From this point onwards tractors produced by the firm became known as \\"Burrell Gold Medal Tractors\\".Lane (1994), p. 262 Charles Burrell & Sons also added showmans fittings or forward mounted cranes to their tractors. In all 11 were sold new to amusement caterers, with at a further 5 receiving showmans fittings by external companies and 6 engines were supplied new to the War Department with a 2-ton capacity crane fitted.Lane (1994), pp. 260‚Äì262 In 1923 road legislation was changed again, and engines up to 7 tons were allowed to be operated on the road by a single operative, in response the company designed a larger steam tractor to service this new market, but it came too late for Charles Burrell & Sons, who by this time were in financial trouble and only three of this type of engine were completed.Lane (1994), p. 264 Charles Burrell & Sons' five-ton tractors found much favour with haulage contractors, quarry owners, timber hauliers, the military and amusement caterers, generally working with the use of a similar-sized trailer. After a production run of 20 years with over 200 engines completed, the final steam tractor was supplied in 1927.Lane (1994), p. 259 Road locomotives His Lordship, Burrell Showman's road locomotive, in the Tom Varley collection. 1970s photo. The first road locomotives started to emerge from the St Nicholas works in the late 1870s, with 14 engines specifically designed for the job of road haulage produced between 1878 and 1890.Lane (1994), p. 142 Following the changes to the Locomotive Act and Locomotive on Highways in 1896 the market for Road Locomotives expanded considerably. Charles Burrell & Sons Road Locomotives were slightly modified versions of their general-purpose engines to allow for faster rates of travel over long journeys.Osbourne (1991), p. 26 A general-purpose engine was designed to spend much of its life stationary, powering belt-driven equipment, whereas a road locomotive was constantly on the move, therefore subtle design differences were needed. These modifications included stronger drive shafts, gears and wheels; additional water-carrying capacity; generally a canopy was fitted; solid flywheels and additional platework around the engine's cylinder motion.Lane (1994), pp. 142‚Äì143 Loads hauled could be anything that could be carried in accompanying wagons, this included coal, bricks, stone, timber, grain etc. During the late 18th to early 19th century it was not uncommon for road locomotives to haul up to three fully laden wagons of 10 tons each, but as smaller steam engines became more common, the use of multiple wagons became infrequent - the use of Road Locomotives shifting to the movement of indivisible loads such as boilers, marine engine parts, railways engines or electrical equipment.Osbourne (1991), p. 28 The largest engine produced by Charles Burrell & Sons was a Road Locomotive produced for the William Kerr of Mavisbank in Glasgow. Works number 3419, the engine was named \\"Clyde\\" and completed in October 1912. Clyde was a special order, built specifically for the haulage of enormous loads across the West of Scotland. Following many years of service the engine was sold at the end of the Second World War and driven away from Kerr's yard in Glasgow by a young man and his wife and never seen again - it is believed that the engine was broken-up shortly after in a Tyneside breakers yard.Lane (1994), pp. 164‚Äì165 Road rollers Burrell's made their first road roller in 1891 which was supplied to a local contractor in close by Roundham, Norfolk.Engine Resources Product increased gradually until the turn of the century when there was regular demand for new machines. Burrell road rollers were a very conventional design and changed little in their total run of production. Five different sizes of rollers were available, 6 ton, 8 ton, 10 ton (class A), 12 ton (class B), 14 ton (class C) all available with additional extras, for example scarifiers which broke up the road surface prior to re-laying.Gilbert (1991), p. 5 In total the company built 384 road rollers in a variety of sizes and configurations with a number of engines converted to rollers at a later date.Engine Resources The final roller was despatched in 1929 to Mutford & Lothingland Rural District Council in Suffolk.Engine Resources Ploughing engines Burrell Universal type Ploughing Engine line drawing as used in Burrell advertising material. Charles Burrell started building ploughing engines from as early as 1860 in the very infancy of steam ploughing. These engines were built under license from John Fowler & Co who had patented the system of steam cultivation with two engines several years earlier.Crawley (1985), p. 27 These early engines were very similar to Kitson and Hewitson design of ploughing engine with the exception of the drive to the rear wheels which was via chain. In addition Burrell produced, again under licence from Fowlers, a range of implements for cable ploughing including balance ploughs, turn-about cultivators and a patent small cultivator for use on light land with a single engine.Haining & Tyler (1985), p. 218 Despite these early exploits and the company having extensive interests in producing engines for agricultural purposes Burrell paid scant attention to the construction of ploughing engines.Bonnett (1965), p. 75 All told the company produced 142 ploughing engines between 1860 and 1914 when the final pair of engines were completed for a customer in Germany.Engine Resources Early engines were often chain driven but later engines were gear driven speciality order engines for overseas customers.Bonnett (1965), p. 76 Burrell's experimented with a system whereupon the winding drum was mounted vertically on the boiler, this had the advantage that external stresses placed on the boiler were much reduced over the standard means of mounting the drum on the underside of an engine's boiler. This system was first patented by two agricultural engineers from nearby Fakenham, Percival Everitt and William John Adams. By arrangement Burrells built ploughing engines incorporating the Everitt and Adams winding drum arrangement and engines were supplied either as a pair with left and right drums or singly with a double drum for use with supplied roundabout tackle. In 1881 Everitt and Adams transferred commercial rights for the system to Burrells for royalties of ¬£5 per engine sold, this type of engine then became known as Universal Type Ploughing Engines. This pattern of side drum mounting was never widely adopted and the limited number of engines produced most were sold overseas.Haining & Tyler (1985), p. 219 A single set of Burrell ploughing have survived into preservation, works numbers 776 & 777 built for a customer in West Sussex and completed in June 1879. After several owners in preservation the engines passed to the Museum of East Anglian Life in Stowmarket Norfolk and occasionally appear at local events demonstrating steam ploughing.Crawley (1985), p. 30 Steam wagons Charles Burrell produced their first steam wagon in 1901, however it appears that this experimental engine never went into product and was retained by the company for their own uses.Gilbert (1991), p. 31 It was not until 1911 that they made a serious attempt to enter what was now a growing market.Lane (1971), p. 226 The Burrell wagons generally followed the design followed by market leader Fodens of Sandbach and several revisions were produced when Fodens had established an improved design. Overall the company produced around 120 overtype steam wagons between 1911 and 1928.Engine Resources Two wagons supplied were fitted with a dynamo and full showman's fittings, works numbers 3843 \\"The Lion\\" and 3883 \\"Electra\\", in 1939 this second wagon was totally destroyed in a Nazi bombing raid over Plymouth.Gilbert (1991), p. 229 The company's steam wagons were never serious competitors to rivals Foden whose products were much better regarded and had cornered the market prior to Burrells entering somewhat late.Gilbert (1991), p. 32 Other Products The Axle, stamped with the firm's name Three miles south of Thetford is Euston Hall, in the grounds is a private watermill. The mill was designed to pump water and also grind corn. Being only a short distance from the factory an axle for the waterwheel was produced. This is the only known surviving waterwheel axle made by the firm. St Nicholas Works=Factory The St Nicholas works was named after the long demolished church of St Nicholas which had stood nearby to where it was sited. The Thetford site where Burrell's designed and built their equipment occupied a area close to the center of the town, next to the Little Ouse with the buildings divided by Minstergate Street.Lane (1971), p. 230 At its closure the works consisted of 15 separate parts each with a distinct purposes. Workforce The labour force of Charles Burrell & Sons Ltd tended to be static and two or three generation of the same family could be employed within the works at the same time. The employees generally enjoyed a tolerable surroundings and were not subjected to the unrelenting demands for greater productivity and efficiency as was the case at other highly industrialised companies at that time. In the 1890s the company employed about 300 men, including a number of indentured apprentices. By 1914 this had grown to in excess of 400.Lane (1971), p. 231 The company produced a number of notable employees who went on to contribute to the development of various spheres of engineering in the twentieth century after leaving Burrell's, the most famous of these being Edmund Bruce Ball who later went on to become President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1939.Lane (1971), p. 232 Another was former Head Salesman Sidney Harrison who worked for the company from 1900 until its closure in 1928, he had an enormous fund of recollections concerning his experiences with the company.Gilbert (1991), p. 37 The Burrell Hiring Company In 1887 in an effort to promote business Burrell's setup The Burrell Hiring Company whereby customers could purchase engines on a hire purchase scheme without having to stand the total cost of an engine. The hiring company was founded with Charles Burrell Jnr and Frederick Burrell as directors and the company purchased engines at list prices less 10% from the parent company.Lane (1971), p. 130 An agreement was made with the customer allowing for an initial payment followed by a series of installments, usually sixteen, paid at quarterly or half yearly intervals with interest usually charged at 6% and on occasions 7.5%,Lane (1971), p. 131 the total terms of repayment usually being 3 or 4 years. Failure to maintain regular payments meant repossession and the equipment was offered for sale. There are a number of documented cases of these repossessions occurring. All engines owned by the Hiring Company carried a brass plate giving a reference number, it was a term of the agreement that this plate could not be removed until the final payment had been made and ownership transferred. The scheme was available for both new and second hand Burrell engines and equipment and a considerable proportion of Burrell's output was purchased on these terms. The scheme was extended upon Burrell's entering of the AGE group and several other members of the group offered items for sale through the Hiring Company.Gilbert (1991), p. 35 See also *Charles Burrell Museum in Thetford FootnotesReferences    External links * Charles Burrell Museum * Company History on Norfolk Museums site * Surviving Burrell Steam Engines Photo Archive * Further Information on Thetford Category:Steam wagon manufacturers Category:Locomotive manufacturers of the United Kingdom Category:Steam road vehicle manufacturers ","title":"Charles Burrell &amp; Sons"},{"id":"10915710","text":"Map of the state of Kosrae Utwe (or Utwa) is the second-largest municipality in the Micronesian state of Kosrae, the largest being Tafunsak.When Walung is counted as a part of Tafunsak Geography Utwe occupies the very South of the island, but has no coast on its East border.

Main characters=Original seriesParn= A young swordsman living in the Kingdom of Alannia, Parn is the son of an infamous knight of Valis, Tessius, and Shoriki, an Alanian noblewoman (who appears in a flashback in the Grey Witch manga). At the beginning of the series, Parn is a brave but unskilled fighter. He chafes at his life in a small farming community and feels ostracized by the townsfolk for his father's legacy. He later leaves the village after a goblin attack, eventually meeting with King Fahn of Valis and King Kashue of Flaim. His skills eventually improve to the point where he can put up a decent fight against his nemesis, the Dark Knight of Marmo, Ashram. He meets Deedlit the High Elf during his adventures, and the two of them become romantically involved over the course of the series, climaxing in a daring rescue from Marmo in the finale of the OVA. =Deedlit= A female High Elf skilled in both swordplay and elemental sorcery, Deedlit grew up in the Forest of No Return, her people's isolated abode. From a very early age on, however, she became interested in the outside world and - despite the disapproval of her family and peers - set out to learn more about it. After meeting Parn, she develops a romantic interest in his rash, impulsive nature, his sense of honor, and his dedication, and has faithfully stayed by his side in the war against Marmo. =Etoh= Parn's best friend and a priest of Falis, the Supreme God. Upon King Fahn's death, he later becomes the king of Valis and the husband of Princess Fianna. =Slayn= Parn's older friend and sometimes advisor, a wise and powerful magician. He marries the priestess Laylia and is the father of Little Neese. =Ghim= Ghim is an elderly but very skilled dwarven warrior. Prior to the start of the series, Ghim was wounded in a mining accident, and was healed at the Temple of Marfa by Neese and her daughter Leylia. When Leylia was kidnapped and possessed by Karla, The Grey Witch, Ghim left to search for her. He has some past connection with Slayn, and comes to seek the wizard's aid in locating Leylia. Coincidentally, Ghim arrives shortly before the goblin attack in Parn's village, prompting he and Slayn to join with Parn and Etoh on their quest. Later in the OVA, Ghim challenges Karla to free Leylia's body from possession. Though successful, Ghim is killed by Karla's magic. Ghim's axe marks his gravesite in the closing scenes of the OVA. Ghim does not appear in the TV series, though his name is mentioned. =Woodchuck= A thief and the last member of the party to join them, Woodchuck encounters the group when they are briefly thrown into prison. After Leylia is rescued from Karla's possession, Karla possesses Woodchuck. His whereabouts after his possession by Karla is unknown. Chronicles of the Heroic KnightSpark= A young aspiring warrior from Flaim who dreams of becoming a knight. What he initially does not know is that King Kashue considers him to be his possible successor in ruling Flaim, and is therefore loath to send him into danger; an intention which is foiled by Spark's impulsiveness and hot-headedness. In the course of his trials, however, Spark becomes more mature and responsible from his experiences, and also enters a romantic relationship with Little Neese. He worships Parn as his idol, who in turn becomes fond of Spark himself, as the latter reminds him of his own impetuous youth. =Little Neese= The 13-year-old daughter of Leylia and Slain, possessed by the soul of Naneel. Like her grandmother (after whom she is named) and her mother, she is a priestess of Marfa. Aware of the malevolent entity's presence inside her, she has detached herself emotionally from the rest of the world, although her mental barriers begin to come down when she meets Spark and gradually falls in love with him. She is later freed from Naneel's presence when Wagnard attempts to resurrect Kardis by drawing Naneel's essence from her. =Leaf= A young Half-Elf born to a male Elf and a female human warrior in the realm of Alannia. She first met Deedlit during the first war against Marmo, when her home village was evacuated, and has idolized the High Elf ever since. She later becomes a mercenary and Garak's partner, with whom she falls in love, but later has to acknowledge that his heart lies with Laina. She is a skilled fighter with her spear and, like a full-blooded Elf, capable of using spirit magic. =Garak= An overconfident axe-wielding mercenary who joins Spark's company under Kashue's orders. Despite his boisterous attitude, he is brave and loyal to a fault. He eventually enters a relationship with the thief Laina. =Laina= An attractive, voluptuous human thief who joins Spark and his companions after encountering a group of Dark Elves, who had just stolen a holy artefact from the vault of Valis. Her fellow thief and friend Randy was cursed by the Dark Elves, which eventually led to his death, and she joins the company primarily to gain revenge on them. Although she initially keeps her true profession a secret, the others - especially Garak - gradually work out her identity as a thief. But after repeatedly using her skills to aid them, she becomes a trusted and valued member of the team and eventually becomes romantically attracted to Garak. =Aldo Nova= A huge but somewhat timid wizard who becomes part of Spark's company. He is Slain's pupil and very devoted to Little Neese, often to the point of losing his sight on more important matters. =Gribas= A Dwarven priest of Myrii, who also joined Spark under Kashue's request. He is a skilled healer, as well as a doughty fighter with his halberd. Other characters=Lord Ashram Known as the \\"Black Knight\\", Ashram is a highly skilled warrior and the former retainer and right-hand aide of Emperor Beld. He served Beld during the War of Heroes, and was sent in the front to deal with any possible resistance. After the death of Beld at the hands of Karla the Grey Witch in the OVA (or Kashue in the TV series), Ashram took up his blade, the Demon Sword Soul Crusher and returned to Marmo to regroup. Later on, Ashram seeks to dominate Lodoss rather than conquer it, as he looks for one of the governor's treasures, the Scepter of Domination. After the destruction of the scepter, Ashram is believed to have died in the fires of Fire Dragon Mountain, but it is later revealed that one of the agents of Wagnard sacrifices his powers (stripped by Wagnard himself) in order to save his life. Ashram is voiced by Akira Kamiya in the original OAV, and by Sh≈ç Hayami in the TV series. In the English version, he is voiced by John Knox in both series. Emperor Beld Beld was a former member of the \\"Six Heroes\\", a band of adventurers who fought and defeated the demon god 30 years before the events of Record of Lodoss War. During the battle with the demon god, Beld's soul was destroyed when his blade became baptized in the blood of the demon, and in the aftermath, his sword became the legendary blade Soul Crusher. He later became the lord of Marmo Island and led an army comprising humans, dark creatures, and Dark Elves in an invasion of Lodoss. The invasion was largely successful, but just after killing his old friend Fahn in personal combat, he is betrayed and struck down by Karla the Grey Witch; the rule of Marmo subsequently passed over to his general, Ashram. Beld is voiced by Taro Ishida in Japanese and by Bob Barry in English. King Fahn Like his former friend and companion Beld, Fahn was one of the Six Heroes and a Holy Knight of Valis, later becoming the King of Valis. He is the one force that truly holds Beld in check and prevents him from acting. Fahn holds the opposing blade to Soul Crusher, called the Holy Sword of Falis, the two blades increase in power when in each other's presence. Parn's father was a former knight of his. Fahn is struck down by Beld just before Beld himself is killed. Fahn is voiced in English by J. W. Gunther for the US Manga Corps TV series production.J. W. Gunther IMDB link Karla The Grey Witch Karla The Grey Witch (so named because of her obsessive neutrality) is the enigmatic sole survivor of the ancient kingdom Kastuul, \\"Kingdom of Sorcery.\\" As barbarian tribes laid siege to the city, Karla, a member of the nobility at the time, foresaw the destruction and sealed her consciousness into a circlet she wore on her forehead. Though her original body was inevitably killed in the battle, her consciousness (and power) lives on in an endless series of host bodies, utterly possessed by her so long as they wear the circlet in which she resides. Due to the horrible fate of Kastuul, Karla swore never to allow such destruction to occur again. Karla has maintained a secret, shadowy influence on the major events of Lodoss for more than 500 years. Her long life and incredible power has warped her perception of herself. Her sworn duty \\"for the good of Lodoss\\" is to endlessly shift the balance of power between the various nations of Lodoss, preventing the annihilation of any one power, at the cost of preventing its rise. All of the major wars in Lodoss since the fall of Kastuul have been carefully manipulated (and some directly participated in) by her, though by nature of her neutrality, she is not always an antagonist. She was even one of the \\"Six Heroes\\" - a group of adventurers who fought and defeated the Demon God King 30 years prior to the events of the series. Throughout the anime series, she is shown possessing three bodies: Leylia, priestess of Marfa and daughter of Neese (From the OVA, not from the TV series), Woodchuck, whom she used to escape at the battle where Karla's circlet was forcefully removed from Leylia (subsequently freeing her,) and an unnamed woman who somewhat resembles her original body. After Karla helped Wagnard to resurrect Naneel, avatar of Kardis the Destroyer, Leylia takes Karla's circlet, believing that she can control the witch so long as she is consciously aware of Karla's presence within the circlet, thus ending 500 years of conflict in Lodoss due to her machinations. Leylia Leylia is the daughter of Neese, a priestess of Marfa. She is possessed by Karla when her mother is busy tending a battered Ghim. Ghim then sets out to rescue Leylia from Karla's control. Later Leylia marries Slayn and becomes the mother of Little Neese. Shiris A red-headed and somewhat hot-tempered mercenary woman. She meets Parn and his companions while on protective watch over a village, along with her partner Orson. She develops a crush on Parn (much to Deedlit's disconcertion), but in the end they only remain good friends. In the TV series, after losing Orson, Shiris makes off on her own.Lodoss War the RPG Orson A strong and silent male mercenary, and the partner of Shiris. He maintains an impassive front to anything and anybody, mainly because he is a berserker. In the TV series it is revealed that a dark spirit called Hyuri first took him over as a child when he watched his sister being assaulted by bandits. In order to prevent himself from hurting those he loves, he has shut himself off from the rest of the world. Orson is secretly in love with his partner Shiris; his berserkism is triggered when he sees her in mortal danger, and only she is able to bring him out of it. However, because of his condition he cannot bring himself to admit his feelings to her. In the TV series, he dies protecting Shiris from Ashram, and it is only then that Shiris discovers her true feelings for him. Princess Fianna The daughter of Fahn. As a child, King Fahn surrendered her to one of the tribes of the desert (which would later become Flaim) to the north, so that she could be sacrificed to Shooting Star to appease the dragon. Parn's father, Tessius, made a secret plan with King Fahn to rescue Fianna, in which he would take all the blame for destroying diplomatic relations with the tribe. This led to his dishonor, and he was sent to the front lines of the civil war that began as a result, where he died. Fianna's presence is a diplomatic one at first, sent to give a message to Alania, but she is intercepted by Karla who informs her that Alania has fallen anyway. She is saved by Parn and his companions, and later on grants Parn the blade of her father. Upon first encountering the group, Fianna becomes attracted to Etoh. While it is never explicitly indicated in either the manga or the anime series, it is likely that they were married when Etoh assumed the throne of Valis. Fianna was not considered an heir to the throne, however, as the royalty of Valis is chosen not by royal bloodline, but upon the death of the previous king, a successor is chosen from the knighthood. Etoh's succession to the throne after marrying Fianna was due to his high spiritual power as a Falis priest and the high regard that the church held him in, though there was opposition in not only a non-knight ascending the throne, but Fianna gaining political power as queen. King Kashue Also known as \\"the mercenary king\\", Kashue is famous for being the only man capable of uniting the desert country of Flaim, which he accomplished using only his sword. During the War of Heroes, Kashue was instrumental in staving off the invasion of Lodoss by the Marmo forces, assuming leadership following the death of King Fahn, after the latter killed Beld in the final battle by cutting him down when he was distracted by a crossbow bolt shot by Karla the Grey Witch. (The story surrounding these events was changed in the OVA, instead having Karla perform the killing blow herself.) Because of this Ashram holds Kashue responsible for treachery, and would love nothing more than to slay him for his supposed sins. Parn greatly admires him. In the Japanese version, Kashue was played by Shuichi Ikeda in the OAV and by Joji Nakata in the TV series. In the English version, Kashue was played by Chris Yates in the OAV and by Anthony Cruise in the TV series. Naneel Naneel is a priestess of Kardis, as well as her avatar embodied.Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, Episode 26 She begins to directly manipulate the people of Lodoss for over 50 years before she is slain by King Kadomos I. Naneel's death was one that was not complete, as she was reincarnated in the form of Leylia some time later. Neese, knowing the child's dark secret, adopted her and raised her as her own, trying to shield her from the truth of her dark secret. When Leylia became pregnant, the soul of Naneel was transferred into the body of her baby, \\"little Neese\\".Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, episode 25 Pirotess (This section requires grammatical cleaning and verification of canon/non- canon content) Pirotess is a dark elven noble considered to be one of the more prominent figures in her people's society. Like most dark elves, she worships Fararis and calls the Forest of Darkness on Marmo island her home. She is the younger sister of Altas, a member of the quest of Rod of Dominatus, eventually cheated by the chief leader of all dark elves, the powerful Ruchiev, who had decided to recreate the kingdom of his kindred. Since she believed that the useless human Ashram should be the one to pay for her beloved brother's death, she joined the mission of killing the general of Dark Knighthood. Ashram found and bested her in hand-to-hand combat when she ambushed him in his bedroom, but let her go after learning her identity as the sister of his lost old friend. After she learned the truth and the crazy decision of Ruchiev from her fellow assassin, she stalked Ashram to learn about him and discovered his loyalty to the lost emperor, the heroic Beld, and his dedication to Marmo and its people. She decided to protect him from the other assassin and aided him in a \\"Test\\" from the Dark Sage. After 10 years, she had been the only one to whom Ashram had showed appreciation and care. She in turn remained fiercely loyal to Ashram as a lieutenant and a leader of his scouts. She was accepted by the subordinates of Ashram as their mistress and sub-general. Pirotess is a skilled adversary, both an adept of the rapier and a skilled magic user. A shaman like Deedlit, she often uses spirits that high elves will not associate with, such as the spirits of darkness. When Ashram decides to leave Lodoss for good and seek a new land where they can find peace, Pirotess goes with him. She has strong affections for Ashram and is very loyal to him. The two may be in love (as it is certainly hinted upon). She sacrificed herself to save Ashram in the OVA against the powerful dragon Shooting Star, and Ashram was visibly distressed, embracing her intimately. When they reach Crystania, Pirotess is forced to seek out a solution after Ashram is placed into stasis by one of the god beasts of Crystania. In the Japanese version, Pirotess is voiced by Sakiko Tamagawa in the OVA and by Kumiko Nishihara in the TV series. In the English version, Pirotess is voiced by Meg Frances in both series. Wagnard Wagnard is a dark wizard, and a worshipper of Kardis, the goddess of destruction. He was originally a student of the magical academy in Valis (the same Slayn had attended), but was expelled for studying the dark arts of magic and cursed with a spell which restricted his ability to cast magic by inflicting severe pain whenever he does so. In time, however, Wagnard became mostly inured to the pain and managed to attain great power as a magician. Despite following Beld, Wagnard's intentions are far worse, as he seeks to kill all the inhabitants of Forcelia, and rule over them as their undead king (a lich). In the OVA, he attempts this by abducting the high elf Deedlit, as high elves have near immortal life spans, and such energy is necessary to revive Kardis. In the original story, manga, and TV series, Wagnard tries to accomplish this task by abducting the priestess of Marfa and daughter of Leylia, Little Neese, the doorway to Naneel and avatar of Kardis. When Naneel is successfully summoned, Wagnard's plans are thwarted and he is killed. Wagnard's summoning of Kardis never takes place in the manga, but the summon of Naneel does. In the Japanese version, Wagnard is voiced by Takeshi Aono in the OAV and by Chikao Otsuka in the TV series. In the English version, Wagnard is voiced by Jayce Reeves in the OAV and by Pete Zarustica in the TV series. (Reeves does play the role in the TV series for at least one episode‚Äîepisode 18, for reasons unknown.) Dragons=Abram A blue dragon, and an ally of Narse, one of the five ancient dragons that had one of the governor's treasures. Abram resides on Blue Dragon Island, where he leisurely swims from to attack and destroy sailing vessels. Abram protects the Soul Crystal Ball, an artifact that can restore life.Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, episode 5 Bramd Bramd is an ancient white dragon, and a former ally to the magic city of Kastuul. A direct ally with Mycen, he would be more likely to lend his aid to her than to any other ally on Lodoss. When Kastuul fell during the final battle of the magic city, Bramd and several other dragons were sent to distant corners of Lodoss to try and preserve the legacy of the magic city. Bramd himself was given the Mirror of Truth to protect, and until he was absolved of the geas spell upon himself, he did so. A decade or more before the events of Record of Lodoss War, Bramd's geas spell was lifted by Neese, a priestess of Marfa. After Neese removed the curse from Bramd, Bramd granted her the staff he was entrusted to protect. In order to keep the staff protected, Neese sent the staff away to the city of Valis to remain within the halls of the temple of Falis.Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, Episode 1 In his search for the Scepter of Domination, Ashram slew Bramd while he was still in hibernation, but finding no treasure with the dragon, he went to Tarbin, the location of the high temple of Marfa, where he found out that Bramd's artifact was not what he was looking for.Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, Episode 1 Mycen A golden dragon, one of the five ancient dragons that had one of the governor's treasures. She resides in Moss, guarded by a fortress of dragon riders. Mycen's treasure is the Staff of Life, which could heal any wound and even resurrect the dead. Narse A black dragon, one of the five ancient dragons that had one of the governor's treasures. Narse resides underneath Marmo itself, where he sleeps awaiting the proper day to awaken. Narse protects the Ferronierre of Knowledge, but it still lays unclaimed and unfound under Marmo. Narse is the dragon counterpart of Kardis. Shooting Star A red dragon, one of the five ancient dragons that had one of the governor's treasures. The most powerful of the dragons, Shooting Star protects the most powerful artifact, the Scepter of Domination. Shooting Star resides in Flame Dragon Mountain, not far from the city of Blade. Gods of Lodoss The seven gods listed below each form the basis for a major religion of Lodoss. There are other gods who are worshipped, such as Ganeed, the god of thieves, but these gods are considered minor gods. Some gods are named after racehorses such as Pharis, Marfa, Mairie and Phalaris. Phalis (or Falis) Phalis is the supreme god of goodness and light, and his affiliated colours are blue, white, and gold. He is associated with healing, good, and protection, and is lawful good in alignment. Phalis and Pharalis were two of the major gods who had a place in the cataclysmic war, with their final battle resulting in the destruction of many gods and other fighters in the battle. Etoh is a priest of Phalis. The name is also commonly translated in the anime as Falis. Marfa Marfa is the goddess of all creation and preservation, and her affiliated colours are green and silver. She is associated with healing, creation, and good descriptors, and is chaotic good in alignment. Marfa and Kardis were the final two gods left alive at the end of the cataclysmic war, with their battle ending in a stalemate as the two tried to strike each other down with one final blow, but both falling into a death sleep after Alecrast and Lodoss split apart. Kardis' body fell on the island of Marmo, while Marfa fell on Lodoss. Marfa's spirit is strongest in Alania, and her main temple is the village of Tarba in Alania's White Mountains. Mairie (or Myrii) Mairie is the god of war and justice, and his affiliated colors are red and grey. He is associated with war, protection, and knowledge, and is true neutral in alignment. Mairie's role in the cataclysmic war is never specified. In Rune Soldier, Melissa is a priestess of Mairie. Mairie is also often translated as Myrii. Rahda Rahda is the god of knowledge, and his affiliated colors are black, white, and grey. He is associated with knowledge and law, and is lawful neutral in alignment. Rahda's role is not specified in the cataclysmic war. Cha Za Cha Za is the god of good fortune and luck, and his affiliated color is green. He is associated with the luck and chaos, and his alignment is chaotic neutral. His role is not known in the cataclysmic war. Pharalis (or Falaris) Pharalis is the god of freedom, desire and darkness, and his affiliated colors are black and crimson. He is associated with desire, death, darkness and freedom, and is chaotic in alignment. Pharalis and Phalis were two of the major gods who had a place in the cataclysmic war, with their final battle resulting in the destruction of many gods and other fighters in the battle. Also he is not truly evil, but his acceptance of all desire causes most of his mortal followers to become enshrouded in evil. Pharalis is also often translated as Falaris. Kardis Kardis is the goddess of all destruction and misery, and her affiliated colors are black and red. She is associated with evil, death, and destruction, and is chaotic evil in alignment. Kardis and Marfa were the final two gods remaining alive at the end of the cataclysmic war, with their battle ending in a stalemate as the two tried to strike each other down with one final blow, but both falling into a death sleep after Alecrast and Lodoss split apart. Marfa's body fell upon the island of Lodoss, while Kardis fell upon the small island of Marmo. The island of Marmo bore the brunt of her curse, leaving the island corrupted and shrouded in darkness.

While the principle is applicable in semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology, most work in linguistics employs the term \\"subordination\\" in the context of syntax, and that is the context in which it is considered here. The syntactic units of sentences are often either subordinate or coordinate to each other. Hence an understanding of subordination is promoted by an understanding of coordination, and vice versa.Subordination as a principle for ordering syntactic units is generally taken for granted; it is the default principle of organization. Coordination, in contrast, is NOT considered a default principle and has therefore been studied in great detail. See for instance Sag et al. (1985), Hudson (1988, 1989), and Osborne (2006). Subordinate clauses Subordination as a concept of syntactic organization is associated closely with the distinction between coordinate and subordinate clauses.Concerning subordination as a principle of organization among clauses, see for instance Chisholm (1981:136f.). One clause is subordinate to another if it depends on it. The dependent clause is called a subordinate clause and the independent clause is called the main clause (= matrix clause). Subordinate clauses are usually introduced by subordinators (= subordinate conjunctions) such as after, because, before, if, so that, that, when, while, etc. For example: ::Before we play again, we should do our homework. ::We are doing our homework now because we want to play again. The strings in bold are subordinate clauses, and the strings in non-bold are the main clauses. Sentences must consist of at least one main clause, whereas the number of subordinate clauses is hypothetically without limitation. Long sentences that contain many subordinate clauses are characterized in terms of hypotaxis, the Greek term meaning the grammatical arrangement of \\"unequal\\" constructs (hypo=\\"beneath\\", taxis=\\"arrangement\\"). Sentences that contain few or no subordinate clauses but that may contain coordinated clauses are characterized in terms of parataxis. Heads and dependents In a broader sense, subordination is a relation existing between two syntactic units, whereby the one unit is subordinate to the other and the latter is superordinate to the former. An adjective that modifies a noun is subordinate to the noun and the noun is superordinate to the adjective; a noun phrase (NP) that is the complement of a preposition is subordinate to the preposition and the preposition is superordinate to the NP; a prepositional phrase (PP) that modifies a verb phrase (VP) is subordinate to the VP and the VP is superordinate to the PP; etc. The subordinate unit is called the dependent, and the superordinate unit the head. Thus anytime two syntactic units are in a head-dependent relationship, subordination obtains. For example: ::black dog ::with patience ::clean the bathroom The word in bold in each case is dependent on the other word, which is its head. Subordination in this sense should be compared with coordination. Two units or more are coordinate to each other if there is no hierarchical relation between them and they have equal functional status, e.g. ::[black] and [brown] dog ::with [love] and [patience] ::clean [the bathroom] and [the kitchen] The words in brackets are coordinate to each other, and both coordinates are subordinate to the word that is not enclosed in brackets. Note that while the coordinated units are not organized hierarchically, they are organized linearly, the one preceding the other. Representing subordination and coordination Most theories of syntax represent subordination (and coordination) in terms of tree structures. A head is positioned above its dependents in the tree, so that it immediately dominates them. One of two competing principles is employed to construct the trees: either the constituency relation of phrase structure grammars or the dependency relation of dependency grammars. Both principles are illustrated here with the following trees.The constituency-based trees here are consistent with early Transformational Grammar, and the dependency- based trees can be found in, for instance, the massive collection of essays on dependency and valency grammar in √Ågel et al. (2006). The a-trees on the left illustrate constituency, and the b-trees on the right dependency: ::Trees illustrating subordination Constituency shows subordination by way of projections. One of the two words projects its category status up to the root node of the entire structure and is therefore the head of the structure. Dependency also shows subordination, but it does so with fewer nodes in the tree. The head directly dominates its dependent. These trees illustrating subordination can be compared with trees illustrating coordination. There are various proposals concerning the tree representations of coordinate structures. The following trees are just suggestive in this regard. The constituency relation is again shown in the a-trees on the left, and the dependency relation in the b-trees on the right: ::Trees illustrating coorondination The constituency trees show that both parts of the coordinate structure project up to the root node of the entire tree, and the dependency trees illustrate that each word again projects just a single node. Both representation formats illustrate the equal status of the coordinated units insofar as they are placed on the same level; they are equi-level. From an organizational point of view, subordination is grouping words together in such a manner that includes hierarchical and linear order, whereas coordination is grouping words together just in terms of linear order.

The next morning, Jehoshaphat led his people out, calling them to have faith in the Lord, and leading them in praise. They saw their enemies turn on each other, and returned to Jerusalem in joy.

Merryweather & Sons of Clapham, later Greenwich, London, were builders of steam fire engines and steam tram engines. The founder was Moses Merryweather (1791‚Äì1872) of Clapham, who was joined by his son Richard Moses (1839‚Äì1877). Fire appliances 1912 Merryweather of Firefighters Corps of Paran√° State, Brazil. Steam fire engine The Gem Pat. (1896). The Merryweathers worked with the engineer Edward Field to fit his design of a vertical boiler onto a horse-drawn platform. They successfully applied it for use in their steam fire engine, thus improving water pressure and making easier to use once steam had been got up. It was reckoned that an engine could get up enough pressure to pump within ten minutes of a call out; the fire could be started before leaving the fire station so there would be enough pressure by the time they arrived at the scene of the fire. Appliances were available in small sizes suitable for a country house, pumping about 100 gallons per minute, through to large dockyard models, rated at 2000 gallons per minute. A common size, popular with Borough fire brigades, was the double vertical boiler, that could pump between 250 and 450 gallons per minute. Merryweather also provided hydrants and mains water supplies for highly vulnerable sites such as theatres, where getting a strong enough supply of water could be a problem. Dock fires were a particular problem, as the hand- operated appliances of the time had neither the reach nor the power to tackle a blaze on a boat or their large warehouses. After successfully demonstrating the improvement of the steam-powered devices fighting petroleum fires at Antwerp docks, Merryweather's appliances, with their distinctive crews wearing Merryweather helmets, soon became synonymous with firefighting in Britain and abroad, alongside their rivals Shand, Mason. Merryweather also built specialist fireboats, such as a steam-powered fire-fighting barge for the port of Alexandria, designed to pump 1,200 gallons per minute to a height of 200 feet. In 1899, Merryweather produced the world's first successful self- propelled steam fire engine, the 'Fire King'; the first was dispatched to Port Louis on Mauritius. The first motorised fire engine in London was a Merryweather appliance delivered to the Finchley Fire Brigade in 1904. It was commemorated in April 1974 by the issue of a 3.5 pence Royal Mail postage stamp. The actual vehicle is preserved in the reserve collection of the Science Museum at Wroughton in Wiltshire. Another notable survivor is the UK's oldest known aerodrome fire/crash tender, a 1937 Merryweather with a Commer engine and chassis, now preserved in running order at Brooklands Museum in Surrey. Tram engines Wellington tramways locomotive Victoria, New Zealand 1879. An 1881 Merryweather steam tram in the Dutch Railway Museum. Merryweather supplied the steam machinery for John Grantham's steam tramcar in 1873. Between 1875 and 1892 the factory produced about 174 steam tram engines, of which 41 were used in Britain, 46 in Paris, 6 in Kassel, Germany, 15 to Barcelona, 15 in the Netherlands, 11 in New Zealand and 15 in Rangoon. 6 engines of 1881 went to the Stockton and Darlington Steam Tramway Company.

All three offers are fermented from Queensland molasses. The distillery was developed to include a blending hall, bottling plant, warehouse and administration facilities. It is located on the bank of the Albert River and is a landmark on the river flats in the area. History Beenleigh Rum Distillery, on the banks of the Albert River near Beenleigh, Queensland. ca. 1912 An advertisement for Beenleigh Rum in 1921 The Beenleigh Rum Distillery is the oldest registered distillery in Australia, and is a rare survivor of Australia's early sugar industry. It commenced operations in 1884 and was the legal successor to a floating moonshine still, the SS Walrus, which drifted between cane plantations and evading police in the early 19th century. The original proprietor, James Stewart, sold the boat's still to local entrepreneurs who used it to start the Beenleigh Rum Distillery. Between 1981 and 2005 a museum featuring displays on the history of sugar and rum production in the Beenleigh area was open at the distillery. The stills, vats and photos were relocated to the Beenleigh Historical Village. During the 1960s and 70s, Beenleigh outsold it largest rival, Bundaberg Rum. Over the years, it lost market share and rebranded under different guises after being sold to successive owners. Stuart Gilbert reinvigorated the brand in 2000 when he purchased the trademark and partnered with Malcolm Campbell, old master Distiller, to bring the brand back to life. In 2003, the Beenleigh Rum brand name was sold to Vok Beverages, a subsidiary of Adelaide based beverage company Bickford's Australia. Gilbert sold the brand in 2007. In May 2012 Vok Beverages purchased the Beenleigh Distillery and reconnected the brand and the distillery,(11 July 2013) Stephanie Master.

These core proteins carry three to five heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains, which allow for interaction with a large variety of ligands including fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, fibronectin and antithrombin-1. Interactions between fibronectin and some syndecans can be modulated by the extracellular matrix protein tenascin C. Family members and Structure The syndecan protein family has four members. Syndecans 1 and 3 and syndecans 2 and 4, making up separate subfamilies, arose by gene duplication and divergent evolution from a single ancestral gene. The syndecan numbers reflect the order in which the cDNAs for each family member were cloned. All syndecans have an N-terminal signal peptide, an ectodomain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. All syndecans are anchored to plasma membrane via a 24-25 amino acid long hydrophobic transmembrane domain, in contrast to another type of cell surface proteoglycans that attaches to cell membrane using a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol linkage. The most obvious differences between syndecans include (together with differences in distribution) the subclassification of the family depending on the existence of GAG binding sites either at both ends of the ectodomain (syndecan-1 and - 3) or at the distal part only (syndecan-2 and -4) and a relatively long Thr-Ser-Pro-rich area in the middle of syndecan- 3‚Äôs ectodomain. The ectodomains show the least amount of amino acid sequence conservation, not more than 10‚Äì20%; in contrast, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains share approximately 60‚Äì70% amino acid sequence identity. The transmembrane domains contain an unusual alanine/glycine sequence motif, while the cytoplasmic domain is essentially composed of two regions of conserved amino acid sequence (C1 and C2), separated by a central variable sequence of amino acids that is distinct for each family member (V). In mammalian cells, syndecans are expressed by unique genes located on different chromosomes. This is general lack of evidence of alternate splicing in syndecan genes. All members of the syndecan family have 5 exons. The difference in size of the syndecans is credited to the variable length of exon 3, which encodes a spacer domain [1, 14]. In humans, the amino acid length of syndecan 1, 2, 3 and 4 is 310, 201, 346 and 198 respectively. Glycosaminoglycan chains, a member of the heparan sulfate group, are an important component of syndecan and are responsible for a diverse set of syndecan functions. The addition of glycosaminoglycans to syndecan is controlled by a series of post- translation events. The preferential site for the addition of glycosaminoglycans is on a serine residue followed by glycine residue, where the linker is attached for the elongation of the glycosaminoglycans by Œ±-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I [1]. The linker is composed of four saccharides, first one being xylose, which is an unusual sugar in a unique place, attached to serine of the protein core and sequentially followed by two galactose and a Œ≤-D-glucuronic acid [1, 12]. Expression Syndecans are expressed on the cell surface in a cell-specific manner. For example, in mouse cells and tissues, syndecan 1 is highly expressed in fibroblastic and epithelial cells. It is especially high in keratinocytes whereas low in endothelial and neural cells. These tissues include skin, liver, kidney and lungs. Syndecan 2 is highly expressed in endothelial, neural, and fibroblastic cells, whereas it has low expression levels in epithelial cells. It is specific to tissues such as the liver, endothelia and fibroblasts. Syndecan 3 is highly expressed in neural cells, but has low or undetectable amount in epithelial cells. In tissues, it is specific to the brain and expressed at low levels in liver, kidney, lung and small intestine. Syndecan 4 is highly expressed by epithelial and fibroblastic cells, but has low expression levels in neural and endothelial cells. In tissues, it is preferentially expressed in the liver and lungs [11]. Functions Functionality of syndecan is contributed by glycosaminoglycans which help in the interaction with different extracellular ligands. Depending upon the cellular localization of syndecan, glycosaminoglycans have different structures to accommodate the functional needs of the region. The syndecans are known to form homologous oligomers that may be important for their functions. Functions of syndecan can be categorized in four ways. First is growth-factor-receptor activation. Glycosaminoglycans attached to the syndecan help binding of the various growth factors for activation of important cellular signaling mechanisms. Growth factors such as FGF2, HGF, EGF, VEGF, neuregulins and others interact with syndecans [1, 2, 8]. For example, at the site of tissue injury, the soluble syndecan-1 ectodomains are cleaved by heparanases, producing heparin-like fragments that activate bFGF [13]. Whereas most growth factors interact with syndecans via heparan sulfate chains, the prosecretory mitogen lacritin requires heparanase to both expose and create a binding site in the N-terminus of syndecan 1. Second is matrix adhesion. Syndecans bind to structural extracellular matrix molecules such as collagens I, III, V, fibronectin, thrombospondin, and tenascin to provide structural support for the adhesion [1, 2]. A third function is cell‚Äìcell adhesion. Evidence for syndecan‚Äôs role in cell‚Äìcell adhesion comes from the human myeloma cell line. These myeloma cells had a deficiency in the ability to adhere to one another in a rotation-mediated aggregation matrix. This deficiency is attributed to the lack of syndecan 1 expression. Syndecan 4 also interacts with integrin proteins for cell‚Äìcell adhesion [1, 2, 12]. A final role is in tumor suppression and progression. Syndecans act as tumor inhibitors by preventing cellular proliferation of tumor cell lines. For example, in the epithelial-derived tumor cell line, S115, the syndecan 1 ectodomain suppresses the growth of S115 cells without affecting the growth of normal epithelial cells [7]. However, syndecan 1 expression also has a role in tumor progression in myeloma and other cancers [5, 6, 9, 15]. It associates with intracellular actin cytoskeleton and helps maintain normal epithelium sheet morphology Protein Domains The syndecan proteins can contain the following protein domains, *A signal sequence; *An extracellular domain (ectodomain) of variable length whose sequence is not evolutionarily conserved in the various forms of syndecans. The ectodomain contains the sites of attachment of the heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan side chains; *A transmembrane region; *A highly conserved cytoplasmic domain of about 30 to 35 residues, which could interact with cytoskeletal proteins. Clinical significance=Endometriosis Syndecan-4 is upregulated in endometriosis and inhibition of syndecan-4 in human endometriotic cells results in a reduction of invasive growth in vitro and changes in matrix metalloproteinase expression. Osteoarthritis Syndecan-4 is upregulated in osteoarthritis and inhibition of syndecan-4 reduces cartilage destruction in mouse models of OA.\\"SDC4: OA Joint effort\\" 2009  Metabolic regulation and body composition  The Drosophila homologue dSdc and human SDC4 have been implicated in energy homeostasis. Multiple Myeloma Syndecan1 is upregulated in multiple myeloma. High levels of shed syndecan1 in a patient's serum typically is correlated with poor prognosis. Syndecan 1 is the most studied of all the syndecans in cancer research. Many studies have shown that syndecan 1 plays an important role in cancer progression, and also can be used as cancer biomarker. For example, syndecan 1 expression is higher in the bone marrow of the patients suffering from the multiple myeloma [9]. In one published study, the cells expressing the soluble syndecan 1 ectodomain promoted the growth and metastasis of B-lymphoid tumors more extensively than cells bearing surface syndecan 1 or lacking syndecan 1 expression [16]. Similarly, syndecan 1 expression has been linked with low differentiation in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [15]. Syndecan 1 also has been linked with cancer progression by mediating the effects of growth factors in the cells. For example, syndecan 1 expression is increased in ductal breast carcinomas and is associated with factors of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis [5]. Studies from patients suffering from endometrial cancer have shown that these patients have increased syndecan 1 expression, and also that expression of this protein positively regulates the endometrial hyperplasia that can progress to endometrial cancer [6].

He was a member of bands √ëu and Le√±o, and is a prominent exponent of the so-called urban rock in Spain.  Biography = First steps  His family was from Bola√±os de Calatrava, in the province of Ciudad Real, but he was raised in Carabanchel, where he still resides (as of 2005). After dropping out of ICAI engineering school, he joined the band Fresa as a guitarist, in 1972. Fresa usually played covers of hits of the time, and sometimes they also backed other soloists and singers. Following some changes, including singer Jos√© Carlos Molina joining the band, this changed its name to √ëu. In 1974 Rosendo discovered Rory Gallagher's music, who became one of his main influences, together with other bands such as Jethro Tull, Canned Heat, Cream, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath.  Le√±o period  After being discharged from the compulsory military service in 1975, he took part in the recording of √ëu's first album. Molina and himself were not in very good terms, so Rosendo left the group in 1977. He then formed Le√±o, where he played the guitar and acted as a vocalist as well. Chiqui Mariscal (bass player) and Ramiro Penas (drums) also left √ëu to join him in Le√±o. They made their debut in 1978, acting as the support band at an Asfalto's gig. They had been hired by Vicente Romero (producer). Romero was founding Chapa Discos (\\"Chapa Records\\") at that time, and published the collective disc Viva el Rollo, Vol. II. Rock del Manzanares, which included two Le√±o's songs: Este Madrid and Aprendiendo a escuchar. Later in 1979 they published their first album, entitled Le√±o. It was produced by Teddy Bautista, and it characterises for including songs with long instrumental sections. Two songs: El tren and Este Madrid are remarkable. Chiqui Mariscal left the band in the middle of the recording sessions, and he was substituted by Tony Urbano; the disc sleeve portrays this fact. In 1980 they published their second album, M√°s madera. It evidences Teddy Bautista's influence. The songs are shorter and have a lighter style. In 1981 Le√±o recorded live En directo at the Carolina club in Madrid. Despite its poor sound quality, the disc made it quite well at the shops, granting great success to the band. It includes one of Rosendo's best-known songs, Maneras de vivir. Luz Casal (chorus) and Teddy Bautista (keyboards) played with them. The last of their official releases is ¬°Corre, corre!. This was made with more resources, due to the success of their previous live record. ¬°Corre, corre! was recorded in London, and produced by Carlos Narea. Notable songs include Sorprendente and ¬°Qu√© desilusi√≥n!. 1983 would see their last performances. Among Miguel Rios and Luz Casal, they took part in the tour Rock de una noche de verano. This was a long series of gigs all around Spain, featuring a set of lights and sound asets as they never had been seen before. The tour was organized by Miguel R√≠os, and few years later it would be marked as a milestone in the Spanish rock history. At the end of the Rock the una noche de verano tour, in the fall of 1983, and when they were at their best and most successful moment, Le√±o members decided to split off.  Solo period  Rosendo's first solo disc (Loco por incordiar) was pushed back until 1985, due to problems with his former label, Zafiro (to which Chapa Discos belonged). The disc was edited by RCA, and produced by Carlos Narea. It marked the moment of greatest commercial success in his career, thanks to songs like Agradecido, Pan de higo or Loco por incordiar. However, his next album, Fuera de lugar, edited next year, was negatively criticized. His last disc for RCA, ... a las lombrices, was published in 1987, and was received coldly. Jo Dworniak was the producer, and Rafael J. Vegas joined as a bass player. After leaving RCA, Rosendo started recording with Twins. The first album with this label was Jugar al gua (1988), which features songs with a different style (e.g., the Del pulm√≥n reggae), but also one of his key songs Flojos de pantal√≥n. The second record for Twins was Directo (1989), a live disc including two songs by Le√±o. Later Twins joined DRO, with whom Rosendo has kept on recording up to present (2005). The first album for DRO, Deja que les diga que no, appeared in 1991. Eugenio Mu√±oz took part in the production, as he did in later discs. Next year Rosendo published the disc La tortuga, containing a song that became quite popular: Majete. With Para mal o para bien (1994), he recorded for the first time in the El Cortijo del Aire studio, in the Cabo de Gata. Some outstanding songs are ¬øDe qu√© vas? and Hasta de perfil. The latter criticizes the power, and three members of Celtas Cortos collaborate. His next album, Listos para la reconversi√≥n was published in 1996. After that disc two of his musicians left, namely the keyboard player Gustavo Di N√≥bile and the drummer Miguel √Ångel Jim√©nez. Next year he recorded the soundtrack of Hector Carr√©'s movie Dame algo, and in 1998 he changed the setup of the band to a trio (bass, drums and guitar, giving up the keyboard), and changed his lifelong Fender Stratocaster guitar for a Gibson, allegedly for its looks. The first disc of this stage is A tientas y barrancas (1998), followed in 1999 by Siempre hay una historia... en directo, which he recorded live in the yard of the Carabanchel prison. In 2001 Canciones para normales y mero dementes was published. This disc features a harder sound, which was also present in Veo, veo... mamoneo (2002). In 2005 Lo malo es... ni darse cuenta was released. In 2006 he was awarded the Medalla de Oro al M√©rito en las Bellas ArtesTogether with Rosendo the king of Spain, Juan Carlos I, also awarded Joaqu√≠n Sabina, Enrique Morente, Raphael, and Maruja Torres His latest album, El end√©mico embustero y el incauto pertinaz, released in 2007, was recorded in the PKO (Madrid) and El Cortijo (Almer√≠a) studios.

Only one prototype of this class is known to be completed, although its characteristics have remained unclear. History Iran had shown interest in midget submarines in the 1980s. According to the Conway's All The World's Fighting Ships, Iran assembled a midget in Bandar Abbas that was completed in 1987 in an unsuccessful attempt. Iran reportedly purchased a second midget of another design from North Korea, delivered in 1988. It is alleged that by 1993, nine midget submarines ‚Äìable to displace 76 tons surfaced and 90 tons submerged, with a top speed between and ‚Äì were imported from North Korea. Existence of Nahang was first known in April 2006. On 6 March 2006, Iranian state television announced that Nahang 1 has been commissioned into the Southern Fleet., Later that year in late August, she participated in the third phase of Zarbat-e Zolfaghar wargame., Two other submarines in the class were allegedly planned, but building further units is considered unlikely. In April 2017, Bellingcat reported that for the first time in years, satellite imagery suggests Nahang has been deployed for a mission. Description There is not much confidently known about characteristics of the class. According to Jane's Fighting Ships, the class displace when at the surface and while submerged. Alternate estimates for surfaced and submerged displacement are and respectively while the number given goes as high as ., Jane's mentions the approximate dimensions as for length, with a beam of and a draft of . and are top speeds reported for the submarine. Nahang is reportedly unarmed and not fitted with torpedoes, however there are contradicting reports suggesting it has a pair of 533mm torpedo tubes in drop collars and can carry and lay four MDM-6 or EM-52 naval mines. Nahang may be utilized as a mothership for swimmer delivery vehicles and a platform for special operations. The submarine has no sonar on the report of Jane's, but another account suggests that she equipped with active/passive sonar on her bow. The machinery installed for propulsion is unknown. Other apparatus reportedly installed include a mast with electronic warfare support capabilities (similar to Russian-made 'Stop Light' type) and surface search and navigation radar.

United States law=Subordination of debt Subordination is the process by which a creditor is placed in a lower priority for the collection of its debt from its debtor's assets than the priority the creditor previously had,Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Ed. 1951, defining \\"subordinate.\\" In common parlance, the debt is said to be subordinated but in reality, it is the right of the creditor to collect the debt that has been reduced in priority. The priority of right to collect the debt is important when a debtor owes more than one creditor but has assets of insufficient value to pay them all in full at the time of a default. Except in bankruptcy proceedings, the creditor with the first priority for collection will generally have the first claim on the debtor's assets for its debt and the creditors whose rights are subordinate will thus have fewer assets to satisfy their claims. Subordination can take place by operation of law or by agreement among the creditors. Subordination of security priority Subordination is also an issue in the priority of security interests in the ownership of property. For example, in real estate, mortgages and other liens on the title to secure the payment or repayment of money usually take their priority from the time they attach to the title. The purpose of this ordering of priority is to determine, in a foreclosure resulting from a default, who gets paid first with the sale proceeds from the foreclosure proceeding. Earlier mortgages or other liens are often subordinated by their holders to later ones in order to accomplish agreed-upon ends. An example is for the holder of a mortgage on undeveloped land to subordinate that mortgage to a later construction loan mortgage. The motivation is either the belief that improvement of the land will benefit the first lender or that the first mortgage requires that it be subordinated to a future construction loan. The subordination percentage of a security is the percentage of the total capital which is subordinate to the security in question. Thus, the security will not suffer any losses until after that percentage of capital has been lost. =Dealer subordinable debt= In the automotive financing industry, many dealerships are allowed to designate personal loans which are payable to the ownership as subordinable debt. The finance institution and dealership may come to an agreement which allows this debt to stay within the confines of the financial statement and concurrently improve the dealership financial position from a liquidity perspective. Equitable subordination Bankruptcy courts in the United States have the power and authority to subordinate prior claims on the assets of a bankrupt debtor to the claims of junior claimants based on principles of equity. This is a remedy called \\"equitable subordination.\\"(c) The basis for subordination is usually the inequitable conduct of the prior claimant with respect to junior claimants. See, e.g., Murphy v. Meritor Savings Bank, 126 B.R. 370, 393, 413 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1991), in which an LBO left the corporation with insufficient cash to operate for longer than 10 days. In that case, the court not only avoided the mortgage securing the LBO debt, but it also subordinated the resulting lender's unsecured claim to the claims of all other creditors of the bankrupt debtor. Equitable subordination can be used to subordinate both secured and unsecured claims.

The National Museum of Ethiopia (NME), also referred to as the Ethiopian National Museum, is a national museum in Ethiopia. It is located in the capital, Addis Ababa, near the Addis Ababa University's graduate school. Overview Selam, a three-year-old Australopithecus afarensis hominid, housed in the National Museum's basement gallery. The museum houses Ethiopia's artistic treasures. It contains many precious local archaeological finds such as the fossilized remains of early hominids, the most famous of which is \\"Lucy,\\" the partial skeleton of a specimen of Australopithecus afarensis. Recently added to the basement gallery is a display on Selam, found between 2000 and 2004. This archaic fossil is estimated to date to 3.3 million years ago. In 1936, the concept of a museum was first introduced in Ethiopia when an exhibition was opened, displaying ceremonial costumes donated by the Solomonic dynasty and their close associates. The current NME grew from the establishment of the Institute of Archaeology, which was founded in 1958. The institute was founded to promote and facilitate the archaeological research mission in the northern part of Ethiopia by French archaeologists. Addi- Galamo, Tigray Region (dated 6th-5th century BCE), part of the National Museum's collection. The statue is inscribed with a phrase in South Arabian, \\"For God Grants a Child to Yamanat\\". The museum started its activities by exhibiting objects from these excavation missions. With the establishment of the Ethiopian Cultural Heritage Administration in 1976, the idea came up to open a National Museum, which was supported by the Government. The NME began to operate under the National Act which provides for the protection and preservation of antiquities, and has legislative authority governing all sites and monuments throughout the country of Ethiopia. Ethiopian National Museum administration building, constructed in Italian style. Later, the National Museum diversified its activities and organised into three working department, i.e. the conservation department, the documentation department and the exhibition and research department. The NME at present has four main exhibition sections. The basement is dedicated to archaeological and paleoanthropological sections. This area show the previously mentioned hominids. The first floor contains objects from ancient and medieval periods, as well as regalia and memorabilia from former rulers, who include Emperor Haile Selassie. The second floor shows art work in a chronological order, from traditional to contemporary works. Afewerk Tekle's massive African Heritage is one of the most notable pieces. Another painting depicts the meeting of Solomon and Sheba. The second floor contains a collection of secular arts and crafts, including traditional weapons, jewellery, utensils, clothing and musical instruments. Finally, the third floor has an ethnographic display. Here, the museum tries to give an overview of the cultural richness and variety of the peoples of Ethiopia.

Currently, Attaran is a Full Professor in both the Faculty of Law and the School of Epidemiology, Public Health and Community Medicine at the University of Ottawa. Early life and education Attaran was born in California to immigrants from Iran. He attended public schools in the Sacramento area. Attaran earned a B.A. in neuroscience from the University of California at Berkeley, after which he worked in the x-ray crystallography laboratory of Professor Robert Stroud at the University of California at San Francisco on a project to determine the 3-D structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Attaran received a predoctoral fellowship from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for graduate studies in the biomedical sciences, leading to degrees from Caltech (M.S., 1992) and Oxford University (D.Phil., 1996). At Oxford, he matriculated to Wadham College and studied under Professor David Shotton of the Department of Zoology and Professor Alain Townsend of the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine. His doctoral thesis examined how killer T-cells modify themselves structurally in response to viral infections as a precursor to granulocyte- and apoptosis-mediated cytotoxicity, and is entitled \\"CTL cytotoxicity and the cytoskeleton: a microscopial study\\". While at Oxford pursuing his science doctorate, Attaran simultaneously enrolled in law school at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. He graduated with an LL.B., was called to the bar in 1999, and has been a barrister and solicitor of the Law Society of Upper Canada since 2005. From 2000 to 2003, Attaran held a junior academic position at Harvard University in the Kennedy School of Government, where his research focus was on public health law and policy. At Harvard he co-directed the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health in the Center for International Development under Jeffrey Sachs, and researched the influence of patent law on the ability of patients to access life-saving medicines and the human right to health at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy under Michael Ignatieff. From 2003 to 2005, Attaran taught at Yale University in the School of Public Health, and was a fellow at Chatham House (formerly the Royal Institute of International Affairs) in London, where he researched global development, patent law, and access to essential medicines for neglected diseases such as malaria. Notable work Attaran has had a diverse career as a scientist, lawyer, scholar, and advocate for public health, human rights and environmental protection. While a graduate student at Oxford, the university secretly ordered its scientists to \\"remove radioactive warning labels\\" from dangerous laboratory waste, and instructed them to dispose of it covertly in the city's sewerage and rubbish bins. Scientists in the Department of Zoology where Attaran was based opposed the policy as \\"unacceptable\\", and Attaran waged a successful whistleblowing campaign that reversed it. , Attaran was counsel on a successful administrative law challenge to the issuance of wood incineration permits in British Columbia that caused exceptionally high levels of smoke and small particulates (PM 10) that harmed asthma patients.Mutschke et al v. Northwood Inc., BC Environmental Appeal Board, Appeals 99-WAS-06/08(d), 99-WAS-11/12/13(d), 00-WAS-01(d). of the right to a healthy environment being fully litigated as a constitutional right under s. 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the right to life, liberty and security of the person). In 1999 and 2000, Attaran was an environmental lawyer participating in the negotiation of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which banned the manufacturing and use of certain toxic substances. Attaran led a controversial global campaign of over 400 scientists and medical doctors, including several Nobel prize winners, who wanted an exemption to use DDT in public health because it is extremely effective in reducing the deaths of children from malaria. South Africa's Medical Research Council subsequently invited Attaran to draft the public health exemption, which countries agreed at the sixth and last negotiation session in Johannesburg as Annex B of the Stockholm Convention. Although once opposed, Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund now accept using DDT in small amounts for public health, and the World Health Organization adopted it as a recommended malaria control strategy. In 2001, Attaran acted as an advisor on patent and trade law to Brazil's Ministry of Health, to defend against a legal challenge the United States brought at the World Trade Organization, which sought to force Brazil to amend its patent laws and prohibit the affordable, generic versions of HIV/AIDS medicines on which the health ministry depended. Attaran and his colleague Paul Champ developed a legal strategy involving a retaliatory challenge to US patent laws. The United States withdrew its case under public pressure and Brazil continued using generic HIV/AIDS medicines for its population. In 2001, Attaran and Jeffrey Sachs, then at Harvard working on the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, published an influential paper in The Lancet that the editors of that journal credited as the \\"blueprint\\" for fighting the global HIV/AIDS pandemic on a large scale. Attaran and Sachs proposed a new, multibillion-dollar fund that would be \\"based on grants, not loans, for the poorest countries\\", and which would be \\"judged as having epidemiological merit ... by a panel of independent scientific experts.\\" Attaran and Sachs' policy innovations were widely championed by advocates, and incorporated into the design of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria which launched later that year. The Fund has since saved over 20 million lives. Although the Federal Courts found that torture could not be justified under s. 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it ruled that the Charter lacks extraterritorial reach to the Canadian Forces' overseas military expeditions. Nonetheless, the Court's decision confirmed that Canada knew about detainees being tortured, as with a man who had \\"bruising ... consistent with the beating [he] described\\", and whose story was corroborated by \\"Canadian personnel [locating] a large piece of braided electrical wire and a rubber hose\\" in the interrogation room.Amnesty International Canada v. Canadian Forces, 2008 FC 162. The Court's ruling that \\"Canadian Forces will undoubtedly have to give very careful consideration as to whether it is indeed possible to resume such transfers in the future without exposing detainees to a substantial risk of torture\\" led to strengthening the detainee policy shortly thereafter. From 2009 to 2015, Attaran litigated a case at the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario which sought to expand the reproductive rights of women and men by compelling the Ontario Health Insurance Plan to fund in vitro fertilization irrespective of sex or disability. Ontario's practice had been to provide IVF only when a woman was infertile, and only where her disability affected the fallopian tubes, thereby excluding other forms of female infertility disability (e.g. cancer, endometriosis), and entirely excluding infertile men. The litigation convinced Ontario to strike an advisory panel on infertilityhttp://health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ivf/docs/ivf_report.pdf that included Attaran in exchange for him adjourning the hearing, the result of which was that the province finally accepted to fund IVF, mooting the legal challenge. In 2008, Attaran wrote a Globe and Mail opinion piece critical of the Department of National Defence (DND) for supporting Canada's involvement in the war in Afghanistan through the undisclosed financing of think tanks and academics favourable to Canada's involvement, alleging that the latter could be viewed as tainted. David Pugliese, writing in the Ottawa Citizen, noted that Attaran faced fierce reactions from the DND \\"who sent in a letter of protest to the Globe as did several defence academics;\\" and that, in an exchange with one of those \\"defence academics,\\" military historian J.L. Granatstein, Attaran pointed out that Granatstein himself had received an award of $5000 from an Ottawa-based think tank. In 2012, Attaran filed a complaint against right-wing political commentator Ezra Levant, who was also a lawyer called to the Alberta bar. Levant told a Hispanic banana company executive \\"chinga tu madre\\" (\\"go fuck your mother\\") on his Sun TV show. The Law Society of Alberta initially withdrew the charges, but Alberta Court of Queen's Bench Justice Dawn Pentelechuk said the society's explanation for doing so was \\"unsatisfactory and unclear\\" and ordered a hearing to determine if they had committed an abuse of process. Levant ultimately resigned from the bar in March, 2016 rather than face a disciplinary hearing. Attaran criticized the law society for allowing Levant to resign without reprimand, saying that it breached their own rules. In 2013, Attaran accused Peter MacKay of falsely alleging that Justin Trudeau committed a crime by smoking marijuana. In dismissing the complaint, the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society said there was no evidence to suggest MacKay knew he was saying something false. MacKay was Attorney General of Canada at the time. In 2016, Attaran filed a complaint at the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that the federal government's Canada Research Chair program discriminated against women, visible minorities, aboriginal people, and persons with disabilities. Attaran brought legal challenge after the CRC Program's decade-long failure to honour a settlement agreement signed by the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, setting firm employment equity targets for these four groups. The government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sided with Attaran, and in 2017 Science Minister Kirsty Duncan announced that universities would be required either to increase diversity and meet the employment equity targets, or lose their federal CRC funding. Criticism of Covid-19 response During the COVID-19 crisis, Attaran testified in Parliament, and wrote articles generally critical of the pandemic response in Canada. Attaran caused controversy among nationalists in Quebec when he likened it to \\"the sick man of Canada\\" after it recorded more deaths in a single day than much more populous countries in Asia, Europe, and the Pacific, and more than any other province in Canada.

It has geological similarities to other hydrocarbon-rich basins in the Middle East. Hydrocarbon exploration and development (Ogadenia) Exploration blocks in the Ogaden Basin and Kismayo Coast The first exploration in the basin was undertaken by Standard Oil in 1920 More recent exploration by Tenneco resulted in the discovery of an estimated 68 million cubic metres (2.4 billion cubic feet) of gas in 1974. Development of the reserves in the basin's Jeexdin and Elale gas fields is being carried out by the Gazoil Ethiopia Project, a joint-venture partnership between the government of Ethiopia and Texas-based Sicor announced in December 1999. The basin has been divided into 21 blocks, and exploration rights have been awarded for many of them. Companies with concessions in the basin include Netherlands registered Pexco Exploration, Petronas (Malaysia), Lundin East Africa (Sweden), SouthWest Energy Ltd. (Hong Kong), and Afar Explorer (USA). Political instability and armed conflict The Ogaden War between Ethiopia and Somalia took place for the control of the region between 1977 and 1978, with a further clash in 1988. In recent years the armed wing of the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) has been active, and the rebel group has stated that they will not allow the resources of the region to be exploited, urging international oil companies not to sign agreements with the Ethiopian government. On April 24, 2007, members of the ONLF attacked and destroyed an oil exploration facility within the basin near Obala and Abole, killing approximately 65 Ethiopians and 9 Chinese nationals in the Abole raid. The facility was being operated by the Chinese Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau, a subsidiary of Sinopec, on behalf of Petronas.

He was charged with aiding the enemy and other breaches of military law, mostly in connection with his role as commander of the 451st Military Police Detachment and Camp Cropper, a holding facility for security detainees in Iraq. He was acquitted of aiding the enemy, but sentenced to 2 years confinement on other charges and was dismissed from the military. He was confined at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Steele was only the second officer to be charged with aiding the enemy during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the other being Captain James Yee. William H. Steele was the only field-grade officer to be charged with aiding the enemy during all of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Biography=Background Steele is originally from Frostburg, Maryland and a 1973 graduate of Beall High School. He is a former police officer from Anne Arundel County, Maryland and a former Hernando County, Florida sheriff‚Äôs deputy. Civilian legal incidents After Steele was charged with aiding the enemy, the press reported on two earlier incidents in which Steele had been involved with the courts. In November 1993, he was charged with felony aggravated child abuse for his verbal and physical abuse of his 11-year-old stepson. From court records, \\"[The boy] was punched. He was thrown across the room for eating food without asking.\\" Steele was also charged with resisting an officer with violence, another felony. Both charges were dropped when he agreed to give up custody. In 2003, Steele was charged with two misdemeanor offenses during a dispute with a contractor. The contractor, who was born in Lebanon, accused Steele of saying: \\"You better get out of here or I'll blow your head off,\\" and said that Steele \\"accused him of working for al-Qaeda\\". Steele was convicted on one count of threatening bodily harm, but upon appeal the charges were dismissed after Steele completed anger management therapy. Camp Cropper Steele served as commandant of Camp Cropper from October 2005 to the end of October 2006, when he transferred to Camp Victory and served as a senior patrol officer with 89th Military Police Brigade. Camp Cropper is known to have held former Baath Party members, Al-Qaeda operatives, and members of the Iraqi insurgency. On April 26, 2007 it was announced that Steele had been held in military detention since March, and that he had been charged with aiding the enemy and other violations of military law. After that he was held in pretrial confinement in Kuwait. Testimony at his Article 32 hearing indicated that the charge of aiding the enemy was based on the allegation that Steele had allowed three juvenile detainees to use his cellphone to call their parents in violation of the prison's requirement that all prisoner phone calls be monitored. (Steele had been previously reprimanded by Brigadier General Kevin McBride, commander of the 43rd MP Brigade, for \\"intimidating tower guards with a service pistol.\\" He was later awarded the Bronze Star Medal by General McBride at the end of his tour of duty.) On June 10, 2007, the military dropped charges of fraternization with the daughter of a prisoner, and failure to oversee expenditure of government funds‚Äîallegedly used to purchase of hair dye and Cuban cigars for Saddam Hussein when he was held at Camp Cropper. At that time, Major General James E. Simmons referred the remaining charges for trial by general court-martial. Steele was ordered confined pending trial. At a pre-trial hearing held at Camp Liberty, Iraq, on October 7, Steele pleaded guilty to two charges relating to improper storage of classified materials and to one of possession of pornographic videos. Steele's trial before a military judge on charges of \\"aiding the enemy, possessing classified information, disobeying orders and conduct unbecoming an officer\\" began in Baghdad on October 15. On October 19, 2007, a military judge found Steele not guilty on the charge of aiding the enemy, but guilty of \\"unauthorized possession of classified documents, behavior unbecoming an officer for an inappropriate relationship with an interpreter and failing to obey an order\\". Steele was sentenced to 2 years confinement (of a possible maximum 6-year sentence for the charges to which he had previously plead guilty, as well as an additional 10 years for the charges for which he was convicted), credited with time served, loss of his military retirement, forfeiture of pay and allowances, and dismissal from the military.

During its operation, the incline ferried people and freight between the South Side and Knoxville. The Knoxville Incline and the nearby Mount Oliver Incline enabled the development of land in Allentown and surrounding communities on the hilltop. Like the Nunnery Hill Incline, the Knoxville Incline featured a curve, an unusual engineering feat for an incline.

It is the dominant classic rock-formatted radio station in the market and is generally a top ten performer in the Grand Rapids ratings. History WLAV (AM) went on the air in 1940. In 1949, WLAV-TV 7 signed on, later becoming WOOD-TV 8. WLAV-FM began broadcasting by 1948. The station was a simulcast of WLAV 1340 in its early days, but began to break the simulcast in the early 1970s to first utilize the syndicated \\"Love\\" format with the likes of Brother John and then went live to play AOR music at night. Also for a time in the early 1970s WLAV-FM played oldies under the tag line \\"Grand Rapids' Goldmine.\\" In 1974, it became western Michigan's first full- time AOR station and was an instant success. The station experienced difficulties in the 1980s. The station was sued for the death of two people and the injury of two other at its popular annual raft race event. Many of its top D.J.s began to leave: morning host Laurie DeYoung left for Baltimore, Tony Gates left in 1984, and in 1986 popular morning personality Kevin Matthews left to work in St. Louis. By the early 1990s, WLAV-FM was doing poorly in the ratings, facing increased competition from nascent album rocker WKLQ and classic rocker WJFM. In the spring 1991 Arbitron report, WLAV, which had been a top five station just a year before and had been the #1 station 12+ as recently as fall 1987, fell completely out of the top ten stations 12+, its role as Grand Rapids' top album-rocker having been usurped by WKLQ. On Memorial Day 1992, the station changed to a modern rock-based format, since it felt that modern rock was the direction that progressive rock and album- oriented rock radio was heading towards. Following backlash from listeners, by the fall of 1993, WLAV put the alternative format on 1340 WLAV-AM (then calling it \\"1340 Underground\\", where it ran for approximately 2 more years until a sports format replaced it). At the same time, they switched the FM signal back to a more classic rock-driven format. They continued refining the format during the 1990s, honing it towards classic rock music from the 1960s to the 1980s, to renewed success in the ratings. Citadel Broadcasting acquired the station from Bloomington Broadcasting (doing business as Michigan Media) in 2000. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

He is mentioned by Emperor Claudius in The Twelve Caesars by Suetonius, but few or no other records of him have survived to the present day. Background J. C. Rolfe's 1913 translation of Suetonius, itself probably composed in response to Teubner's 1904 German translation, contains Footnote 100, explaining the term \\"Telegenius\\" as a proper name: \\"Obviously, some man proverbial for his folly, but nothing is known about him.\\" The word, or, more accurately, the term \\"telegenius\\" is itself a combination of two words: tele (from the Greek œÑŒ∑ŒªŒµ, tele meaning \\"distant\\") and genius (from the Latin geniƒÅlis, a derivative of genius, which originally meant \\"of generation and birth\\". At Book V, Claudius, Chapter LX, Suetonius quotes the Emperor's use of figures of speech. There is no evidence for Rolfe's translation of \\"Telegenius\\" being anything more than a Georgian misunderstanding of the original Latin sentence, \\"Quid, ego tibi Telegenius videor?\\" Suetonius probably meant \\"mind reader\\". William Whitaker's Latin Dictionary translates \\"telegenius\\" as \\"prophetic skill\\". The term was either not capitalized by Suetonius, or more likely, the entire text was capitalized. Minuscules are an early mediaeval invention. Although modern capitals are based on Renaissance capitals, which were based on Roman capitals, the Romans used them for inscriptions, rather than writing on papyrus or wax tablets. Rolfe himself wrote that his text is based upon a manuscript written either in rustic capitals or uncials, with a provenance dating from 884 AD, the \\"Fulda Codex\\". This evidence supports the position that Rolfe, telegeniously, but incorrectly attempted to guess at Suetonius' meaning. For the last 98 years, Rolfe's error has been perpetuated in every republication of his text.

The organization was founded in March 1988 to mobilize community opposition to the city's operation of the North River Sewage Treatment Plant, and the siting of the sixth bus depot in Northern Manhattan. Bird's Eye view of Harlem, New York City WE ACT is dedicated to fighting environmental justice issues in the Northern Manhattan community. The organization focuses on urban quality of life issues such as climate justice, clean air, access to good jobs, public health, pollution, and sustainable and equitable land use. It works through citizen empowerment, lobbying, litigation, education, and community outreach to accomplish its goals. Currently, WE ACT is one of several groups engaged in negotiations for a Community Benefits Agreement with Columbia University as part of the school's Manhattanville expansion plan. It is also renovating an abandoned brownstone for conversion into the WE ACT Environmental Justice Center, which will house office and program space as well as serve as a demonstration of various green building technologies.  History and organization  In April 1986, the North River Sewage Treatment Plant began its operations on eight blocks of riverside property in West Harlem, Manhattan. Soon after its opening, local residents from the predominantly African American and Latino neighborhood complained of noxious odors emitting from the plant and increased exposures to health hazards. Peggy Shepard, a local resident, who was elected as a political district leader in 1985, pressured local and state authorities to perform a study on the health effects of exposure to the treatment plant's emissions. The study found that the fumes may cause respiratory problems at high levels of exposure, triggering public backlash from West Harlem residents, demanding repairs be made on the facility. In 1988 the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) attempted to construct a second bus depot in West Harlem, adjacent to an intermediary school. The MTA was met with strong community opposition, in the form of protests, lawsuits, and scientific research. During this period, the attention and discontent surrounding the operation of the North River Sewage Treatment Plant and the construction of a second bus depot in West Harlem, presented the need for a unified movement to address the unequal impact of environmental hazards on the minority community. Therefore, in March 1988 Peggy Shepard, Vernice Miller-Travis, and Chuck Sutton launched WE ACT to \\"institutionalize resources in the community\\" to build and educate a community dedicated to fighting environmental injustice and improving environmental health. WE ACT emphasizes the importance of citizen involvement in its campaigns and partnerships. It utilizes community-based participatory research to address environmental justice issues and improve the environmental health and quality of life of the Northern Manhattan community. WE ACT strives to educate community members and raise public awareness on issues effecting the health and quality of life of the community.  Early work = North River Sewage Treatment Plant  The construction of the North River Sewage Treatment Plant, was initially proposed for a site along the Hudson River at 72nd Street, a primarily white and affluent community; however, the site was rejected due to community opposition and logistical problems. Thus, the site relocated to 137th Street in West Harlem, a predominantly Latino and African- American neighborhood. Local residents were outraged by the new sitting of the sewage plant in their community, concerned it would worsen preexisting pollution problems. Despite community resistance, construction of the plant started in 1972 and was completed in 1985. When the plant began its operations in 1986, community members further voiced their concerns over noxious odors emanating from the plant effecting an area of almost two miles. Local residents remained indoors to escape the fumes, partly due to their fear of developing adverse health effects resulting from exposure to the fumes. A study by the New York Department of Energy Conservation (DEC), found the plant's emissions contained hydrogen sulfide levels 28% higher than the standard. Community discontent shifted into activism and in 1988 on Martin Luther King Day, WE ACT co-founders Peggy Shepard and Chuck Sutton, along with several others were arrested for blocking traffic around the treatment facility, as an act of protest against the poor operation and management of the plant. Due to lawsuits filed by community organizations, resistance from West Harlem residents, and pressure from WE ACT, city officials addressed the plant's operating issues in 1991 and located a design flaw that was causing the excess air pollution. After a prolonged court battle with the city and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), WE ACT came to a settlement regarding the operations of the sewage plant in December 1993. As a result, $1.1 million was set aside in a fund for communal environmental initiatives in West Harlem and WE ACT was made \\"a monitor of the city's $55 million consent agreement to fix the plant\\". In an act of appeasement to the West Harlem community for the faulty operating of the sewage plant and occupation of limited open space, the state constructed a 28-acre state park known as the Riverbank State Park on top of the sewage plant in 1993. However, fumes and odors continued to seep out of the plant affecting local neighborhoods. Today the North River Sewage Treatment Plant is continuing to improve their facility and upgrade to meet higher air quality standards. In their most recent endeavors the facility has installed new duct work and fans to optimize odor control and reported air issues.  Dirty Diesel  Northern Manhattan is home to one-third of \\"the largest diesel bus fleet (4,000 vehicles) in the country\\" operated by the MTA. WE ACT deemed the high concentration of bus depots had negative impacts on air quality and the subsequent health of Northern Manhattan community members. The organization associated the high rates of asthma in Northern Manhattan with concentrated levels of particulate matter (PM), an air pollutant released during diesel fuel combustion, emanating from the bus depots, major transportation routes, and heavy traffic throughout West Harlem. WE ACT also organized a media campaign, The Clean Fuel --Clean Air--Good Health Diesel Bus Campaign, to raise public awareness on the risks associated with diesel exhaust and its ability to trigger asthma attacks. While it failed to influence the MTA to change its policies in favor of cleaner fuel alternatives, the campaign garnered a large amount of public support and attention, demonstrating the power of public media and community outreach. In November 2000, WE ACT, filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) claiming that bus depots were disproportionately located in minority communities in Northern Manhattan, which houses six of the eight total bus depots in Manhattan, thus elevating the health risks associated with high exposure to harmful diesel exhaust. The USDOT found that the MTA violated Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and failed to meet the federal environmental impact analysis involving the construction, rehabilitation, and operation of bus depots and other facilities. This campaign led to the MTA's modification of bus depots and investment in clean- fuel buses, as well as increased public awareness pertaining to the dangers of fuel fumes and poor air quality.  Mission  WE ACT states its mission is \\"to build healthy communities by ensuring that people of color and/or low income residents participate meaningfully in the creation of sound and fair environmental health and protection policies and practices.\\" The organization serves as an \\"educational resource\\" to galvanize citizen participation and activism on matters of \\"environmental health and quality of life issues\\".  Environmental justice = Asthma  In the United States the number of people suffering from Asthma has grown steadily every year. Healthcare professionals have referred to the alarming rise in asthma cases as \\"a new epidemic\\". The respiratory disease is characterized by chronic lung inflammation and episodes of airway constriction. While there is uncertainty on the exact cause of the disease, it is believed that \\"genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life\\". Recently, the focus has turned to the impact of environmental conditions, most notably the exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollutants or allergens. WE ACT states that a racial divide exists in air pollution, resulting in the disproportionate exposure of minority or low income communities to high levels of air pollutants. WE ACT works to improve the air quality of Northern Manhattan communities and reduce the incidence of asthma and other respiratory problems by addressing the sources and environmental risks producing harmful air pollutants. WE ACT focuses on asthma or clean air as one of its primary areas of concern, because of exceptionally high rates of asthma found in Northern Manhattan. The organization highlights the connection between environmental risks in the predominantly Latino and African-American neighborhoods, such as the disproportionate exposure to diesel exhaust and the ubiquitous odors from municipal facilities, and the highest asthma mortality and morbidity rates in New York. WE ACT the challenges the city and state to recognize and address air quality problems. Currently WE ACT, is collaborating with several community-based environmental organizations, such as the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice (DSCEJ), Green Door Initiative (GDI), and Jesus People Against Pollution (JPAP), on the National Asthma Disparities Project. The project aims to study the disparities in asthma treatment across four different communities in the United States, by assessing the effectiveness of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Coordinated Federal Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Asthma Disparities (Action Plan). The Action Plan was introduced in May 2012, to review federal efforts addressing asthma issues and develop a more effective collaboration among federal programs.  Partnerships = Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC)  The Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC) is a collaborative program between the NIEHS Center for Environmental Health in Northern Manhattan, WE ACT, and other community stakeholders, working to understand and prevent the environmental aspects of diseases such as Parkinson's, Cancer, Asthma, and ALS through policy and legislation. The operations of the COEC focus on four Northern Manhattan communities: Central Harlem, West Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood. Other members of the program include organizations within a close proximity to Northern Manhattan, such as The Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) of Columbia University, The Harlem Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, and the Harlem Hospital Center. One of the biggest accomplishments of COEC and WE ACT is the development of an Environmental Health Report Card. The report card assigns a grade to New York City communities based on measurements of indoor/outdoor air quality, recreational water quality, solid waste, open space, and the availability of healthy food. By communicating scientific and health research findings through initiatives such as family events and fairs, conferences, forums, and the Environmental Health Report Card, the COEC members seek to increase community awareness of environmental dangers and establish a consistent local involvement in environmental issues. WE ACT's involvement in Northern Manhattan communities allows COEC members to acquire information about local environmental health concerns. In turn, WE ACT acts as a bridge for the passing of information between research groups and low-income communities in Northern Manhattan.  Faith Leaders for Environmental Justice  WE ACT has collaborated with members of diverse Northern Manhattan churches in an effort to raise public awareness of environmental issues. The goal of the partnership is to encourage people of faith to care about environmental issues and to educate religious figures so that they can inspire environmental justice activism throughout diverse communities that, traditionally, have not engaged in environmental justice issues. Faith Leaders for Environmental Justice focuses on three key points: Climate Justice, Food Justice, and Energy Consumption. The Climate Justice work group seeks to promote awareness surrounding the dangers of climate change and the behavioral alterations that can be made to mitigate the effects. In coordination with the Energy Consumption work group, one of the main points of the Climate Justice group is to teach people how to reduce their energy consumption and carbon emissions. The Food Justice work group aims to educate people about the barriers to healthy eating and the importance of purchasing healthy food, while bringing healthful food initiatives to low- income communities. Some of these initiatives include Community Sponsored Agriculture (CSA) projects, community and rooftop gardens, food drives, and food stamp outreach.  Healthy Home Healthy Child Campaign  The Healthy Homes Project is a joint research initiative between the Columbia University Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH). The project targets the unequal exposure of environmental hazards faced by children in minority or low-income communities and works to educate families on a number of known risk factors such as \\"cigarettes, lead poisoning, drugs and alcohol, air pollution, garbage, pesticides, and poor nutrition\\".

Serbs have been associated with Bournville since Dame Elizabeth Cadbury sponsored thirteen Serbian refugee children of World War I. Built in traditional 14th-century Byzantine form by Yugoslavian architect Dr Dragomir Tadic and Bournville Village Trust, it is a replica of a church in Serbia using stone from the same quarries. Completed in 1968, it is of brick and stone with three sets of bronze doors and a candelabrum from Serbia. It has no seats, which is the usual thing for traditional Orthodox churches. Moreover, the interior has a full scheme of traditional Byzantine decoration. The dome contains the image of Christ Pantocrator, and the hemi- dome of the apse contains that of the Virgin Mary. At the bottom of the walls are the warrior saints, above these are patriarchs and priestly saints, and at the top are the apostles and scenes from the twelve major Christian feasts. Not only have these murals been executed in a perfect Byzantine style, but they are painted fresco, meaning that the paint was applied meticulously to wet walls.

China's government, specifically the National Health and Family Planning Commission (formerly the Ministry of Health), plays a leading role in these reforms. Reforms focus on establishing public medical insurance systems and enhancing public healthcare providers, the main component in China's healthcare system. In urban and rural areas, three government medical insurance system, Urban Residents Basic Medical Insurance, Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance and New Rural Co-operative Medical Scheme cover almost everyone. Various public healthcare facilities, including county or city hospitals, community health centers, township health centers, were founded to serve diverse needs. Current and future reforms are outlined in Healthy China 2030.  General Guidelines =Healthy China 2020 In October 2009, Chen Zhu, head of the Ministry of Health, declared the pursuit of Healthy China 2020, a program to provide universal healthcare access and treatment for all of China by 2020, mostly by revised policies in nutrition, agriculture, food, and social marketing.Hu, F. B., Liu, Y., and Willett, W.C. (2011). Preventing chronic diseases by promoting healthy diet and lifestyle: public policy implications for China. Obesity Reviews, 7, 552-559. Much of the program centers on chronic disease prevention and promoting better lifestyle choices and eating habits. It especially targets public awareness for obesity, physical inactivity, and poor dietary choices. Healthy China 2020 focuses the most on urban, populous areas that are heavily influenced by globalization and modernity. Additionally, much of the program is media-run and localized and concentrates on change through the community rather than local laws. Many of the aims of Healthy China 2020 are concentrated to more-urban areas under Western influences. Diet is causing obesity issues, and an influx of modern transportation is negatively affecting urban environments and thus health.  Healthy China 2030  In October 2016, after Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping and premier Li Keqiang's relevant theme speech at China National Health and Well-being conference in Beijing, China National Health and Family Planning Commission issued the Healthy China 2030 Planning Outline, the most recent comprehensive framework on the goals and plans of its healthcare reform. The strategic theme of Healthy China 2030 is ‚Äúco-building, sharing and health for all‚Äù. The project aims to achieve these key goals by 2030: continuous improve in people's health conditions, raise life expectancy to 79, effective control on main health-endangering factors, substantial improve in health service, notable expansion in health industry, establishment of inclusive health- improving regulatory systems. Specific actions include: enhancing health education in schools, promoting healthy lifestyle, encouraging exercise, enhancing universal healthcare access, improve service quality of healthcare providers, special attention to the elderly, women, children and disabled, reforms in health insurance, pharmaceutical and medical instruments systems, etc.  Medical insurance reforms  See also Health Insurance in China  Rural Co-operative Medical Scheme (1950‚Äì1980s)  After 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took control of China, and the Ministry of Health effectively controlled China's health care system and policies.Blumenthal, David, and Hsiao, William. (2005). Privatization and Its Discontents ‚Äî The Evolving Chinese Health Care System. The New England Journal of Medicine. 1165-1170. Under the Chinese government, the country's officials, rather than local governments, largely determined access to health care. Rural areas saw the biggest need for healthcare reform, and the Rural Co-operative Medical Scheme (RCMS) was established as a three-tier system for rural healthcare access. The RCMS functioned on a pre-payment plan that consisted of individual income contribution, a village collective welfare Fund, and subsidies from higher government.Liu, Yuanli, Hsiao, William C., and Eggleston, Karen. (1999). Equity in health and health care: the Chinese experience. Social Science & Medicine, 10, 1349-1356. The first tier consisted of barefoot doctors, who were trained in basic hygiene and traditional Chinese medicine.Cook, Ian G., and Dummer, Trevor J.B. (2004). Changing health in China: re-evaluating the epidemiological transition model. Health Policy, 3, 329-343. The system of barefoot doctors was the easiest form of healthcare access, especially in rural areas. Township health centers were the second tier of the RCMS, consisting of small, outpatient clinics that primarily hired medical professionals that were subsidized by the Chinese government. Together with barefoot doctors, township health centers were utilized for most common illnesses. The third tier of the CMS, county hospitals, was for the most seriously ill patients. They were primarily funded by the government but also collaborated with local systems for resources (equipment, physicians, etc.).Public health campaigns to improve environmental and hygienic conditions were also implemented, especially in urban areas. The RCMS has significantly improved life expectancy and simultaneously decreased the prevalence of certain diseases. For example, life expectancy has almost doubled (from 35 to 69 years), and infant mortality has been slashed from 250 deaths to 40 deaths for every 1000 live births. Also, the malaria rate has dropped from 5.55% of the entire Chinese population to 0.3% of the population. The increase in health has been from both the central and local government and community efforts to increase good health. Campaigns sought to prevent diseases and halt the spread of agents of disease like mosquitoes causing malaria. Attempts to raise public awareness of health were especially emphasized. Due to Mao Zedong's support, the RCMS saw its rapidest expansion during Cultural Revolution, reaching a peak of covering 85% of the total population in 1976. However, as a result of agricultural sector reform and end of People's Commune in the 1980s, the RCMS lost its economic and organizational basis. Therefore, RCMS collapsed, with only 9.6% coverage in 1984.  Healthcare Provider Reforms = Changes in hospitals (2010‚Äìpresent)  Haidian Hospital, Beijing In China, public hospitals are considered the most important health facilities, providing both outpatient and inpatient care. They also bear major teaching, training and research responsibilities. Most hospitals are located in cities. However, several problems posts challenges to accessible and affordable hospital healthcare. To begin with, prices of medicine are set unreasonably high to make up for low service price. Doctors are also dissatisfied about their income. Secondly, great tension in patient-doctor relationships sometimes causes conflicts or even violence against doctors (yinao). Furthermore, patients are not distributed by seriousness among hospitals and lower health facilities, which leads to over-consumption of high-level medical resources in hospitals. The aim of hospital reforms is to maintain the social welfare nature of public hospitals and encourage them to perform public service functions, thereby providing accessible and affordable healthcare services for the people. Reforms started as pilot in 2010 in 16 cities.State Council. (2010) Guidelines on Public Hospital Reform Pilots. [1] In 2015, a new version of guidelines came out and extra attention is given to county-level hospitals.State Council. (2015) Guidelines on Comprehensive Reform of City Public Hospitals. [2] In 2017, public hospital reforms expanded with focus on eliminating drug price difference between hospital pharmacies and wholesales.State Council. (2017) Notice on Universal Expansion of Comprehensive Reforms on Public Hospitals.[3] Various studies have shown mixed results on the effectiveness of the results. Case survey found that reforms in compensation systems increased service quantity and quality, but caused drastic drop in management efficiency. Regional evidence showed that total out-of-pocket expenditure actually increased, despite the decrease in inpatient medications. Health staff's job satisfaction increased while exposed to higher pressure and overtime working.  Changes in other healthcare providers  Apart from public hospitals, numerous grass-root public health facilities and private healthcare providers also play their unique role in providing healthcare services. Reforms on grass-root facilities focus on their cooperation and responsibility distribution between hospitals, motivate and compensate grass-level health personnel.State Council. (2010) Guidelines on Establishing Compensation System for Grass-root Health Facilities.[4] Private parties are encouraged to provide medical service and cooperate with public sectors.State Council. (2016) The 13th Five-Year Plan for Deepening the Medical and Health System Reform.  Pharmaceutical reforms = Essential Drug List (2009‚Äìpresent)  In 2009, State Council started Essential Drug System (EDS) and published first version of Essential Drug List (EDL) that consists 307 types of drugs. All grass-root healthcare facilities are required to prepare, use and sell listed drugs almost exclusively. Price of drugs are negotiated by regional government and drug producers while they are sold at zero profit at grass-root facilities. Reimbursement rate for ED is set notably higher. EDL is subject to change according to needs and drug development. However, in 2015, State Council changed its regulations to deter local governments from expanding EDL. Analysis pointed out that local governments' power in adding new drugs to their EDL is prone to rent-seeking behaviors and protectionism for local medicine industry. Besides, the new guideline removed the restriction of using unlisted drugs, as this regulation caused in shortage of drugs in grass-root facilities. Opinions on EDS varies. Mckinsey survey in 2013 found that over 2 thirds top executives from multinational drug companies expected EDS would have negative effect on their business. Studies suggested changes in drug selection process. Cooperation with outside=World Bank Health VIII project An example of a reform model based on an international partnership approach was the Basic Health Services Project. The project was the 8th World Bank project in China, and was implemented between 1998 and 2007 by the Government of China in 97 poor rural counties in which 45 million people live.China: Basic Health Services 8 Project. http://go.worldbank.org/UYUURCNVY0accessdate=October 20, 2013. The project aimed to encourage local officials to test innovative strategies for strengthening their health service to improve access to competent care and reduce the impact of major illness. Instead of focusing on eradicating a specific disease, as previous World Bank projects had done, the Health Services Project was a general attempt to reform healthcare.Wagstaff, Adam, and Yu, Shengchao. (2007). Do health sector reforms have their intended impacts?: The World Bank's Health VIII project in Gansu province, China. Journal of Health Economics, 3, 505-535. Both the supply (medical facilities, pharmaceutical companies, professionals) and demand (patients, rural citizens) side of medicine were targeted. In particular, the project supported county implementers to translate national health policy into strategies and actions meaningful at a local level. The project saw mixed results. While there was an increase in subsidies from the government, which was able to reduce out-of- pocket spending for residents, there was no statistically significant improvement in health indicators (reduced illness, etc.). Policy implications With China managing major health system reform against a background of rapid economic and institutional change, the Institute of Development Studies, an international research institute, outlines policy implications based on collaborative research around the Chinese approach to health system development.Lesson from the Chinese Approach to Health Systems Development Institute of Development Studies (IDS) In Focus Policy Brief Issue 8, June 2009. A comparison of China's healthcare to other nations shows that the organization of healthcare is crucial to its implementation. There is some disorganization and inequity in access to healthcare in urban and rural areas, but the overall quality of healthcare has not been drastically affected.Hsiao, William. (1995). The Chinese health care system: Lessons for other nationsjournal=Social Science and Medicine, 8, 1047-1055. Certain incentives, such as adjusting prices of medical equipment and medicine, have helped improve health care to an extent. The largest barrier to improvement in healthcare is a lack of unity in policies in each county. The Institute of Development Studies suggests testing innovations at the local level, encouraging learning from success, and gradually building institutions that support new ways of doing things. It suggests that analysts from other countries and officials in organizations supporting international health need to understand that approach if they are to strengthen mutual learning with their Chinese counterparts. Public opinion Though life expectancy in China has increased and infant mortality decreased since initial healthcare reform efforts, there is dissonance in quality of healthcare. Studies on public reception of the quality of China's healthcare in more rural Chinese provinces shows continued gaps in understanding between what is available in terms of medical care and affordability of healthcare.Lim, Meng-Kim, Yang, Hui, Zhang, Tuohong, Feng, Wen, and Zhou, Zijun. (2004). Public Perceptions Of Private Health Care In Socialist Chinajournal=Health Affairs, 6, 222-234. There continues to be a disparity between the quality of healthcare in rural and urban areas. Quality of care between private and publicly funded facilities differs, and private clinics are more frequented in some rural areas due to better service and treatment. In fact, a study by Lim, et al. showed that in the rural Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Shanxi, and Sichuan, 33% of rural citizens in these provinces utilize private clinics as opposed to governmentally funded hospitals. The study showed that it was not so much the availability and access to health care for citizens, as it was the quality of the public health care people were receiving that drove them to opt for private clinics instead. The continued lack of health insurance, especially in the majority of rural provinces (where 90% of people in these rural provinces lack health insurance) demonstrates a continued gap in health equality. Challenges Many minority groups are still facing challenges in gaining equality in healthcare access. Due to the 1980s health reform, there has been a general increase in government health subsidies, but even still, individual spending on health has also increased. A disparity in inequality between urban and rural areas persists, since much of recent government reform is focused on urban areas.Chen, Lanyan, and Standing, Hilary. (2007). Gender equity in transitional China's healthcare policy reforms. Feminist Economics, 189-212. Despite efforts by the NRCMS to combat this inequality, it is still difficult to provide universal healthcare to rural areas. To add to this rural inequality, much of the elderly population lives in rural areas and face even more difficulties in accessing healthcare, and remains uninsured. Like minority groups, health policy makers are also faced with challenges. First, a system that keeps basic wages low, but allows doctors to make money from prescriptions and investigations, leads to perverse incentives and inefficiency at all levels. Second, as in many other countries, to develop systems of health insurance and community financing which will allow coverage for most people is a huge challenge when the population is aging and treatments are becoming more sophisticated and expensive. This is true especially in China, with the demographic transition model encouraging a larger aging population with the one-child policy. Several different models have been developed across the country to attempt to address the problems, such as more recent, local, community-based programs.

Riegner was office manager of the WJC in Geneva. He was indirectly informed about the German plans for the final solution by German industrialist Eduard Schulte. Schulte informed Isidor Koppelmann (business associate), who informed Benjamin Sagalowitz (head of the press agency of the Union of Jewish Communities in Switzerland), who in turn informed Riegner. Through his British and American diplomatic channels (Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise of the American Jewish Congress in New York and Sydney Silverman, a Jewish Member of Parliament and Chairman of the British Section, World Jewish Congress) Riegner sent the following message to his contacts via the British Foreign Office and the State Department in Washington:\\"Riegner Telegram\\". United States Library of Congress. Original telegram. However, in England and the United States, Riegner's telegram was met with disbelief. The US State Department considered the telegram \\"a wild rumor, fueled by Jewish anxieties\\" while the British Foreign Office didn't forward the telegram for some time. Only on the 28 August 1942 did it find its way to the President of the World Jewish Congress, Rabbi Stephen Wise, who decided to not make it public.

The station is owned by Birach Broadcasting. Licensed to Peotone, Illinois and currently serving Chicago, it first began broadcasting in Zeeland, Michigan in 1990 under the WBMX call sign, serving Muskegon and Grand Rapids. The station has since been through a number of different formats and call signs, and changed market areas, which is rare for a station. 640 kilohertz is a United States clear-channel frequency, on which KFI in Los Angeles and KYUK in Bethel, Alaska are the dominant Class A stations. AM 640 was originally a MOR station in 1990 when it signed on as WBMX, using the call sign that had recently been vacated by a popular urban contemporary station in Chicago, Illinois. The following year, the owners of WROR-FM 98.5 in Boston, Massachusetts, bought the WBMX call letters from 640 in order to debut \\"Mix 98.5\\" there; in return, AM 640 received the WROR calls. Its format did not change. In 1993, WROR (AM) was sold and converted to Radio AAHS as WISZ, freeing the WROR calls to be used again in Boston, where they were again placed beginning in 1996. For a time, the station also played adult standards (Westwood One's AM Only) at night as a continuation of daytimer sister station WMJH 810 AM's format. Since WMJH was known at the time as \\"Majic 810,\\" WMFN's nighttime standards programming was called \\"Night Majic.\\" In 1995 am 640 became WMFN, taking a sports format branded \\"West Michigan's Fan\\". During its sports talk days former NFL linebacker Ray Bentley hosted an afternoon program. In 1999 WMFN adopted a Business News format branded \\"West Michigan's Financial News\\". Starting in 2000 WMFN evolved into a News Talk Sports format eventually becoming \\"Hot Talk 640\\". In 2005 WMFN's talk format was dropped in favor of an Adult Urban Contemporary format branded \\"Smooth Vibes AM 640\\".WMFN AM 640 Zeeland/Grand Rapids Michiguide.com. Accessed June 7, 2010 WMFN logo, during the period when the station was programmed by Tyrone Bynum, 2006-2008. From about 2006 until November 2008, the station was leased to Tyrone Bynum, a controversial talk show host and deejay who hosted many of his programs on this station, which went under the name \\"Smooth Vibes\\"; during periods when there was no talk programming, Bynum (or his staffers) would play Urban Adult Contemporary music. In November 2008, due to low advertising revenues, Bynum opted not to renew his lease with Birach; on November 7, 2008, the station began carrying Regional Mexican programming, moved from WMJH. Bynum soon relaunched \\"Smooth Vibes\\" as an online-only station free from music licensing fees. As \\"La Poderosa,\\" the station became the exclusive Regional Mexican station in West Michigan, as former competitor stations WYGR and WNWZ have switched to other formats. The \\"Poderosa\\" format has since moved back to WMJH, which has also launched an FM translator at 93.3. At that time, WMFN became Radio Activa. In 2014, the FCC allowed the station to be moved to south of Chicago, to be licensed to the town of Peotone, Illinois.http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/129275/fcc-approves- move-of-new-birach-am-closer-to-chicahttp://transition.fcc.gov/fcc- bin/amq?list=0&facid;=55089 The station aired a Spanish Contemporary format.

WMJH programming is available around the clock on FM translator W227CG 93.3 FM, licensed to Grand Rapids. History AM 810 began operations in 1965 as WJPW and featured a MOR/adult contemporary music format for many years. In 1991 the station was sold and the calls were changed to WBYY. During this time the stations studios were moved from Rockford to 29th Street in Grand Rapids. AM Stereo was also added during this time. In 1996 the stations calls were changed again and from 1996 to 2004, WMJH was known as \\"Magic 810,\\" airing a satellite-fed Adult Standards format from Westwood One. \\"Magic 810,\\" which also broadcast in AM stereo for a time, had a loyal audience and respectable ratings for an AM daytimer, but was chiefly popular with listeners aged 55 and older, which led Birach to switch the station's format to brokered Spanish programming, under the name \\"La Poderosa\\" (Spanish for \\"the powerful one\\") using the slogan \\"Con Sentimiento Mexicano\\". On November 7, 2008, the \\"La Poderosa\\" programming and format moved to WMFN AM 640, after that station's prior leasee, Tyrone Bynum, vacated the station, which, at that point, WMJH retooled its format to lean more towards Spanish-language Adult Contemporary.

Members The members, all sympathisers of the volkstaat idea, were: Johann Wingard, a retired industrialist and chairman of the council, Dirk Viljoen, a town planner (vice-chairman), Anna Boshoff, daughter of Hendrik Verwoerd, her son Carel, the nuclear scientist Wally Grant, Chris de Jager, Mars de Klerk and Hercules Booysen, three jurists, Ernest Pienaar, former general in the South African Defence Force, \\"Natie\\" Luyt, Piet Liebenberg, Chris Jooste and Pikkie Robbertze, four academics, Koos Reyneke, an architect, Douw Steyn, a senior member of the civil defence system, Herman Vercueil from the Transvaalse Landbou-unie, Kobus Visser, a former head of the Criminal Investigation Department, Flip Buys, an executive of the trade union Solidariteit, Duncan du Bois, a local politician in Durban and Riaan Visagie, a teacher. History The Volkstaat Council was created by the South African government, via the Volkstaat Council Act in 1994. This was in accordance with sections 184A and 184B of the 1993 South African Constitution, which state: \\"The Council shall serve as a constitutional mechanism to enable proponents of the idea of a Volkstaat to constitutionally pursue the establishment of such a Volkstaat‚Ä¶\\". The council's funding was terminated in 1999, without the council being formally disbanded. The council produced a final report, making three key recommendations: #That areas with an Afrikaner majority should enjoy \\"territorial self- determination\\". Areas identified included the region around Pretoria, and a region of the Northern Cape Province. #That the government establish an \\"Afrikaner Council\\", as an advisory board to the government. \\"Representation in parliament, where numerical power is all that mattered, was not seen as a democratic system for minorities.\\" #That the government create legislation enacting the other two points. Draft legislation for the Afrikaner Council was provided. The provisions in the constitution allowing for formation of the council were removed in 2001, by the Repeal of Volkstaat Council Provisions Act, in accordance with the original act. Aftermath Johann Wingard, chair of the council, expressed the view in 2005 that he doubted if any government official ever opened any of the reports to read them. Additionally, he stated that only a \\"civil war\\" would ever enable Afrikaners to gain independence in any part of South Africa. The opposite is suggested, however, by the fact that then deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, and then Minister of Home Affairs, Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, quoted figures from Volkstaat Council reports in a report to parliament in 1999. Nelson Mandela, the president at the time, specially requested that the delivery of the report be delayed until he could attend its presentation personally. Subsequent to the disbanding of the Volkstaat Council, the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities was established in 2003. This committee is charged with the protection of the rights to cultural identity of all self-identifying groups in South Africa, including Afrikaners. The committee includes an Afrikaner, JCH Landman, who is also a member of the Afrikaner Alliance. The reports from the Volkstaat Council were to be handed over to this committee. The ANC government formalised their stance on the issue in 1998-1999, when they declared that they would not support a Volkstaat, but would do everything they could to ensure the protection of the Afrikaner language and culture, along with the other minority cultures in the country.

He acquired a reputation in that region for his enterprise, daring, and personality. Evans was born in the Dakotas and came to the Cariboo as a boy. His nickname derives from the curly, dark hair of his youth (\\"a mass of raven locks\\"), although later in life he was balding. His freighting career spanned the age from jerk-line times on the Cariboo Road to bush piloting, instructed by no less than Ginger Coote, who pioneered flying in the Bridge River and Fort St. James areas of BC. Around 1910, Evans was employed by the BC Express Company (formerly Barnard's Express) out of Ashcroft, British Columbia. He was also, like many others in this region, a cowboy as well as a miner. As gold extraction began to boom into the Bridge River Goldfields, Evans was one of the many who started freighting operations to supply the mines and prospectors in that area and earned a reputation for reliability in delivering freight despite all obstacles, including floods, mountain slides and blizzards. With the development of a proper road into the Upper Bridge River from Shalalth on Seton Lake, Evans expanded his personal operation into a fleet of trucks and passenger vehicles, eventually becoming the owner of one of the largest transportation firms in the BC Interior, most of its business derived from Bralorne Mine and other Bridge River mining camps, and also from the construction of the Bridge River Power Project. Although never seen to fruition, Evans intended his company to expand into air freight.

Gameplay The player is the pilot of a spacecraft, set during a period of early space colonization. There are 64 star systems to explore, presented in a rotating top-down 2D view. Each system has a starbase ‚Äì which issues missions, receives supplies from the player, and sells various ship add-ons ‚Äì a sun that presents a navigation hazard due to its high temperature, and one or more orbiting planets. The player can navigate his ship onto a planet's surface through a warp hole (and a tunnel-maneuvering subgame). Once there, three different supplies can be collected in a first- person flight subgame. The three supplies ‚Äì people, minerals and radioactives ‚Äì are then made available for pick-up in the main playing area and can be transferred back to the starbase. Players must also defend themselves from constant attacks from enemy alien ships. Adjacent star systems can be flown to through an asteroid field (represented by square blocks). Eventually, the player is able to create a vaccine to combat a plague, which destroys systems 200 stardays from infection. The player can eventually purchase better ships and starbases to form their own empire. The last task of the game is to deploy a defence shield network to secure the player's empire from invaders. Critical reaction The game's retro sci-fi graphics have drawn comparisons with Flash Gordon and Asteroids, but games magazines noted that underlying this is a complex game, similar to Elite, requiring a varied range of skills.

The station can be received across all of West-Michigan and as far east as Alma, St. Johns, and Northwest Lansing, with reception also possible in Eastern Wisconsin across Lake Michigan, especially in Sheboygan and Ozaukee Counties; a short-spaced allocation and higher power means that the Brookfield-licensed WNRG-FM has a much smaller coverage area than most Milwaukee stations due to the heritage of the 106.9 signal in Muskegon. WSAE 106.9 \\"Home FM\\" in Spring Arbor, Michigan tends to overpower the frequency across south-west lower Michigan. Since switching from stereo to monaural broadcasting, 106.9 FM can now be heard over a slightly larger coverage area than previously. WOOD-FM originally began broadcasting as WMUS-FM in 1947 at 100.5 on the FM dial; it was Muskegon's first FM station and came on the air just a few months after its AM sister, WMUS. By 1950, WMUS-FM had gone dark, but the station was revived in November 1962 at its current frequency of 106.9 MHz and a power of 2,850 watts (gradually increased to the current 50,000 watts over the years). WMUS-FM's original programming consisted of a simulcast of its AM sister. In 1965, WMUS 1090 changed format from middle of the road music to country as \\"Top Gun Radio.\\" Rather than continue to simulcast, WMUS- FM separated programming and adopted the new call sign WFFM. In a \\"storecast\\" arrangement with Hasper's, a local grocery-store chain, WFFM aired instrumental easy listening music in monaural sound, interspersed with promotional announcements about Hasper's. The WMUS-FM call letters returned to 106.9 in 1970 and the station resumed its simulcast of the AM's country format. FM stereo broadcasting was added in 1975. Eventually the AM and FM signals switched roles, with the 50,000-watt stereo FM signal becoming the primary station and AM 1090 becoming the simulcast. The simulcast ended in April 2001 when AM 1090 changed to a news/talk format, eventually taking the calls WKBZ (which one belonged to one of WMUS' biggest competitor stations). At Noon on January 5, 2011, WMUS-FM became WOOD-FM. WOOD-FM is now an FM simulcaster for sister station WOOD 1300 in Grand Rapids, Michigan and now broadcasts in mono. At the same time the WMUS calls and format were moved to 107.9 FM. It acts primarily to fill in gaps in the AM station's nighttime signal.

The river is only long. It takes its source from the foothills of Vitosha, runs through Sofia's South Park, separates the two lanes of Evlogi Georgiev Boulevard, runs through the neighbourhood Poduyane, and finally flows into the Iskar River. The well-known Orlov Most is built over this river.  Geographical characteristics  Perlovska springs from the villa zone of Dragalevtsi, crosses the Ring Road, connects the new neighborhoods, parallel to Bulgaria Boulevard, and then crosses the South Park. Under the Bulgaria Boulevard, the Boyana River flows into it and both go out into the open at Evlogi and Hristo Georgievi Blvd. From there Perlovska becomes a canal. In the city the course of the river is completely corrected, in places underground. It flows to the left into the Iskar River at 513 m above sea level, 1.2 km northeast of the Obradov Monastery. Other interpretations of the name \\"Pearl River\\" are also widespread. For example, on a map made in GIS Sofia, the Perlovska River includes the Boyana River as its initial part, but does not include the river flowing through the South Park (the map does not indicate the name of the river in question, but in many other sources it is called Drenovichka). The Perlovska River is one of the few small and short rivers that pass through Sofia. It crosses the city along the capital's Evlogi Georgiev Boulevard. A famous landmark of the Perlovska River is the Eagle Bridge, where Tsarigradsko Shosse begins. The river is also the northern border of Lozenets. The Perlovska River also crosses one of the largest parks in Sofia - the South Park. In the colloquial language of the people of Sofia, the river is also known as the \\"canal\\", which is reflected in derivative names such as the Small City Theater \\"Behind the canal\\".  Hydrological data  The catchment area of the river is 257 km¬≤, which represents 3.0% of the catchment area of the Iskar River. The largest tributary is the Vladayska River (left). The maximum outflow is in the months of April-June, due to the snowmelt in Vitosha, and the minimum - August-October. Formally, the river is the fourth largest (high water) tributary of the Iskar River (after Malki Iskar, Lesnovska and Iskretska rivers), into which it flows after receiving the waters of the Boyanska, Slatinska and Vladayska rivers.

The film is based on the 1959 novel The Final Diagnosis by Arthur Hailey. Ronald Reagan was the narrator in the film.  Plot  David Coleman (Ben Gazzara) is a young doctor hired by a hospital's pathology department. The head of the department, Dr. Joseph Pearson (Fredric March), sees Coleman as a rival, and they fight over many medical issues. Coleman falls in love with Cathy Hunt (Ina Balin), a student nurse at the hospital, who develops a tumor in her knee. Pearson believes that the tumor is malignant and that the leg should be amputated, but Coleman disagrees. Coleman orders three blood tests on Mrs. Alexander (Phyllis Love), an expectant mother whose baby may have hemolytic disease, but Pearson believes that the tests are excessive and cancels the third test. Mrs. Alexander is married to a young intern at the hospital (Dick Clark), who, along with Coleman, tried to push for the third test.

The Market is a regular event from March to December at which local designers and artisans can sell their creations directly to the public. It was established in August 2006 by Carlie Smith, a graduate of the University of Victoria who, after living in London, England for two years, wanted to bring the European style market atmosphere to her home town. Carlie envisioned a regular event that would raise the profile of local designers and artisans as well as be a regular outdoor community event.  Location  Originally held at the Plaza of Nations, Portobello West relocated to the Rocky Mountaineer Station in November 2006 as a result of the Plaza's closure. It currently takes place at Creekside Community Centre (1 Athlete's Way, Vancouver) in the Olympic Village/False Creek area.  Data  The inaugural market was attended by some 3,000 shoppers and had 92 vendors selling local fashion and art products. Since then the average attendance has been 1,100 shoppers and 120 vendors (not including food and drink vendors). In November 2006, the Market suffered a drop in attendance as a result of a last minute change of location from the Plaza of Nations to the Rocky Mountaineer Station and a sudden snowfall on the market day. The attendance improved again for the first ever Holiday Market on the second Sunday of December 2006. Portobello West has only ever had one January Market and one February Market, both in 2007. After consultation with local artists and designers and the general public, the January and February Markets were determined to be unpopular, predominantly as a result of the consistently inclement weather in the region during those months. In 2008 the Market introduced a two-day season opener on the last weekend of March and a two-day Holiday Season Market on the second weekend of December, with both events drawing nearly 3,000 shoppers across both days. In 2009 the Market added another two-day Market at the end of November, expanding the Holiday Season Markets to 4 days. Portobello West has no Olympic Markets planned for February 2010.  Trivia  The name 'Portobello West' was suggested by Carlie's father, Grant 'Fuzzy' Smith, as a reference to the famous Portobello Road market in London, England and also to the location of the new market (in Western Canada). Commonly referred to as 'The Market' and 'Portobello'. In 2008, Portobello West stopped using paper applications, transferring all application processes to a web-based system. In 2009, Carlie Smith took the concept of Portobello West to Toronto, Canada and established Portobello East (renamed for its more Eastern location).

Although little of Amino's work has been published in the West, Japanese writers and historians of Japan regard Amino as one of the most important Japanese historians of the twentieth century.Sakurai, Eiji. \\"Foreword to 'Medieval Japanese Constructions of Peace and Liberty: Muen, Kugai, and Raku\\". International Journal of Asian Studies 4 (1). 2007Souyri, Pierre F. \\"Yoshihiko Amino\\" Le Monde. Mar. 4, 2004. LeMonde.fr.

Amino Yoshihiko, Rethinking Japanese History, translated by Alan S. Christy (Ann Arbor: Center for Japanese Studies, University of Michigan, 2012) . Biography Born in Yamanashi Prefecture in 1928, Amino received a high school education in Tokyo. Amino studied under the Marxist historian Ishimoda Sh≈ç (; 1912‚Äì1986) at the University of Tokyo, where he first became involved in both Marxist historiography and the student movement during the early postwar period. Following graduation, Amino taught for several years at the high school level, beginning his career as a university professor at Nagoya University in 1956 as an assistant professor before taking up a post at Kanagawa University in 1980 as a professor of the university's Junior College and a Kanagawa Research Fellow, exchanging a more prestigious teaching position at a national university for the opportunity to devote more energy to research and publication. There, with his colleague, the anthropologist Miyata Noboru (ÂÆÆÁî∞ Áôª; 1936‚Äì2000), he ran an interdisciplinary seminar at the newly founded Institute for the Study of Japanese Folklore (Êó•Êú¨Â∏∏Ê∞ëÊñáÂåñÁ†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) established in 1982. Although Amino continued in his capacity as a writer until his death, he retired from both institutional teaching and research in 1998. Amino began his career researching the lifestyles of out-of- the way villagers and marginalized non-urbanized Japanese. His scrupulous examination of primary sources enabled him to reconstruct the outlooks of a variety of non-agrarian peasant communities that shared little in common with the image of \\"the Japanese\\" constructed by scholarship and nationalist historians. He arrived at the conclusion that medieval Japan was neither a single culturally nor socially integrated state, but rather a mosaic of quite distinct societies, some of which knew nothing, for example, about the Japanese emperor. From these beginnings he undertook, especially in the last three decades of his life, an extensive rewriting of the common orthodoxies about Japanese history and Japanese society, which had exercised a powerful hegemony over academics and their national audience since the Meiji period. In this sense, he became one of the great academic deconstructors of the premises and mythology of the nihonjinron. He died of lung cancer on February 27, 2004, aged 76. Legacy and Influence A prolific historian, Amino produced a published output of at least 486 known titles‚Äìranging from newspaper and magazine interviews and articles, book reviews, dialogues, round-table discussions, and other publications to several hundred original articles and over twenty books that were either monographs or essay collections and several multiple-volume series on historical and ethnographic themes. Wesleyan University Professor of History William Johnston writes that \\"a complete introduction to the Amino oeuvre would probably require its own book.\\" Simultaneously, Johnston writes that > Despite his prolific output and stature in Japan, only a handful of papers > and only one book (although even that remains unpublished) by Amino have > been translated in the English language. As a leading scholar of early > modern Japan once told me, everybody talks about Muen, kugai, raku, one of > Amino‚Äôs most important books, but few have read it.

One is that much of it has a highly > specialized focus on medieval Japan, and another is the context in which his > work is read. Many of his essays and monographs focus like a micro laser on > the minutiae of landholding patterns, forms of taxation, local power > relations, changes in legal codes, the reading and interpretation of > documents, and similar specialized topics, and as a consequence even in > Japan only specialists find them compelling reading.

Finally, > although much of his work would certainly be of interest to students and > scholars of Japanese history outside Japan, the shortage of translations > remains an obstacle.

Hibees won't rush hot- shot, Edinburgh Evening News, 2 September 2006. Gray was signed by Hibernian after failing to gain a senior contract with Newcastle, and was a prolific scorer for the Hibs youth and reserve sides. He made his Hibernian debut as a late substitute in the 2007 Scottish Cup semi-final against Dunfermline in April 2007. Later that month, he netted his first goal in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Aberdeen. He failed to win a regular place in the Hibs first team, however, and was loaned out twice to Partick Thistle. Gray was released by Hibs in May 2009, at the end of his contract.Hibs braced for more player bids, BBC Sport, 21 May 2009. = Loans to Partick Thistle = Gray was loaned to First Division club Partick Thistle in early 2008, where he stayed for the rest of the season.

He also scored a notable goal in the Scottish Cup quarter-final against Rangers at Ibrox Stadium, helping Thistle to a 1‚Äì1 draw. Gray returned to Partick Thistle for a second loan spell in July 2008. He scored on his second debut for Thistle in a Challenge Cup win against Queen's Park.  Berwick Rangers  After his release by Hibernian, Gray went on trial with St Mirren, but he did not earn a contract from the SPL club. In late July 2009, Gray signed for Third Division club Berwick Rangers. The pairing of Berwick and Civil Service Strollers in the 2009‚Äì10 Scottish Cup meant that Gray returned to the ground where he regularly trained while he was with Hibs.

Otherwise the quadratic form is anisotropic. More precisely, if q is a quadratic form on a vector space V over F, then a non-zero vector v in V is said to be isotropic if . A quadratic form is isotropic if and only if there exists a non-zero isotropic vector (or null vector) for that quadratic form. Suppose that is quadratic space and W is a subspace. Then W is called an isotropic subspace' of V if some vector in it is isotropic, a totally isotropic subspace if all vectors in it are isotropic, and an anisotropic subspace if it does not contain any (non-zero) isotropic vectors. The ' of a quadratic space is the maximum of the dimensions of the totally isotropic subspaces. A quadratic form q on a finite-dimensional real vector space V is anisotropic if and only if q is a definite form: :* either q is positive definite, i.e. for all non-zero v in V ; :* or q is negative definite, i.e. for all non-zero v in V. More generally, if the quadratic form is non-degenerate and has the signature , then its isotropy index is the minimum of a and b. Hyperbolic plane Let F be a field of characteristic not 2 and . If we consider the general element of V, then the quadratic forms and are equivalent since there is a linear transformation on V that makes q look like r, and vice versa. Evidently, and are isotropic. This example is called the hyperbolic plane in the theory of quadratic forms. A common instance has F = real numbers in which case and are hyperbolas. In particular, is the unit hyperbola. The notation has been used by Milnor and Husemoller for the hyperbolic plane as the signs of the terms of the bivariate polynomial r are exhibited. The affine hyperbolic plane was described by Emil Artin as a quadratic space with basis satisfying , where the products represent the quadratic form.Emil Artin (1957) Geometric Algebra, page 119 Through the polarization identity the quadratic form is related to a symmetric bilinear form . Two vectors u and v are orthogonal when . In the case of the hyperbolic plane, such u and v are hyperbolic-orthogonal. Split quadratic space A space with quadratic form is split (or metabolic) if there is a subspace which is equal to its own orthogonal complement; equivalently, the index of isotropy is equal to half the dimension. The hyperbolic plane is an example, and over a field of characteristic not equal to 2, every split space is a direct sum of hyperbolic planes.  Relation with classification of quadratic forms  From the point of view of classification of quadratic forms, anisotropic spaces are the basic building blocks for quadratic spaces of arbitrary dimensions. For a general field F, classification of anisotropic quadratic forms is a nontrivial problem. By contrast, the isotropic forms are usually much easier to handle. By Witt's decomposition theorem, every inner product space over a field is an orthogonal direct sum of a split space and an anisotropic space. Field theory * If F is an algebraically closed field, for example, the field of complex numbers, and is a quadratic space of dimension at least two, then it is isotropic. * If F is a finite field and is a quadratic space of dimension at least three, then it is isotropic (this is a consequence of the Chevalley‚ÄìWarning theorem). * If F is the field Qp of p-adic numbers and is a quadratic space of dimension at least five, then it is isotropic.

History The company began trading as Vivid in the late 1990s, but was established as Birmingham Centre for Media Arts in 1992, when TURC Video amalgamated with the community arts organisation Wide Angle. The conjunction of the two entities created a hybrid resource unique in Birmingham: a film, video and photography workshop creating community access to what at the time was the dominant means of visual communications. Popularly known in the 1990s as BCMA, the centre adopted the name Vivid following a re-location to The Big Peg in Birmingham's jewellery quarter and began several years of digital image making, digital video training and artist development. From 2000 Vivid concentrated on developing contemporary new media and artist moving image through production, commissioning, exhibition and event programmes.

Biography Schopper was born in Lan≈°kroun, Bohemia, to a family of Austrian descent. He obtained his diploma and doctorate from the University of Hamburg studying under Wilhelm Lenz and Rudolf Fleischmann. In 1950-51 he was a research assistant with Lise Meitner at Stockholm and in 1956-57 at the Cavendish Laboratory under Otto Robert Frisch. During these fellowships, Schopper worked on nuclear physics and contributed substantially to the evidence of parity violation in weak interactions. He measured the circular polarization of gamma rays following a beta decay, thought unfeasible by Lee and Yang, and showed in the same experiment that the helicities of neutrino and antineutrino are opposite. Later, he was involved in an experiment to test time reversal symmetry. In 1956, he followed Fleischmann to the University of Erlangen where he continued to do research in optics and solid-state physics, with emphasis on thin metal layers, which he had started at Hamburg. Also he developed, along with Clausnitzer, the first source of polarised protons. In 1957 he became Privatdozent at the University of Erlangen. From 1958 to 1961, Schopper was an associate professor at the University of Mainz where he established the Institute for Experimental Nuclear Physics. In 1960-61 he worked under Robert R. Wilson at Cornell University to be introduced to elementary particle physics, namely the use of electron scattering to study the structure of the proton and neutron. Schopper was appointed Professor at the University of Karlsruhe in 1961 and Director of the newly established Institutes for Experimental Nuclear Physics of TH Karlsruhe and the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Centre. In order to continue his research on electron scattering he set up a group to carry out one of the first experiments at DESY. He also created a group at CERN to investigate neutron scattering at high energies at the Proton Synchrotron (PS) and Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR). These experiments where then continued at the Institute for High Energy Physics (IHEP) in Serpukhov, Russia. The group made important contributions to the study of neutron-proton and neutron-nuclei scattering cross sections. For this purpose, the first hadron calorimeter was developed and optimised by Monte Carlo simulations. Another group at Karlsruhe developed the first superconducting high frequency cavities in Europe, a technology which was transferred to CERN for particle separators and later for particle acceleration at LEP. At CERN, he was a research associate in 1966‚Äì67, became division leader of the Nuclear Physics Division in 1970, member of the directorate responsible for the co-ordination of the experimental programme until 1973 and chairman of the ISR Committee from 1973 to 1976. In 1973 Schopper became professor at the University of Hamburg and the chairman of the directorate of DESY, serving until end of 1980. He was responsible for the installation of the ARGUS detector at DORIS which later resulted in the first evidence of B ‚Äì B bar mixing. Also, by establishing HASYLAB at DORIS synchrotron light science became an important branch of research at DESY. He proposed and completed the construction of the electron-positron collider PETRA which led to the discovery and study of the gluon. During his mandate, DESY, a national laboratory became as far as science was concerned an international particle physics laboratory. This included the start of the first collaboration with China. From 1977 to 1979, Schopper was Chairman of the Association of the German Large Research Centres (now Helmholtz Association) and member of various advisory bodies of the Federal Ministry of Research, the Deutsche Forschungs Gemeinschaft and the Max Planck Society. After being member of the Scientific Policy Committee at CERN, Schopper was elected Director General and served from 1981 to 1988. His first task was to unite the two CERN laboratories existing at that time under two Directors General. The Large Electron‚ÄìPositron Collider (LEP) was also proposed and constructed under his leadership. This facility allowed the verification of the standard model of particle physics, namely that it is a renormalizable field theory, leading to the award of the Nobel Prize to the theoreticians Veltman and t‚ÄôHooft. Furthermore, it enabled the precise determination of fundamental parameters of the electroweak force, such as the W¬± and Z masses, and proved the existence of three neutrino families. Thus, this particle accelerator transformed high energy physics into a field of precision measurements and provided estimates to the mass of the top quark, Higgs boson and other supersymmetric and hypothetical particles. LEP was approved under the condition of a reduced and constant budget with the consequence that some unique activities at CERN (e.g. ISR) had to be abandoned. Schopper was obliged to introduce a new way of international collaboration for the four LEP experiments since CERN could not provide funds for them. The experiments became rather independent activities organised in a rather democratic way bringing together hundreds of scientists from many universities and national organisations. The LEP experiments became a model for the later LHC experiments, shaping the way this organization works today. He contributed to the globalisation of research at CERN and was also responsible for the return of Spain and Portugal in the CERN‚Äôs member states. Schopper is professor emeritus at the University of Hamburg since 1989. From 1992 to 1994 he was president of the German Physical Society and president of the European Physical Society in 1995-97. For many years he was member of the scientific council of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and of the board of trustees of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Garching. At UNESCO, he served as member of the Physics Action Council and chairman of the Working Group on Large Facilities, president of the scientific council of the Regional Office for Science and Technology ROSTE of UNESCO in Venice (2001-2002) and in 2003-2009 he was the chairman of the international advisory committee for the International Basic Science Programs. Schopper‚Äôs vision of science without borders resulted in him becoming a founding father of SESAME, the laboratory for Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East, which provides an extremely bright light source to investigate a broad range of domains from condensed matter to biology and archeology. In 1999-2008 he became President of the Preliminary International Council and later, after the formal foundation of SESAME, of the International Council. Without his dedication this international research facility would probably not have been built. SESAME was founded analogous to CERN, under the umbrella of UNESCO, with presently nine member states: Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority and Turkey. It provides an environment where countries with different political systems, traditions, religions and mentalities are able to work together peacefully. Schopper is a Founding member of The Cyprus Institute at Nicosia, Cyprus, and since 2000 Member of the Board of Trustees and was Chairman of the Scientific Council and Member of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees of the Cyprus Institute. Currently, he works as an advisor and goodwill ambassador on science for peace. He writes articles about research policy, science and religion and also science and society. Honours and awards=Honorary academic degrees Schopper received honorary doctoral degrees from: University of Erlangen, Moscow State University, University of Geneva, University of London, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna), Institute for High Energy Physics (Protvino) and The Cyprus Institute (Nicosia).

Both Gregory and Nonna came from wealthy families, and Gregory was able to personally finance the construction of a church in the region.

One daughter, Saint Gorgonia outlived her parents by only a year, and was lauded in the eulogy given by her brother as a model Christian wife. Their younger son, Caesarius of Nazianzus, studied in Caesarea Mazaca and at Alexandria and became a physician.

It was founded in 1921 on the site of the former Kaiserliche Werft Danzig that had been closed after World War I.  History  After the World War I ended, Danzig was turned into a free city under indirect control of the League of Nations. While technically an independent state, Danzig was also subject to Treaty of Versailles, other post-war arrangements and demilitarisation of Germany. Because of that, in 1919 former Kaiserliche Werft was banned from producing military vessels. Pending further decisions of the victorious Entente with regards to German arms industry, in October 1919 the new German government officially donated the shipyard and all of its assets to the city of Danzig. The new owners were also forced to scrap the final 33 U-boats still on slips in 1918. However, as the company lost both its main client (the Kaiserliche Marine) and its raison d'etre, in 1922 it had to be commercialised. It was turned into a joint stock company, with 30% shares held by French Groupement Industriel pour Danzig conglomerate, 30% by British Cravens company, and remaining 40% by local Danziger Privat Aktienbank and Polish Bank Handlowy (20% each). The new company used the name of \\"International Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Limited\\", but was most commonly referred to by its simplified German name: Danziger Werft (\\"Danzig Shipyard\\"). Although the shipyard was equipped with facilities for construction of ships up to of length, initially the market was overflowing with demobilised vessels of the warring nations. One of the first clients of the new company was Poland who ordered four large river monitors in 1920, shortly before Danzig was officially demilitarised. The four units were completed, but no further orders for large ships followed. Until the end of the 1920s the shipyard was working well below capacity, mostly on small merchant ships, tugs and motor boats. By the end of the decade some larger merchant vessels were ordered, but the orders soon plummeted due to the Great Depression. It was not until the late 1930s when the shipyard finally recovered from the post-war crisis. New toolshop was built, along with new boiler plant, compressed air workshop, compressor plant and a new slip for vessels of up to of length. License production of MAN ship engines was also started. Following the outbreak of World War II and the German takeover of Danzig, the shipyard was taken over by Nazi authorities, initially informally, and officially on 30 August 1940. The new company, this time officially known as \\"Danziger Werft AG\\" concentrated its activities on the construction of the Type VII U-boats for the Kriegsmarine. After World War II the Danziger Werft, which was considerably damaged by bombing raids, was mostly dismantled by the Soviet Union. Eventually the shipyard was taken over by Polish government and merged with the nearby Schichau-Werke shipyard under the name of Stocznia Gda≈Ñska. Since 1990 named Stocznia Gda≈Ñsk Sp√≥≈Çka Akcyjna or Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard it is still in existence today as the greatest Polish shipyard.

The future metropolitan undertook a year of study towards a medical degree at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, but elected in 1960 to switch to divinity studies. He transferred to the St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute in Paris, simultaneously pursuing studies at the University of Paris. He was awarded the degree of Master of Theology from St. Sergius and the degree of lector from the university. Charalambides was ordained to the diaconate on 6 January 1963 and to the priesthood on 17 November 1968 for service in the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of France. He was appointed in 1972 as protosyngellos (i.e., episcopal vicar) for the southern region of France, with his base in Nice. Fr. Stephanos was consecrated on 25 March 1987 to the episcopacy with the titular title of Bishop of Nazianzus. While continuing his previous responsibilities, he took on new assignments: secretary of the Assembly of Orthodox Bishops of France, lector at St. Sergius, and professor of patrology at the Roman Catholic seminary of Nice. In 1996, the Ecumenical Patriarchate restored the Estonian Orthodox Church as an autonomous entity under its protection, following the independence of Estonia from the Soviet Union.

The station operates on the FM radio frequency of 98.7 MHz, FM channel 254. . The studios are located at 3575 McCarty Lane in Lafayette, Indiana. The tower is located on South 30th Street in Lafayette, Indiana. History WASK-FM signed on the air in late 1992 as WIIZ, 98.7 The Wizard, featuring an Adult album alternative or Triple A format. The original owners, Wizard Broadcasting, called the station a clone of Chicago's WXRT, which featured similar programming. The station had a loyal following during its short existence. However, due to the station being a standalone FM and given the fact that this was immediately before the modern rock revolution of the mid- to late-1990s, the station went bankrupt and shut down. In 1994, WASK, Inc., owners of country music outlet, WASK-FM (K105) and news/talk station WASK (1450) acquired the defunct station and returned it to the air. Initially WIIZ, went back on the air with alternative rock, but in March 1995, the station acquired 105.3's WASK-FM calls and became a news/talk simulcast of the company's AM 1450. The Newstalk WASK simulcast was a success for 98.7, featuring high-profile national personalities such as Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy, then-rising syndicated \\"hot talk\\" personality Tom Leykis as well as local morning (Don Pratt) and afternoon drive (Ski Anderson/Jim Walsh)programs. In fact, the simulcast garnered the highest ratings in the United States for the FM \\"Hot Talk\\" format under programmer Keith Harris and consultant Doug Silver. WASK also featured high school and professional sports on the weekends with 1970s and 1980s classic hits music filling the other weekend dayparts. Despite a successful run as a news/talk station, WASK dropped the format in September 1997 citing expense as the main reason for the switch. The format was changed to oldies and \\"Kool AM & FM\\" premiered, featuring music from the 1950s through the 1970s. Within a year, the name was changed again to \\"Kool Oldies WASK\\" and programming was streamlined to mainly late 1950s through early 1970s pop hits. In 2003, WASK-AM-FM changed their name yet again to simply \\"Oldies 98.7 WASK.\\" In 2006, after over a 10-year run simulcasting with AM 1450, the two stations officially split programming. 1450 WASK would become an ESPN Radio affiliate as \\"ESPN 1450\\" becoming Lafayette's only AM commercial station running an independent format for over 4 years. WASK-FM changed its positioning statement from mentioning Oldies to \\"The Super Hits Of The 60s and 70s\\". WASK-FM currently positions itself as \\"Lafayette's Listen at Work Station\\" and carries Indianapolis Colts football. Schurz Communications announced on September 14, 2015 that it would exit broadcasting and sell its television and radio stations, including WASK-FM, to Gray Television for $442.5 million.

Tendu patta collection prices were increased. Government took a major step away from shiksha-karmi (temporary teacher) policy and vacancy for posts of 15,000 permanent teachers was announced. Naxal attack in April 2019, which claimed five lives including one opposition MLA Bhima Mandavi, shocked the government. Welfare schemes=Narva, Garva, Ghurva, Bari  Bhupesh Baghel is the architect of this innovative scheme. The objective of this scheme is to revive the agricultural economy by striking a balance between modernity and traditions. The scheme has been launched to ensure water conservation, livestock protection and development, use of organic compost through household waste and cultivation of fruits and vegetables in backyards for self consumption and earning additional income. Mukhyamantri Suposhan Yojna CM Bhupesh Baghel inaugurates Nutrition Campaign by feeding banana to young child with his own hands. National Health Family Survey (NHFS)- 4 (2015-16), Chhattisgarh is one of the top states in India with high level of malnutrition and anemia among children and women. The scheme launched on 2 October 2019 on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs 150 birth anniversary aims to turn Chhattisgarh into malnutrition and anemia free state in the next three years. Upliftment of tribals=Repatriation of tribal land Under an MoU signed between the then govt and Tata Steel in 2005, agricultural land was acquired from the local tribals 10 villages around Lohandiguda in Bastar region. Despite protests from the villagers, the govt went ahead with the acquisition to build a 5.5 million tonne per annum capacity mega integrated steel plant. Tata Steel decided to quit the project in 2016. Immediately after coming to power, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel took a decision to return 4400 acres of the land to 1707 tribal families. The land was returned to the immediate owners or their legal heirs as per the provisions of the 'Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 under the Section 101. Section 101 stipulates that if any land acquired remains underutilized for a period of 5 years from the date of taking over the possession the same shall be returned to the original owners of their legal heirs. Campaigns=Malaria Mukt Bastar Malaria is a major public health concerns in India and major contributor to the malaria burden in South East Asia. Several factors contribute to the prevalence and incidences including socio-economic factors, geographical region, drug resistance. Bastar region of the state of Chhattisgarh has the highest Annual Parasite Incidence (API) (malaria) in India. Timely diagnosis due to limited infrastructure compounds the problem. Launching the ‚ÄúMalaria Mukt Bastar‚Äù on 26 January 2020, the Chief Minister, Bhupesh Baghel pledged to make Bastar Malaria free in the coming days. In the first phase of the campaign, 14 lakh people were tested in Bastar, out of which 64,646 (4.60 percent) were found malaria infected. The second phase of the campaign started on 6 June and ended 31 July in which more than 23 lakh people have been examined. The process of medication of the victims has started.

Life and career  Born 17 July 1890 in Southampton, Hampshire, England, UK, Stanley Ridges became a prot√©g√© of Beatrice Lillie, a star of musical stage comedies, and spent many years learning and honing his craft on the stage. Eventually making his way to America, Ridges began as a song-and-dance man on Broadway, but later turned to dramatic roles onstage, appearing in such plays as Maxwell Anderson's Mary of Scotland (as Lord Morton) and Valley Forge (as Lieutenant Colonel Lucifer Tench), becoming a romantic leading man. Ridges' silent film debut was in Success (1923). With his excellent diction and rich speaking voice, he easily made the transition into sound films, with his career taking off at age 43, in Crime Without Passion (1934), with Claude Rains. Ridges found himself cast in character roles, as his greying hair put his romantic leading man days at an end. His most best known roles were probably two different characters in one film, one of them the kindly Professor Kingsley and the other the murderous Red Cannon in the thriller Black Friday (1940). The Jekyll and Hyde transformations gave Ridges a chance to display his acting ability. Ridges was often cast in supporting roles in many classic films, and played the lead only once, in the B-picture False Faces (1943). Among Ridges's other film roles were as the Scotland Yard inspector who is shadowing Charles Laughton in the film The Suspect (1944), as Major Buxton (Gary Cooper's commanding officer) in Sergeant York (1942), as Professor Siletsky in To Be or Not to Be (also 1942), and as Cary Travers Grayson, the official White House physician in Wilson (1944). By 1950, he had just begun an appearing in television anthologies such as Studio One and Philco Television Playhouse. His last feature film, the Ginger Rogers comedy The Groom Wore Spurs, in which he played a mobster, was released a month before he died. Stanley Ridges died 22 April 1951, in Westbrook, Connecticut, aged 60. Broadway roles * Mary of Scotland (1933) as Lord Morton * Valley Forge (1934) as Lt.

The book was a 2006 finalist for the Orange Prize for Fiction and won the 2008 William Saroyan International Prize for Writing for fiction. An excerpt from the novel was published in The New Yorker in 2004 under the title The Last Words on Earth. Plot Approximately 70 years before the present, the 10-year-old Polish-Jewish Leopold (Leo) Gursky falls in love with his neighbor Alma Mereminski. The two begin a relationship that develops over the course of 10 years. In this time, Leo writes three books that he gives to Alma, since she is the only person he deeply cares about. Leo promises he will never love anyone but her. Alma, now 20, is sent to the United States by her father, who feared the alarming news concerning Nazi Germany. Leo does not know that Alma is pregnant and dreams of going to America to meet her. A short time after, the Germans invade Poland and Leo takes cover in the woods, living on roots, small animals, bugs and what he can steal from farmers' cellars. After three and a half years of hiding, he goes to America and finds Alma but is shocked to hear she thought he had died in the war and had married the son of the manager of the factory she works at. He is devastated when he finds she has had another child with her husband. He asks her to come with him, but she refuses. She tells him, however, about his son Isaac who is now five years old. Heartbroken, Leo leaves, and later becomes a locksmith under the guidance of his cousin. Leo regularly watches Isaac from a distance, wishing to be part of the boy's life but scared to come in contact with him. In the present day, Leo is a lonely old man who waits for his death, along with his recently found childhood friend, Bruno, and Alma has been dead for five years. Leo still keeps track of his son, who has become a famous writer, much to Leo's enjoyment since he believes Isaac inherited the talent from his father. Leo's depression deepens when he reads in a newspaper that his son has died at the age of 60, and Leo develops an obsession with finding his place in his son's world, to the extent that he breaks into Isaac's house to see if he had read Words for Everything, a book about his life that he recently wrote and sent to Isaac. Zvi Litvinoff's perspective is introduced. In the past, a younger Leo wrote a letter to his old friend Zvi, asking for his manuscript of The History of Love to be returned to him. Leo had given Zvi The History before they parted, years ago. However, his wife Rosa informs him that the book was destroyed in a flood, choosing to hide that her husband did not write The History of Love. Zvi also describes an event where Leo fell gravely ill in Poland and wrote his own obituary, after which Zvi stole it in the hope that it would keep his friend alive. Unknown to Leo is that the book had been published in a small printing of two thousand copies (and re-published upon the supposed author's death) in Spanish, but under the name of Zvi Litvinoff, who copied the book thinking Leo was killed in Poland. Zvi felt so guilty for copying his book that he added his friend's stolen obituary as the last chapter, telling the publisher that including the obituary was conditional to printing the book, although doing so did not make sense with the plot. Zvi died later without telling the world about the real author of The History of Love. In a parallel story, a 15-year-old girl, Alma Singer, named after the Alma in The History of Love, her parents' favorite book, is struggling to cope with the loss of her father due to cancer. Her mother becomes distant and lonely, escaping into her work of book translation. Her younger brother Bird, so called for jumping from the second story of a building hoping he could fly, seeks refuge in religion and believes himself to be one of God's chosen people, thus distancing himself from reality. Alma finds refuge in one of her father's hobbies: surviving in the wild. Alma also bears a crush on her Russian pen friend Misha, who has moved to New York. The two become a couple but they break up because of Alma's incertitude. One day, her mother receives a letter from a mysterious man named Jacob Marcus who requests that she translate The History of Love from Spanish to English for $100,000, to be paid in increments of $25,000 as the work progresses. Alma's mother finds the sum suspicious, but the stranger confesses that his mother used to read the book to him when he was a child, so it has a great sentimental value. Alma sees this as an opportunity to help her mother recover from her depression and changes her mother's straightforward letters to Jacob Marcus into more romantic versions. When the letters stop before her mother completes the translation of the book, Alma decides to find the mysterious client. She starts by noting down what she knows about Jacob Marcus in her diary, and concludes that the Alma in the book was real and proceeds to find her. She struggles in her search for Alma Mereminski, but succeeds when she realizes that Alma could have married and finds her under the name of Moritz. She is disappointed to hear that Alma has been dead for five years. However, she finds out that Isaac Moritz is the first of Alma's sons and a famous writer. When she starts reading his bestselling book, she finds that the main character's name is Jacob Marcus and realizes that Isaac Moritz had hired her mother to translate the book. Isaac is dead, however, which explains why his letters had stopped coming to their home. To be sure about her suspicions, Alma leaves a note on Isaac's door asking who the writer of the novel is. In the meanwhile, Bird finds Alma's diary and misinterprets the names Alma Mereminski and Alma Moritz as being his sister's real names, and believes they had different fathers. Isaac's brother calls Alma, after reading the note and the original manuscript of the book, to tell her that Gursky is the real author, but Bird answers the telephone and it confuses him even further. He now suspects that Leopold Gursky is Alma's real father. To cleanse his sin of bragging and to regain the status as one of the chosen ones, he decides to set up a meeting with Alma and Gursky, thus doing a good deed without anybody knowing except God. When the two receive the letter regarding their meeting, both are confused: Alma tries to discover which of the people she met during her searches could have sent her the note, while Leo comes to believe it was Alma who sent him the note, despite her being dead. Leo settles himself on a park bench, waiting a long while for Alma to appear. He ponders his life, key moments from his past, the loss of his love, and what it means to be human. He imagines that he will die while he is waiting there, his own death and mortality being one of his preoccupations in the novel. When Alma finally appears, he and she are both confused, although at first Leo believes that she is his Alma from the past and that she is really just in his imagination. After he realizes that she doesn't look like his Alma, and he gets confirmation from a man walking by that the Alma who is there is actually real, Leo talks to her briefly about Bruno and Isaac, while Alma starts piecing together the puzzle of who Leo is. When Alma asks him if he ever loved a girl named Alma Mereminski, the old man finally feels a sense of transcendence in being recognized at long last, and instead of being able to respond to Alma's questions with words, he keeps tapping his fingers twice against her. She puts her head on his shoulder and hugs him, and he is finally able to speak again, saying her name three times and giving her her own feeling of transcendence at finally being recognized, too. (Some readers believe that Leo has a heart attack and dies at this point, possibly because of Leo's earlier assumption that he is about to die, and also because he says during this meeting with Alma, \\"I felt my heart surge. I thought: I've lived this long. Please. A little longer won't kill me.\\" A more compelling case can be made that the novel, for all its poignancy, simply ends with this mutually transcendent moment for these two characters.) The last chapter is entitled \\"The Death of Leopold Gursky\\" and is identical with the last chapter of the book inside a book The History of Love, both being the self-written obituary of Leopold Gursky. By ending the novel this way, Krauss is richly alluding to earlier parts of the novel and to her theme of how words keep people alive for us, indeed, make people in danger of becoming invisible, visible. Zvi Litvinoff carried Leo's self-written obit in his pocket for years, as a talisman guarding against Leo's death. Litvinoff, when preparing History of Love for publication, insists that his editor include the Leo Gursky obit at the end, his way of ensuring that Leo will continue to \\"live\\" in the hearts of all readers of the book. And finally, Nicole Krauss includes the same obit at the end of her novel, as a way of urging all readers to keep this Leo, and all Leos, alive. Literary allusions in The History of Love There are many thematically significant literary allusions in The History of Love. The writer Isaac Babel (1894‚Äì1940), as eulogized by Leo Gursky, has unmistakable affinities with Zvi Litvinoff's description of Leo's own writing style, and the description of Rosa Litvinoff's writing style in the early chapter \\"Forgive Me\\". The Polish writer Bruno Schulz (1892‚Äì1942) and his classic The Street of Crocodiles are mentioned several times in the novel, as is Nicanor Parra (1914‚Äì2018), whose 1954 book of antipoems is translated by Charlotte Singer and read by the mysterious Jacob Marcus. A passing reference to \\"Don Quixote\\" by Miguel de Cervantes (1547‚Äì1616) is also significant because Don Quixote is a novel that contains stand-alone stories within it, much in the same way that The History of Love contains excerpts of a mysterious book called \\"The History of Love.\\" Other important literary allusions in the novel include references to James Joyce, Franz Kafka, Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry, Leo Tolstoy, Rub√©n Dar√≠o and Pablo Neruda. Although he is never directly mentioned, the novel also alludes to Isaac Bashevis Singer in that Leo's son's name is Isaac and Alma's last name is Singer. Also, Basque writer Miguel de Unamumo published a short story in Spanish, A History of Love, with similar themes to the novel.  Comparisons to Extremely Loud...  The History of Love was published in early 2005 as was Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, written by Jonathan Safran Foer who had just married Krauss. Both books feature a precocious youth who set out in New York City on a quest. Both protagonists encounter old men with memories of World War II (a Holocaust survivor in Krauss and a survivor of the Dresden firebombing in Foer). Both old men recently suffered the death of long-lost sons. The stories also use some similar and uncommon literary techniques, such as unconventional typography. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations The book was optioned by Warner Bros. in early 2005, and was set to be directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n. The film eventually began production in Montreal in 2015, directed by Radu MihƒÉileanu, and was released in 2016. Notes 1. A real-life Bruno who is mentioned in the novel is Bruno Schulz, author of The Street of Crocodiles, a book that Alma read after Jacob Markus' letter said he was reading it for the third time. There are resemblances between Bruno Schulz and Leo's friend Bruno, whose last name is not given. Both were Jewish writers who were born in Poland. Leo says his friend Bruno died in 1941, which was the year of the death of Shultz's family and the beginning of Shultz's brutal imprisonment. Schulz was killed by a Nazi officer in 1942.

It receives particularly strong Santa Ana winds in comparison to surrounding areas, hence the name. History Originally, U.S. Route 91 ran through the canyon; however, it has long since been re-signed or upgraded along the entirety of its former right-of-way in the state. California State Route 91 is its primary successor. Recreation The Santa Ana River bicycle path runs through the canyon. This recreational path was constructed on the bank of the river and abuts the length of Yorba Regional Park in Anaheim. The bike trail, as it is referred to by locals, roughly parallels SR 91 in certain areas, extending all the way to Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) on the Pacific coast. Across SR 1 lies Santa Ana River County Beach, which shares a border with Huntington State Beach. Highways It is the namesake of Santa Ana Canyon Road, which is a thoroughfare that parallels the 91 from the Anaheim-Orange line to Gypsum Canyon Road in Yorba Linda. La Palma Avenue is a much longer arterial road than Santa Ana Canyon Road, stretching from West Carson to Yorba Linda uninterrupted. La Palma Avenue actually begins in Redondo Beach as Del Amo Boulevard, but there is a gap in the route between Torrance and West Carson that has yet to connect. Currently, there are no plans to connect the two segments. La Palma also terminates at the intersection with Gypsum Canyon Road. Traffic The Foothill Toll Road (SR 241) itself ends at State Route 91 as well. As a result of the confluence of these three routes at State Route 91 in Santa Ana Canyon, there is often a bottleneck of eastbound traffic during evening rush hour that begins there and continues across the county line and into Corona. Worsening the bottleneck further is the southern terminus of State Route 71 just beyond that. However, there are numerous projects in the planning stages that are aimed at alleviating traffic through the canyon and into Corona and Riverside. Among them are lane additions and interchange improvements, some of which will not be completed until 2030. One proposal is to entirely bypass the canyon by drilling through the Santa Ana Mountains to connect the Eastern Transportation Corridor directly to Interstate 15. Another possible option could be to extend Green River Road to connect to La Palma Avenue, though this likely will never happen. 91 Express Lanes As seen on their official site, the 91 Express Lanes pass through the Santa Ana Canyon. Their goal was to relieve some of the traffic that SR 91 carries daily; previously, they ended at Green River Road, without continuing further into Corona. As of March 20, 2017, an 8-mile extension of the 91 Express Lanes was completed that terminates after passing I-15 when headed eastbound. The 91 Express Lanes is a four-lane, 18-mile toll road built in the median of the Riverside Freeway (State Route 91) between Interstate 15 (I-15) and California State Route 55 (SR 55). A connecting ramp from SR 91 eastbound to I-15 southbound, as well as the parallel I-15 northbound to SR 91 westbound connecting ramp, opened March 20, 2017. When the 91 Express Lanes opened in 1995 between SR 55 and Green River Road, the facility boasted several firsts ‚Äî the first privately financed toll road in the U.S. in more than 50 years, the world's first fully automated toll facility, and the first application of value pricing in America. 91 Express Lanes customers pay tolls from pre-paid accounts, using a FasTrak transponder ‚Äî a pocket-sized radio transmission device mounted to the inside of their vehicle's windshield. This electronic toll collection technology eliminates the need to stop and pay tolls at traditional tollbooths, thus ensuring the free flow of traffic on the 91 Express Lanes. The 91 Express Lanes was born from the need for congestion relief on the 91 Freeway when no public funds were available to solve this critical transportation problem. The concept was unique ‚Äî the private sector would take the risk and the State would get congestion relief at no cost to taxpayers. On a wider scale, the 91 Express Lanes has contributed to major advances in the toll industry worldwide. The facility has been featured in the national and international media. Since the project opened in 1995, transportation officials from 21 U.S. states and 23 countries have visited the 91 Express Lanes to study its advanced systems and operations. Railroad A railroad runs through the canyon which carries Metrolink's 91/Perris Valley Line. Freeway Complex Fire The Freeway Complex Fire of November 2008 raged through Santa Ana Canyon. It ultimately destroyed hundreds of homes in the area and forced multiple road and school closures. In addition, thousands of residents in the canyon were under mandatory evacuation orders at one point or another and could not reenter their neighborhoods. This was the largest wildfire in Santa Ana Canyon since 1969, when fewer people lived there, making the Freeway Complex Fire much more dangerous. 2017 Canyon Fire 2 On October 9, 2017, the Canyon Fire 2 broke out near the interchange for California State Route 91 and California State Route 241 on the border of the City of Anaheim. The Canyon Fire 2 was the second fire in the same area in a matter of weeks, the first fire was designated the Canyon Fire. Canyon Fire 2 was driven by fast moving winds and low humidity. By noon on the day the fire began, it had burned . By 2:30, fueled by high winds and low humidity, it had burned and was 0 percent contained. Canyon Fire 2 lead to the evacuation of 16,570 residents of Yorba Linda, Anaheim, Orange, North Tustin, Orange Park Acres and Tustin and the destruction of 25 homes located in Anaheim Hills and Orange.

Format (Fox News)  At Fox News the show was shot before a live studio audience. Huckabee started with an opening monologue discussing issues of the day, then opened the floor to field several questions from the audience. The show also featured one or more guests as well as a panel of commentators. Huckabee maintains a genial style as host and speaker, \\"markedly less combative\\" than other commentators on the Fox network and Fox News Channel. Tonal differences aside, he believes the show's conservative political content is harmonious with other Fox News hosts past and present such as Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly, saying \\"I'm certainly on the same ideological spectrum\\" as them. The programs concluded with a \\"house band\\" (named The Little Rockers; the name is a play on the Arkansas state capital where Huckabee once served) consisting of several Fox News staff performing a song, often featuring a well-known entertainer as the lead. Band members include host Huckabee on bass guitar, chief religious correspondent Lauren Green on keyboards, M and J Show video editor Dave Colonna on lead guitar, lighting technician Adrian Sharkey on vocals and guitar, M and J Show writer Bob Higgins on guitar, Fox News Edge PA Elizabeth Tucker on backup vocals, and final cut craft editor Dominic Salvatore on drums.

Format (TBN)  On TBN, the show is prerecorded before a studio audience at the TBN studios a few days before it airs. Announcer Keith Bilbrey goes over the lineup of the show at the beginning and throughout the show. The house band, the \\"Music City Connection\\", performs instrumentals of various songs throughout the show. Huckabee then starts with an opening monologue discussing the issues of the week. The show features a handful of different guests each week who are invited by Huckabee to talk about their topics of expertise and how one can learn more about them and their work. There are recurring segments of the show as well, such as \\"In Case You Missed It\\", which highlights the funny and weird news stories of the week, and \\"Huck's Heroes\\", which highlights someone who has done a good deed in their community. The show features a different comedy act each week. Sometimes, Huckabee will set time aside to answer questions sent to him by viewers. The show ends with a different musician each week or if there is no musical guest, the Music City Connection will perform.

A common example of syntactic expression of hypotaxis is the subordination of one syntactic unit to another in a complex sentence.Stanley Fish, How to Write a Sentence p 51 Another example is observed in premodification. In the phrase \\"inexpensive composite materials\\", \\"composite\\" modifies \\"materials\\" while \\"inexpensive\\" modifies the complex head \\"composite materials\\", rather than \\"composite\\" or \\"materials\\". In this example the phrase units are hierarchically structured, rather than being on the same level, as compared to the example \\"Cockroaches love warm, damp, dark places.\\" Note the syntactic difference; hypotactic modifiers cannot be separated by a comma. John Keats's \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" has an example of hypotaxis in the second stanza: \\"O, for a draught of vintage! That hath been/ Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth, / Tasting of Flora and the country green\\" (1. 11‚Äì13). The \\"draught of vintage\\" is modified by the clauses in the successive lines. In William Blake's poem \\"The Clod and the Pebble\\", the phrase \\"So sang a little Clod of Clay,/ Trodden with the cattle's feet\\" (l. 5‚Äì6) is an example of hypotaxis; line 6 modifies the \\"Clod of Clay\\" in line 5.

It originally served as both the National Command Element for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, reporting directly to the Commander, United States Central Command, and as ISAF's Regional Command East. It was replaced by Combined Joint Task Force 101 (CJTF-101) in early April 2008. In May 2009, CJTF-82 returned to Bagram Air Field and assumed control of the east. Shortly thereafter United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) officially took over responsibility as the National Command Element for the theater. CJTF-82 was headquartered at Bagram Air Base. Subordinate fighting formations Under Combined Joint Task Force 180 and later Combined Forces Command - Afghanistan (CFC-A), the corps-level overall headquarters, a division level headquarters supervising fighting brigades was maintained in Afghanistan in 2002‚Äì2004. The HQ was provided in succession by different US Army light divisional headquarters. Combined Joint Task Force Mountain, drawn from 10th Mountain Division, the headquarters that oversaw Operation Anaconda, was the first of these HQs. Later changes in the Divisional HQ providing the task force HQ saw changes to the name, first to Combined Joint Task Force 76 and then to CJTF 82. The mission of CJTF-76 was to conduct a 'full spectrum of operations throughout its operations area to defeat [the] enemy extremist movement, establish an enduring security and reshape its posture for the Long War in order to set conditions for long-term stability in Afghanistan.' CJTF 76 had a one-point two combat brigades under its control, which conducted counter- insurgency operations against Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the east and south of the country. The Task Force and its subordinate formations comprised a shifting group of units and formations. There were also engineer and special operations Task Forces, plus the Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The lead fighting formation of CJTF-180 changed in mid-April 2004 to the 25th Infantry Division (Light), resulting in a designator change to CJTF-76. CJTF 76 was in place until March 2007. In March 2005, the U.S. Army's Southern European Task Force (SETAF) took the leadership role in CJTF-76. In February 2006, the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) took over CJTF-76 leadership.DefenseLink News Article: 10th Mountain Division Takes Afghanistan Task Force Command At the time of the transfer of authority of the RC East area from U.S. Central Command to the NATO-led ISAF, CJTF-76 was commanded by Maj. Gen. Benjamin Freakley of the U.S. 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry). With the inactivation of CFC-A in late 2006, CJTF-76 transitioned to ISAF command as headquarters for ISAF's Regional Command East. The elimination of the intermediate U.S. CFC-A meant the commander CJTF-76 simultaneously reported to the Commander, U.S. Central Command as the National Command Element for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. CJTF-76 was replaced by CJTF-82, led by the 82nd Airborne Division, in March 2007. Post Handover to ISAF With the concurrence of the Commander, U.S. Central Command, and upon the inactivation of HQ CFC-A, Headquarters CJTF-76 became the United States National Command Element for the Afghanistan Combined Joint Operations Area (CJOA). The Commander of CJTF-76 is also the regional commander of Regional Command East (RC-East). The Commander, Joint Task Force-76 Maj. Gen.

Originally laid down as USS LST-1003, an , she was launched 8 June 1944 by the Boston Navy Yard and sponsored by Mrs. V. M. Rines. Renamed and reclassified USS Coronis (ARL-10) on 12 June 1944 she was placed in partial commission 29 June 1944 and sailed to Baltimore, Maryland for conversion to a landing craft repair ship. Coronis was commissioned in full 28 November 1944 with Lieutenant J. J. Ready, Jr., USNR, in command. Service history Departing Norfolk, Virginia 4 January 1945 Coronis arrived at Purvis Bay, in the Solomon Islands to repair battle-damaged landing craft in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa. Arriving at Ulithi, the staging area, on 24 March she joined the Service and Salvage Unit, and five days later sortied with them for Okinawa, arriving off the island 3 April. There she repaired landing craft and the smaller radar picket ships, and operated a fog generator to give protective cover from air attack to ships lying in her area. On 18 June Coronis sailed for Saipan and Guam to load spare parts and supplies, and continued to Subic Bay, in the Philippines, where she acted as repair ship for the training group preparing for the invasion of Japan. After the end of the War, Coronis returned to Okinawa 26 August to repair landing ships of the 5th Fleet. She also converted into a minecraft tender. She arrived in Wakayama Wan on 25 September to operate a boat pool, and service ships of the 5th Fleet carrying out occupation activities until 16 March 1946. After calling at Shanghai, China she sailed for Astoria, Oregon, arriving 2 May. Coronis was placed out of commission in reserve at Vancouver, Washington on 29 July 1946. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register (date unknown), she was sold for commercial service in 1965 for CPR's British Columbia Coast Steamships and renamed MV Trailer Princess. In 1986 it was sold to Helifor Industries Ltd. of Vancouver, British Columbia, and as of 2017 it is used as an unpowered camp barge for heli-logging operations.

Architect Alfred B. Mullet designed the mansion in the Richardson Romanesque style. Mullett had previously designed the Customs House building in downtown Knoxville. The home is two and a half stories, with a three-story tower in the front. The exterior of the home is sheathed in stone from a quarry in Lake City, Tennessee. The home contains elaborate hand-carved mantels from France. Each room is paneled in a different type of wood. The heads of windows include stained glass panels, and 22 different types of marble are used in the house. The site also includes a carriage house.Knoxville: Fifty Landmarks. (Knoxville: The Knoxville Heritage Committee of the Junior League of Knoxville, 1976), page 8. Major Camp was born in Ohio, served in the Union army during the Civil War, made Knoxville his home and was appointed a U.S. District Attorney by President Ulysses S. Grant. The Camp family used the home until 1935. When Camp's heirs were no longer able to maintain the house, they sold some of the furnishings and subdivided the mansion into apartments. The condition of the building declined during its rental use, until WATE-TV purchased the building in 1965 at a cost of $75,000. Over the next two years, the mansion was restored and renovated for use by the television station. The restoration and renovation process cost $1.5 million. The first floor of the building was preserved and restored largely in its original form. A new addition on the back of the building housed the station's studios. In April 1973, Greystone was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

In December 1910 he joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and he was attracted to Zvezda and went on to work for the Bolshevik newspaper, Pravda. He was arrested, and allowed to emigrate, but after running into trouble with the German police, he returned illegally to Russia, and was again arrested and exiled to Arkhangel, but released in 1913 under the amnesty called to mark the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty. He enlisted in the navy on the outbreak of war, and in 1917 he received the Naval rank of Midshipman (michman) but he did not participate in World War I. Kronstadt In March 1917 he was sent to the sea fortress of Kronstadt, where he edited the newspaper Golos Pravdy (Voice of Truth): an incarnation of the forbidden at that time Pravda newspaper. He was one of the organizers of the Kronstadt Mutiny in July 1917. He was arrested by troops loyal to the Russian Provisional Government but released on October 11, 1917, a few weeks before the October Revolution.

R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft, Ursula K. Le Guin and others. The first editions, in hardcover, were published simultaneously in London and New York City by Elkin Mathews and Mitchell Kennerly, respectively, in April, 1915. The British and American editions differ in that they arrange the material slightly differently and that each includes a story the other omits; \\"The Poet Speaks with Earth\\" in the British version, and \\"The Mist\\" in the American version. The collection's significance in the history of fantasy literature was recognized by its republication (as The Food of Death: Fifty-One Tales) by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the third volume of the Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library in September, 1974.

Early life Fink was born in Guernsey on the Channel Islands, the son of Moses Fink, a shopkeeper, and his wife Gertrude, n√©e Ascher. Brought to Victoria, Australia by his father in 1860, he was educated at the Flinders School, Geelong, at Geelong College, and at Melbourne Church of England Grammar School from 1871, where Alfred Deakin was a classmate and friend. Fink qualified as a solicitor at the University of Melbourne and established a successful practice. Political career In September 1894 Fink was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as member for Jolimont and West Richmond, holding the seat for 10 years. On 5 December 1899 he became a minister without portfolio in the Allan McLean ministry. The treasurer William Shiels had been in bad health and the intention was that Fink should act as an assistant to him. He, however, objected to some personal remarks made by Shiels at a public meeting referring to the ministry just displaced, and resigned from the ministry.The Argus, 21 and 22 December 1894 It was generally felt that his reasons were insufficient, and his action did harm to his future career as a politician. He supported the federation movement and stood for Kooyong in the House of Representatives at the first federal election in March 1901, but was defeated by William Knox. He still held his seat in the Victorian assembly but retired in 1904 and never afterwards entered politics. Educationist During his political career, Fink had been doing valuable work in another direction. He was president of the royal commission on technical education in 1899-1901 which resulted in reforms in primary and technical schools, and he was also president of the royal commission on the University of Melbourne in 1902-4. In August 1904 he was thanked by parliament for his services to education. Subsequently, he was chairman of conferences on apprenticeship in 1906-7 and 1911, chairman of a board of inquiry into the working-men's college in 1910, vice-president of the council of public education, vice-chairman of the state war council of Victoria, and chairman of the Commonwealth repatriation board for Victoria in 1917-19. Newspaper director In his younger days Fink had done some writing for the press and in 1889 he became a director of the Herald and Sportsman Newspapers Co. Ltd, after being in some financial difficulty after the land boom collapse. A few years later he became chairman of directors. It was generally believed that Fink was an important factor in the great improvement that took place in the conduct of The Herald, and that he was largely responsible for the appointment of such excellent editors as Guy Innes and Sir Keith Murdoch. Fink later resisted Murdoch's attempts to be made a director. He retained his interest in the press until the end of his long life. He died in his Toorak (a Melbourne suburb) home on 25 April 1942. He married in 1881 Kate, daughter of George Isaacs, who predeceased him; he was survived by two sons and two daughters. Other interests Fink was much interested in the arts and literature and was widely read. In his earlier days he was well known as an excellent after-dinner speaker, and his witty speeches at social gatherings of artists and literary men were much appreciated. Though he was also well known in the business life of Melbourne as a lawyer and a power in the newspaper world, comparatively few people realized the full value of his educational work. The advance in education in Victoria during the first quarter of the twentieth century was based on the report of the commissions over which he presided, and his recognition of the ability of Frank Tate led to his appointment as director of education and the great expansion which followed. Fink was a member of the Eclectic Association, fellow members included Arthur Patchett Martin, Arthur Topp, Alfred Deakin and David Mickle. Fink was President of the Victorian Football Association. In 1896/97 when the eight strongest teams left the VFA to form the Victorian Football League, Fink's wise leadership ensured that the VFA continued to retain an important presence in Victorian sporting circles.

Chicago-Style Stepping has gained popularity, particularly in the urban neighborhoods of America. \\"Chicago-Style Stepping\\" makes reference to other urban styles of dance found throughout the United States larger enclaves in cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.  Origins  Chicago-Style Stepping, affectionately known as steppin, like most social dances, evolved from the \\"Bop\\" in the 1970s. In 1973 Sam Chatman was the first to coin the term \\"Chicago Step\\", and has been widely credited with marking steppin's evolutionary transition from Bop. The swing dance known as Steppin' is a part of the Western Swing family. The parent dance \\"Chicago Bop\\" may have been more Eastern Swing, but Steppin' has characteristics more similar to Western, especially its usage of a lane or slot. The term \\"Bop\\" was used to describe the dance form by Chicagoans until the early 1970s. Prior to that time \\"Bop\\" was a universally known term with its origin beginning sometime between 1945 & 1950 to express music and dance. The dance known as Chicago Steppin' evolved from Bop and is more likely a derivative of Jitterbug. No published syllabuses exist for the dance. Chicago-Style Stepping gained a real foothold when a local radio station, WVAZ (102.7FM/1390AM) began playing \\"Mr. Fix-It\\" and \\"Loves Gonna Last\\", two obscure songs recorded by Jeffree (Jeffree Perry) from his MCA 1979 Jeffree album. \\"Mr Fix it\\" had modest success as a single on the R&B; charts. \\"Loves Gonna Last\\", an album cut, became so popular in Chicago that the steppers dubbed it The Steppers National Anthem.  Popularity  Steppin in Chicago goes back to the late 1940s early 1950s, originally called Bopping it evolved with soul music as the street corner harmony soul songs did with musical bands. Stepping remained popular throughout, even as Hip Hop and Rap music came along it remained main stream in the urban dance scene. Artist such as Grover Washington Jr., Micheal Jackson, Earth , Wind and Fire, Average White Band and especially James Brown (J.B.'s Mono-rail) all had hot stepping tunes aside from many others R. Kelly's songs that featured Steppin' or Stepping helped move the dance into national mainstream culture.  Characteristics  Chicago Stepping is a slotted dance. The follower is typically kept traveling up and down the slot. Two action two one count cycle is the structure. Patterns like \\"roll out and rollback\\" describe the action on the slot or lane. The lane belongs to the follower and the leaders travel on, off and around the slot or lane. Steppin' has a 6 or 8 count basic pattern. Its tempo ranges 70 to 100 bpm. Its basic rhythm pattern consists of a double and two syncopated triples. The patterns start traditionally on the downbeat of one. The leader's footwork is started on their Left and finished on their Right. The follower's dance is naturally opposite. The dance bears similar characteristics to New York Hustle and West Coast Swing.

It is popular in Longshan county, Baojing county and Yongshun county, Xiangxi Tujia-Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan province. The dance is usually performed from the third to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. It originates from an ancestor worship ceremony and dates back nearly 1,000 years ago, according to the broken stele in the Temple of Eight Clan Leaders (Qing Dynasty) and the county annals. The Tujia nationality baishou dance integrates singing, dancing, music and opera elements. It presents numerous topics concerning history and human existence, including the creation of the world, human reproduction, migration, hunting & fishing, sericulture & weaving, slash-and-burn cultivation, ancient stories, myths and legends, and daily life. The dance uses ritual gestures. Dancers' movements and postures are powerful and aesthetic. They wave one hand, wave two hands, wave hand(s) when circling around, or wave hand(s) with foot movements. The dance, usually performed on level ground, can be classified into grand baishou and small-scale baishou. The grand baishou is performed by over 1,000 dancers when offering sacrifices to Tujia ancestors and is watched by over 10,000 spectators; the small-scale baishou is performed on a small scale when offering sacrifices to ancestors with the same family name. The music of the dance incorporates vocal accompaniment (starting song and baishou song) and musical accompaniment (drum and gong). The song changes flexibly according to the content and movements of the dance. Dancers' movements and postures indicate power and freedom and feature turning, bending knees, shaking, and lowering the body.

The doors of the last castle were opened from the inside by this subcommander of Dae Yeon-Rim, which ultimately caused the fall of the short-lived kingdom, and an unknown fate for Dae Yeon-rim and his loyal commanders.

Acquired in 1906, the park is the oldest park in the city. Located at southeast Tenth and Maple streets along Tualatin Valley Highway, Shute Park includes an aquatic center, a branch of the Hillsboro Public Library, and a community center. The park once had a pavilion that contained a roller skating rink, and was the center of civic activities before the opening of the Washington County Fairgrounds. Named for businessman John W. Shute, the park at one time included land on the east side of the highway that consisted mainly of a baseball field. History On December 21, 1906, the City of Hillsboro purchased a tract of land from banker John W. Shute for $1,622, with the condition that the land be used as a park and named in his honor. The city passed a levy to finance the purchase of its first park at 1.8 mills per assessed valuation. At the time, the total assessed value in the city was just over $600,000.\\"Park site sold to city by banker Shute in ‚Äò06\\", Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. The land had previously been the site of a brickyard, whose brick had been used in the construction of several buildings in downtown Hillsboro. In June 1920, voters approved a levy to finance the construction of a pavilion at the park. Finished in June 1921, the building was designed and built without posts in the floor and included a stage. At first, the pavilion was used mainly for dances, but was later used as a roller skating rink. It also was home to an infantry unit and later artillery unit, and during World War II was used for drill by the national guard. Over time, the building eventually no longer met building codes, but the city felt the costs were too much to remodel the facility so the pavilion was torn down in 1974. Beginning in 1925 and until 1951, the Washington County Fair was held at the park.Buan, Carolyn M. This Far-Off Sunset Land: A Pictorial History of Washington County, Oregon. Donning Company Publishers, 1999. p. 126. During that time, the park contained additional structures, including a poultry building. In 1935, workers from the Works Progress Administration improved the park. Enhancements included extensive landscaping, the addition of a baseball diamond, construction of a stone-arch bridge, a creek, and the addition of lighting. The improved park was dedicated on July 2, 1936. Hillsboro's Happy Days festival was also previously staged at Shute Park. The pavilion at Shute could seat as many as 1,500 and was used for events that included a circus. In 1962, the county's historical society looked at the park as a possible home for their museum, which was not built at that time or at that location. However, the society temporarily moved their museum to the park's pavilion that year. The city decided to re-zone a section of the park in 1972. The section was located across Tualatin Valley Highway and contained a baseball field. Hillsboro High School had used the ball field for its home baseball games until Hare Field opened in 1965. The parks department wanted to sell off the land in order to pay for improvements at other park facilities in the city. Hillsboro's city council elected to re-zone the parcel as commercial in order to maximize the value of the land. The city's parks commission approved plans to build the permanent stage in the park in September 1982 using private funds. In 1987, the Peter Wolf Toth statue, Chief Kno-Tah, was added along the eastern side of the park. It is one of 74 such statues collectively known as the Trail of the Whispering Giants. In 2006, the city celebrated the 100th anniversary of the park that included people in period dress and a performance by the Oregon Symphonic Band.\\"Neighborhood Roundup: Living history marks Shute Park's centennial\\", The Oregonian, August 17, 2006. Many of the Douglas fir trees at the park were found to have schweinitzii butt rot and red ring rot in 2008. In May 2009, the city began removing those diseased trees that posed a danger to park visitors as the trees slowly died. Additional trees were removed in 2013 as part of the renovations to the library. Facilities Chief Kno-Tah sculpture located in the park for 30 years until 2017 Located at 10th and Maple streets, the park contains a variety of amenities.

During World War II, he made contributions to the German nuclear energy project. After World War II, he emigrated to the United States to work at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Ohio, for the Air Force Materiel Command. In 1950, he became a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where he became director of the Cyclotron Laboratory there in 1951. In 1956, he became a professor of physics at the University of Hamburg and spearheaded the effort to build the 7.5 GeV electron synchrotron DESY, the foundation of which was in December 1959. He was director of DESY for 10 years. In 1971, he became Director General of CERN Laboratory I for the next five years. He retired from the University of Hamburg in 1980.  Education  Jentschke studied physics at the University of Vienna, from 1930 to 1936. He received his doctorate under Georg Stetter in 1935.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry of Jentschke.

Prankl, and F. Hernegger Die Spaltung des Ioniums under Neutronenebestrahlung, Die Naturwissenschaften Volume 28, Issue 20, 315-316 (1940). From 1946 to 1947, Jentschke was a lecturer at the University of Innsbruck. Near the close and after the end of World War II in Europe, the Russians and the Western powers had programs to foster technology transfer and exploit German technical specialists. For example, the U.S. had Operation Paperclip Naimark, 1995, 205-207. The author also points out that denying scientific and technical personnel to the Soviets was as much an objective as was acquiring their services for the West.Gimbel, 1986, 433-451. The author, in Reference #3 on page 434, points out that the Soviets protested to President Truman about U.S. and British removal in June 1945 of equipment, documents, and personnel from regions which were to fall within the Soviet zone of occupation. General Eisenhower investigated and reported that the Soviets were correct about the removals, but what had been done had exceeded their claims.Gimbel, 1990. and the Russians had trophy brigades advancing with their military forces. In the area of atomic technology, the U.S. had Operation Alsos and the Russians had their version. While operational aspects of the Russian operation were modeled after the trophy brigades, a more refined approach was warranted for the exploitation of German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, and scientific personnel. This was rectified with a decree in late 1944 and the formation of specialize exploitation teams in early 1945 under the Russian Alsos, which had broader objectives, which included wholesale relocation of scientific facilities to the Soviet Union.Oleynikov, 2000, 3. Jentschke emigrated to the United States under Operation Paperclip, where he worked at the Air Force Materiel Command (today, the Air Force Logistics Command after merger with the Air Force Systems Command in 1992), at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, from 1947 to 1948. On his way to the United States, Jentschke wrote to Walther Bothe that his reasons for going there was to do real scientific work, which then not possible in Austria and Germany.Walker, 1993, 179-180. In 1950, Jentschke became a resident assistant professor, and in 1955 resident professor, in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. In 1951, he became director of the Cyclotron Laboratory there.Willibald Jentschke ‚Äì Biografi (DESY). During 1956 and 1957, Jentschke was a member of the Arbeitskreis Kernphysik (Nuclear Physics Working Group) of the Fachkommission II \\"Forschung und Nachwuchs\\" (Commission II \\"Research and Growth\\") of the Deutschen Atomkommission (DAtK, German Atomic Energy Commission). Other members of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in both 1956 and 1957 were: Werner Heisenberg (chairman), Hans Kopfermann (vice- chairman), Fritz Bopp, Walther Bothe, Wolfgang Gentner, Otto Haxel, Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, Josef Mattauch, Wolfgang Riezler, Wilhelm Walcher, and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker. Wolfgang Paul was also a member of the group during 1957.Horst Kant Werner Heisenberg and the German Uranium Project / Otto Hahn and the Declarations of Mainau and G√∂ttingen, Preprint 203 (Max-Planck Institut f√ºr Wissenschaftsgeschichte, 2002). In 1956, Jentschke became an ordinarius Professor of Physics at the University of Hamburg. There, he found a positive climate, as well as funding, for his vision of building a new institute around a particle accelerator. An international particle accelerator conference at CERN in 1956 was helpful in the decision of which accelerator to build. His vision could not be supported by Hamburg alone, so negotiations took place to bring in support of the Federal Republic of Germany and the states of Germany (L√§nder). A financial agreement was signed on 18 December 1959, which founded the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), a 7.5 GeV electron synchrotron. Jentschke was chairman of the DESY Board of Directors from 1959 to 1970, and for many years also the director of the Second Institute of Experimental Physics at the University of Hamburg. While at DESY, Jentschke endorsed the electron-positron storage ring scheme for the DORIS accelerator, and promoted the use of synchrotron radiation for research purposes.DESY mourns for Professor Dr. Dr. h.c. Willibald Jentschke, DESY's Founding Father died at the age of 90, DESY Press Release 18.03.02 (2002). In 1971, Jentschke accepted the post as Director General of CERN Laboratory I (the Meyrin site); John Adams was Director General of the neighboring CERN Laboratory II (Pr√©vessin), where the new SPS proton synchrotron was being constructed. They shared the directorship of CERN until the two laboratories were united in 1976. While Director General, Jentschke oversaw the exploitation of the new research tool, the Intersecting Storage Rings, which began operation in 1971. Jentschke retired from the University of Hamburg in 1980.  Honors  * Professor Jentschke was the recipient of a number of honors: * Wilhelm Exner Medal in 1971.Editor, √ñGV. (2015).

History  The Jewish holiday Hanukkah stems from the Maccabees' revolt against the Seleucid Empire. Many Jews of the era had adopted the Hellenistic language and culture, which the Maccabee group considered an abomination. Use of the vernacular is an example of acculturation, one of the key characteristics of Jewish assimilation in the modern era. Jewish assimilation began anew among Ashkenazi Jews on an extensive scale towards the end of the 18th century in Western Europe, especially Germany, as the Haskalah emerged as a culture. Reasons cited for its initial success included hope for better opportunities accompanying assimilation into the non-Jewish European communities, especially among the upper classes. \\"The concentration of the Jewish population in large cities had a strong impact on their lifestyle and made them more visible in the economy and in the culture.\\" As legal emancipation remained incomplete in Germany, many upper-middle class urban Jews propagated Enlightenment ideals, which they believed would allow them to improve their social standing. \\"The ideologues consequently envisioned a regeneration of German Jewry that would gain it equal rights but would also lead to the formation of a new kind of Jew based on its ideal of man.\\" Both the Christian and Jewish communities were divided concerning answers to what was known as the Jewish question. The question, coming during the rise of nationalism in Europe, included the extent to which each nation could integrate its Jewish citizens, and if not integrated, how should they be treated and the question solved. The breakdown of the traditional Jewish communal structure, the Kehilla, marked the declining perception of a distinct Jewish nationality among those Jews that promoted emancipation. However, attempts to reduce Judaism to a confession did not necessarily induce an increase in tolerance of the Jews on the part of the majority society. As an alternative to a more liberal practice of Judaism, assimilation also took the form of conversion to Christianity. None of the descendants of Moses Mendelssohn retained the Jewish religion. Assimilationists saw Jewish cultural distinctiveness and tribalism as the root of antisemitic hostility and thus felt that Jewish social bonds needed to be weakened. This led some Jews to philosophical questions of Jewish identity and Who is a Jew?. The propriety of assimilation, and various paths toward it were among the earliest internal debates of the emancipation era, including whether and to what extent Jews should relinquish their right to uniqueness in return for civic equality. These debates initially took place within the diaspora, a population with a revered historical Biblical homeland, but without a state of their own for nearly 2,000 years. Jewish academics in the nineteenth century partook in social scientific studies concerning anti-Semitic notions of Jewish degeneration. Their active role in this intellectual discussion served as both a calculated response to anti-Semitic allegations and a way to explore common social bonds uniting Jews as the autonomous community had been in full decline. Many Jewish social scientists did not entirely disagree with the ideas of distinct Jewish traits conceived by anti-Semites. This lent itself well to the contentious debate over assimilatory practices. \\"The political and social message of this immutable Jewish nature was clear: the 'Jewish body' was racially different and pathological, and opponents of emancipation and integration were correct in insisting that Jews were unfit to be part of a healthy modern nation-state.\\" Participating in the exploration of Jewish lineage can also be seen as a form of appeasement as \\"It allowed Jewish social scientists to fill the roles of apologist and reformer, to defend their own people based on the knowledge and insights of science.\\" In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, conditions in Eastern Europe convinced many Jews to emigrate to the United States. In Germany, Jewish integration into the Army and other occupations was successful. In the United States traditional disabilities were generally absent but they faced many different challenges of acculturation. In the early 20th century, there was social discrimination against Jews in certain quarters, with many universities and professions barred to them or with a quota limit. In the modern 21st century, although the view on Jews has considerably improved, in the US specifically, the nation is guided as a Christian nation, with a common example being all of the Christmas songs and ads being played during the holiday season with parents needing to say \\"we do not celebrate Christmas.\\" , and the lack of such advertisement for any Jewish holiday during the year. Jewish assimilation is common more in the modern day since the pressures of society to be like everyone else are high. The new Reform Judaism Movement also adds to this, since it is a branch of Judaism that has become more moderate on following the laws of the torah (Jewish law), leading some Jews to be more relaxed instead of strict regarding their religious observance. The largest Reform Synagogue in New York- Central Synagogue, performs \\"interfaith\\" marriages.https://www.haaretz.com/us- news/.premium.MAGAZINE-judaism-shouldn-t-have-to-survive-only-because-jews- are-afraid-of-everything-else-1.6828507 Such marriages are conducted to strengthen Jewish continuity (with the aim that the non-Jewish spouse will convert to Judaism). However, the 2013 study \\"What happens when Jews intermarry?\\" explains that children of intermarriage are much more likely to intermarry themselves and much more likely than people with two Jewish parents to describe themselves religiously as atheist, agnostic or just ‚Äúnothing in particular.‚Äù.https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/11/12/what-happens- when-jews-intermarry/ In orthodox Jewish law, children born from a non-Jewish mother (although they may have a Jewish father) are no longer considered Jewish. Notwithstanding, under the state of Israel's law, it is sufficient for one parent to be a Jew for his spouse and children to be entitled to citizenship, under the Israeli Law of Return.  Contemporary debate  The issue of Jewish assimilation has agitated Jewish polemicists and intrigued Jewish historians for a considerable time. Since some Jews supposedly abandoned traditional Jewish customs to embrace modern secular Western culture, more conservative Jews have chastised them for deserting the Jewish people. \\"Religious Jews regarded those who assimilated with horror, and Zionists campaigned against assimilation as an act of treason.\\" As a result, the term assimilation, once used proudly by those who sought integration into European society, became seen as a term of contempt for a symbol of subservience to gentile culture, a sign of rejection of all links to the common history and destiny of the Jewish people, and a betrayal of their ancestors who suffered pogroms, mass murder and other calamities to keep Judaism alive. Such Jews consider assimilation a loss of Jewish identity of an individual either by marriage to a spouse who is not Jewish or by abandonment of Judaism to adopt another religion. The assimilation is the leading cause for the shrinkage of almost all Jewish populations in Western countries since World War II. This shrinkage has been called the Silent Holocaust (in comparison to the genocide against Jews during World War II) by communal leaders such as Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald of the National Jewish Outreach Program. Buchwald said in 1992 that the Jewish community would not be recognizable in 25 to 30 years. According to the 2000‚Äî2001 National Jewish Population Survey, from 1996, 47% of American Jews married a non- Jew.http://www.jewishpost.com/archives/news/Silent-Holocaust-Gets-a-Voice.html The NJPS survey said that higher levels of education are associated with lower levels of intermarriage. In Assimilation in American Life, Milton Gordon defined assimilation as a continuum, with the first stage acculturation, that is, the adoption of such outward cultural forms of the larger society as language, dress, recreational tastes, and political views. Total assimilation is possible only if the host society is receptive and extensive interfaith marriage takes place (at its most in former European colonies with a divisive black-white line, which allowed Jews to be seen as part of the desirable white element and where miscegenation was hardly a taboo). Most European and American Jews acculturated, but they rarely lost their sense of Jewish identity. They most frequently abstained from what Gordon called \\"structural assimilation,\\" the creation of friendships and other contacts primarily with members of the host society. In Assimilation and Community: The Jews in nineteenth-century Europe, Marion Kaplan describes how the Jewish identity was maintained and how the German-Jewish identity was formed, specifically through Jewish women and their actions within their families and their communities. Jewish women placed a lot of importance on their culture and religion by reinforcing their traditions. They accomplished this by continually observing Jewish traditions and rituals, such as family dinners on Friday evenings, and holidays from the Jewish calendar. Strict adherence to Judaism was essential in maintaining their Jewish identity within their household. Kaplan also stresses the importance of family and community; close knit families had strong ties with one another. This strong sense of community helped them in protecting and maintaining their culture. However, ways in which Jews adapted to the culture can be seen in the way Jewish women raised their children in Germany. They encouraged them to take part in sports, learn musical instruments, and read German fairy tales to them. Jewish women also subscribed to German periodicals, following its fashion styles and news. In Paula Hyman's book The Jews of Modern France demonstrates that Jewish assimilation into French society allowed them to integrate in the community. The term assimilation is based on the modern term. Assimilation is presumed to \\"reflect the substitution of a French identity for a Jewish one.\\" It is believed that this simplistic view does not give an all encompassing view on the intricate relations between Jews and the French. The Jews had to constantly defend their legitimacy as a minority group in France. While most people associate assimilation as a negative term, \\"they were not simply passive absorbers of bourgeois French culture; they also participated in its shaping.\\" Jews contributed to French society, through participating in all aspects of society like government and universities. In her book Hyman helps illustrate instances that show integration in French society. Beginning with the cooperation of the French state, Jews were able to maintain networks of communal institutions in the system of consistories that both promoted acculturation and reinforced Jewish feelings of solidarity. These consistories also helped support the existence of specific Jewish institutions. These institutions provided charitable assistance to Jews through a variety of philanthropic societies. Examples of these would be a network of modern Jewish primary schools as well as extended supplemental Jewish education to Jewish children who began attending public schools. Despite mass participation by Jews in all levels of French society ‚Äì government, universities, and professional careers ‚Äì the vast majority of Jews in 19th century France chose to be married and buried as Jews. This clarifies that Jews were not fully assimilated into French society nor sought the disappearance of their institutions and/or biological merger with the French society. David Sorkin's The Transformation of German Jewry 1780-1840 assesses what should have been an immensely successful integration process given the Jewish population's great societal contributions as they adopted German secular culture and the bourgeois ideal of individualism known as Bildung. Instead, a separate German-Jewish subculture developed while emancipation lagged. Sorkin depicts the fruitless attempts of the Jews to be tolerated as no level of self-denial would ultimately prove acceptable to their counterparts. From an international conference on Jewish assimilation held at Haifa University in May 1976, Bela Vago edited a collection of papers entitled Jewish Assimilation in Modern Times. Most of these papers accept the Zionist equation of assimilation with Jewish group disappearance. Christian‚ÄìJewish relations The question of Jewish assimilation is a topic of concern for both Jewish and Christian religious leaders. A number of Progressive Christian denominations have publicly declared that they will no longer proselytize Jews.Ecumenical Considerations on Jewish-Christian Dialogue (World Council of Churches)Policies of mainline and liberal Christians towards proselytizing Jews (religioustolerance.org) Early Christian Europe proved a time and place where Jews and Christians could come together while coexisting socially and creatively amidst the persecution. They were living so closely together in some areas that leaders from both would be worried about the influence one religion had on the other. A Christian Monarch in charge of a growing town would invite Jewish merchants to help revitalize the economy. There was a pattern of expulsion and re-invitation that allowed for the two to live intimately together in smaller towns throughout Europe. Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne in the Holy Roman Empire, was the first to leave detailed descriptions of the rights of Jewish Merchants. In Spain and Portugal, after the 15th century, there was controversy over the sincerity of Iberian Judeo- Catholics who converted under pain of being expelled from the Peninsula. In Spain and Portugal, descendants of Arabs, Moors, and Jews (moriscos and marranos), were, for a period of time banned from certain guilds, positions in the clergy and particularly from emigrating to Latin America (limpieza de sangre). This early discrimination system was weaker in Latin America due to the social status that Sub-Saharan African slaves had, much below that of New Christians from the Old World, a contributing factor to the absorption of these elements in the developing culturally pluralistic societies of the New World. The Roman Catholic Church has attracted some Jews, such as Edith Stein, Israel Zolli, Erich von Stroheim, and Jean-Marie Lustiger.John Tagliabue, French Catholic leader, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, dies at 80, International Herald Tribune, 6 August 2007 See also * Historical Jewish population comparisons * Bundism * Yevsektsiya * Zera Yisrael * Apostasy in Judaism * Criticism of multiculturalism References Bibliography *  External links  *Effects of Intermarriage and Assimilation *Intermarriage is not the same as assimilation, Lior Tal Sadeh (◊ú◊ô◊ê◊ï◊® ◊ò◊ú), The Times Of Israel *Are we assimilating?, Eretz Acheret Magazine * The History of the Jews in Europe * Assimilation Category:Cultural assimilation Assimilation ","title":"Jewish assimilation"},{"id":"10918034","title":"Transportation in Mexico"},{"id":"10918047","text":"Alexandru Tyroler Alexandru (S√°ndor) Tyroler (19 October 1891, Garamszentkereszt, now ≈Ωiar nad Hronom, Slovakia - 3 February 1973, Budapest, Hungary) was a Hungarian-Romanian chess master.

After a resolution introduced by congressman Charles Lindbergh Sr. for a probe on Wall Street power, congressman Ars√®ne Pujo of Louisiana was authorized to form a subcommittee of the House Committee on Banking and Currency. In 1913‚Äì1914, the findings inspired public support for ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment that authorized a federal income tax, passage of the Federal Reserve Act, and passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act. Background and overview Beginning in the late 1800s, a concern regarding the power of bankers and monopolies began to grow. This led to a breaking point in July 1911, when Congressman Charles August Lindbergh asserted that a banking trust existed within the United States and that it should be investigated.\\"The 'Money Trust.'\\" The New York Times, July 24, 1911. A move to create an investigation was then made on February 7, 1912, when the democratic Money Trust Caucus decided to pass House Resolution 405.\\"To Investigate the Money Trust.\\" The New York Times, February 8, 1912. Not long after this resolution's passage, amendments followed placing the investigation of the Money Trusts into the hands of then-chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee, Ars√®ne Paulin Pujo of Louisiana. Pujo submitted a resolution, later amended and passed by a vote of 268-8, to establish the footing upon which the rest of the investigation would base itself. As early as December 12, 1911, the lawyer Samuel Untermyer supported the creation of such an investigation, encouraging Lindbergh to continue fighting for its creation despite early setbacks. Untermyer, a strong proponent of the investigation himself, eventually came to be the committee's counsel.\\"Untermyer to Lead Money Trust Inquiry.\\" The New York Times, January 12, 1912. See also page 53 of Pujo Committee Report and \\"Plan Inquiry Into the 'Money Trust,'\\" The New York Times, December 22, 1911. Despite being called the Pujo Committee, in March 1912, approximately a month after it received authorization, Pujo's wife became ill, forcing him to take an indefinite leave of absence from the investigation. His successor was Representative Hubert D. Stephens of Mississippi. The investigation originally intended to examine data from 1905‚Äì1912 regarding all loans of $1,000,000 or greater; however, the Comptroller of the Currency furnished only a fraction of the overall data, hampering the investigation's scope. Three sections of the economy were the focus of attention: clearing houses, the New York Stock Exchange, and the growing concentration of wealth within the economy. Witnesses were first examined on May 16, 1912.Pujo, Arsene. Report of the Committee Appointed Pursuant to House Resolutions 429 and 504 to Investigate the Concentration of Control of Money and Credit. Washington: Government Printing Office. February 28, 1913. Findings and aftermath=Clearing houses The Committee concluded that clearing house associations (associations created for the clearing of checks to and from individual banks) based in New York were gaining power at the public's expense. This was done via minimum capital requirements as well as predatory membership and discriminatory member policies. The report states, \\"Non-member banks must engage a member bank as its clearing agent, which in effect leaves its future up to the discretion a single bank.\\" This clause allowed member banks and the boards of these clearing houses to stifle any competition that might arise from smaller upstart banks by simply telling their member banks not to act as their clearing agents. In fact, the Panic of 1907 started with the closing of the Knickerbocker Trust Co., when its member clearing bank (the National Bank of Commerce of New York) refused to act as its clearing agent anymore. New York Stock Exchange The Committee discovered that, much like the clearing houses, certain predatory listing practices were forcing certain restrictions on both members and non-members of its exchange. Additionally, the Committee discovered large amounts of \\"unwholesome speculation\\" and price manipulation, citing examples of large groups colluding for profit and ultimately running companies out of business. Concentration and control of money and credit The Committee discovered several forces, such as the consolidation of banks and interlocking directorates (small groups of the same men serving as directors on several different boards) had led to increased wealth accumulation of 42.9% of America's total banking resources held by its twenty largest banks. Furthermore, with many surprises to the investigators, it was found that \\"180 individuals\\" covering \\"341 directorships in 112 corporations...[possessed] $22,245,000,000 in aggregate resources of capitalization.\\"\\"Morgan Reveals Business of Firm.\\" The New York Times. December 19, 1912. Finally, it was concluded that a system is known counterintuitively as \\"Banking Ethics\\" prohibited competition among banks and firms. Despite the fact that lead attorney Samuel Untermyer had predetermined that no money trust would be found as part of the Investigation because ‚ÄúThere is no agreement existing among these men that is in violation of the law‚Äù,\\"Say Money Trust is Now Exposed.\\" The New York Times, January 12, 1913. and despite the refusal of aid by the Comptroller of the Currency, the failure of the Senate to pass the bill to amend section 5241 of the Revised Statutes, and the lack of any authoritative decision by the courts sustaining the committee's right to access the books of the national banks, the Pujo Committee Report concluded in 1913 that a community of influential financial leaders had gained control of major manufacturing, transportation, mining, telecommunications and financial markets of the United States. The report revealed that at least eighteen different major financial corporations were under the control of a cartel led by J.P. Morgan, George F. Baker and James Stillman. These three men, through the resources of seven banks and trust companies (Banker‚Äôs Trust Co., Guaranty Trust Co., Astor Trust Co., National Bank of Commerce, Liberty National Bank, Chase National Bank, Farmer‚Äôs Loan and Trust Co.) controlled an estimated $2.1 billion. The report revealed that a handful of men held manipulative control of the New York Stock Exchange and attempted to evade interstate trade laws. The Pujo Report singled out individual bankers including Paul Warburg, Jacob H. Schiff, Felix M. Warburg, Frank E. Peabody, William Rockefeller and Benjamin Strong, Jr.. The report identified over $22 billion in resources and capitalization controlled through 341 directorships held in 112 corporations by members of the empire headed by J.P. Morgan. Although Pujo left Congress in 1913, the findings of the committee inspired public support for ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 that authorized a federal income tax, passage of the Federal Reserve Act that same year, and passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914. The findings were also widely publicized in the Louis Brandeis book, Others People's Money‚Äîand How the Bankers Use It. House of Morgan partners blamed the April 1913 death of J.P. Morgan on the stress of testifying in the Pujo hearings, though other health factors were certainly involved. See also *Pecora Commission *United States v.

Its three members were born in Morocco and were of Jewish origin. They were France's first band to headline the famed Olympia Theatre, the first to tour America, the first to sign with a US label and the first to achieve hit records in America. On their last two albums, Moroccan Roll (1974) and Cafe de Paris (1975), their compositions, arrangements and lyrics contained sounds and stories of North African and Jewish Sephardic culture as well as the Hebrew songs of the band members‚Äô youth growing up in North Africa. With this sound, they introduced a new rock fusion which is now referred to as Moroccanroll music, which is played throughout North Africa and has influenced many western rock bands over the past four decades. History Three of the original four members were Moroccan Jews. Joe Leb sang vocals, Marc Tobaly played guitar, and Isaac ‚ÄúJacky‚Äù Bitton was on drums. The fourth member, Jacques ‚ÄúPetit Pois‚Äù Grande, who played bass, is of Italian heritage. In 1971, Leb was briefly replaced by French singer Michel Chevalier. In 1975, Leb was later replaced by Tunisian born Robert Fitoussi. Les Variations was formed in 1966 by Marc Tobaly's older brother Alain, who became the band's manager. That year they began touring throughout Europe as a great live performance band, singing songs in English of their favorite artists, such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley and The Rolling Stones, and in 1967, they began their recording career in Denmark with the release of Spics & Spack. Returning to France in 1969, they signed with France's EMI/Path√© Records, and forged a successful recording relationship. Les Variations were the first and certainly one of the best known rock groups from France, largely in part to their commercial record successes, their unabandoned concert and television performances, their unmatched media and press coverage, and their unique position of being the first French rock band to tour America, to sign with an American label and eventually pioneer a new style of rock music over their decade-long existence. Between 1969 and 1973, they released the bulk of their albums on Pathe Records. Their early recordings often mimicked traits of The Rolling Stones, The Who and Led Zeppelin. In 1972, Alain Tobably formed a partnership with Doug Yeager and Charles Benanty of Applewood Productions in New York, and the band began the second phase of their career touring and recording in America. Their only French language recording, \\"Je Suis Juste Un Rock'n Roller\\", produced by Doug Yeager and the band and backed by soul sisters Angel & Sybil, was recorded in Cincinnati's 5th Floor Recording Studios, and became their biggest hit ever, reaching No. 7 in the French pop charts. In 1973, their popular album Take it or Leave It was recorded in Memphis's Ardent Studios with producer Don Nix. In 1974, Les Variations became the first French rock band to sign with an American label, Buddah Records while creating a more exotic and unique style reminiscent of their North African roots. Their pioneering introduction of sounds and styles taken from their Moroccan heritages, was exemplified in the albums Moroccan Roll (1974, produced by Ralph Moss), and Cafe de Paris (1975, produced by Lewis Merenstein & Michael Wendroff), which would influence rock bands in America, Europe and Africa for the next several generations. During the recording and subsequent touring of these Buddah albums, the band added the American keyboard player/singer Jim Morris; and for the next album (Cafe de Paris) and its tours, they added the French/Tunisian/singer/guitarist/composer Robert Fitoussi and the French/Tunisian violinist of Arabic music, Maurice Meimoun. This 1975 album reached the Billboard Top 200 Album Charts in America, while their single \\"Superman, Superman\\", reached No. 36 in the U.S. Pop Charts. During this 1974-1975 period, they became the first French rock band to headline the famed Olympia Theatre in Paris; and the only French band to ever headline the national American TV concert show The Midnight Special and the national American radio concert special King Biscuit Flower Hour. In the summer of 1975, after the band's national tour of America in support of their charted album, Robert Fitoussi choose to branch out on his solo career as F. R. David. Jacques Grande and Maurice Meimoun also left the band at that time. Les Variations reformed at their Cincinnati band house and studio with Tobaly, Bitton and Morris and the addition of Americans singer Carl Storie and bassist/singer Albritton McClain. Unfortunately, as they finally were able to gain measurable success in America with their major tours and hit record, Les Variations gave their last concert at Philadelphia's Academy of Music on December 7, 1975 and disbanded two weeks later on December 21, 1975. In 1977, Les Variations reformed for a historic recording session for CBS Records International. Jac Hammer, composer of many classic rock songs, such as \\"Great Balls of Fire,\\" wrote an anthem the night Anwar Sadat flew to Israel to make peace. Three days later, Richie Havens & Les Variations recorded \\"Shalom, Salem Aleicum\\" (produced by Charles Benanty, Doug Yeager and David Wilkes), which CBS released immediately throughout the Middle East, and it became a #1 hit in Israel, Egypt and Jordan. Over the course of their career, Les Variations became the first French rock band to tour Europe, Africa and America. Over their ten years on the road they toured with many major acts of the era, including: Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive, Kiss, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Cream, Yes, Guess Who, Taste, Queen, Uriah Heep, Rush, Kraftwerk and Aerosmith, to name a few. In 1993, Maurice Meimoun died in Paris. In 2009, a Tribute to Les Variations was presented before 250,000 fans at the L'Boulevard Rock Music Festival in Casablanca, Morocco, honoring the band as the Fathers of Moroccanroll music. Les Variations bassist, Jacques \\"Petit Pois\\" Grande, died on June 16, 2011 from cancer, near his home of Davis, California.

Lightning protection systems are often installed in outdoor areas which are often congested with people, lack sufficient shelter, and are difficult to evacuate quickly (such as water parks, college campuses, and large swimming pool or athletic field complexes). These locations are particularly dangerous during lightning storms. Prediction systems are prone to false alarms as they respond to conditions that are not always attributed to a developing thunderstorm. Electric field data is typically used in conjunction with detection information to limit false positives. Description A Perry Weather lightning warning system. The detection equipment is designed to constantly survey atmospheric electrical activity and potential for lightning occurrence via radar and other methods. Storms are scanned by radar to determine the degree of electrification and potential for lightning occurrence. The method used by such systems includes the stationing of at least three receivers at known locations in order to triangulate their data. When any of the receivers detects a strong electrical disturbance, the location is shared with other receivers in the area for corroboration, and then (presuming the data has passed the filters), encoded and transmitted to a central facility and thereafter processed for deriving the position of the lightning strike. By detecting thunderstorm electrical fields, a track can be predicted to allow warnings as early as 30 minutes before lightning strikes the protected area. The system is synchronized with the U.S. Coast Guard LORAN navigation network, and includes various features which permit a more accurate analysis of lightning position. While some systems require manual remote activation of the siren from the central monitoring facility, others work automatically. These systems can also sound an \\"All Clear\\" tone when electrical activity in the monitored area has receded to safe levels. This feature eliminates both the need for skilled monitoring of the system as well as the chance for human error in interpreting the data.

The album is a compilation of 13 songs created completely from Beck samples, samples that were not legally approved by Beck's recording label. Illegal Art's actions set off a large scale legal battle between the two record labels and attracted worldwide media attention. According to Steven Shaviro, the release of Deconstructing Beck served as a challenge to the music industry since the music artist Beck creates much of his music by sampling other artists' original music.  About Deconstructing Beck  Deconstructing Beck is a compilation of 13 songs which were all created by mixing together several of Beck's songs. The album was produced by the anonymous sample recording label named Illegal Art which was created by an anonymous person(s) calling himself/herself/themselves Philo T. Farnsworth. \\"The samples have been manipulated electronically in various ways. The resulting thirteen tracks, by a number of different pseudonymous artists, have a \\"do-it-yourself\\" feel. Most of them were made on Macintosh computers, with relatively inexpensive software. By the standards of the recording industry, this makes it low-tech. The CD‚Äôs sound varies from track to track, but overall it is far more abrasive than Beck‚Äôs original music. Some of the pieces work as witty commentaries on their source. Others change the music unrecognizably, breaking it into abstract formal patterns.\\"\\" Songs include: # Mr. Meridies \\"Paving the Road to Hell Pt2\\" # Jane Dowe \\"Puzzels & Pagans\\" # Huk Don Phun \\"Killer Control Enters Blackhole\\" # Steev Hise \\"Stuck Together, Falling Apart\\" # The International Bankers \\"Void Transaction\\" # Corporal Blossom \\"Burning Today's Memory\\" # Mr. Meridies \\"So Cal Weevil Dream\\" # The Evolution Control Committee \\"One Beck in the Grave\\" # Spacklequeen \\"Eggs eggs, arms legs\\" # Hromlegn Kainn \\"Doublefolded\\" # Mr. Meridies \\"Carpet Tunnel Syndrome\\" # Jane Dowe \\"Bust a Move\\" # J. Teller \\"Fat Zone\\"  Copyright controversy  Deconstructing Beck is built completely out of samples taken, without authorization or payment, from Beck or his record label. When the release of the album was announced in February 1998, Illegal Art made great efforts to inform Beck's lawyers and recording company. Immediately, Beck's lawyers threatened to sue on the grounds of copyright infringement which resulted in a high-profile controversy. However, Beck's lawyers and publicist were never able to take legal action since the identity of Philo T. and the actual location of Illegal Art was unknown. Since the CD violates copyright laws, it cannot be sold in stores and is publicized and marketed exclusively over the Internet.  Steven Shaviro  Steven Shaviro's article \\"Deconstructing Beck\\" brings up many important issues regarding the use of appropriation and sampling in the music industry today. Shaviro's article takes issue with the legalities of sound/image ownership and copyrights. Shaviro's utilization of the controversy surrounding Beck and Deconstructing Beck bring questions such as \\"who owns the images and sounds around us?\\" and \\"what does it mean to own a sound?\\" to the surface. Beck's own music is created from various beats and rhythms of all different genres of music from multiple artists. However, Beck's recording company Geffen Records financially backs Beck and is able to pay the royalty and copyright fees of the samples Beck utilizes in his own songs. Since Beck's songs are paid for and legal he is considered \\"eclectic\\" and an artist of appropriation. However, those who do not have record label support and cannot afford copyright fees and continue to appropriate others' music are seen as thieves and criminals. This issue calls into question the issue of music ownership. Since recording companies leverage the money for copyright fees and serve as \\"watch dogs\\" over their clients' work, do they ultimately own music? This situation also leads the reader to question how these copyright legalities limit artist creativity and at what point is a song considered brand new? \\"As the contrast between Beck and Deconstructing Beck suggests, the practice of sampling can take many different forms and has a wide range of implications and meanings.

In 207 career games, Grove pitched 1,176 innings and posted a win‚Äìloss record of 63‚Äì73, with 66 complete games, 11 shutouts, and a 3.78 earned run average (ERA). The only freshman on the Proviso High School varsity baseball team, Grove's pitching ability attracted the attention of the White Sox. After signing with the team in 1937, Grove moved between the major leagues and minor leagues for a few seasons until 1943, when he found a solid place in the White Sox's pitching rotation. Grove had a career-year in 1943, finishing the season with career-bests in ERA, wins, and complete games; in 1944, he made his only All-Star appearance. Grove spent four more full seasons with the White Sox, and after pitching one game in 1949, was sent to the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League. After playing four seasons with them, he formally retired from professional baseball. After retirement, he worked with his uncle in a trucking business in Chicago while continuing to pitch at the semi-pro level. In 1992, Grove died at the age of 72. Early life Grove was born in West Mineral, Kansas, on August 29, 1919, and was raised in Maywood, Illinois. By eighth grade, Grove developed a fondness for baseball and began pitching for the Proviso East High School baseball team. He became the first freshman member of the varsity team in school history. During a high school pitching career of three years, Grove lost only two games and pitched a no-hitter and two one-hitters. Over the summer of 1937, Grove attracted the attention of Chicago White Sox talent scout Doug Minor, who requested that he \\"come and workout with the Sox.\\" Later that year, Grove was signed by the White Sox for $2,500 and began his minor league career, foregoing his senior season of high school. Minor league career Grove began his career with the Dallas Steers of the Texas League at the start of the 1938 season. He played with the Steers until management began to replace young players with veterans due to the team's struggling form and moved Grove to the Longview Cannibals. As his first minor league season drew to a close, Grove planned on returning to Proviso High School to complete his education. At the end of the season, the St. Paul Saints purchased Grove's contract to replenish their pitching staff. After the 1939 season had begun, Grove became part of the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League; St. Paul did not see much potential in him. Grove played well enough over the course of the season to receive votes for Most Valuable Player, which ultimately went to Nick Cullop. In 1939, Grove had a peculiar game while pitching against the Tulsa Oilers. Playing in a night game with virtually no light due to storms, Grove did not allow a hit during his time on the mound, but earned the loss because he walked three men in a row, which allowed a run to score. As the 1940 season began, Grove became a part of the White Sox roster and began his Major League career. Transition to the majors During spring training in 1940, Hall of Fame pitcher Ted Lyons said that Grove would have a great career, stating, \\"They'll never drive that sinker very far.\\" Grove was an official part of the 40-man roster as the 1940 season began (teams started rather than ended the season with 40 men at this time), but had not made an appearance after a month on the roster. The White Sox planned to use three rookie pitchers, including Grove, during the final week of May, as they had three doubleheaders that week. Grove made his Major League debut on May 28, 1940. He pitched in two more games for the White Sox that season before being sent back to Oklahoma City. Grove finished 1940 with six innings of major league work over three games, allowing two earned runs. The highlight of Grove's 1940 season came on August 11 against the Oilers; he pitched a complete game that lasted 12 innings, winning 1‚Äì0 against Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean. Grove finished the minor league season with nine wins and eight losses, but the team saw issues with his control, and as a result he spent most of the next season in the minor leagues. In 1941, Grove played two games for the White Sox, pitching seven innings and allowing eight runs during the two outings. He spent the start of the 1941 season at Oklahoma City, though on May 19 he was sent to the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League, where he spent the rest of the season. Grove concluded the year at Oklahoma City with a 17‚Äì7 record, an improvement over the previous season. However, Grove received a knee injury late in the season, which he did not think much of at the time. In October, Grove injured his other knee when he was involved in an automobile accident in Missouri. The following season, Grove was provided an opportunity to be a starting pitcher for the White Sox. Over the course of the season, he started eight games and played in four more en route to a 4‚Äì6 record and a 5.16 ERA. In the middle of July, Dr. Philip Kruescher discovered that Grove had torn cartilage in his left knee, a result of the same injury which caused him problems for most of the season and the previous off-season. Grove was scheduled for knee surgery, which necessitated two months of recovery, effectively ending his season. Issues with his knee drew concern both during and after the season. Dr. Kruescher stated that Grove had a \\"1 in 100\\" chance of playing again, but the surgery was a success, and by season's end Grove was able to test the knee and do light workouts. Complications arose shortly thereafter as an abscess developed on the back of his knee, prompting another operation in December to correct the problem. Prime years As the 1943 season began, the White Sox held strong doubts about Grove's status as a pitcher. They were so doubtful of his recovery from knee surgery that Grove was signed to a $1 contract until he could prove that his playing ability was back on par with the abilities of the other White Sox pitchers. After Grove proved himself in spring training, manager Jimmy Dykes gave him his first major test of the season against the New York Yankees in relief of Eddie Smith. He won the game in extra innings, and was placed in the starting rotation. In 1943, Grove had to deal with issues related to World War II and the selective service. He was originally classified as 3-A, meaning that registration was deferred due to hardship to dependents, but was ordered to take the selective service screening examination in Cleveland in mid-May. After the examination, Grove was classified as 4-F, making him ineligible for military service, which meant that he could continue his baseball career. Grove took advantage of his place in Chicago's starting rotation by winning nine consecutive decisions to start his season and by not losing a game until a contest against the Yankees, which he lost as the result of a balk. At the time, Grove became the second member of the White Sox to win nine consecutive decisions to start a season. The first pitcher to win nine straight games for the team was Lefty Williams in 1917, and the only one to do it since Grove was LaMarr Hoyt in 1982. On July 8, 1943, Grove nearly became one of the few pitchers in baseball history to pitch a no-hitter. In a game against the Yankees, he was one out away from pitching a no-hitter when Joe Gordon came up to bat. Gordon hit a double to left field that was fair by inches, ending Grove's closest bid for a Major League no-hitter. Grove finished the season with career bests in ERA (2.75), wins (15), and complete games (18). He led the White Sox that season in ERA, wins, innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts; at the time, Grove was the youngest pitcher on the team's staff. Grove's personal life improved along with his career. On January 8, 1944, he married Catherine Sloan, having met her at a party thrown for the White Sox by her father, Francis Sloan, a year and a half earlier. Grove started the 1944 season with an interesting honor: he was assigned to the 4-F All-Star team, a group of 25 major league players who were the best of those exempt from military service. Grove was given the job of being the Opening Day starting pitcher for the White Sox. He pitched the first game of the season against the Cleveland Indians and their starting pitcher, Al Smith, on April 19, 1944, and won 3‚Äì1. Grove also managed to shut out the Yankees on May 18; it was the first time the Yankees had not scored a run in 1944. By mid-season, Grove had seven wins, six losses, five complete games, and a 3.40 ERA. Because of these statistics, he was selected to the American League All-Star team, his first and only career appearance. Five American League pitchers pitched in the All-Star Game on July 11, although Grove was one of the four on the roster who did not; therefore, his lone All- Star appearance was indeed only an appearance. During the second half of the season, Grove performed well at Comiskey Park, but struggled on the road, at one point losing five straight games despite good run support from the White Sox. Grove finished the season with 14 wins, 15 losses, an ERA of 3.72, two shutouts, and a career best of nearly 235 innings pitched. There was a sense of closure for Grove before the beginning of the 1945 season, as he was awarded $310 ($ today) in damages for the auto accident in 1941. He held out for a new contract in the off-season, and finally signed with the White Sox a couple weeks before the beginning of the season after becoming the last remaining holdout. Grove was the workhorse of the White Sox, leading the team in games pitched (33) and started (30), while remaining the youngest pitcher on the roster. He finished the season with 217 pitched innings, a career best four shutouts, a 14‚Äì12 record, and a 3.44 ERA. The 1946 season saw Grove persist as a stable part of the White Sox pitching rotation. He pitched in 33 games during the season, second to closer Earl Caldwell, and started in 26, second to Ed Lopat's 29. His best outing of the season occurred on August 3 against the Washington Senators. Grove pitched a complete game and threw to the minimum 27 batters, allowing three hits and a walk, all of which were negated by double plays. He finished the season with more losses than wins because he was eager to succeed and was trying too hard, and because of this the coaching staff planned to make Grove into \\"as good a pitcher most of the time as he is some of the time\\". At the end of the 1946 season, Grove had eight wins and 13 losses, a 3.02 ERA, 10 complete games, and a league-leading 10 wild pitches. Later career During the off-season, while preparations were underway for the 1947 season, Grove was the subject of trade discussions. Most notably, White Sox manager Ted Lyons and Cleveland Indians president Bill Veeck discussed trading him for Indians pitcher Steve Gromek, but the deal was nixed when they could not come to an agreement. As the season began, Grove remained part of the rotation, which was led by Lopat and included Joe Haynes and Frank Papish. While Grove started off the season well, he struggled through the middle of the year, going from May 18 to August 2 without winning a game. As a result, he was benched, and finished the season with 19 starts in 25 pitching appearances. For the first time, Grove finished a full season with an ERA above 4.00. He ended the season with six wins, eight losses, a 4.44 ERA, and six complete games. Grove spent the off-season working in the men's furnishings department of Henry C. Lytton's department store in Chicago. In the 1948 season, the White Sox faced difficult decisions regarding their pitching staff and starting rotation. In the midst of Caldwell's departure and Papish's absence for most of the preseason, Grove remained a starter heading into the season, having pitched decently during spring training. In his final exhibition matchup of the season against Johnny Schmitz, Grove pitched the full nine innings and the White Sox defeated the Chicago Cubs 1‚Äì0, making Grove the only White Sox pitcher to throw a complete game during the preseason. By the end of May, Grove was the lone White Sox pitcher with a complete game through the first several weeks of the season. However, Grove eventually lost his starting job, and by the end of the season, he had two wins, 10 losses, a 6.16 ERA, and had started 11 games out of 32 total pitching appearances. As the 1949 season began, Grove was again the subject of trade rumors. The Detroit Tigers agreed to trade an outfielder, presumably Don Lund or Jimmy Outlaw, in exchange for Grove, although the Tigers denied the existence of such a deal, stating \\"We need pitching, but I don't think Grove would help us.\\" Grove pitched one game during the season on April 27, 1949, allowing four runs in two-thirds of an inning. In his one appearance against the Indians, he hit Lou Boudreau with a pitch, which prompted concern until X-rays revealed Boudreau's left elbow was only bruised. Shortly afterward, Grove was demoted to the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League, having pitched his final major league game. During his inaugural season at Sacramento, he was part of a pitching quartet that included Ken Holcombe, Bob Gillespie, and Frank Dasso, and was declared by Sporting News sportswriter John B. Old as \\"the best any Coast League club ever had.\\" Over the course of the next three seasons, Grove continued to pitch for the Solons. He was one of the workhorses of the 1950 squad, finishing the season with 17 victories. His contract with the Solons promised him part of the purchase price if he was sold to the majors. When this did not occur, he considered quitting baseball and devoting himself full-time to his uncle's trucking business. However, Grove continued to play, and pitched 159 innings in 1951, compiling an 8‚Äì9 record. There was talk of his retiring in the off-season; however, Grove ended up playing part of the 1952 season, making his season debut on June 10 and playing for the rest of the season. After the season ended, Grove was traded to the Portland Beavers, and refused to report, choosing instead to pitch at the semi-pro level. Grove stated, \\"I'm now pitching for Earl Smith Motors Pontiac sales service\\", signaling the end of his professional baseball career. Later life After his retirement from baseball, Grove continued to work with his uncle. His legacy lived on in his nephew, Wayne Grove. While playing for the Bellwood Lions of the Chicago Little League, Wayne pitched a no-hitter and struck out 15, and narrowly missed a perfect game when a runner got on base with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. Despite an unimpressive Major League career, Grove earned a few votes for induction into the Hall of Fame, receiving five votes in the 1958 balloting (1.9% of the required votes needed) and seven in the 1960 balloting (2.6% of the required votes needed). Grove had four children and four grandchildren, and later was the co-owner of a car wash in Sacramento, California for 20 years. He became close friends with Joe Gordon, the player who broke up Grove's no-hitter, after moving to Sacramento. Grove died in Carmichael, California on April 20, 1992, and is buried alongside his wife, Catherine.

The copper binding domain of the protein is located at the amino-terminal end, while the carboxyl-terminal end is rich in hydroxyproline and serine residues, typical of proteins associated with cell walls of plants. In addition, it is also heavily glycosylated.UCLA-DOE Institute for Genomics and ProteomicsPeisach, J., Power, L., Blumberg, W., Chance, B., Biophysical Journal, 38, 277-285, 1982. Abstract The copper is tetrahedrally coordinated by a cysteine, 2 histidines, and a glutamine residue. The glutamine residue takes place of a methionine ligand typically found in other blue copper proteins. In addition, electron transfer rates for stellacyanin are faster than for other type I copper proteins suggesting stellacyanin is more solvent accessible at the active site. The exact function of stellacyanin is unknown. However, given the fact that type I copper proteins are involved in electron transfer and stellacyanin appears to be associated with the plant cell wall, it is suggested that it is involved in oxidative cross-linking reactions to build polymeric material making up the cell wall.

The high dam is of concrete buttress construction and impounds the River Haddeo to provide a water storage capacity of some 21,000 megalitres over an area of . Aggregate for the dam came from a quarry at Bampton and sand from Uffculme. These were combined to give a pinkish tinge to blend in with the local geology. The tributary valleys include the River Pulham, which passes the village of Brompton Regis and continues to Hartford where it joins the Haddeo. At times of low flow in the River Exe, water is released into the river for abstraction downstream at Tiverton and Exeter. The effects of this regulation of the water flow from the lake have been studied by comparing the regulated River Haddeo and the neighbouring (unregulated) River Pulham. It showed that the main thermal effects of impoundment and regulation have been to raise mean water temperature, eliminate freezing conditions, depress summer maximum values, delay the annual cycle and reduce diurnal fluctuation. In 2001 - 2002 South West Water commissioned a detailed assessment of fish population, physical habitat, flow and water quality data within the River Haddeo, since it has been subject to regulated releases from Wimbleball Reservoir, to identify potential bottlenecks restricting the development of juvenile salmon populations. Managed by the charity South West Lakes Trust, the lake offers a popular location for walking, camping, birdwatching, angling, sailing, windsurfing, canoeing, rowing and kayaking. In December 2005 the trust was successful in obtaining funding for a ¬£1 million project to provide a new rowing store, conversion of barn space into showers and changing areas, new sports equipment, an accessible bird hide, and interpretation, improved access, and signage around the site. In 2006 a new ¬£1 million activity centre opened.

To the east sits Citicorp Center building and to the south, residential-complex of Presidential Towers. In the base of the building, there is a Starbucks Coffee and a restaurant bar, Slightly Toasted. The building is anchored by West Madison Street, West Washington Street, North Jefferson Street and North Clinton streets. It was completed in 2003. The building has a total of 29 floors that span 453 feet. Cost are estimated to have been near $387 million (US). It took approximately 3 years to erect. The goal was to bring together all office workers in Chicago who comprised the staff of the five buildings the company occupied previous to the construction of the Plaza. When the building was acquired by Bank of America as part of the company's acquisition of LaSalle Bank from ABN AMRO in the spring of 2008, the green and yellow shield icon was removed from the building's top. In December 2012, Bank of America sold the building to a group of New York investors for $350 million. It was the largest office transaction in Chicago that year, both in price and cost per square foot.

Khala Shahab, as he was referred to by those who worked with him, was considered one of the most influential modern Kurdish politician, whose progressive ideology help shape the politics and political ideology of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Khala Shahab grew up yearning to help the oppressed and was not bound by borders. On a number of occasions, Khala Shahab traveled to Lebanon, Yemen and Syria making contact with global liberation leftist organizations. Khala Shahab inspired his cousin Shaswar Jalal [Shahid Aram], Faraidoun Abdul Qadir and a number of other left-leaning Kurdish nationalists to make international contacts and put forward the Kurdish cause. Prior to forming the Komalay Ranjdaran Khala Shahab joined the mainstream Kurdish movement and partook in the September Revolution and joined the Ahmadist faction within Kurdistan Democratic Party.  Arrest  In late 1975 the Komalay Ranjdaran was faced with a series of arrests against their cadres. The first to get arrested was Anwar Zorab in the city of Baghdad by the Iraqi Secret Security Organization Amin al Khas.

According to Awat Abdulghafur and Ali Pichkol who were sentenced to six years in Abu Ghraib prison Khala Shahab gave the following speech to his comrades: > \\"Brothers, we chose this path in life, we all knew very well this is a long > and torturous road and involves a long journey. This is the true path of our > nation, we must endure its pains, detentions, wounds; we must be prepared to > face being refugees, endure hunger and ready to become martyrs; I must state > none of these hindrances derailed us and we are not afraid of our destiny. > You, my brothers are the righteous ones, don't abandon our cause.

Komala will not fade away, but rather our martyrdom will only > empower it. Let the truth be known, you must not shed any tears of our > deaths. I, for one do not regret the path I have chosen, on the contrary, I > embrace my choices and the righteous path I have chosen. I urge you to > replace your tears for us with continuous struggle and take lessons from our > experience to assist our brothers in Komala so as to strengthen our ranks > and files so as to expedite our nation's ultimate freedom from the grip of > Arabization, force Baathification and forced migration of Kurds to Arab > regions. You must now be more active, to live a short life, but live it > proud, so Live Short, but live proud! Only by living proud we can free our > nation.

Reviews to the album were mixed to favorable. Victoria Seagle of NME wrote in her review, \\"There isn't a single hint of pantomime, no self-parodic angst. You doubt they know what Napster is, let alone give a damn. Instead, they just flip the hinge in their heads and let the Amen breakdown begin... Disgusted, frustrated, paranoid; it's hard to imagine what could help them with their minds. But as psycho therapy, 'We Have Come For Your Parents' is the pipe-bomb.\\" In a less favorable review, Blabbermouth.net's wrote, \\"Although AMEN should be credited for pursuing a style that has little in common with their Southern Californian counterparts, the group's tuneless, noisy approach gets tiresome very quickly, with Casey's obnoxious, high-pitched screaming proving to be more irritating than effective, in the process adding a touch of abrasiveness to the songs that is bound to turn off many a discriminating listener. Punknews.org, in a 4.5 out of 5 star rating, wrote, \\"it is quite possibly one of the most angry, violent and frenetic albums released in the past ten years... Overall I think this album was quite possibly one of the most overlooked albums of the past few years\\" Rock Sound voted Amen's \\"We Have Come For Your Parents\\" as the 2nd best album of the year.

Playing career=Ajax and Fortuna Sittard Sneekes started as a Youth player at Ajax Amsterdam, and made 22 appearances for Netherlands National Schoolboys. He made his debut for Ajax at the age of 16, and broke through into the Netherlands U21 team, but never quite fulfilled his potential for the club and was transferred out at the age of 21. After a short spell at Volendam Sneekes signed for Fortuna Sittard and spent four years at the club after which he moved to FC Locarno in Switzerland before being transferred to England. Bolton Wanderers Sneekes first came to prominence in England when he signed for Bolton Wanderers in August 1994 for ¬£200,000. He was part of their team that won promotion to the Premier League that season, but was a casualty the following season when Bolton struggled in the Premier League and was transferred shortly before the end of the season. Whilst at Bolton he played in the 1995 Football League Cup Final. West Bromwich Albion Alan Buckley signed the Dutchman for West Bromwich Albion in March 1996 for ¬£400,000. Despite Buckley claiming it would be a while before he made any difference, Sneekes almost immediately became a cult hero at The Hawthorns. Sneekes was an overnight sensation, and many of the Baggies crowd took to wearing long blond wigs - even the club shop was selling them. Sneekes finished his first season with ten goals from thirteen games, arguably for some Albion fans saving them from relegation. Sneekes spent seven seasons at West Brom before finally being transferred at the start of the 2001‚Äì02 season. After Sneekes' retirement in 2007, he went on to captain West Bromwich Albion in the Midlands 'Masters' and has done so ever since. He scored in the 2008 and 2011 tournaments. Stockport, Hull and Herf√∏lge He moved to Stockport County on a free transfer in September 2001, but stayed just two months before a move to Hull City. That move also didn't work out and he left the latter club in May 2002. A further year was spent with Danish club Herf√∏lge BK, before retiring from the professional game at the age of 34. Hinckley United Sneekes was convinced to come out of retirement following a chance meeting with Hinckley United manager Dean Thomas, at the Hong Kong Sixes tournament in July 2007. Sneekes initially trained with the Conference North club, but then decided to sign for them. However his debut was put on hold as his International Clearance was sought after last playing in Denmark. He eventually made his debut in Hinckley's 4-2 FA Cup win over Grantham Town in September 2007. However, a disastrous start for Hinckley United in the league meant that Sneekes was released, after playing only three games for the club, in October 2007. Sneekes immediately went back into retirement, saying \\"The fact that I was not really enjoying it meant that it became too much of a chore to do it\\". Dudley Town On Monday 27 September 2010, it was revealed in local newspapers that Richard Sneekes had signed for Dudley Town, who play in the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division. Richard Sneekes' son, Giorgio also signed for the club in the 2010/2011 season.http://www.dudleytownfc.org.uk/news/index.php?id=259 Richard made his debut in Dudley's 2‚Äì2 draw at Shifnal Town on 5 October 2010.

It was nominated for a 2008 Hugo Award in the Best Novel category. Plot synopsis John Perry and Jane Sagan, the former Ghost Brigade clone of Perry's dead wife, are offered positions as leaders for the new colony of Roanoke, which will comprise human settlers from the first ten established human colonies. After deliberating, they decide to accept and go with Zoe to the new colony. In tow are Zoe's Obin protectors, named Hickory and Dickory, who view her with almost religious awe due to her father's success in giving the Obin consciousness. Upon arriving, the colonists quickly realize they are not at Roanoke. They are approached by a member of the Special Forces of the CDF, adapted to live in space, who had attached himself to the exterior of their craft. He informs them they have no option but to land and begin the colony anyway. The ship has been irreparably damaged to prevent the craft from leaving orbit, and all the colonists are considered quarantined from the rest of the Colonial Union. The Conclave (a group that wants to stop humanity's expansion) was aware of the original position of Roanoke, and therefore was waiting to annihilate them. He further tells them that to isolate them fully, they are forbidden from using any advanced technology. This is offset by the presence of the Mennonites, an Amish-like group of colonists who are familiar with the large amount of basic machinery that the CDF had given the colonists. The colony proceeds with surprisingly little initial difficulty. Several colonists are killed by stone- age-level werewolf-like creatures who view them as potential prey, but otherwise begin to settle into the colony. After a certain length of time, they are again visited by Special Forces, who inform them that the plan has partially succeeded, and the initial restrictions on technology have been lifted. The Union attempted to destabilize the Conclave by making them appear incompetent, due to their inability to find a single colony despite a year's worth of searching. After a brief interlude when their location is leaked to the Conclave, they are visited by the Conclave fleet, consisting of a single ship from every member race of the Conclave. The Conclave leader, General Gau, begs John to either give up the colony or secede from the Union and join the Conclave. John refuses, and asks General Gau to surrender. Baffled, the General tells John to make his peace, and orders the Conclave fleet to open fire. Almost immediately, the entire fleet is annihilated. Special Forces members, during the prior year, had methodically tracked down every ship in the Conclave fleet and attached an antimatter bomb to the hull. The officer who accompanied the erstwhile Roanoke colonists then waited for every Conclave ship to arrive before detonating the explosives, save the leader's craft. This shatters the Conclave into multiple factions, several of which swear vengeance on the Union. Jane staves off an attempted attack from one faction, remotely controlling the colony's defense lasers, although some people are killed. After the attack, John is arrested for almost ruining the plan to destroy the enemy fleet by asking General Gau to surrender. He is eventually released, and after speaking with Special Forces again, returns to New-Roanoke. He realizes that New-Roanoke is a sacrificial pawn. If New-Roanoke is destroyed, enlistment in the CDF will spike using the destruction of the colony as a rally cry, allowing for a more aggressive campaign against the other alien races. This however will cause humanity's eventual extinction through a war of attrition. John abdicates the leadership of New-Roanoke and joins the Conclave, after being awarded a ship by them as his sovereign domain, with help from the Obin. Together with the other members of the Conclave, he visits (forbidden, isolated) Earth to reveal what has been occurring in the rest of the universe and to update them on the Conclave's level of technology. The Colonial Union is thrown into disarray, with enlistment plummeting and potential colonists demurring, but the end of the book suggests that bringing Earth into the Union properly will allow for more diplomatic solutions and cooperation between species.

WRP purchased CTC Board magazine from Hundman Publishing after the May 2006 issue, and rebranded the magazine as Railroads Illustrated, and used the CTC Board name for the news section. December 2014 marked the final monthly issue, with future expanded editions to be released annually. The news section and some feature content now appears in an expanded Railfan & Railroad, which was acquired by WRP in 2014. CTC Board (1970-2006) Railroads Illustrated was originally published as CTC Board (ISSN 0164-8373), a monthly magazine devoted to railroad photography, rail industry and tourist railroad news, and historical articles, from 1970 to 2006. The magazine's name referred to the centralized traffic control displays used by train dispatchers to control rail traffic across a given territory. The magazine's well-known cover logo was an Alaska Railroad F-unit. January 1995 issueIt originally was a mimeographed leaflet by Dean Lewis of Castro Valley, California, and later was published by David Styffe in Southern California; HyRail Productions of Denver, Colorado; then Hundman Publishing, of Edmonds, Washington. The editor until the July 2005 issue was Dale Sanders. From August 2005 until the final issue, the magazine was edited by author Paul D. Schneider. Mark W. Hemphill (later editor of Trains magazine), then rail photographer Brian Rutherford, were production editors for many years. While the magazine's focus was on railroad photography, it included current news for railfans, as well as articles from railroad professionals such as Jack Wheelihan of General Motors' Electro- Motive Division, and Bob Eisthen, a private investment analyst. Among CTC Board's notable works was a series devoted to the last logging railroads in North America, the race for high-horsepower locomotives in the U.S. during the 1960s, photo essays showcasing the work of U.S. railroad photographers, and a retrospective on the end of the Milwaukee Road's Pacific Coast Extension. In addition, the magazine explored thematic issues, such as \\"Storm Light,\\" (photographs taken under stormy weather conditions), \\"Black and White Forever\\" (showcasing contemporary black-and-white photography), and photographs taken on a single day, entitled a \\"Day in North America.\\" Final monthly edition, December 2014 Railroads Illustrated (2007-2014) CTC Board ended production in 2006, with the June issue (No. 332) becoming the final issue using that name. With owner/publisher Bob Hundman seeking retirement, the magazine was sold to White River Productions (WRP), publisher of Passenger Train Journal and other magazines. WRP renamed the magazine Railroads Illustrated (ISSN 1071-8311), the CTC Board name being retained for the news section. WRP's production began with No. 333, published in February 2007, with Cinthia Priest as editor. Railroads Illustrated Annual (2014-present) When WRP acquired Railfan & Railroad magazine in 2014, it was decided to end monthly production of Railroads Illustrated. Future editions of Railroads Illustrated would be released on an annual special edition schedule. Monthly subscribers would receive Railfan & Railroad beginning with the January 2015 issue. When White River Productions acquired Railfan & Railroad magazine in September 2014, it was decided to transfer the best features of Railroads Illustrated to the new expanded monthly format including the news columns and the closing Parting Shot image on the final page. The last monthly edition was published in December 2014, and the publication was converted into an annual. The new 100-page Railroads Illustrated Annual publication focuses on creative railroad photography, featuring subjects both current and historical. All content is sourced from outside contributors who are regular readers of the publication. In 2019, Steve Jessup succeeded Cinthia Priest as editor of Railroads Illustrated Annual.

Statue by Pierre Le Gros the Younger, 1702-03, Rome, Jesuit Novitiate Flooring in a fireplace at Modave Castle executed in Noir Belge in combination with white Carrara Marble and Rouge Belge. Noir Belge (Belgian Black) is collective noun referring to black limestone found on several sites in Belgium. Some trade names refer more specifically to the quarry were the material was found, for example \\"Noir de Mazy\\" or \\"Noir de Golzinne\\". Some Noir belge marble deposit belongs to a fine-grained calcareous sedimentary formation dated Frasnian era (Upper Devonian ‚Äì around 360 million years ago) and located on the northern border of Namur sedimentary basin. A few black limestones located in the lower Carboniferous (near the city of Dinant) * Catherine Cnudde / Jean-Jacques Harotin / Jean-Pierre Majot: Pierres et Marbres de Wallonie. Bruxelles (Archives d'Architecture Moderne) 1988, S. 21 To the naked eye the differences between the black marbles from different quarries are almost impossible to determine. Good \\"Belgian Black\\" is dug as an inconspicuous grey stone but becomes immaculately deep black and shining as it is polished. Its relative scarcity is due to the difficult exploiting conditions (quarries in underground operation, for example of Golzinne and Bioul). Today it is one of the most expensive marbles in the world.  History  Master Sculptor Ugo Togni in Pietrasanta (Italy) with gigantic Noir Belge marble statues-January 2007 \\"Noir Belge\\" has been exploited since Roman Antiquity when the Belgian provinces belonged to the Roman Imperium (Gallia Belgica). It was used in mosaics in local villas. The name \\"Paragone del Belgio\\" or \\"Diaspro del Belgio\\" of this marble originated from the use of Belgium black stones to test the content of gold in coinage. Since Renaissance the \\"Noir Belge\\" marble was widely used as a decorative construction material. Due to its immaculate velvety black appearance and its remarkable high gloss, it was preferred by artisans across Europe. It became exceedingly widespread since it was preferred as the deep-black background for the colourful Intarsia or Pietra dura works from the Florentine Medici workshop founded in 1588. \\"Noir Belge\\" was even used by Italian artisans in the intarsia decoration of the Taj Mahal in India. In northern Europe, especially in Belgium and France, \\"Noir Belge\\" was also applied to large decorative structures such as stairs, floorings, altars, fireplaces... It was often used in combination with white marble imported from Carrara but also with local red and grey marbles. It was applied on a large scale in chessboard floorings, for example in the Palace of Versailles and the Chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte. Until the 1930s it remained popular in Art Deco decorations such as clocks and vases. From First World War onward, the difficulties linked to the underground exploration of the quarries combined with the progressive exhaustion of the precious resource led to a progressive limitation of the use of this marble to the most exclusive and prestigious architectural and artistic creations.

Jones resigned from her position in 2007 when it became known she had fabricated her academic degrees from Union College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on a job application in 1979 and she had added a fabricated degree to her resume from Albany Medical College sometime \\"after she was hired.\\" The Times characterized Jones's earlier prestige as \\"the guru of the movement to tame the college-admissions frenzy.\\" The Boston Globe called her \\"the most celebrated and outspoken admissions dean in America.\\" After her resignation, she became the number 2 newsmaker of the day on COUNTDOWN with Keith Olbermann for \\"begging college applicants not to pad their resumes\\" while having done so herself. Jones was first hired by MIT as an entry-level admissions officer in 1979; she was later promoted to associate director of admissions. She then served as interim dean of admissions from May 1997 until January 1998, when she was appointed to the position full-time. Resignation On April 23, 2007, Jones resigned her position after MIT learned she had fabricated her academic degrees from Union College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute when she first applied for an entry-level admissions officer position with MIT in 1979 and she had fabricated \\"a degree\\" from Albany Medical College \\"after she was hired.\\" MIT administrators were alerted to the discrepancy on or around April 16, 2007. MIT has not released the name of the person or persons who alerted them about Jones's background. Jones issued a statement on the MIT web site, in which she admitted to wrongdoing: A spokesperson from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute reported on April 26, 2007, that Jones attended the institute as a \\"part-time, non- matriculating student\\" from September 1974 to June 1975 and did not receive a degree. Spokespeople from Union College and from Albany Medical College both reported that there are no records of Jones ever attending either institution. On May 2, 2007, it was reported that she had actually earned a bachelor's degree in biology from The College of Saint Rose in 1973, though she did not list that degree when applying for her first job at MIT or when being considered for subsequent promotions. When Jones was appointed to the position of Dean of Admissions in 1998, she was credited with having earned an \\"SB and an SM in biology from Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute\\" in an article published in The Tech as well as an article published by MIT Tech Talk. Neither article made any mention of the degree from Union College which she had placed on her resume in 1979 nor of a Ph.D. credited to her several times in 2007. Shortly before her resignation, she was referred to by the title \\"Dr. Marilee Jones\\" in a number of forums. A biography of her on the website for the 2007 September Conference of the National Association of College Admission Counselors referred to her as \\"Dr. Marilee Jones, Ph.D.\\" and credited her with degrees from RPI and Albany Medical in biology and chemistry but offered no further details. She was also referred to as \\"Dr. Marilee Jones\\" in the local Concord press in April 2007. A February 2007 NPR transcript from All Things Considered referred to her as \\"Dr. Marilee Jones\\" (though the audio program itself did not address her as \\"Dr\\"). And a brief bio of her for an April 17, 2007 speaking engagement at Kean University's Annual School Counselor Conference referred to her as \\"Dr. Marilee Jones.\\" When asked in a December 6, 2009 interview with the Chronicle of Higher Education about having added \\"a degree\\" from Albany Medical to her resume \\"after she was hired\\" by MIT, Jones did not dispute the fact. She could not, however, remember the details. After her departure from MIT Jones created her own consulting firm which provides college admissions advice to both institutions and applicants. She also claimed she was offered the position of Dean of Admissions at several universities, which she declined. In 2008, she hired Rose Marie Terenzio, a public relations consultant who was the former personal assistant of John F. Kennedy Jr, to help her make a \\"reclamation\\", a \\"comeback\\". Awards In 2001, Jones received MIT's Excellence Award for Leading Change, which recognized Jones's leadership as dean of admissions. An excerpt from the presentation reads: Jones also received MIT's Gordon Y. Billard Award \\"for special service of outstanding merit performed for the Institute\\" in 2006. Personal Jones is divorced from Steven R. Bussolari, an engineer at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. They have one daughter.

He then joined the Los Angeles Times in 1983 as a staff writer for the paper's Orange County edition. Initially reporting on high school sports, Penner went on to cover a variety of national and international sporting events, including the Olympics, Major League Baseball, tennis, and World Cup soccer. Transsexuality Later in his career, in addition to covering sports, Penner began writing about transsexual identity and the process of gender transition from an autobiographical perspective. The first such piece he wrote for the Times was an essay entitled \\"Old Mike, New Christine\\", which appeared in the paper in April 2007. In it, he wrote about his lifelong struggle to come to terms with his transsexuality: Penner lived and wrote as Christine Daniels for more than a year, continuing to document his own experience with gender transition in the LA Times' blog \\"Woman in Progress\\". Daniels' writing became a source of hope for people across the country with gender-identity issues. Penner wrote as Christine Daniels from July 2007 until about March 2008; without elaboration, he resumed using Mike Penner as his byline in October 2008. Penner was a member of the Times' sports staff at the time of his death. Personal life Penner was at one time married to fellow Los Angeles Times sportswriter Lisa Dillman although at the time of his death they were divorced. Penner was found dead in his Los Angeles home on November 28, 2009, of an apparent suicide.

Entering a Jesuit gymnasium in 1932, he later attended the Superior School of Philosophy and Theology in Fulda, and the seminary in Neuzelle. During World War II, Bengsch was drafted by the German Army; in the course of his service, he was wounded and captured by the United States Army in August 1944. He was eventually ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Konrad von Preysing on April 2, 1950. Bengsch then did pastoral work in Berlin until 1954, when he began teaching at the seminary in Erfurt, of which he was named regent on April 1, 1959. From 1956 to 1959, he also served as a professor at Neuzelle's seminary. On May 2, 1959, Bengsch was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Berlin and Titular Bishop of Tubia.

Further, applied academics can be viewed as theoretical knowledge supporting practical applications.  Definition  Applied Academics is an approach to learning which focuses on motivating and challenging students to connect what they learn with the world they experience and with what interests them. The basic premise is that if academic content is made more relevant, participatory and concrete, students learn better, retain more and apply learning in their lives. Teaching in this model uses hands-on innovative teaching methods sometimes called contextual learning. Teachers help students understand the reasons for studying their subject matter and capitalize on students' natural learning inclinations and problem-solving approaches they can use well beyond the classroom throughout their lives. Applied Academics is an attempt to break from disconnected learning (where students go to different classes for different subjects for specified periods of time and don't gain a sense of the interconnectedness of learning) that has become a part of traditional approaches to education. This approach attempts to reintegrate learning by doing such things (for example) as teaching math, science, writing, or speech within other contexts such as a learning experience dealing with some form of technology training.  Research in cognitive science  Research in cognitive science has shown that learners are not passive receptacles into which knowledge may be \\"poured\\". Learning occurs when the learner constructs, invents, and solves problems. Studies have shown that students taught theoretical principles, processes and skills in isolation without practice do not transfer these skills and knowledge as well to real life situations. Although \\"learning to know,\\" \\"learning to do,\\" and their \\"application\\" are often separated, there is no effective learning or understanding of one kind without the other two. Relating to the SCANS Competencies In the United States the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) states that \\"good jobs require people who can put knowledge to work\\", and listed the knowledge (academics) that it considered critical for all students to possess. These competencies include: * Knowing how to effectively allocate time, money, materials, space, and staff * The ability to work on a team, teach, serve customers, lead, negotiate and work with people from culturally diverse backgrounds * Understanding how to effectively acquire, evaluate, and use data * Understanding and ability to design and improve social, organizational, and technological systems * The ability to effectively use technology Relating to action research The concept of action research is related to Applied Academics, as one tenet of action research is to discover theory through practice, and then implement using the foundation of theory.

It is named after √Årni Magn√∫sson, a 17th-18th century collector of medieval Icelandic manuscripts. The √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute () was an academic institute located in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. The institute had the task of preserving and studying mediaeval Icelandic manuscripts containing Landn√°ma, Heimskringla and the Icelandic sagas. On 1 September 2006, this institute was merged with the Icelandic Language Institute, the University of Iceland Institute of Lexicography, the Sigur√∞ur Nordal Institute, and the Place-Name Institute of Iceland to create the current √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies. It is a university institution with its own board and financing. The Minister of Education, Science and Culture appoints a five- member board for four-year terms. Three members are appointed according to nomination by the University Senate and two without nomination, with one of those two acting as chairman. The Minister appoints a director for five-year terms on the recommendation of the board. Dr. V√©steinn √ìlason was appointed director of the Institute of Icelandic Studies on 12 September 2006. V√©steinn had been the director of the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute from 1 May 1999 until 1 September 2006, after which it was merged with four other institutes to create the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies. Professor Gu√∞r√∫n Nordal took over as director of the institute on 1 March 2009, appointed for a period of five years.  History  A page from a skin manuscript of Landn√°ma After Iceland received home rule from the Danish government in 1904, the Icelandic parliament (Al√æingi) began to petition for the return to Iceland of at least a significant portion of the Arnamagn√¶an Manuscript Collection, the manuscripts and other documents collected in the late 17th and early 18th centuries by the Icelandic antiquarian and scholar √Årni Magn√∫sson. In 1927-28 four manuscripts and some 700 charters and other legal documents were returned to the Icelandic National Archives. In 1962 a special institute was set up under the name Handritastofnun √çslands (English: \\"Icelandic Manuscript Institute\\"). Ten years later, after the transfer of manuscripts from Copenhagen had begun in earnest, the laws concerning the institute were changed and it was renamed Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar √° √çslandi (generally referred to as √Årnastofnun). It was administratively associated with the University of Iceland until 1 September 2006, when it merged with four other institutes in Iceland to create a larger independent institute of Icelandic studies, the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies.  Location  The Institute has long been located in the √Årnagar√∞ur building on the campus of the University of Iceland by Su√∞urgata in Reykjav√≠k, though the organisations that were merged into the Institute in 2006 continued to be based at different sites in Reykjav√≠k. In 2005, the Al√æingi approved the construction of a purpose-built H√∫s √≠slenskunnar ('House of Icelandic') or H√∫s √≠slenskra fr√¶√∞a ('House of Icelandic Studies') to house the whole Institute, standing on the other side of Su√∞urgata, beside the National Library of Iceland. Ground was broken in 2013 and a large hole dug before building work was temporarily halted following a change of government; the hole came to be known as the 'hola √≠slenskra fr√¶√∞a' ('hole of Icelandic studies').

She was convicted in 1917, along with her daughter, Winnie, and son-in-law, Alfred Mason, of conspiracy to murder the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. Some of the evidence given in the case against them appears to have been fabricated on behalf of \\"a government eager to disgrace the anti-war movement\\". Early life Alice Ann Marshall was born in Derby, England, the daughter of an engine driver who had worked as a house servant when young. In 1886 she married William Augustus Wheeldon, who was a widowed train driver and later a commercial traveller. They had three daughters, Nellie (born 1888), Harriette Ann (Hettie) (born 1891) and Winnie (born 1893), and a son, William Marshall (Willie, born 1892). Willie's application for exemption from military service as a conscientious objector was rejected in 1916. Political activism Wheeldon was a socialist. She was a friend of members of the Socialist Labour Party, especially John Smith Clarke although a source of membership is not known. On arrest, police reported finding copies of Socialist and The Tribunal in her house.TNA DPP 1/50 List of Exhibits She and her children, who shared her feminist political views and were active campaigners until Britain joined in the First World War. Wheeldon disagreed with the Women's Social and Political Union's (WSPU) strong support for the War and conscription. With her family, including her daughters Hettie and Winnie and son Willie, Wheeldon expressed her opposition to the War, joining the No-Conscription Fellowship. The Wheeldon family supported young men opposing conscription in Derby where Alice supported the family by selling secondhand clothes in her shop at 12 Pear Tree Road, where she and her family lived - incorrectly reported as number 29. Arrest and trial In custody at Derby Police Station, January 1917: a police matron, Hettie Wheeldon, Winnie Mason, and Alice Wheeldon It was known that the Wheeldon family was sheltering young men \\"on the run\\" from conscription. In December 1916 'Alex Gordon', an undercover agent from P.M.S.2, arrived at the Wheeldon home, claiming to be a conscientious objector on the run. Alice Wheeldon took him in for the night and confided in him. He invented the fiction that the work camps for conscientious objectors provided under the Home Office Scheme were guarded by dogs. Gordon called his immediate superior, Herbert Booth, introducing him to Alice as an army deserter. A package containing two vials of curare and two of strychnine was sent to her. The package was intercepted and it was claimed that these chemicals were intended to kill guard dogs at a work camp. This claim formed the basis of the case against the family when the family were arrested on 30 January 1917. Alice, Hettie, Winnie and Winnie's husband, Alfred Mason, were all charged with conspiracy to murder the Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Labour Party cabinet minister Arthur Henderson. The Attorney-General, F. E. Smith, himself, led the prosecution held in Derby Guildhall. The trial was moved to the Old Bailey, London, where he prosecuted the case in person. The trial began on 6 March 1917; Smith refused to call Gordon as a witness or divulge his name or whereabouts, thus preventing his being cross-examined. Alice was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude, Alfred Mason (aged 24) was sentenced to seven years and Winnie (aged 23) to five years, even though the jury recommended mercy on account of their youth. Hettie was acquitted. Alice was sent to Aylesbury Prison, where she went on intermittent hunger strike; she was later moved to Holloway. Three days after the conviction, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers published an open letter to the Home Secretary that included the following: \\"We demand that the Police Spies, on whose evidence the Wheeldon family is being tried, be put in the Witness Box, believing that in the event of this being done fresh evidence will be forthcoming which will put a different complexion on the case.\\" Review of the Wheeldon case In January 2012 the BBC reported on a campaign to clear Wheeldon's name, quoting Dr Nicholas Hiley of the University of Kent, who said the case against her was \\"shaky\\". Hiley said that during the First World War MI5 had become \\"very fixated on political opposition to the war\\" and that the Wheeldons' unusual combination of beliefs (Marxists, atheists, vegetarians, supporters of the suffragettes and conscientious objectors), had drawn MI5's attention. Hiley described Alex Gordon (in reality William Rickard) as an \\"unbalanced fantasist\\" who was \\"spectacularly unreliable\\": a convicted blackmailer, he had twice been declared criminally insane and was released from the high-security psychiatric Broadmoor Hospital only two years before being employed by MI5. Hiley went on to suggest that Rickard's department of MI5 was facing closure at the time of Mrs Wheeldon's arrest and the case against her and her family was fabricated to justify the department's being kept open. Death Wheeldon was released from prison on licence on 31 December 1917 at the request of Lloyd George. Her health permanently weakened, she died of influenza during the pandemic a little over a year later in 1919. At her funeral, Willie (possibly William Land, her nephew also a CO) placed a red flag over his mother's coffin and her friend John Smith Clarke, still evading police as a conscientious objector on the run, was the only speaker. Her daughters, Winnie and Hettie, were too ill to attend the funeral. Wheeldon's grave was not marked as there was concern it would be defaced. Hettie died in 1920; in that year she had married Arthur MacManus, first chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain. In 1921 Willie Wheeldon joined a Friends Emergency Victims of War Relief mission going to Buzuluk Russia,married in Russia, took Soviet Union citizenship and became a translator for the Comintern. During the Stalinist purges, he was arrested on 5 October 1937 and shot on Christmas Day of that year.Hochschild (2011), p. 231, based on Comintern personnel files, Moscow, 495/198/537 Memorial Blue Plaque on the building where Alice Wheeldon lived In 2013 Derby City Council and Derby Civic Society erected a Blue Plaque as a memorial at 12 Pear Tree Road, Normanton, Derby.

Biography Anstis E. Shepard was born in Middlefield, New York to David Spaulding Shepard and Rosella Bailey. She was the oldest of their two daughters. Her parents were devout members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She attended the Harwick Academy, and following her graduation she left home in 1854 to teach school in Haverstraw, New York, where she met John Druce, a member of the LDS Church. She was taught by Druce and baptized into the church on July 5, 1856. On August 31, 1856, she married George Hamilton Taylor, another convert, in Haverstraw. They left New York for Utah on April 15, 1859. She met with the Edward Stevenson Company that left from Quincy, Illinois, in June 1859 and arrived in Salt Lake City on September 16. In Utah, they started a successful lumber company. They were rebaptized and received their endowments from Brigham Young in the Endowment House. The couple had seven children, three of which died before reaching adulthood. In 1877, Taylor agreed to her husband marrying Louise (Louie) Foote; later in 1885, George took a third wife, Ella Susannah Colebrook. The following year, George was imprisoned for practicing polygamy. Taylor continued to support and defend plural marriage. At a meeting of the LDS Church's organization for adolescent girls held June 19, 1880, in the Assembly Hall on Temple Square, Taylor was appointed the first general president of the Young Ladies' National Mutual Improvement Association, the original name of the church's Young Women organization. Taylor was the general president of the organization until her death in 1904. Taylor held the first churchwide conference for young women in 1890. As president, she attended meetings of National Council of Women of the United States and International Council of Women throughout the 1890s. She also attended The World's Congress of Representative Women in 1893. Under her direction, Susa Young Gates founded the Young Woman's Journal, which began publication in 1889 and was published until 1929. Just prior to Taylor's death, she shortened the name of the YLNMIA to the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association. Taylor was succeeded by her second counselor, Martha H. Tingey. In 1888, Taylor and others met with Susan B. Anthony in Seneca Falls, New York, and participated in the founding of the National Council of Women of the United States, an organization dedicated to promoting the rights of women. In 1891, Taylor was appointed an ex officio vice president of the organization, a position she held until her death. Taylor died at her home in Salt Lake City.

It consists of 719 amino acid residues. The molecular weight of Protein L purified from the cell walls of Peptostreptoccus magnus was first estimated as 95kD by SDS-PAGE in the presence of reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol, while the molecular weight was determined to 76kD by gel chromotography in the presence of 6 M guanidine HCl. Protein L does not contain any interchain disulfide loops, nor does it consist of disulfide-linked subunits. It is an acidic molecule with a pI of 4.0. Unlike Protein A and Protein G, which bind to the Fc region of immunoglobulins (antibodies), Protein L binds antibodies through light chain interactions. Since no part of the heavy chain is involved in the binding interaction, Protein L binds a wider range of antibody classes than Protein A or G. Protein L binds to representatives of all antibody classes, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) and Fab fragments also bind to Protein L. Despite this wide binding range, Protein L is not a universal antibody-binding protein. Protein L binding is restricted to those antibodies that contain kappa light chains. In humans and mice, most antibody molecules contain kappa (Œ∫) light chains and the remainder have lambda (Œª) light chains. Protein L is only effective in binding certain subtypes of kappa light chains. For example, it binds human VŒ∫I, VŒ∫III and VŒ∫IV subtypes but does not bind the VŒ∫II subtype. Binding of mouse immunoglobulins is restricted to those having VŒ∫I light chains. Given these specific requirements for effective binding, the main application for immobilized Protein L is purification of monoclonal antibodies from ascites or cell culture supernatant that are known to have the kappa light chain. Protein L is extremely useful for purification of VLŒ∫-containing monoclonal antibodies from culture supernatant because it does not bind bovine immunoglobulins, which are often present in the media as a serum supplement. Also, Protein L does not interfere with the antigen-binding site of the antibody, making it useful for immunoprecipitation assays, even using IgM. Gene for protein L The gene for protein L contains five components: a signal sequence of 18 amino acids; a NH2-terminal region (\\"A\\") of 79 residues; five homologous \\"B\\" repeats of 72-76 amino acids each; a COOH terminus region of two additional \\"C\\" repeats (52 amino acids each); a hydrophilic, proline-rich putative cell wall-spanning region (\\"W\\") after the C repeats; a hydrophobic membrane anchor (\\"M\\"). The B repeats (36kD) were found to be responsible for the interaction with Ig light chains.[2] Other antibody binding proteins In addition to Protein L, other immunoglobulin-binding bacterial proteins such as Protein A, Protein G and Protein A/G are all commonly used to purify, immobilize or detect immunoglobulins. Each of these immunoglobulin-binding proteins has a different antibody binding profile in terms of the portion of the antibody that is recognized and the species and type of antibodies it will bind.

It was founded in Los Angeles, California on January 22, 1937 by its conductor, Dr. Ernst Katz (1914-2009). The Jr. Philharmonic enjoys the distinction of being the only orchestra in the world with its original conductor on the podium for over 69 years. The Jr. Philharmonic is a non-commercial venture. From its inception, it has been a family-run orchestra. Katz and his sister, Silvia Greene (n√©e Katz), were the initial managers of the orchestra. Later, Katz's niece and nephews took on managerial responsibilities; his great-nieces have also taken on significant roles in the operations of the orchestra. Motto and mission Dr. Katz, a piano prodigy, founded his youth orchestra in East Los Angeles in 1937. Throughout his life, spread his philosophy and motto, ‚ÄúGive Youth A Chance To Be Heard,‚Äù to more than 70,000 young people. 69th Anniversary and the Mayor's \\"Good Luck Candle\\" Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa lit a piece of Los Angeles‚Äô history at the Jr. Phil‚Äôs 69th Anniversary Concert Spectacular on April 26, 2006 when he lit the orchestra‚Äôs ‚ÄúMayor‚Äôs Good Luck Candle,‚Äù presented to founder-conductor Ernst Katz and his young people‚Äôs orchestra by the citizens of Olvera Street in 1947. First lit by Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowren at the orchestra‚Äôs 10th Anniversary, the candle symbolizes the important connection between the city of Los Angeles and youth in music as fostered by Katz. 70th Anniversary The Jr. Phil‚Äôs 70th anniversary was celebrated with a Platinum Concert Spectacular on June 10, 2007 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. The sponsor was Smith Barney. The concert highlighted the Jr. Philharmonic Orchestra with myriad composers, musicians, celebrities, plus an all-alumni orchestra. At the event, Katz's great-niece, Victoria Gordon, became the youngest-ever soloist at Walt Disney Concert Hall.https://allevents.in/santa%20monica/victoria-gordon-live- at-the-edye/1000048814259765 75th Anniversary The LA Junior Philharmonic celebrated its 75th Anniversary on June 6, 2012. This concert, which took place several years after the death of Dr. Katz, featured another alumni orchestra, led by Katz's nephew. Following the concert, the orchestra went on hiatus, with the intent to return for another alumni event at the next major anniversary. Current Status There was no alumni concert for the orchestra's 80th anniversary in 2017. However, the family's orchestral tradition continues, as Katz's nephew, Gary S. Greene, is the conductor of another Los Angeles-area orchestra, the LA Lawyers Philharmonic. His daughter is its Executive Director and his sister, Lori Greene Gordon, is the orchestra's harpist. Celebrity and Composer participation Over the years a wide array of famous celebrities and iconic composers of both film and stage have participated in the Jr. Phil's gala events including: Meredith Willson, Richard Pryor, Richard Sherman, Robert Sherman and the bassist from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Michael \\"Flea\\" Balzary (who is also an alum of the orchestra) to name only a few.

In 1803, Dr. Charles Alexander Warfield patented 510 acres under the name \\"Paternal Gift\\" to his son Gustavius. A colonial farmhouse was built circa 1860. The land originally belonged to Dr. Charles Alexander Warfield who patented the 510 acres to his son Gustavus Warfield. The Harding family of Howard County held the land until 1937, when Warwick Keegan acquired around 200 acres and the original farmhouse. Keegan modernized the house but died soon after, resulting in the sale of the land to Melvin and Prue Scheidt in 1946. The Scheidt family continued to use the land to farm cattle, horses, sheep, chickens and crops until 1995, at which point the land was developed. Melvin and Prue Scheidt's daughter-in-law, Susan Scheidt, singlehandedly developed what is now the Paternal Gift Farm neighborhood. She sought to preserve the original farming nature of the property by putting 75% of the land into farmland preservation. That land is used to operate a horse boarding facility featuring seven barns, which funds upkeep of the community property. A series of crimes involving the cutting of horse tails followed on the farm shortly afterward. The original farm is now subdivided and reduced to 3.748 acres. The Paternal Gift Farm development consists of 30 single family homes‚Äî28 new homes, the farm manager's home, and the original developer's home‚Äîon approximately . The property rests on the land triangle made between Maryland Route 216 (Highland road), Maryland route 108, and Hall Shop Road. Paternal Gift Farm is the recipient of several state and national awards. In 1997, the Home Builders Association of Maryland presented Paternal Gift Farm with two awards: \\"1997 LDC Award of Excellence\\" for excellence in design, planning and construction of a small single family development, and the \\"1997 Overall Project of the Year.\\" Also in 1997, the National Association of Conservation Districts presented Paternal Gift Farm with the \\"Outstanding Cooperator Award\\" for the environmentally sensitive way in which the property is subdivided and for dedicated responsible land management. The community was featured on an episode of Dream Builders in a segment called \\"Farms of Tomorrow\\".

He served as President of the Town Board of Trustees from 1899 to 1903. Captain Marston was born in Cutler, Maine in November 1835, and orphaned at age 9. He was eventually taken in by the Plummer family. Mr. Plummer was a seaman, and Marston decided at age 17 to follow in his footsteps. He started as a cabin boy, and worked himself up to first mate by 1859. In 1860, the Plummers decided to move to California, and Marston went with them, arriving in San Francisco in May 1860. Upon his arrival, he was made a captain and hired out to sea. His initial voyages were in the coastal lumber trade which stretched from California to Puget Sound in Washington. Later voyages took him to destinations throughout the Pacific, from Alaska, to Hawaii, Tahiti, China, Australia and New Zealand. Captain Marston brought the first load of Hawaiian sugar into the United States at San Francisco in September 1876 under the 1875 Treaty of Reciprocity between the U.S. and the Kingdom of Hawaii. In 1884, Captain Marston married Idela Reed in San Francisco. She too was a native of Maine, born in 1862. She grew up in Lawrence, Massachusetts and moved with her family to Hawaii in 1880. Idela came to San Francisco in June 1882 to take her teaching exam, and began working at schools in Shasta County and Mendocino County. Upon marriage, she sailed with Captain Marston, and learned how to navigate. The Marstons had six children: Sibyl (b. 1885), Ellery (b. 1886), Elsa (b. 1892), Otis (b. 1894), Vera (b. 1895), and Merle (b. 1903). Ellery died in 1888. When they were not at sea, the Marstons lived in various rooming houses in San Francisco. In May 1893, they moved into their own house in Berkeley located at the corner of Vine and Arch Streets. At the close of the 19th century, Captain Marston became the president of the Shipowners Association of San Francisco. He also served on the Board of Directors of Welsh and Co. (the \\"Planters Line\\"), a shipping company eventually acquired by Matson Lines. He was also a director of the Mercantile Trust Company, the First National Bank of Berkeley, and Boole and Sons Shipyards in Alameda, California. During his tenure as President of the Board of Trustees of the Town of Berkeley, Marston led the effort to purchase the site of the new town hall. Mrs. Marston was active in Berkeley civic affairs. She was secretary of the city's Playground Commission, and helped establish city recreation centers as well as city summer camps outside the city proper. She helped found the Berkeley League of Women Voters, and was active in the Berkeley Women's City Club and the Hillside Club. Captain Marston died of a stroke on April 10, 1926. His wife Idela, who was considerably younger than he, died almost exactly 30 years later on April 11, 1956, also of a stroke.

Clark, a locomotive driver with the Great Western Railway, did not play any cricket until he was 25, when he began playing for a railways team. Three years later he was called into the Somerset side for five matches when regular wicketkeeper Wally Luckes was ill. He took eight catches, and Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for 1931 said that he \\"rendered useful service in that capacity\\". He stood up to the wicket to all bowlers, even the fastest. The county offered him a professional contract but he decided to stay with the railway.Irving Rosenwater, \\"And never a run did come\\", The Cricketer, December 1975, pp. 23, 28. Clark is chiefly remembered as a batsman. In nine innings in the five games, he failed to score a single run. This article was first published in the July 1988 edition of Wisden Cricket Monthly. In the match against Northamptonshire at Kettering, he was not out in both innings and failed to score, but otherwise he was out for 0, bowled five times and caught twice. Nine innings is believed to be the record for a first-class cricketer who failed to score a single run. John Howarth of Nottinghamshire played in 13 matches without scoring, but batted only seven times. In Clark's obituary in Wisden 1996 edition, it is reported that the Essex and England bowler Peter Smith, bowling Essex to an overwhelming victory at Colchester, attempted to give him a run. He bowled so gently to Clark that the ball bounced twice before reaching the batsman. Clark was still bowled by it. In club cricket, Clark reckoned his highest score was three. Clark remained with the railway until he retired to Weston-super-Mare in 1965.

Plot Wilson prepares a 14-year-old leukemia patient named Nick for a last resort bone-marrow transplant from his younger brother, Matty. However, when his brother sneezes, the team must figure out what is wrong with him before the transplant can occur. With only 5 days left for Nick, the team resorts to worsening Matty's condition to reveal what it is and treat it quickly. Meanwhile, Foreman is busy checking the donor list to provide a riskier but immediate bone marrow donor. The first transplant does not work, and Nick is dying. House convinces Nick that if he is going to die, he should die saving Matty. House proposes that if Matty's bone marrow is transplanted into Nick, whatever Matty has will spread and kill Nick, but will tell the team Matty's condition. The boys' parents originally oppose this, but are convinced by Nick to allow the procedure. Before the transplant begins, the team finds out that the younger brother is suffering from a fungal infection known as histoplasmosis. Foreman decides to take bone marrow from Matty in order to save Nick's life. However, since Matty is too sick to be sedated, Foreman removes his marrow without anesthesia. House applauds the decision, while Foreman realizes he is too much like House for his own good, and tells House he is resigning. Outside the hospital, House must deal with his new dog, Hector, about whom House does not seem to care. Hector makes a mess in the house, including eating some of House's pills and biting off a piece of House's cane. The doctor tries to get rid of the dog by leaving the door of his apartment open, but Hector just stays inside (though somebody does enter and steal House's stereo). At the end of the episode, Wilson's ex-wife is now able to have dogs at her condo and she can take Hector back if House wants. House scoffs at the idea of keeping the dog, but it seems that House and Hector developed a certain fondness for each other. When Wilson calls for Hector, Hector stands up and starts limping towards Wilson. Then Wilson looks at House with an accusing look. House merely says, \\"Accidents happen,\\" while handing over the leash. Wilson walks out with Hector, followed by House seeing them dramatically leave while the song \\"Ain't No Reason\\" by Brett Dennen plays.

The game was published for Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro Model B, Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Dragon 32, MSX, Oric Atmos, and ZX Spectrum at ¬£8.95 for each part. Original advertisement for the game A prize worth ¬£30,000 was on offer if the game could be solved. Gameplay In game shot with the hare (ZX Spectrum) The game takes the form of a series of graphical screens depicting grass, sky and trees with occasional text clues. The only interaction is pressing the cursor keys to follow a hare which moves across the screen and disappears off one of the sides. There are no hints as to how the puzzle can be solved but it may be the case that the text and the position of the trees, sun, clouds and other elements (which are different on each screen) can be interpreted in some way. The solvers of Prelude would also then have to buy and solve Finale. They could then enter a competition to locate the prize, the bejewelled 18 carat \\"Golden Hare\\" pendant featured on the cover. Background The golden hare had previously been the prize for solving the book Masquerade, by the British artist Kit Williams.\\"Play to Win\\" in Retro Gamer, Issue 17 It had been buried at a secret location (Ampthill Park in Bedfordshire), the object of the game being to solve the clues in the book that would lead the successful treasure-hunter to this location and the golden prize. Several sources state, erroneously, that Hareraiser is based on Masquerade - in fact, the only thing apart from the prize that the two have in common is that both feature a hare. Haresoft was founded by Dugald Thompson, the controversial winner of Masquerade, and his business partner John Guard.\\"Masquerade & the Mysteries of Kit Williams FAQ\\" at bunnyears.net, accessed 3 May 2009 Release Haresoft claimed the game was released in two parts \\"to make it fun and enable competitors of all ages to participate\\". Sinclair User magazine however suggested it was simply to make more money. Haresoft stated that an additional clue had been revealed in Harrods by TV personality Anneka Rice. The nature of the clue remains unknown, as does whether or not Rice even revealed such a clue. The game did not sell well and Haresoft went into liquidation. Hareraiser was never solved, and the hare was sold at a Sotheby's auction by the creditors in 1988. Although only given a guide price of ¬£3,000‚Äì6,000, it did in fact exceed Haresoft's stated value, selling for ¬£31,900. Although it was rumoured to have been sold again in the early 1990s, its whereabouts were unknown for over 20 years until July 2009 when an appeal was made on BBC Radio 4. The current owner's granddaughter got in touch and Kit Williams was reunited with the hare for a BBC TV documentary. Reception The game was awarded 3/10 in Sinclair User with reviewer Richard Price struggling to find any reason to play the game except \\"the sincere need to get rich\\". At the Norwich Gaming Festival in 2017, comedian and computer game historian Stuart Ashen described and showed the game play, and called it \\"quite possibly the worst video game ever,\\" further revealing that the solution to the videogame's predecessor had been discovered via cheating. Ashen further stated that he believed the puzzle was intentionally designed to be unsolvable so that Haresoft would not lose the art piece (the golden hare).

Established in 1889, it is one of the nation's oldest schools for nursing education, ranking 1st in the nation. It is also among the top recipients of nursing research funding from the National Institutes of Health. The school's mission is to provide leadership to improve health care and advance the nursing profession through education, research, practice, and service. Origins The founder Johns Hopkins' desire for a training school for female nurses was formally stated in a posthumous 1873 instruction letter to the board of trustees of the Johns Hopkins institutions. The School of Nursing in conjunction with the Johns Hopkins Hospital was eventually founded in 1889 after in depth consultation with Florence Nightingale on its planning, organization, structure and curriculum.History of the School of Nursing Location The Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing is located on the Johns Hopkins University East Baltimore campus along with the Bloomberg School of Public Health, School of Medicine, and the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Programs The School of Nursing offers a variety of programs from pre- licensure programs to Master's, DNP and PhD programs, online options, post- degree opportunities, and nursing prerequisites.  Pre-licensure program options  * Master's Entry into Nursing (21 months)  Master of Science in Nursing program options  * Adult-Geriatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner * Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner * Family Primary Care Nurse Practitioner * Pediatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner * Clinical Nurse Specialist (online option available) * Health Systems Management (online option available) * Health Systems Management/Clinical Nurse Specialist Dual Track * Master of Science in Nursing/Master of Business Administration (MSN/MBA) * Public Health Nursing * Public Health Nursing, Nurse-Midwifery Track * Master of Science in Nursing/Master of Public Health (MSN/MPH) * Nurse Practitioner with Public Health Nursing Focus (MSN-NP/MPH)  Doctor of Nursing Practice  Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing  The school has four research centers (Center for Innovative Care in Aging, Center for Nursing Research and Sponsored Projects, Center for Collaborative Intervention Research and the Center on Health Disparities Research) and also offers Interdisciplinary Fellowship research on violence, pain, and health disparities in underserved populations, as well as research focused on cardiovascular health prevention and risk reduction, care at end of life, community-based health promotion, health disparities, interpersonal violence, maternal-child health, psychoneuroimmunology, and symptom management areas. The school is also home to the country's first and only Peace Corps Fellows Program in nursing. The school offers a special program for Arts and Science College students to transfer after two years. Reputation and Ranking The Johns Hopkins School of Nursing ranks #1 nationally among graduate schools of nursing and #3 for online programs, according to U.S. News & World Report, and was named the Most Innovative Nursing Graduate Program in the U.S. by Best Master of Science in Nursing Degrees. The school ranks #1 among nursing schools for Federal Research Grants and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. Nearly 95 percent of graduates pass the NCLEX on their first try. Among the faculty, more than 40 percent are ranked as Fellows of the American Academy of Nursing. The school has clinics across Baltimore that reach out to abused women, struggling mothers and other underrepresented communities, giving over 12,000 volunteer hours annually and conducting 40 different community-based service programs.

The avifauna of Tunisia include a total of 375 species, of which eight are rare or accidental. Ten species listed are extirpated in Tunisia and are not included in the species count. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Tunisia. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Tunisia *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Tunisia although populations exist elsewhere Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa.

XXTEA is vulnerable to a chosen-plaintext attack requiring 259 queries and negligible work. See cryptanalysis below. The cipher's designers were Roger Needham and David Wheeler of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory, and the algorithm was presented in an unpublished technical report in October 1998 (Wheeler and Needham, 1998). It is not subject to any patents. Formally speaking, XXTEA is a consistent incomplete source-heavy heterogeneous UFN (unbalanced Feistel network) block cipher. XXTEA operates on variable-length blocks that are some arbitrary multiple of 32 bits in size (minimum 64 bits). The number of full cycles depends on the block size, but there are at least six (rising to 32 for small block sizes). The original Block TEA applies the XTEA round function to each word in the block and combines it additively with its leftmost neighbour. Slow diffusion rate of the decryption process was immediately exploited to break the cipher. Corrected Block TEA uses a more involved round function which makes use of both immediate neighbours in processing each word in the block. XXTEA is likely to be more efficient than XTEA for longer messages. Needham & Wheeler make the following comments on the use of Block TEA: > For ease of use and general security the large block version is to be > preferred when applicable for the following reasons. * A single bit change > will change about one half of the bits of the entire block, leaving no place > where the changes start. * There is no choice of mode involved. * Even if > the correct usage of always changing the data sent (possibly by a message > number) is employed, only identical messages give the same result and the > information leakage is minimal. * The message number should always be > checked as this redundancy is the check against a random message being > accepted. * Cut and join attacks do not appear to be possible. * If it is > not acceptable to have very long messages, they can be broken into chunks > say of 60 words and chained analogously to the methods used for DES. However, due to the incomplete nature of the round function, two large ciphertexts of 53 or more 32-bit words identical in all but 12 words can be found by a simple brute-force collision search requiring 296‚àíN memory, 2N time and 2N+296‚àíN chosen plaintexts, in other words with a total time*memory complexity of 296, which is actually 2wordsize*fullcycles/2 for any such cipher. It is currently unknown if such partial collisions pose any threat to the security of the cipher. Eight full cycles would raise the bar for such collision search above complexity of parallel brute-force attacks. The unusually small size of the XXTEA algorithm would make it a viable option in situations where there are extreme constraints e.g. legacy hardware systems (perhaps embedded) where the amount of available RAM is minimal, or alternatively single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi or Arduino. Cryptanalysis An attack published in 2010 by E. Yarrkov presents a chosen-plaintext attack against full-round XXTEA with wide block, requiring 259 queries for a block size of 212 bytes or more, and negligible work. It is based on differential cryptanalysis. To cipher \\"212 bytes or more\\" algorithm performs just 6 rounds, and carefully chosen bit patterns allows to detect and analyze avalanche effect. The paper notices adding two additional rounds (i.e. 8 rounds instead of 6) fixes this problem. Reference code The original formulation of the Corrected Block TEA algorithm, published by David Wheeler and Roger Needham, is as follows: #define MX ((z>>5^y<<2) + (y>>3^z<<4) ^ (sum^y) + (k[p&3^e]^z)) long btea(long* v, long n, long* k) { unsigned long z=v[n-1], y=v[0], sum=0, e, DELTA=0x9e3779b9; long p, q ; if (n > 1) { /* Coding Part */ q = 6 + 52/n; while (q-- > 0) { sum += DELTA; e = (sum >> 2) & 3; for (p=0; p> 2) & 3; for (p=n-1; p>0; p--) z = v[p-1], y = v[p] -= MX; z = v[n-1]; y = v[0] -= MX; sum -= DELTA; } return 0; } return 1; } According to Needham and Wheeler: Note that the initialization of z is Undefined behavior for n < 1 which may cause a segmentation fault or other unwanted behavior ‚Äì it would be better placed inside the 'Coding Part' block. Also, in the definition of MX some programmers would prefer to use bracketing to clarify operator precedence. A clarified version including those improvements is as follows: #include #define DELTA 0x9e3779b9 #define MX (((z>>5^y<<2) + (y>>3^z<<4)) ^ ((sum^y) + (key[(p&3)^e] ^ z))) void btea(uint32_t *v, int n, uint32_t const key[4]) { uint32_t y, z, sum; unsigned p, rounds, e; if (n > 1) { /* Coding Part */ rounds = 6 + 52/n; sum = 0; z = v[n-1]; do { sum += DELTA; e = (sum >> 2) & 3; for (p=0; p> 2) & 3; for (p=n-1; p>0; p--) { z = v[p-1]; y = v[p] -= MX; } z = v[n-1]; y = v[0] -= MX; sum -= DELTA; } while (--rounds); } } See also * RC4: A stream cipher that, just like XXTEA, is designed to be very simple to implement. * XTEA: Block TEA's precursor. * TEA: XTEA's precursor.

Design and specifications The Topper had a single-cylinder two-stroke engine mounted horizontally between the floorboards. The engine required a premixed gasoline/oil mixture. The starter was of the rope-recoil type similar to lawn mowers or the Lambretta E model. Unlike most scooters with enclosed engines, the Topper's engine did not have a cooling fan. It was expected that the low, horizontally mounted engine would be cooled by air passing under the scooter, but some Toppers developed overheating problems. The engine used a reed valve in its induction system. The engine powered a continuously variable transmission called \\"Scootaway Drive\\" that included a safety device that did not allow the scooter to move from rest at engine speeds higher than 1800 rpm. Final drive was by an exposed roller chain. The Topper had 5 inch internal expanding drum brakes on both wheels. The front brake was controlled by a hand lever on the left handlebar with a parking brake lock; the rear brake was controlled by a pedal. The front body, front fender and floorboards of the Topper were made of stamped steel, and the engine cover and body were made of molded fiberglass. Storage space was provided under the seat; the manufacturer suggested storing extra containers of two-stroke oil there. Development The main complaint from Topper owners was with the \\"Scootaway Drive\\" continuously variable transmission. Road grime would get into the transmission and cause the belt to slip. A new transmission, with the primary drive sealed in an oil bath, was introduced for 1961. The Topper H was introduced in 1961 (sold through 1965) with a new alloy cylinder head that increased the compression ratio to 8.0:1, a reusable foam air filter, and revisions to the cylinder ports and air intake tube. A detuned version of the Topper was also available, with the power restricted to . This was advertised as the \\"Topper U\\". The detuned Topper was made to comply with laws in some states in the United States that allowed motorcycles with rated engine power below a stated maximum to be operated without a license or to be operated on a special license by riders at a younger age than would be allowed a regular motorcycle license. A Topper was used by the Milwaukee Brewers as a bullpen car from 1959 through 1995.https://www.jsonline.com/story/life/green-sheet/2016/08/09/our-back- pages-county-stadiums-pioneering-bullpen-cart/88374212/ Performance In 1959 a Topper was ridden from Bakersfield, California to Death Valley and back without repair or adjustments requiring tools. The route went through Trona, to Stovepipe Wells, then to Badwater Basin, then to Whitney Portal, above sea level on the side of Mount Whitney. It then returned to Bakersfield.

The boats had diesel motors for surface running and electricity generation, but when underwater ran off electric motors. They had two propeller shafts. Maximum speed was on the surface, and when dived. Otway had a boat's company of 54. Armament consisted of eight torpedo tubes (six facing forward, two facing aft), one deck gun, and two machine guns. Otway was laid down by Vickers Limited of Barrow-in-Furness in England in March 1925, under the designation OA2.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 111 She was launched on 7 September 1926, and commissioned into the RAN on 15 June 1927. Operational history After commissioning, Otway and Oxley were temporarily assigned to the Royal Navy's 5th Submarine Flotilla. On 8 February 1928, the two submarines set out for Australia in the longest unescorted voyage undertaken by a British submarine. En route to Malta, cracks were found on Otways engine columns. On arrival in Malta, similar fractures were found in Oxleys engine columns, and the two boats were detained while improved columns were fabricated and installed. They resumed their voyage in November, and reached Sydney on 14 February 1929. Because of the deteriorating financial conditions leading into the Great Depression, the two submarines were placed into reserve a year later; Otway was paid off on 10 May 1930. The submarines were maintained in operational condition, and left the harbour twice a month for diving exercises. The ongoing cost of maintaining the boats, coupled with the tonnage limits imposed by the London Naval Treaty prompted the Australian government to offer Otway and Oxley to the Royal Navy. The submarines were transferred and commissioned on 10 April 1931, and sailed to Britain. HMS Otway operated during World War II with the pennant number 51.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 112 In 1942 it was under the command of Commander Howard Bone. The submarine left RN service in 1945, and in August was transported to Thos W Ward Inverkeithing, Scotland to be broken up.

The avifauna of Turkey include a total of 515 species, of which 4 have been introduced by humans. 29 species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2019 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Turkey. The white-throated kingfisher (Halcyon smyrnensis), also known as Smyrna kingfisher, was described from Turkey by Linnaeus in 1758. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Turkey *(E) Endangered - a species that is endangered in Turkey *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Turkey as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Turkey although populations exist elsewhere *(X) Extinct - a species or subspecies that no longer exists Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

The result was a colorful, smooth-gaited horse, used in the show ring and for pleasure and trail riding. Two registries have been created for the breed, one in 1979 and the other in 1985. The two have similar registration requirements, although one has an open stud book and the other is slightly more strict with regard to parentage requirements, having a semi-closed stud book. The Spotted Saddle Horse is a light riding horse, always pinto in color. Solid-colored foals from registered parents may be registered for identification purposes, so their pinto-colored foals have documented parentage. They always perform an ambling gait, rather than a trot, in addition to the gaits of walk and canter, performed by all breeds.  History  A black tobiano Spotted Saddle Horse. The Spotted Saddle Horse developed from small gaited pinto ponies of Spanish ancestry. These were crossed with larger American breeds such as the Morgan and Standardbred, developed after the American Revolution, to increase size while retaining coloration and the desired gait. After the American Civil War, additional gaited blood was added, with contributing breeds including the Tennessee Walking Horse, Missouri Fox Trotter, Paso Fino and Peruvian Paso. Mustangs from the American West were also incorporated. Originally developed in central Tennessee, and selectively bred for pinto coloration, they were used for general pleasure and trail riding. There are two breed registries for the Spotted Saddle Horse. In 1979, the National Spotted Saddle Horse Association (NSSHA) was organized in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The association focuses on promoting naturally-gaited saddle horses with pinto coloration. The NSSHA is adamant about disallowing cruel and inhumane training and showing practices, including soring, sometimes seen in other elements of the Spotted Saddle Horse industry, and prohibited by the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA). The NSSHA also bans the use of action devices (such as chains or other weights around the pasterns) and performance packages (stacks of pads attached to the shoe, sometimes weighted or used to conceal abusive shoeing practices) in their shows, which goes beyond the protection afforded by the HPA. In 1985, the Spotted Saddle Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association (SSHBEA) was formed, headquartered in Shelbyville, Tennessee. The SSHBEA is recognized as a \\"Horse Industry Organization\\" (HIO) under the HPA, and occasionally sees violations of the HPA at their shows. Violations of the HPA are addressed in the SSHBEA rulebook, and violations can result in disqualifications from individual shows or extended suspensions from Spotted Saddle Horse showing. Today, the Spotted Saddle Horse is seen at horse shows, as well as being used for pleasure and trail riding.  Characteristics  English equipment Spotted Saddle Horses are light riding horses. They average high and weigh . The NSSHA will register horses that are shorter, down to , although it considers taller horses to be the breed ideal. The head is refined, with a straight or slightly convex facial profile. The neck is muscular, with a slight arch, leading into long, sloping shoulders and a muscular chest. The back is short and the hindquarters muscular and broad. The croup is slightly sloping and rounded, with a high-set tail. The ideal Spotted Saddle Horse resembles a \\"smaller, slightly stockier Tennessee Walking Horse\\". Pinto coloration is required, with white spots on a background any equine coat color. Overo and tobiano are the two most common patterns, and the coverage of the white spots can range from minimal to almost complete. To be registered with the NSSHA, Spotted Saddle Horses must display an ambling gait (they cannot trot) and have pinto coloration. As long as they meet these two requirements, they can have any breeds in their pedigree. Even if already registered as Racking Horses, Tennessee Walking Horses, Missouri Fox Trotters or other breeds, or from undocumented parentage, registration with the NSSHA is allowed. If a foal who has one or both parents registered with the NSSHA displays solid coat color (without pinto markings), it can be listed as having \\"identification\\" registration, and any spotted foals it has are considered to have NSSHA-documented parentage. Solid-colored, gaited mares and stallions can be registered as breeding stock, but are not considered to have full registration with the organization. Requirements for the SSHBEA are similar with regard to color and gait, including identification-only registration for solid colored foals of registered parents. However, one difference is that it is a semi-closed stud book, as a foal must have one or both parents listed with the SSHBEA to be registered by the SSHBEA. Gaits The Spotted Saddle Horse is a gaited breed, meaning that they perform an intermediate-speed ambling gait instead of the trot. The flat walk, or show walk, is a regular four-beat walk, covering . The show gait is also a four-beat gait, similar to the flat walk with the exception of the speed. Horses traveling at a show gait can cover , with an extremely smooth motion. The third main gait is the canter, a three-beat gait performed by all breeds. Some members of the Spotted Saddle Horse breed can also perform the rack, stepping pace, fox-trot, single- foot or other variations of ambling gaits, all intermediate gaits, but differentiated by the pattern of foot-falls.

In 1924, the bureau was renamed to the Statistical Office in Zagreb (Statistiƒçki ured u Zagrebu). In 1929, after royal monarchy was proclaimed in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes the bureau lost its financial and technical independence. In 1939 with the formation of the Banovina of Croatia, the office was made subject to the presidential office on the Ban's administration. In 1941 the Independent State of Croatia was formed and an Office of General State Statistics existed during this time under the control of the presidential government. In 1945 the Statistical Office of the People's Republic of Croatia was formed. In 1951 it was renamed to the Bureau of Statistics and Evidence, in 1956 to the Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of Croatia and in 1963 to the Republican Bureau for Statistics of the Socialist Republic of Croatia. The bureau was independent during this time, but was subordinated to the Yugoslavian Federal Bureau for Statistics. Upon Croatian independence, the Central Bureau of Statistics was made the highest statistical body in the nation. Work The bureau collects and processes data for the Republic of Croatia.

The avifauna of Jordan include a total of 412 species, of which two have been introduced by humans and 86 are rare or accidental. Two species listed are extirpated in Jordan and are not included in the species count. Twelve species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Jordan. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Jordan *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Jordan as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Jordan although populations exist elsewhere *(X) Extinct -a species or subspecies that no longer exists Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds. *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus (Ex) **Arabian ostrich, Struthio camelus syriacus (X) Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.

Whiting School of Engineering, is a division of the Johns Hopkins University located in the university's Homewood campus in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. History Originally known as the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering building, Maryland Hall was renamed in 1931 to recognize the Maryland General Assembly's role in establishing the School of Engineering. Engineering at Johns Hopkins was originally created in 1913 as an educational program that included exposure to liberal arts and scientific inquiry. In 1919, the engineering department became a separate school, known as the School of Engineering. By 1937, over 1,000 students had graduated with engineering degrees. By 1946 the school had six departments. In 1961, the School of Engineering changed its name to the School of Engineering Sciences and, in 1966, merged with the Faculty of Philosophy to become part of the School of Arts and Sciences. In 1979, the engineering programs were organized into a separate academic division that was named the G.W.C. Whiting School of Engineering. The school's named benefactor is George William Carlyle Whiting, co-founder of The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company. Several departments at the school have been nationally and historically recognized. The Johns Hopkins Department of Biomedical Engineering is recognized as the top-ranked program in the nation. The Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering has consistently ranked as one of the top 5 programs nationally by US News and World Report in recent years. The Department of Mechanical Engineering is well known for its fundamental and historic contributions, especially in the fields of mechanics and fluid dynamics. Although it has always been a very small department, an uncharacteristically large number of highly acclaimed scholars have been associated with it over the years. These include Clifford Truesdell, Owen Martin Philips, Jerald Ericksen, James Bell, Stanley Corrsin, Robert Kraichnan, John L. Lumley, Leslie Kovasznay, Walter Noll, K. R. Sreenivasan, Hugh Dryden, Shiyi Chen, Andrea Prosperetti, Fazle Hussain, Harry Swinney, Stephen H. Davis, Gregory L. Eyink, Charles Meneveau, Joseph Katz (professor), Gretar Tryggvason and Mohamed Gad-el-Hak. Many of the landmark papers in the field of fluid mechanics (turbulence in particular) were written using data from the Corrsin Wind Tunnel Laboratory. The wind tunnel is still in operation today. The department was also home to the school of rational mechanics. It was recently ranked as one of the top 5 departments in the nation for research activity by the National Research Council (the department was ranked 13th by the generic US News and World Report rankings), and is still considered one of the main centers of fundamental research in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Departments The Whiting School contains nine departments: * Applied Mathematics & Statistics * Biomedical Engineering * Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering * Computer Science * Electrical and Computer Engineering * Civil Engineering * Environmental Health and Engineering (formerly Geography and Environmental Engineering) * Materials Science & Engineering * Mechanical Engineering (link)  Engineering Programs for Professionals  The Engineering for Professionals (EP) program is a part-time and online program at Whiting School. EP offers master's degree programs and courses in 21 distinct disciplines. The Johns Hopkins University first offered courses to working engineers in 1916, held ‚ÄúNight Courses for Technical Workers‚Äù in response to the potential for United States involvement in World War I. The part-time undergraduate engineering program realized its largest enrollments for a time after World War II when returning servicemen and women received GI Bill benefits for a college education. Until the late 1950s, part- time courses were primarily offered at the undergraduate level on the Johns Hopkins Homewood campus. In 1958, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) began to offer advanced technical courses at the graduate level with credit toward Johns Hopkins academic degrees under the auspices of that institution‚Äôs Evening College. By 1963, APL established a formal center for the Evening College to meet growing demand. Over the years, the number and variety of engineering and applied science courses and master‚Äôs degree program expanded, so that by 1983 five master's degrees were offered at the APL Education Center: Applied Physics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Numerical Science, and Technical Management. In 1983, the APL-based programs came under the oversight of the re-established engineering school at Johns Hopkins, the G.W.C. Whiting School of Engineering. At that time, eight additional degree programs were added: undergraduate programs in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering and five master's degree programs in Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Materials Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. Johns Hopkins professionals engineering education has changed its name several times to reflect added programs, advancing technology, and a changing workforce. Its name was the Part-Time Engineering Program from 1983 to 1987, Continuing Professional Programs from 1987 to 1992, Part-Time Programs in Engineering and Applied Science from 1992 to 2004, Engineering and Applied Science Programs for Professionals from 2004 to 2008,‚ÄúEngineering and Applied Science Programs for Professionals,‚Äù Allan W. Bjerkaas, Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, Vol. 26, No. 3, 2005 () and Engineering for Professionals from 2008 to the present. Also, several degree programs have changed their names to reflect changes in focus, and in several cases, concentrations in existing programs have become new programs in their own right. EP is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.
