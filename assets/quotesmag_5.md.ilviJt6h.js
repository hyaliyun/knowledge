They are now reduced in population to some hundred animals, most of them in the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy calls the Choctaw Hog's status \\"critically rare\\" and says it \\"is a high conservation priority.\\" History The Choctaw Hog descends from livestock brought to the Americas by Spaniards from the 16th century onwards. The Choctaw Hog was used not only by Native Americans but also by European settlers and a succession of other peoples in the Southeastern United States for over three hundred years. The Choctaw people and their livestock migrated from the Deep South to Oklahoma Territory in the early 19th century. The United States government forced the Five Civilized Tribes out of Mississippi and Alabama in 1830, and they too brought more hogs to Oklahoma. An Oklahoma Choctaw will from 1858 leaves the posthumous \\"wish and desire that all the hogs running at the home place be gathered and sold\\". It is from Oklahoma swine that today's Choctaw Hogs are descended and their appearance has changed little in 150 years. Description Choctaw hogs have two distinctive characteristics indicative of their ancestors brought from Spain. First, their toes are typically fused forming a single hoof like that of a mule. The mulefoot shares this trait for the same reason and the two breeds may come from common ancestral stock which was loosely selected and managed until the late 19th century. Secondly, many have fleshy wattles on each side of their necks. These hogs are black, sometimes with white markings, and at about 120 pounds, they are relatively small for a domestic pig. Feral descendants of Spanish pigs are much more common than non-feral ones, but the Choctaw is \\"a pure Spanish breed\\" and is distinct from the exact feral hog populations in the Choctaw National Wildlife Refuge area, which are of mixed ancestry. They are nevertheless quick and athletic pigs with heavy forequarters and \\"it is obvious that Choctaw hogs are built for survival\\". Cultivation The Choctaw tribe still raises these hogs in Oklahoma. They require relatively little care and are traditionally allowed to run free on open range and forage for acorns, berries, invertebrates, roots, and whatever else they can find. With the aid of trained dogs, hogs are rounded up periodically, earmarked, and sorted. The dog usually used for this purpose is the Catahoula Leopard dog, another animal of probable Spanish origin. While Choctaw Hogs kept in confinement can become very tame, some may be \\"amazed at the speed and agility of Choctaw hogs.\\" Pigs kept for market are fattened with corn to improve their value. A paper from the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine describes the Choctaw as \\"large and fat\\" and reports: > As hog breeding more favors the industrial organization and breeding of > white hogs for lean pork production these remnants of the Spanish strains > that were adapted for extensive systems are becoming rarer and rarer. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy reports that Choctaws do not have a very valuable \\"market carcass\\". Lacking economic incentive, commercial interests are not drawn to help in the Choctaw's conservation and there is no official Choctaw Hog registry for this breed.

The Manifesto The manifesto is a manual for the formation of secret societies. It is debated how much input Mikhail Bakunin had or if it is solely the work of Nechayev. The work called for total devotion to a revolutionary lifestyle. Its publication in the Government Herald in July 1871 as the manifesto of the Narodnaya Rasprava secret society (\\"–û–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤—ã\\") was one of the most dramatic events of Nechayev's revolutionary life, through its words and the actions it inspired establishing Nechayev's importance for the Nihilist movement. The Catechism is divided into two sections; General Rules of the Organisation and Rules of Conduct of Revolutionaries, 22 and 26 paragraphs long respectively; abridged versions were published as excerpts in the anarchist periodicals Freiheit and The Alarm. The most radical document of its age, the Catechism outlined the authors' revolutionary Jacobin program of organisation and discipline, a program that became the backbone of the radical movement in Russia. The revolutionary is portrayed in the Catechism as an amoral avenging angel, an expendable resource in the service of the revolution, committed to any crime or treachery necessary to effect the downfall of the prevailing order.Avrich p.38 Criticism Critics of anarchism argue that the Catechism reflects the innately violent and nihilistic nature of the philosophy. Scholar Michael Allen Gillespie has hailed the Catechism as \\"a pre-eminent expression of the doctrine of freedom and negation\\" that arose in the Fichtean notion of the \\"Absolute I\\" that had been concealed in Left Hegelianism. Prominent Black Panther of the 20th century Eldridge Cleaver adopted the Catechism as a \\"revolutionary bible\\", incorporating it into his daily life to the extent that he employed, in his words, \\"tactics of ruthlessness in my dealings with everyone with whom I came into contact\\".Avrich p.13 The ideas and sentiments in the work had been in part previously aired by Zaichnevsky and Nikolai Ishutin in Russia, and by Carbonari and Young Italy in the West.Avrich, p.37 The journal Cahiers du monde russe et sovi√©tique published a letter from Bakunin to Nechayev, in which Bakunin wrote, \\"You remember how you were angry with me, when I called you abrek and called your Catechism the Catechism of abreks?\\"Micha√´l Confino Bakunin et Neƒçaev Cahiers du monde russe et sovi√©tique Ann√©e 1966 Volume 7 Num√©ro 7-4 pp. 581‚Äì699 See also * Russian nihilist movement * Anarchism and violence * Professional revolutionaries * Demons, an 1872 novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky influenced by the events surrounding the publication of the Catechism.

It is off a bend in Mechanic Street south of the hamlet of Carmel, seat of Putnam County. Some of the earliest settlers of the region are buried here. It was attached to a Congregational, and later Presbyterian meeting house built ca. 1756 and demolished in 1839. Among those buried here include Enoch Crosby, a Revolutionary War spy believed to be the model for the title character of James Fenimore Cooper's novel The Spy, and Joel Frost, a local politician who later served in the New York State Legislature and for a single term in the House of Representatives. The headstones themselves also display an unusual range of funerary art from the first graves through the last historically significant ones, in 1929. The earliest illustrate changing Protestant notions of the role of death in the later years of the 18th century. For these reasons it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 (entry #88002684). Cemetery The cemetery occupies a rough trapezoid in area, sloping gently uphill from the corner. It is surrounded by stone walls from in height, with a pair of tall stone gateposts flanking the iron gates at the south entrance. An open area just past those gates was the likely site of the meeting house. In the rear of the property several trees rise over in height. There are 310 separate gravesites. 280 of these the headstones have legible carvings; another 199 also have footstones. They are made of materials from sandstone to white marble and granite, depending on the era. The earliest graves are dated 1766; the latest is from 1959. Graves are arranged in rows east to west. Headstones face east and footstones, which usually face the headstones, are instead aside them, an unusual practice. The westernmost row probably faced west originally, but was at some point reoriented. The largest marker is a 14-ton (13-tonne) monument to Enoch Crosby added in the early 20th century to replace his previous stone, destroyed by vandals and souvenir- hunters. Four family plots are within the cemetery, set off by small metal- and-stone cordons. History The future cemetery was part of a tract of land leased by Frederick Philipse III in 1756 to Thomas Crosby, Enoch's father. The meeting house was established quickly, with 57 parishioners signing the letter asking The Rev. Ebenezer Knibloe to be their first pastor, a position he held for three years before yielding to Elnathan Gregory. The church and some other features of the surrounding areaSuch as Lake Gilead. would get their name from one of Gregory's widely reprinted sermons, \\"Is There No Balm in Gilead?\\" In 1766, the cemetery received its first burial, Sarah Smith, as the surrounding farm was leased to a new tenant, James Dickenson. It was sold outright to Elisha Cole in 1828. In 1839 the meeting house was torn down and the property became exclusively a cemetery. The stone walls, probably meant to keep livestock from neighboring farms out in the early days, were augmented by work paid for by local benefactor Ferdinand Hopkins, who also had the gates and Crosby's monument added. The Gilead Cemetery Association was created at this time to maintain the cemetery and document its history. Burials dwindled after the opening of the much larger Raymond Hill Cemetery nearby. Those who chose Gilead as their final resting place were mainly the descendants of those already buried there. In 1959 the last burial took place, although the cemetery, now town property, has been maintained ever since by the cemetery association. Funerary art Many of the headstones have high-quality decorative carvings in addition to the usual information about the decedent's birth and death date. This collection of funerary art is more extensive than in other American cemeteries of this size from this period and illustrates changing Protestant notions of death. Sarah Smith's 1766 gravestone, the oldest in the cemetery, is made of slate and features an inverted half-moon and semi-circular finials. Other graves from that early era are carved mainly from red sandstone, with a few postwar markers of fieldstone reflecting the economic stress of the war. They feature similar designs plus death's heads, skeletons, skulls and starbursts. These were meant to represent the triumphant finality of death. Later in the 19th century, winged cherubs begin to appear atop headstones, symbolizing the soul's escape from death's clutches into new life. In the 19th century, when white marble became the tombstone material of choice, this belief remained but was symbolized instead through neoclassical imagery of an urn and willow tree. The urn represented death, the tree rebirth in the hereafter. A few gray granite markers are found from the early and mid-20th century. One of these, Enoch Crosby's monument, features a sword and musket in recognition of his military service.

Previously, he was President of the National Assembly of C√¥te d'Ivoire from 2001 to 2011, Minister of the Budget in 2000 and Minister of Economy and Finance from 2000 to 2001. For years he was leading member of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI), briefly leading the party in an interim capacity in 2011 before quitting it. Political career A Muslim and a native of the north of C√¥te d'Ivoire,\\"After the phoney war\\", Africa Confidential, volume 45, number 7, 2 April 2004. Koulibaly was born at Azagui√©-Gare and studied economics, becoming an economist and economics professor. Under the transitional military regime of Robert Gu√©√Ø, Koulibaly served in the government as Minister of the Budget from 15 January 2000 to 18 May 2000, then as Minister of the Economy and Finances from 18 May 2000 to January 2001. When Gu√©√Ø was ousted following the disputed results of the October 2000 presidential election and FPI leader Laurent Gbagbo was sworn in as President, Koulibaly retained his post as Minister of the Economy and Finances, while gaining the role of Government Spokesman. He remained in those posts until 15 January 2001.. Koulibaly stood as an FPI candidate in the December 2000 parliamentary election and was elected to the National Assembly from Koumassi constituency. He was then elected as President of the National Assembly on 22 January 2001\\"Ruling party secures Ivorian parliament's top position\\", Associated Press, 22 January 2001. without opposition. Another FPI deputy, Emile Boga Doudou, was also a candidate, but withdrew prior to the vote. The opposition Democratic Party of C√¥te d'Ivoire (PDCI) supported Koulibaly's candidacy as a gesture of cooperation.\\"Programme summary of Radio France Internationale 1830 gmt 22 jan 01\\", Radio France Internationale, 22 January 2001. In the aftermath of the 2002-2003 civil war, in which rebels failed to unseat Gbagbo but seized control of the north of the country, Koulibaly was noted as one of the main hard-line FPI figures surrounding Gbagbo who were hostile to the Marcoussis peace accord and despised opposition leader Alassane Ouattara.\\"Hard-core Gbagbo\\", Africa Confidential, volume 44, number 7, 4 April 2003. He was closely associated with Simone Gbagbo, who was Gbagbo's wife as well as President of the FPI Parliamentary Group. Alleged coup plotters led by Ibrahim Coulibaly were said to have conspired to kill Koulibaly along with President Gbagbo and Gbagbo's wife before being thwarted in August 2003.\\"Another year, another plot\\", Africa Confidential, volume 44, number 18, 12 September 2003. After President Gbagbo extended National Assembly's parliamentary mandate in January 2005, contrary to the wishes of United Nations mediators, Koulibaly strongly criticized the United Nations Operation in C√¥te d'Ivoire (UNOCI) in an interview with the newspaper Le Courrier that was published on 1 February 2006. According to Koulibaly, UNOCI had ceased to play a positive role in the resolving the Ivorian conflict and was only exacerbating the situation.\\"C√¥te d'Ivoire: Anti-UN sentiment rumbles on\\", IRIN, 1 February 2006. In June 2010, Koulibaly accused D√©sir√© Tagro--the Minister of the Interior and another top ally of Gbagbo--of embezzling money and showing regional favoritism regarding admissions to a training school for the police. Gbagbo ordered an investigation into the allegations; in July 2010, the investigation judged that the allegations were without merit,\\"Minister cleared in graft probe\\", Agence France-Presse, 19 July 2010. and Tagro, who continued to enjoy Gbagbo's favor, was ultimately unscathed by the episode.\\"Politicians waiting in the wings\\", Africa Confidential, volume 51, number 17, 27 August 2010. Following the second round of the October-November 2010 presidential election, both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory. Although his claim to victory was rejected by regional and international institutions, Gbagbo was promptly sworn in for a new term on 4 December 2010. Koulibaly was notably absent from the hastily arranged swearing-in ceremony, raising some eyebrows. In an interview a few days later, Koulibaly explained that he had been out of the country at the time. Regarding the severe political controversy that had erupted between Gbagbo and Ouattara, Koulibaly urged calm and stressed that the dispute should be peacefully resolved through the creation of a national unity government. He said that was the method settled upon for the resolution of post-election disputes in Africa and he said that it should be done quickly.Pascal Soro, \\"Situation post √©lectorale : Mamadou Koulibaly: \\"J'appelle les Ivoiriens au calme et √† la s√©r√©nit√©\\"\\", Fraternit√© Matin, 8 December 2010 . Koulibaly attempted to resolve the situation through dialogue and met with Ouattara, but his efforts came to nothing. Although known as a long-time Gbagbo loyalist, he did not actively take sides in the conflict. As the political dispute turned violent and the two sides battled in Abidjan in March-April 2011, Koulibaly went to neighboring Ghana. After Ouattara's forces captured Gbagbo and effectively took control of Abidjan on 11 April, Koulibaly returned to Abidjan on 19 April 2011.Traor√© M. Ahmed, \\"Mamadou Koulibaly ce jour √† Abidjan\\", L'Expression, 19 April 2011 . He met with Ouattara on 20 April and discussed the situation, especially the need to constitutionally normalize it by formally swearing in Ouattara as President and putting Ouattara's orders through the National Assembly. Ouattara appeared willing to leave the existing National Assembly, dominated by the FPI and chaired by Koulibaly, in place for the time being. Koulibaly also complained that his homes had been looted, his family had been threatened, and the National Assembly's offices had been damaged. He stressed reconciliation and expressed concern regarding persecution of FPI members and attacks on members of Gbagbo's B√©t√© ethnic group.Cyprien Tiess√©, \\"Mamadou Koulibaly, a √©t√© re√ßu hier, par le Pr√©sident de la R√©publique, Alassane Ouattara\\", Nord-Sud, 21 April 2011 . FPI President Pascal Affi N'Guessan was arrested soon after Gbagbo's capture, and consequently Koulibaly took over the party leadership as Acting President. Responding to Ouattara's stated willingness to include moderate Gbagbo supporters in a national unity government, Koulibaly said on 25 May 2011 that the FPI would consider such participation only if Gbagbo and others who supported him were released.\\"Prochain gouvernement ivoirien: le parti de Gbagbo pose ses conditions\\", Agence France-Presse, 25 May 2011 .

Lars is happy and decides to stay in town. After only a few days, Lars meets the powerful businesswoman Sylvia Jones (Heike Brentano) and falls in love with her. But Sylvia only begins an affair with Lars to make her former husband, Martin von Beyenbach (Gerry Hungbauer), who owns 'Beyenbach AllMedia', jealous. When Sylvia's little sister Hanna Novak (Katharina Dalichau) comes to town, she begins to fall for the smart lawyer and wants him to see Sylvia's true face.

But Carla is a lesbian and begins to fall in love with Hanna, which is why she ends her friendship with Carla. But with time, Hanna discovers that she cares about Carla, more than she thought. Lars doesn't notice and wonders why Hanna distances herself more and more from him. He still thinks Hanna is the love of his life and he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. Because of that, he buys an expensive apartment, where he wants to live with her. Hanna sees that she needs to make a decision. In the new apartment, Lars plans a romantic surprise for Hanna, but when she shows up, she breaks up with him. Lars doesn't understand and wants to know why, but Hanna keeps her feelings for Carla a secret, because Carla is a Countess and her father doesn't know about her homosexuality. Without an apartment, Lars moves in with his client and friend Felix von Beyenbach (Stefan Kirch). He soon begins to work as a lecturer on the university, after he lost his job at 'Beyenbach AllMedia'. One of his students is the vixen Vanessa von Beyenbach (Inez Bj√∏rg David), Felix' cousin.

When they sleep together again, Lars searches for a condom in Vanessa's bag and finds the questions for the next test. Angry he wants to know, why she is doing that to him and bringing his job in danger. Vanessa tries to put the fault on Felix, but Lars believes him and not her and ends their affair. Meanwhile, Vanessa has true feelings for Lars and says that she loves him. But Lars only laughs about it. After that, Vanessa wants revenge and plans an intrigue together with another student. Vanessa lures Lars into the girls toilet, where she simulates a rape, with the other student as \\"witness\\". Lars loses his job and his reputation is almost ruined.

Fraternity in the Western concept developed in the Christian context, notably with the religious orders in the Catholic Church during the Middle Ages.

There are mixed male and female fraternities and fraternal orders, as well as wholly female religious orders and societies, some of which are known as sororities in North America.

There are known fraternal organizations which existed as far back as ancient clan hero and goddess cults of Greek religions and in the Mithraic Mysteries of ancient Rome. The background of the modern world of fraternities can be traced back to the confraternities in the Middle Ages, which were formed as lay organisations affiliated with the Catholic Church. Some were groups of men and women who were endeavoring to ally themselves more closely with the prayer and activity of the church; others were groups of tradesmen, which are more commonly referred to as guilds. These later confraternities evolved into purely secular fraternal societies, while the ones with religious goals continue to be the format of the modern Third Orders affiliated with the mendicant orders. Other yet took the shape as military orders during the Crusades, which later provided inspiration for elements of quite a few modern fraternal orders. The development of modern fraternal orders was especially dynamic in the United States, where the freedom to associate outside governmental regulation is expressly sanctioned in law.NAACP v.

Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958) There have been hundreds of fraternal organizations in the United States, and at the beginning of the 20th century the number of memberships equaled the number of adult males. (Due to multiple memberships, probably only 50% of adult males belonged to any organizations.) This led to the period being referred to as \\"the Golden age of fraternalism.\\" In 1944 Arthur M. Schlesinger coined the phrase \\"a nation of joiners\\" to refer to the phenomenon. Alexis de Tocqueville also referred to the American reliance on private organization in the 1830s in Democracy in America. There are many attributes that fraternities may or may not have, depending on their structure and purpose. Fraternities can have differing degrees of secrecy, some form of initiation or ceremony marking admission, formal codes of behavior, dress codes disciplinary procedures, very differing amounts of real property and assets. Types Krak√≥w's Kur Fraternity during the inauguration of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Monument in Krak√≥w. The only true distinction between a fraternity and any other form of social organizations is the implication that the members are freely associated as equals for a mutually beneficial purpose rather than because of a religious, governmental, commercial, or familial bond ‚Äì although there are fraternities dedicated to each of these fields of association. On college campuses, fraternities may be divided into four different groups: social, service, professional, and honorary. Fraternities can be organized for many purposes, including university education, work skills, ethics, ethnicity, religion, politics, charity, chivalry, other standards of personal conduct, asceticism, service, performing arts, family command of territory, and even crime. There is almost always an explicit goal of mutual support, and while there have been fraternal orders for the well-off there have also been many fraternities for those in the lower ranks of society, especially for national or religious minorities. Trade unions also grew out of fraternities such as the Knights of Labor. The ability to organize freely, apart from the institutions of government and religion, was a fundamental part of the establishment of the modern world. In Living the Enlightenment, Margaret C. Jacobs showed that the development of Jurgen Habermas's \\"public space\\" in 17th-century Netherlands was closely related to the establishment of lodges of Freemasons. Trade guilds The Syndics of the Drapers' Guild by Rembrandt, 1662. The development of fraternities in England can be traced from guilds that emerged as the forerunners of trade unions and friendly societies. These guilds were set up to protect and care for their members at a time when there was no welfare state, trade unions or universal health care. Various secret signs and handshakes were created to serve as proof of their membership allowing them to visit guilds in distant places that are associated with the guild they belong. Over the next 300 years or so, the idea of \\"ordinary\\" people joining together to improve their situation met with varying degrees of opposition (and persecution) from \\"People in Power\\", depending on whether they were seen as a source of revenue (taxes) or a threat to their power. When Henry VIII broke from the Roman Catholic Church, he viewed the guilds as supporters of the Pope, and in 1545 expropriated them. Later, Elizabeth I appropriated apprenticeships away from guilds, and by the end of her reign most guilds had been suppressed. The suppression of these trade guilds removed an important form of social and financial support from ordinary men and women. Fraternal orders Square and Compasses of Freemasonry. In London and other major cities, some Guilds (like the Freemasons and the Odd Fellows) survived by adapting their roles to a social support function. Eventually, these groups evolved in the early 18th century into more philosophical organizations focused on brotherly love and ethical living, with some elements inspired by organisations such as chivalric orders. Among guilds that became prosperous are the Freemasons, Odd Fellows and Foresters. By joining a fraternity, networking becomes a key factor to pushing a member towards success. With alumni members; who have previously been active but graduated at an earlier time, connections offered by them are endless. Depending on the individuals interest and common goals; Networking is a big part of the different types of Fraternities (ex: Social, Business, Religious, etc.). University and college fraternities The German Student Corps are known for practicing their tradition of engaging in academic fencing by rules dating back to the 1750s. Fraternities have a history in American colleges and universities and form a major subsection of the whole range of fraternities.Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities In Europe, students were organized in nations and corporations since the beginnings of the modern university in the late medieval period, but the situation can differ greatly by country. In the United States, fraternities in colleges date to the 1770s but did not fully assume an established pattern until the 1820s. Many were strongly influenced by the patterns set by Freemasonry. The main difference between the older European organizations and the American organizations is that the American student societies virtually always include initiations, the formal use of symbolism, and a lodge-based organizational structure (chapters). The oldest active social American college fraternity is the Kappa Alpha Society founded in 1825 at Union College. Sigma Phi Society (1827) and Delta Phi Fraternity (1827) were founded at the same school and comprise the Union Triad. In Germany the German Student Corps are the oldest academic fraternities. Twenty-eight were founded in the 18th century and two of them still exist.Klimczuk, Stephen & Warner, Gerald. \\"Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries: Uncovering Mysterious Sites, Symbols, and Societies\\". Sterling Publishing, 2009, New York and London. . pp. 212‚Äì232 (\\"University Secret Societies and Dueling Corps\\"). Most of their traditions have not changed much for the past two centuries. These traditions include academic fencing duels with sharp blades while wearing only eye and neck protection, or regular hunting events, as can be seen in examples such as Corps Hubertia Freiburg, Corps Palatia Munich, Corps Rhenania Heidelberg, or Corps Altsachsen Dresden. At Swedish universities, especially those of Uppsala and Lund, students have organized in nations since the 16th century. These organizations are open to all students who wish to join. Parallel to the nations both Uppsala and Lund play host to a large number of university related secret societies, for both students and older academics. In September 2014, Wesleyan University in America ordered all fraternities with on-campus housing to become co- educational within the next three years. In April 2019, Swarthmore College suspended fraternities on campus due to leaked documents that made reference to a \\"rape attic\\" and employed otherwise homophobic, misogynistic and racist language. The University of Texas Arlington also announced that fraternities would be suspended due to concerns about fraternal culture both on campus and nationally. Fraternities have received increased scrutiny in the United States from incidents of hazing or racism that have received national attention. Three members of Beta Theta Pi were sentenced to prison after pleading guilty in charges related to the hazing death of Tim Piazza. Members of Delta Kappa Epsilon were arrested at Louisiana State University in connection with multiple hazing incidents, and the university's chapter was closed. Phi Delta Theta suspended Louisiana State University's chapter following the death of Maxwell Gruver. Four fraternity members were expelled from the University of Georgia after video surfaced showing video of the men using racial slurs and talking about blacks picking cotton.

By the 1980s, most nations were independent. Military systems reflect this evolution in several ways: *Growth of indigenous knowledge and skill in handling modern arms *Established colonial armies of mainly indigenous troops officered by Europeans *Rebellions, resistance and \\"mop up\\" operations *Weakening of European colonial power due to World War I and World War II *Decolonization and the transition to the militaries of the new African states *Wars of national liberation across the continent particularly the northern and southern regions *Frequent tribal or civil wars across the continent *Frequent military coups against the post colonial regimes *Continued strength of regional powers like Egypt and South Africa *The rise of asymmetric forces and failed states *The rise of international forces and bureaucracies *Continued challenges and evolution into the 21st century For events prior to 1800, see African military systems to 1800. For events between 1800 and 1900, see African military systems (1800‚Äì1900). For an overall view of the military history of Africa by region, see Military History of Africa. Below are the major activities and events that shaped African military systems into the 20th and 21st century. Rebellions, resistance and \\"mop up\\" operations thumbColonial map of Africa, 1913. By 1900, the imperial powers had won most of the initial major battles against indigenous powers, or had occupied strategic areas such as coastlines, to secure their dominance. Colonies were established or expanded across the landscape- sometimes eagerly, as in the case of major mineral finds- or sometimes forced on the imperial center by the outlying actions of grasping or ambitious settlers, merchants, military officers, and bureaucrats. The complexity of African responses to the new order defies a simple narrative of good versus evil.Bruce Vandervort, Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa: 1830‚Äì1914, Indiana University Press: 1998, pp. 6‚Äì37 In some cases the intruders were welcomed as useful allies, saviours or counterweights in local disputes. In other cases, they were bitterly resisted. In some areas, the colonial regimes brought massive land confiscations, violence and what some see as genocide.Hochschild, Adam, King Leopold's Ghost: A story of greed, terror and heroism in colonial Africa, Pan Macmillan: London, 1998 In others they brought education, better security, new products and skills, and improved standards of infrastructure and living. The historical record shows destructive operations by both indigenous hegemony and foreign intruders. Some of the methods used by the colonial powers are also reflected in armed European conflicts. Murdered peasants, livestock and grain seizures, arbitrary quartering of troops, and massive theft and looting by roaming armies for example, are common occurrences in various eras of European military history. Napoleon's brutal occupation of Spain is but one example. Nor did the colonial era see a complete cessation of purely internal disputes and wars. These were much reduced from the 19th century due to the colonial conquests, but still occurred in some areas with varying levels of intensity. Some limited areas of North Africa, such as Libya, were still under the sway of non-European powers like the Ottomans, adding to the complexity of the colonial situation.Gann, L. H. and Duignan, Peter, Burden of Empire ‚Äì an Appraisal of Western Colonialism in Africa South of the Sahara, Pall Mall Press. London 1968. Reviewed in Whatever the balance sheet in different areas, it is clear that consolidation and exploitation of the new territories involved a large measure of coercion, and this often provoked a military reply. The exact form of such coercion varied- it could be land seizures, forced labor, hut taxes, interference in local quarrels, monopolism of trade, small-scale punitive expeditions, or outright warfare of genocidal intensity as that waged by the Germans against the Herero and Namaqua (or Nama) in southwest Africa. African military responses in this \\"mop up\\" or \\"pacification\\" period of the century's first decades were diverse- ranging from minor rebellions and revolts, sustained guerilla warfare, and full scale clashes. Only a few of these varying responses are considered here in terms of African military systems. *Cavalry: the demise of the Sokoto Caliphate, one of the major powers in the savannah regions of West Africa *Guerilla warfare: the Herrero and Nama versus the Germans *Major warfare: the massive Rif War in Spanish Morocco Twilight of the mounted man Ouaddai's forces held to the old methods- mass cavalry charges followed by the infantry. These were insufficient against modern weapons. West Africa's largest single state during the 19th century, the Sokoto Caliphate of northern Nigeria moved into the 20th century with its military system intact- the traditional mix of infantry and cavalry. New powers and technologies however were appearing on the scene. Some cavalry- strong states like the Tukolor, made sporadic attempts to incorporate weapons like artillery but integration was poor.Bruce Vandervort, Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa: 1830‚Äì1914, Indiana University Press: 1998 Sokoto largely stuck to the old ways, was annexed and incorporated in the British Empire in 1903. Sokoto's soldiers, whether horse or foot, had very few guns. The Caliphate's tactics were to attack in a series of set-piece battles, with thundering cavalry charges leading the way, followed by infantry armed with bow, sword and spear. As the fighting men surged forward into combat, their movements were accompanied by loud music and drums These however were not enough, and assaults were quickly routed by the modern weaponry of virtually invulnerable British squares. Traditional fortified cities and forts also made a poor showing and were usually rapidly breached by British artillery.Risto Marjomaa, War on the Savannah: The Military Collapse of the Sokoto Caliphate under the Invasion of the British Empire, 1897‚Äì1903 ‚Äì Reviewed in Thus ended the heyday of the centuries-old West African cavalry-infantry combination. In Southern Africa the mounted men of the Boer forces also saw defeat in 1902, as imperial troops implemented a blockade and scorched earth policy against their mobile tactics. This outcome paralleled general developments on the battlefield, as mounted forces gradually lost their relevance under modern firepower.Archer Jones, The Art of War in the Western World, University of Illinois Press: 1987, pp. 387‚Äì463 Guerilla warfare in Southwest Africa The harsh extermination methods of German commander von Trotha provoked an outcry in some areas of Germany. Thousands of Herero perished in the conflict. Guerilla warfare was a common military response in many areas of Africa during the early colonial era. The bitter 1904‚Äì1907 war between imperial Germany and the Herero tribe in today's Namibia is an illustration of this pattern, with tragic consequences for the indigenous resistance, including concentration camps, forced labor and a scorched earth extermination policy that even some contemporary Germans found repugnant. In August 1904, German colonial troops under commander Lothar von Trotha, carried out a ruthless cleansing campaign against the recalcitrant Herero and Nama tribes, who had risen in revolt against increasing white demands for land, labor and cattle. Several white farmers were killed in the rising and thousands of cattle were collected. General von Trotha counterattacked with well equipped modern troops, and refused Herero offers to negotiate surrender. His extermination proclamation, issued on October 2, 1904, read in part: \\"Every Herero found within German borders, with or without guns, with or without livestock, will be shot. I will not give shelter to any Herero women or children..\\" An estimated 75,000 Herero and Nama were slaughtered. Thousands were killed in battle and in the aftermath, victorious German forces chased the survivors into the waterless Omaheke Desert, physically preventing any from returning. Thousands of men, women and children died of thirst and starvation. Many of those Herero and Nama that survived this slaughter were sent to specially erected concentration camps or to forced employment on German commercial farms. Hundreds of civilians died due to the inhumane conditions in the camps and on the farms. The liquidation of the blacks opened the way for the seizure of land and cattle and consolidated European control over the territory.The Herero and Nama Genocides, 1904‚Äì1908, J.B. Gewald, in Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity, New York, Macmillan Reference, 2004. The Rif Wars Relatively small bodies of imperial regulars or European-led indigenous troops carried out most military operations in Africa during the post 1900 colonial era. The Rif wars however saw major formations deployed by both France and Spain to crush native resistanceThe Rif wars are relatively obscure compared to the well known Ethiopian victory at Adowa or that of the Zulu at Isandhlwana. Nevertheless, it was a significant demonstration of large scale warfare by indigenous troops, and fighters of the Moroccan Rif and J'bala tribes dealt several defeats to Spanish forces in Morocco over their course. It took a massive collaboration by French and Spanish forces to finally liquidate resistance in 1925. =Early defeats of the Spanish= The Rif War of 1920, also called the Second Moroccan War, was fought between Spain (later assisted by France) and the Moroccan Rif and J'bala tribes. Spain moved to conquer the lands around Melilla and Ceuta and the eastern territory from the Jibala tribes during the 1920s. In 1921 Spanish troops suffered a momentous defeat ‚Äî known in Spain as the disaster of Annual ‚Äî by the forces of Abd el- Krim, the leader of the Rif tribes. The Spanish were pushed back and during the following five years, occasional battles were fought between the two. In a bid to break the stalemate, the Spanish military turned to the use of chemical weapons against the Riffians. The Berber tribesmen had a long tradition of fierce fighting skills, combined with high standards of fieldcraft and marksmanship. They were capably led by Abd el-Krim who showed both military and political expertise. The elite of the Riffian forces formed regular units which according to Abd el-Krim, quoted by the Spanish General Manual Goded, numbered 6‚Äì7,000. The remaining Riffians were tribal militia selected by their Caids and not liable to serve away from their homes and farms for more than fifteen consecutive days. General Goded estimates that at their peak the Riffian forces numbered about 80,000 men. Spanish troops in Morocco were initially mainly Metropolitan conscripts. While capable of enduring much hardship they were poorly trained and supplied, with widespread corruption reported amongst the officer corps. Accordingly, much reliance was placed on the limited number of professional units comprising the Spanish \\"Army of Africa\\". Since 1911 these had included regiments of Moorish Regulares. A Spanish equivalent of the French Foreign Legion, the Tercio de Extranjeros (\\"Regiment of Foreigners\\"), was also formed in 1920. The regiment's second commander was General Francisco Franco. =Entry of France into the war and collaboration between France and Spain= In May 1924, the French Army had established a line of posts north of the Ouregha River in disputed tribal territory. On 13 April 1925, an estimated 8,000 Rifs attacked this line and in two weeks 39 of 66 French posts had been stormed or abandoned. The French accordingly intervened on the side of Spain, employing up to 300,000 well trained and equipped troops from Metropolitan, North African, Senegalese and Foreign Legion units. French deaths in what had now become a major war are estimated at about 12,000. Superior manpower and technology soon resolved the course of the war in favour of France and Spain. The French troops pushed through from the south while the Spanish fleet secured Alhucemas Bay by an amphibious landing, and began attacking from the north. After one year of bitter resistance, Abd el-Krim, the leader of both the tribes, surrendered to French authorities, and in 1926 Spanish Morocco was finally retaken.David S. Woolman Rebels in the Rif, pp. 149‚Äì152, Stanford University Press 1968. Impact of World War I and World War II Tirailleurs Senegalais, 1915. Over 500,000 African troops served in World War I, constituting a major manpower resource for France. French West Africans fought in every major battle, playing a notable role at Verdun. The massive conflicts of World War I and World War II were to have important effects on African military development. Hundreds of thousands of African troops served in Europe and the Pacific and gained new military skills via their exposure to new forms of organization, handling of advanced weaponry, and intense modern combat. The exposure to a wider world during the two conflicts opened up a sense of new possibilities, and opportunities. These were eventually to be reflected in demands for greater freedom in homeland colonies. The success of peoples like the Japanese also demonstrated that European forces were not invincible, and post-war weakening of many former imperial powers provided new scope in challenging the colonial order. World War I France deployed hundreds of thousands of African fighting men to aid its cause, including some 300,000 North Africans, some 250,000 West Africans and thousands more from other regions. Over 140,000 African soldiers for example, fought on the Western Front during World War I and thousands of others fought at Gallipoli and in the Balkans. French West African troops fought and died in all the major battles of the Western Front, from Verdun (where they were instrumental in recapturing a fort) to the Armistice. Some writers (Lunn 1999) argue that towards the end of World War I, the black soldiers were increasingly been used as shock troops, and were absorbing three times as many casualties as white French troops.See Joe Lunn, Memoirs of the Maelstrom: A Senegalese Oral History of the First World War, Heinemann: 1999 The French did offer such incentives as citizenship for those who fought, and French leader Clemeanceau pushed for continued recruitment of West Africans to fight for France, maintaining that it was better blacks were killed than long-suffering white Frenchmen.Niall Ferguson, 2011, Civilization: The West and the Rest, p 187 One in five West African combat soldiers who fought in World War I died in the war, compared to less than 17% for the French. Colonial troops such as Indian regiments in British employ suffered less.Ferguson, Civilization, p187 During the conflict, African soldiers were not simply local enforcers of colonial hegemony, but also served as a major combat reserve for use in European conflicts. The case of the British Indian Army, including its elite Gurkha regiments is well known in this role, but the Senegalese and other African regiments of France demonstrate a similar pattern from Africa. Based on a variety of contemporary accounts, the performance of many African units was excellent, and both their German enemies and American allies accord them respect in a wide range of commentary, particularly fighting units from Morocco and regiments of Tirailleurs Senegalais from France's Armee coloniale.Lou Potter, Wimmiam Miles and Nina Rosenblum, Liberators: Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: 1992, pp. 22‚Äì29 One French commander, commander of the 58th Regiment on the Western Front favored the employment of blacks as shock troops to save white lives: \\"finally and above all superb attack troops permitting the saving of the lives of whites, who behind them exploit their success and organize the positions they conquer.\\"Ferguson, Civilization p 185 German native troops in Cameroon The impact of the European war was substantial in Senegal and other French African colonies. Many of the soldiers had volunteered, but the French also resorted to extensive conscription in its territories. Many of the African soldiers found army life in Europe comparatively more egalitarian than civilian life under the colonial regimes of their homelands. The mixing of African troops with troops and civilians from other races however often made colonial regimes nervous. In 1918 for example, South Africa, forced to earlier deploy armed Africans to cover manpower shortages, removed its black troops from France, because \\"blacks in the French front were contaminated with foreign notions about race relations and other social grievances.\\"Alon Peled. A question of loyalty: military manpower policy in multiethnic states. Cornell University Press, 1998. p. 20-42 The French employed a number of high-ranking black soldiers, such as Sosthene Mortenol, Commander of the Air Defenses of Paris. The exigencies and shared dangers of war also seemed to have created, in measure, more mutual understanding and freer communication between Africans and Europeans, although this did not translate immediately into a more just order in their homeland territories. Ironically, the last troops to surrender in World War I were the black soldiers fighting for Germany in East Africa. The British made use of Africans troops in Europe primarily as labor and transport troops. One such group of Africans bound for France, part of the South African Native Labour Corps (SANLC), met a sudden end in a tragic 1917 incident, that sparked sympathy throughout South Africa. Their transport, the SS Mendi was struck by another ship, the Darro, which was sailing without warning lights or signals, and made no attempt to pick up the survivors. Their chaplain, Reverend Isaac Dyobha, is reported to have rallied the doomed black troops on deck for one final muster, referencing old warrior traditions as the waves closed in: The Second Italian-Ethiopian War: 1935‚Äì36 African- American pilot John C. Robinson was head of the Ethiopian Air Force during the Italian invasion. Numbering only 20 unarmed planes, the force could do little against modern Italian aircraft. Skilfully using the mountain ranges and cloud cover, Robinson however managed to fly numerous reconnaissance missions before the Ethiopian defeat.Distinguished African Americans in aviation and space science. Betty Kaplan Gubert, Miriam Sawyer, Caroline M. Fannin. Greenwood Press: 2001. pp. 253‚Äì254 The Italo-Ethiopian War (1935‚Äì36), saw Ethiopia's defeat by the Italian armies of Benito Mussolini. Ethiopia (Abyssinia), which Italy had unsuccessfully tried to conquer in the 1890s, was in 1934 one of the few independent states in a European-dominated Africa. A border incident between Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland that December gave Benito Mussolini an excuse to intervene. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I pulled all forces back from the border so as not to give the Duce any reason for aggression, but to no avail. Rejecting all arbitration offers, the Italians invaded Ethiopia on October 3, 1935. The Ethiopians were poorly armed with antiquated artillery, obsolete firearms, little armor, and some 20 outmoded planes. The Italians had over 200,000 troops in place, well equipped with modern arms for air and ground fighting.Barker, p. 160 Under Generals Rodolfo Graziani and Pietro Badoglio, the invading forces steadily pushed back the ill-armed and poorly trained Ethiopian army, winning a major victory near Lake Ascianghi (Ashangi) on April 9, 1936, and taking the capital, Addis Ababa, on May 5. Italian operations included the use of hundreds of tons of mustard gas, banned previously by the Geneva Convention.Barker, pp. 2‚Äì189 The nation's leader, Emperor Haile Selassie, went into exile. In Rome, Mussolini proclaimed Italy's king Victor Emmanuel III emperor of Ethiopia and appointed Badoglio to rule as viceroy. In response to Ethiopian appeals, the League of Nations had condemned the Italian invasion in 1935 and voted to impose economic sanctions on the aggressor. The sanctions remained ineffective because of general lack of support, and because they excluded key war-making material- iron, coal, steel and most critically, oil. Strangely, aluminum, a metal that Italy had in plenty, and even exported, was on the list of sanctions that supposedly punished Italy. Although Mussolini's aggression was viewed with disfavour by the British, the other major powers had no real interest in opposing him. One historian notes that Britain could have starved the Italian war machine to a halt simply by closing the Suez Canal to the Duce, but while issuing public statements condemning Italy, Britain took no real action.W. Manchester, 1988. Winston Spencer Churchill: The Last Lion ‚Äì Alone, Little Brown and Co: pp. 160‚Äì178 Indeed, senior British and French officials hatched the cynical Hoare- Laval pact to carve up the country- handing three-fifths of Ethiopia to the Italians. Press leaks created public outrage that canceled the deal. Less than a year after the Italian invasion, the League voted to remove sanctions against Italy.Baer, George W. (1976). Test Case: Italy, Ethiopia, and the League of Nations. The war ultimately gave substance to Italian imperialist claims, and contributed to international tensions between the fascist states and the Western democracies. It also sounded the death knell of the League of Nations as a credible institution according to some historians. These outcomes were to eventually culminate in World War II. World War II Black governor Felix Eboue was instrumental in transferring fighting men and resources of Chad and equatorial Africa to de Gaulle's Free French Forces. This 1943 illustration details his involvement. Numerous Africans participated in World War II with black troops from France's colonial domains making up the bulk of the non-Europeans. Senegalese (sometimes a generic name for black troops from French colonies) put up a stiff fighting resistance against the Nazis during the great German Blitzkrieg into France. These, African troops were also to form a large part of the Free French Forces that maintained French resistance under Charles de Gaulle, outside the continent. In Africa, Felix Eboue, a black colonial administrator, was instrumental in rallying the territory of Chad for the Free French, adding thousands of fighting troops and masses of equipment to de Gaulle's cause. Other colonial formations were made up of troops from north Africa. As the Germans were beaten back, African troops made up the bulk of the initial forces that participated in the liberation of France during 1944, including supporting the French crossing of the Rhine. The British colonies mostly deployed African troops in both Africa and Asia. Thousands of white South Africans and Rhodesians saw service in the Middle East and the Mediterranean, while black soldiers were assigned to both logistics and support formations. Some black regiments however did see combat, such as the King's African Rifles in the conquest of Madagascar from Vichy France in 1942, and the thousands of men of two West African divisions that fought with the British 14th Army against the Japanese in Burma.Black soldiers, white wars: black warriors from antiquity to the present. William E. Alt, Betty Sowers Alt. (Greenwood Publishing Group), 2002, p. 2-136 =Destabilizing effects of WWII among colonial soldiers= World War II was to have a profound effect on attitudes and developments in the African colonies. Dissatisfaction at inequities under colonial administration developed and had significant effects as the de-colonization/liberation era approached. As various colonial reports note: :\\"Most of the thousands of Africans who became soldiers had never been out of their native lands. On active service, despite the dangers and hardships, they were well fed and clothed, and comparatively well paid. Many of them learned to read newspapers listen to wireless bulletins and to take an interest in world affairs. They learned to see their own countries in perspective, from the outside. On their return home, many of them became dissatisfied with conditions which were not so attractive as army life in countries more developed than their own... Such Africans, by reason of their contacts with other peoples, including Europeans, had developed a political and national consciousness. The fact that they were disappointed at conditions on their return, either from specious promises made before demobilization or a general expectancy of a golden age for heroes, made them the natural focal point for any general movement against authority.\\"CR Gibbs, Africans in World War II. thumb =More brutal treatment of black troops= Some WWII historians hold that black troops in France during the Western Campaign of 1940 were singled out for more brutal treatment by Nazi forces, even after making allowances for victor's anger at the steadfast resistance of the Negro units, who, as some German reports noted, \\"fought tenaciously, the blacks especially used every resource to the bitter end, defended every house.. to overcome the last Senegalese we had to kill them one by one.\\"\`\`Edgerton, Robert (2002) Africa's Armies: From Honor to Infamy. p vii :\\"Blitzkrieg‚Äôs real victor in 1940 was National Socialism. Hitler celebrated the successes of May and June in Nazi terms: as a triumph of will, informed by a consciousness of martial superiority that in turn depended on the racial superiority evoked and refined by the Third Reich. In that context, blitzkrieg played a central, arguably essential role in the \\"exterminatory warfare‚Äù that was Nazi Germany‚Äôs true contribution to modern war making. Some forewarning was given by the treatment of the West African troops the French deployed in large numbers during the campaign‚Äôs second half. The atrocities had historical roots: fear and resentment generated by French use of African \\"savages‚Äù in 1870 and 1914-18... After all allowances are made there is nevertheless no question that German soldiers, including men from the mobile divisions, disproportionately refused quarter to black combatants, disproportionately singled out black prisoners for brutal treatment including large-scale executions in non-combat situations, and justified themselves on racial grounds.\\" (Dennis Showalter - Hitler's Panzers_ The Lightning Attacks that Revolutionized Warfare)Dennis Showalter. 2009. Hitler's Panzers_ The Lightning Attacks that Revolutionized Warfare, p 174 While the post-surrender killings were not ordered as part of official Nazi regime policy, archival documents indicate that the German army massacred several thousand black POWs belonging to units drafted in France's West African colonies, amid the background of a long-running propaganda campaign identifying African as sub-human racial enemies. Some researchers hold that the massacres represent a significant link in the Nazis' progressive racial radicalization of the war.Raffael Scheck. 2008. Hitler's African Victims: The German Army Massacres of Black French Soldiers in 1940. p 11-143 While white British and French POWs were generally treated according to the Geneva Convention, not so the blacks, who were separated out from whites, North Africans and other colonial soldiers for special abuse. Massacres of the black POWs occurred in several different places, with some killings of a hundred at a time. Massacres did not just take place with POWs, but with wounded Africans on the battlefield, such as after African troops had recaptured Aubigny in a counterattack, but were later driven out. Some French reports claim an \\"indescribable rage\\" of German troops when they fought the black units, with no quarter given, compared to the white, a pattern contributing to far higher casualty rates among the Negro units than other French forces.Raffael Scheck. 2005. The Killing of Black Soldiers from the French Army by the \\"Wehrmacht\\" in 1940: The Question of Authorization. German Studies Review. Vol. 28, No. 3 (Oct., 2005), pp. 595-606 Such indicators of racialization began with the casual killing of captured Polish and African Untermensch in 1939 and 1940, and continued into the deliberate mass murder of millions of Soviet POWs after 1941, which was sanctioned as state policy.Raffael Scheck. 2008.

The post-Cold War era=Rise of asymmetric warfare and the \\"technicals\\" generation With the exception of a handful of nations such as Egypt and South Africa, most modern defense forces in Africa are comparatively small and lightly armed, although many have a limited number of heavy weapons such as older main battle tanks. The post- colonial era however has also seen the emergence of numerous non-state military forces, such as terrorists, rebel guerilla organizations, ethnic gangs, and local warlords with various political platforms. Such non-state actors add to the instability of the African situation, and the growth of asymmetric warfare and terrorism makes the military challenges in Africa more acute. The military landscape that these asymmetric forces operate in has been shaped by political instability and the massive introduction of inexpensive arms, such as the Chinese and Russian variants of the AK-47, rocket-propelled grenades, light mortars, and various multiple rocket launchers. The traditional mobility of the horse and camel is diminished from earlier times, but the rise of the technical, a pickup truck fitted with an individual crew- served weapon, has brought a comparative degree of mobility and firepower to fighting organizations within Africa, both military and paramilitary. While unable to match conventional armies openly in intensity of firepower and armor, the technicals and the weapons described above can cause significant harm when local light infantrymen fight on interior lines, and can deter the sustained intervention of foreign forces. One illustration of the continued relevance of lightly armed Third-World forces operating on their own ground is the 1993 American intervention in Somalia. Local militiamen downed two Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks with RPG-7s and killed 18 elite Army Rangers. Although Somali losses in the encounter were staggering and the Rangers carried out their assigned objectives, the affair prompted the United States to withdraw, ultimately leaving the field to the Somali defenders.Bowden, Mark (2010). Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War. New York: Penguin Group . Another tactically significant demonstration of today's African mobility was displayed in the Toyota War, which pitted an under-equipped and understrength Chadian army against 20,000 Libyan troops backed by 300 T-54/55 and T-62 tanks, thousands of armored personnel carriers, and Sukhoi Su-10 bomber aircraft. As one military analyst notes of the Chadian performance: :'In contrast, Chadian forces possessed nothing more sophisticated than a handful of older Western armored cars, and mostly relied on Toyota pick-up trucks mounting crew-served infantry weapons. The Chadians had no tanks, no APCs, no artillery, no air force, no infantry weapons heavier than the Milan antitank guided missile, and only the complicated and ineffectual Redeye shoulder- launched surface-to-air missile (SAM) for air defence, What's more, the Chadians did not operate their weaponry very well. Nevertheless, an army of as many as 20,000 Libyans was demolished by 10,000 Chadian regulars and 20,000 tribal militia during eight months of fighting.\\"Ken Pollack, Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness 1948‚Äì1991, University of Nebraska Press, p. 3 Guerilla organizations, paramilitaries and other asymmetric elements also continue to make an important impact in local areas‚Äîthreatening to overthrow local regimes as well as generating widespread misery and economic dislocation in various areas. Such patterns are not unique to Africa and are also seen in places such as the Balkans. Major modern forces in Africa The impressive 1973 Suez Crossing by Egyptian forces illustrated a new sophistication by modern Africa- based armies. Contrasting with the small scale, more fragmented pattern in many parts of the continent are the modern forces of such major powers as Egypt and South Africa. Well equipped for air and ground fighting, such regional powers represent a significant illustration of the growing capacities of Africa-based armies. The well-organized Canal Crossing of the Egyptians in the 1973 Yom Kippur War for example, is spoken of with respect by some Western military analystsChaim Herzog, The Arab-Israeli Wars, Knopf Publishing: p. 212-267 and demonstrates the degree to which some continental forces have mastered modern technology. However, detailed open-source evaluations of Egyptian military effectiveness, remain skeptical of any great capability leaps, arguing at length that the same problems that held the Egyptians back in 1956, 1967, and 1973 remain. The initial success at Suez for example, was comprehensively beaten back by the Israelis, first in the Sinai and then in the Battle of the Chinese Farm, leading to the cutting off of the Egyptian Third Army.Kenneth M. Pollack, Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness 1948‚Äì91, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London, 2002, Chapter 2 on Egypt Compared to previous Egyptian performances however, the Suez crossing represented a step forward, and showed an increasing sophistication on the battlefield.Chaim Herzog, The Arab-Israeli Wars, Knopf Publishing Further south, Somalia in July 1977 initiated the Ogaden War with Barre's government trying to incorporate the predominantly Somali-inhabited Ogaden region in Ethiopia into a Pan-Somali Greater Somalia. The Somali national army invaded the Ogaden and was successful at first, capturing most of the territory. But the invasion reached an abrupt end with the Soviet Union's sudden shift of support to Ethiopia and was forced to retreat with almost the entire communist world siding with Ethiopia. Somalia's initial friendship with the Soviet Union and later partnership with the United States enabled it to build the fourth largest army in Africa.Oliver Ramsbotham, Tom Woodhouse, Encyclopedia of international peacekeeping operations, (ABC-CLIO: 1999), p.222. While some fighting forces such as those maintained by South Africa have already been recognized for their professional competence and operational record, intermediate nations like Ethiopia also grow increasingly more sophisticated, adding to dynamic patterns of change and transformation illustrated from the earliest times on the continent, to the present. 21st century military challenges The large number of international military efforts in Africa has raised questions as to their efficacy. The military challenge in Africa is huge in the post-Cold War era. It is a continent covering some 22% of the world's land area, has an estimated population of some 800 million, is governed by 53 different states, and is made up of hundreds of different ethnicities and languages. According to a 2007 Whitehall Report, (The African Military in the 21st Century, Tswalu Dialogue), some issues affecting African militaries in the 21st century include:The African Military in the 21st Century: Report of the 2007 Tswalu Dialogue : May 3‚Äì6, 2007, Whitehall Report Series, 2007 *The continued need to build military proficiency and effectiveness *The threat of rebellions, coups and the need for stability *Unrealistic expectations by the West about what Africa should be doing about continental defence and security issues *The relevance of West Point or Sandhurst style training and thinking to the African context *The weak and fragmented nature of many collective security type arrangements ‚Äì such as the AU (African Union) ‚Äì weak clones of the NATO concept *The challenge of terrorism asymmetric warfare and how African forces shape themselves to meet them *The danger of giving militaries a bigger role in nation building and development. In Africa such activity touches on political power. *The appropriateness of international peacekeeping forces and bureaucracies in parts of Africa, with the mixed record of UN peacekeeping in the Congo or Rwanda raising doubts about their efficacy Future of African military systemsTheme of modernization= Some writers argue that military activities in Africa after 1950 resemble somewhat the concept of a \\"frontiersman\\" ‚Äì that is, warriors from numerous small tribes, clans, polities, and ethnicities seeking to expand their lebensraum ‚Äì \\"living space\\" or control of economic resources, at the expense of some \\"other.\\" Even the most powerful military below the Sahara, South Africa, it is argued, had its genesis in the notions of lebensraum, and the struggle of warriors from tribes and ethnicities seeking land, resources and dominance against some defined outsider. The plethora of ethnic and tribal military conflicts in Africa after the colonial period- from Rwanda, to Somalia, to the Congo, to the apartheid state, is held to reflect this basic pattern.Anthony Clayton, Frontiersmen: Warfare in Africa Since 1950, Taylor & Francis: 1999, pp. 1‚Äì9, 115‚Äì157 Others maintain that ethnic and tribal struggles, and wars over economic resources are common in European history, and military conflicts and development that these struggles aid or hinder can be seen as a reflection of the process of modernization.Richard E. Bissell, Michael Radu, Africa in the Post- decolonization Era, Transaction Publishers: 1984, pp. 15‚Äì67 =Inspiration from the past in African military systems= African troops fighting for France earned respect in some German reports for their tenacity during the Panzer Blitz of 1940. According to one German war document: ..the French fought tenaciously; the blacks especially used every resource to the bitter end, defended every house. To break them we had to use flame throwers, and, to overcome the last Senegalese we had to kill them one by one.Edgerton, p. vii Yet other writers call for a renewed study of the past as inspiration for future reforms. They maintain that there has been a decline in African military systems from their indigenous foundations of the pre-colonial era, and early post colonial phases. In these eras, it is argued, African military forces generally conducted themselves \\"with honor\\" but future decades were to see numerous horrors and infamy.Edgerton, pp. 2‚Äì12, 300‚Äì336 Peoples like the Asante, Zulu etc. fought hard and sometimes viciously, but this was within the context of their cultural understanding, at their particular time and place. There were no mass campaigns of genocidal extermination against others. Encounters with such African military forces it is held, often generated the universal code of respect between opposing warriors who had seen combat- one fighting man to another. An example of this can be seen in British writings such as post-mortem accounts of enemy leadership at the Battle of Amoaful against the Ashanti: :The great Chief Amanquatia was among the killed. Admirable skill was shown in the position selected by Amanquatia, and the determination and generalship he displayed in the defence fully bore out his great reputation as an able tactician and gallant soldier.\\"Charles Rathbone Low, A Memoir of Lieutenant-General Sir Garnet J. Wolseley, R. Bentley: 1878, pp. 57‚Äì176 According to R. Edgerton, historian of many African conflicts: :\\"These armed men ‚Äì and sometimes women- fought for territorial expansion, tribute and slaves; they also defended their families, kinsmen and their societies at large with their cherished ways of life. And when they fought, they typically did so with honor, sparing the elderly, women, and children... When colonial powers invaded Africa, African soldiers fought them with death- defying courage, earning such respect as warriors that they were recruited into the colonial armies not simply to enforce colonial rule in Africa but to fight for the European homelands as well. The French were so impressed by African warriors that they used them in the trenches of the western front in World War I, and African soldiers bore the brunt of German panzer attacks in World War II.. where they made a vivid impression on the far better equipped Germans..\\"Edgerton, pp. vii, 2‚Äì12 Likewise indigenous freedom forces fighting for independence indulged in savage fighting and some atrocities, but there were no wholesale massacres of tens of thousands. Indeed, some indigenous liberation forces went out of their way to spare combatants. It is claimed that this tradition of restraint and comparatively clean hands in the military sense, has been shattered and overshadowed by the bloody slaughters of civilians in numerous civil wars in Liberia or Sierra Leone, to mass genocidal slaughter of the latter 20th century in places like Rwanda and the Sudan. Added to these have been breaches of discipline seen in the large number of military coups, and assassinations afflicting the continent, military breaches that would have been unthinkable under fighting leaders of old like Shaka of the Zulu, or Opoku ware of the Asante. Too often it is argued, some of today's armies distinguish themselves by torture and murder of unarmed civilians, but show little appetite for real fighting against well-armed foes who can shoot back ‚Äì a stark contrast with the warriors of olden time ‚Äì like the Ethiopian, Zulu, Asante or Kongo hosts, who confronted credible opponents with much better technology, and still won.Edgerton, p. 4 A challenge to African militaries of the future is to restore this tradition of discipline and honor, and transform themselves once more to \\"armies of the people\\", according to some writers: See also *African military systems to 1800 *African military systems after 1800 *Military history of Africa *Mali Empire *Military history of the Mali Empire *Kingdom of Ndongo *Kingdom of Matamba *Kingdom of Kongo *Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba *Battle of Mbwila *Battle of Zama ReferencesBibliography *Barker, A.J.

Career background  Stephen Bolsin graduated with BSc Hons (Anatomy) London in 1974 and MB, BS London in 1977. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Anaesthetists London in 1982. Bolsin became a consultant anaesthetist at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, The Bristol Eye Hospital England in 1989. He was the first national audit co-ordinator of the Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthetists of Great Britain & Ireland London England 1991‚Äì1996. The Bristol paediatric cardiac surgery scandal In 1989, as a new consultant anaesthetist at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bolsin identified that too many babies were dying during heart surgery. He spent the next six years confirming the high mortality rates and attempting to improve the service. This led to a fall in mortality rates for children's heart surgery in Bristol from 30% to less than 5%; it also, however, led to direct confrontation with paediatric cardiac surgeons whom the hospital refused to investigate. Bolsin eventually took his concerns to the media and became a whistleblower.BBC, Bolsin: Maverick or martyr?, undated, accessed 17 August 2010 Bolsin's actions led directly to a major government inquiry, the Kennedy Report which made wide-ranging recommendations about reform of clinical governance in UK hospitals.Royal Bristol Infirmary Inquiry http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/index.htm (accessed 25 July 2009) From 1989 to 1995, Bolsin published numerous articles and chapters in textbooks relating to the provision of high quality cardiac services while he was a consultant anaesthetist at the Bristol Royal Infirmary.Donald Irvine (President of the General Medical Council) Medical Journal of Australia 2004; 181:27-28 He also acted as a Department of Health Committee member advising on the assessment of quality and performance in cardiac surgery in the UK from 1992 to 1995. Over the same period, Bolsin was a Department of Health Advisor on performance measurement and risk adjustment in cardiac surgery. The Department of Health Committee, supported by the then chief medical officer, Sir Kenneth Calman, was provided with ¬£3 million to introduce audit of cardiac surgical activity in the NHS and was chaired by Professor Taylor.  Significance of Bolsin's whistleblowing  Bolsin's actions significantly reduced high death rates for children's heart surgery in The Bristol Royal Infirmary.Tony Delamonth, BMJ, June 1998; Vol. 316: 1757Spiegelhalter DJ, BMJ, February 2002; Vol. 324: 261-262Paul Aylin et al, BMJ, October 2004; Vol.329:825-30 This was the first time that such a serious problem had been identified and then rectified in the NHS.Richard Smith. All changed, changed utterly BMJ June 1998; Vol. 316:1917-8 It remains to this day the most important single-handed clinical outcomes improvement brought about in the NHS.Donald Irvine (President of the General Medical Council) Medical Journal of Australia 2004; 181:27-28. Particularly as a result of widespread adoption of recommendations from the Kennedy Report, Bolsin's actions have affected clinical governance in each specialty in every hospital in the NHS. The concept of ‚ÄòClinical Governance‚Äô that has emerged and taken root in the UK NHS, Australia, New Zealand and globally, arose directly out of Bolsin's actions in Bristol. The GMC have confirmed that Bolsin was the only doctor in the UK prepared to write to them about the events in the children's cardiac surgery service at the Bristol Royal Infirmary.BBC, Bristol Babies Inquiry overview, last updated 6 January 2003, 11:31 GMT Over the years that this case was discussed in the House of Commons, Members of Parliament confirmed that Bolsin knowingly sacrificed his job, professional popularity and ultimately his young family's life in Britain in defence of his conscience, what he knew was morally right.Sir William Rees-Mogg 'Why did they allow so many to die?', 1 April 1996 The Times Newspaper, London Bolsin's achievements in establishing Clinical Governance across the UK and globally have never been formally acknowledged in the UK.Roger Berry MP, 17 January 2002, Hansard In 2013 Bolsin contributed his case to the Whistleblower Interview Project.

He entered the Society of Jesus in 1697. Works His great work is \\"A History of the People of God,\\" published in three parts. The first of these parts bears the title \\"Histoire du peuple de Dieu depuis son origine jusqu'√† la venue du Messie\\" (7 vols., Paris, 1728). A revised and augmented edition of this was published in Paris in 1733. Next followed (Paris, 1734), a supplement, containing a continuation of the prophecies of the Old Testament, the History of Job, maps necessary for understanding the sacred history, etc. By 1736 seven editions of the work had been issued. It was translated into German, Italian, Spanish, and Polish. The second part of the \\"history\\" was published, also at Paris, in 1753: \\"Histoire du peuple de Dieu depuis la naissance du Messie jusqu'√† la fin de la Synagogue.\\" in 1754 an √©dition plus exacte appeared at Antwerp (8 vols.) and in 1755, at Paris, still another edition (4 vols.). The latter contained five questions: (1) On Christ, the object of scriptures; (2) On Christ, the Son of God; (3) On Christ, the Son of Man; (4) On Christ, the founder of a new religion; (5) On the Presentation of Christ in the Temple and the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary. According to Augustin de Backer this second part of the History was published without the knowledge, and against the will, of the superiors in the Jesuit house in Paris. Berruyer put his name to only a small number of copies of this publication. The third part of the work has the title, \\"Histoire du peuple de Dieu, ou paraphrase des √âpitres des Ap√¥tres\\" (2 vols., Lyons, 1757). The work, as various parts appeared, aroused an uproar and some bitter controversy. The freedom with which he described certain facts was considered unbecoming. Serious fault was found with the author for giving to portions of the sacred narrative the air of romance rather than of sober history. Some propositions put forward by him were construed as favoring Nestorianism. But above all Berruyer was blamed for following the opinions of Jean Hardouin. The work was condemned by many bishops of France, by the superiors of the Society, by the Sorbonne, and by the Parliament of Paris. The first part was put on the Index, 27 May 1732; the second part, 3 December 1754, and by a Brief of Benedict XIV, 17 February 1758; the third part 24 April 1758, and by and Brief of Clement XIII, 2 December 1758. (See Index Librorum Prohibitorum, Rome, 1900, 62). A corrected edition of the first part, approved by the Roman Censors, was published at Besan√ßon in 1828.

Birds of prey are trained to fly with paragliders, guiding them to thermals. Parahawking was developed by British falconer Scott Mason in 2001. Mason began a round-the-world trip in Pokhara, Nepal, where many birds of prey ‚Äì such as the griffon vulture, steppe eagle and black kite ‚Äì can be found. While taking a tandem paragliding flight with British paraglider Adam Hill, he had the opportunity to see raptors in flight, and realised that he could combine the sports of paragliding and falconry. The team started by training two black kites, but have since added two Egyptian vultures, Kevin and Bob, to the team. Only rescued birds are used ‚Äì none of the birds have been taken from the wild. Mason and Hill documented their endeavours, with help from colleague Graham Saunders-Griffiths, in a film entitled Parahawking. In addition to being named Best Debut Film at the 2003 Festival International du Film de Vol libre in St- Hilaire, France (held as part of the Coupe Icare), and winning top prize in the 'Air' category at the 5th Hory a Mesto international festival of mountain films in Slovakia,'German film climbs to the festival's top', 3 May 2004 Parahawking was a finalist in the category of 'Best Film on Mountain Sports' at the 2003 Banff Mountain Film Festival, and competed for the title of 'Best Documentary' at the 2004 Cervino International Film Festival.

Despite these allegations parahawking stayed operational in Pokhara until 2017. In February 2017 Mason announced that parahawking has been shut down: :Thank you so much for all your concern and support, I know many are still wondering what is going on, it's still a very sensitive time so I really can't go into too much detail just yet. However I can announce that at present there will be no more Parahawking in Nepal, our project has been closed down and our birds, including our beloved Kevin and Bob have been confiscated. I appreciate that this is upsetting for many of you who have followed and supported us for MANY years. We are devastated, It's a difficult time for us all but we are working through it as a family and supported by many friends near and far. Just to reassure you, Kevin, Bob, Sapana, Goggles and Brad are safe and well and we are working hard to ensure they are well cared for, this situation is on going but our priority is their welfare at this time. Thank you all for believing in us and supporting us in our efforts to bring about awareness and support vulture conservation in Nepal. We have not given up, this chapter may be closed for now but there may be something exciting just around the corner. Watch this space! Scott On 15 February 2017 Mason announced on his Facebook page that the last ever parahawking flight in Nepal was performed with the vulture Bob and the passenger Paula Graham. Aftermath The government of Nepal confiscated all birds.

E. Toberman Estate, also known as Villa Las Colinas, is a gated Mission Revival mansion and estate on Camino Palmero in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1984. Architecture In 1922, C. E. Toberman hired architects Russell & Alpaugh to design his Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival style dream house, which took two years to build and was completed in 1924. The estate, built on a lot, includes a 19-room, main house, a guest apartment and garage, and a separate natatorium with a 30 by tiled pool with cabanas under skylights. The main house has eight fireplaces, a butler's pantry and cut-crystal doorknobs. Toberman, who lived to be 101 years old, recalled in a 1981 interview that the estate became \\"practically a country club\\" with its enclosed swimming pool, tennis courts, a nine-hole pitch-and-putt golf course, and formal gardens. History The house was built for Charles E. Toberman (1880-1981), a noted real estate developer who was known as \\"Mr. Hollywood\\" and the \\"Father of Hollywood\\" for his role in developing Hollywood and many of its landmarks, including the Hollywood Bowl, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, the Roosevelt Hotel, the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre and the Hollywood Masonic Temple. The house was reportedly featured in the first issue of Architectural Digest with a young Bette Davis at the front door. The Toberman family lived at the estate until 1941. It was situated on one of the most exclusive streets in Hollywood, adjacent to the Errol Flynn estate and with neighbors including Bette Davis, Samuel Goldwyn, Preston Sturges, Al Jolson, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson and Fatty Arbuckle. In 1980, the Toberman estate sold for $1 million (then a record price for a house in the Los Colinos section of Hollywood), and it was listed for sale in 1982 at a price of $1.5 million. The estate was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, after the property was purchased and renovated by Beverly Hills attorney and investor Donald L. Hunt. In the 1980s the house was recommended for Historic-Cultural Monument status by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission, but the proposal was initially rejected by the City Council because \\"the property owner and the councilman of the district object.\\" The estate was later designated as Historic Cultural Monument #285. Filming location The Toberman Estate has long been a popular filming location. In 1990, it was the principal filming location for the film Where Sleeping Dogs Lie. The Toberman Estate was also used as the home of Vincent Chase on the first two seasons of HBO's Entourage and the later sixth season. (\\"Vincent Chase's first mansion was just three doors down, in the former home of 1920s real estate magnate Charles Toberman.\\") The estate was later renamed \\"Villa Las Colinas\\" and is rented for receptions and special events.  August 2009 Fire  On the morning of August 30, 2009, a fire broke out in the kitchen of the main house. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded at 8:29 AM with 130 firefighters. The flames spread to the attic, and it took just over two hours for it to be extinguished. Two firefighters received minor injuries and were taken to local hospitals.

Maurice Le Sage d'Hauteroche d'Hulst (born at Paris, 10 October 1841; died there, 6 November 1896) was a French Roman Catholic priest, writer, and orator. He was the founder of the Institut Catholique de Paris.  Life  After a course in the Coll√®ge Stanislas, he entered the seminary of Saint-Sulpice and later proceeded to Rome to finish his ecclesiastical studies. There he obtained the doctorate in divinity. On his return he was for some time employed on the mission as curate in the populous parish of St. Ambrose. During the war of 1870 he became a volunteer chaplain in the army. In 1873 Cardinal Guibert called him to take part in the administration of the diocese, but he was engaged principally in founding and organizing the free Catholic University (then the Universit√© Catholique de Paris), which the bishops opened at Paris after the passage of the law of 12 July 1875, allowing liberty of higher education. He became its rector in 1880 and for fifteen years devoted himself to developing it in every branch of learning. In 1891 he succeeded P√®re Monsabr√© in the pulpit of Notre-Dame de Paris and preached the Lenten conferences there for six successive years, on the bases of Christian morality and the Decalogue. In 1892 he was elected deputy for Finist√®re on the death of Mgr Freppel. He died while still active, after a short illness. Works Besides two biographies, the \\"Vie de la M√®re Marie-Th√©r√®se\\" (Paris, 1872) and the \\"Vie de Just de Breteni√®res\\" (Paris, 1892), he wrote \\"L'√©ducation sup√©rieure\\" (Paris, 1886); \\"Le Droit chr√©tien et le Droit moderne\\", a commentary on the Encyclical \\"Immortale\\" of Leo XIII (Paris, 1886), a volume of \\"M√©langes philosophiques\\" (2nd ed., 1903); and also published two volumes \\"M√©langes oratoires\\" (Paris, 1891 and 1892) and the six volumes of his \\"Conf√©renees de Notre-Dame\\", with notes and appendixes (Paris, 1891‚Äì96). Among the many articles he contributed to the current reviews were the \\"Examen de conscience de Renan\\"; \\"Une Ame royale et chr√©tienne\\" (a necrology of the Comte de Paris), and \\"La Question biblique\\". Most of his occasional discourses were collected and published by the Abb√© Odelin in the four volumes entitled \\"Nouveaux M√©langes oratoires\\" (Paris, 1900‚Äì07).

Life Martinelli was born Shirley Burns Brennan in Philadelphia in 1918. Of Irish ancestry, she was the eldest of four children and began using the name Sherry by the time she was a teenager. Later told that her first name had the wrong numerological value, she modified it to Sheri. The name Martinelli came by way of a brief early marriage to painter Ezio Martinelli, by whom she had a daughter Shelley (named after the poet) in 1943. Sheri Martinelli was a prot√©g√©e of Ana√Øs Nin and is described at length in Nin's famous Diary; she was the basis for Esme, a major character in William Gaddis‚Äôs novel The Recognitions,http://www.williamgaddis.org/recognitions/martinelli/index.shtml William Gaddis's Sheri Martinelli links and then became the long-time muse and mistress of Ezra Pound in Washington, D.C. (she appears in various guises in the later Cantos); Charlie Parker and the members of the Modern Jazz Quartet hung out at her Greenwich Village apartment; Marlon Brando was an admirer and Rod Steiger collected her art, as did E. E. Cummings; she knew and was admired by many of the Beats - Ginsberg was an especially close friend and mentions her in one of his poems- and she was known in San Francisco in the late 1950s as Queen of the Beats; H.D. identified with her and wrote about her in End to Torment. She wrote unusual prose and poetry, much of it published in her own magazine, the Anagogic & Paideumic Review. She was one of the first to publish Bukowski, and her magazine was the very first to review his work.Beerspit Night And Cursing: The Correspondence Of Charles Bukowski And Sheri Martinelli 1960-1967 Edited By Steven Moore - Black Sparrow Press, 2001.

It was the first time a trade union was forced to pay common law damages to an employer for losses suffered through picketing in Australia. The dispute was also significant for boosting the career of the barrister representing the company, Peter Costello, leading him to stand for federal Parliament and become Treasurer in the Howard Government. Background Dollar Sweets was a confectionery company in the Melbourne suburb of Malvern employing 27 people on a 38-hour week basis. The award for the industry specified a 40-hour week. The Hawke Government and the ACTU had entered into a wages accord which provided employer superannuation, reduced taxation and other social gains in return for unions agreeing to not pursue excessive wage claims. At the same time, centralised wage fixing was introduced in September 1983 where indexed wage rises were automatically granted to those workers whose unions undertook to abide by the Arbitration Commission's principles. Several small unions, including the Federated Confectioners Association of Australia, refused to join the accord. The company owner, Fred Stauder, proposed an agreement with his employees in November 1983, that if they agreed to abide by the principles of the Arbitration Commission, the company would pay them the prescribed increases. All 27 employees agreed to the proposal.Peter Costello In Search of the Magic Pudding: The Dollar Sweets Story Published by the H.R. Nicholls Society, Accessed 6 August 2008 The dispute In July 1985, the Federated Confectioners Association started a campaign with employers for a 36-hour week. Although this breached Arbitration Commission wage-fixing principles, the union had never agreed to accept those principles. When the union demanded negotiations with Stauder on a 36-hour week, Stauder told the union he could not afford to reduce hours and offered to show his accounts to the union. A reduction in hours would have also broken the 1983 agreement Stauder had reached with his employees. Stauder offered his 27 employees that if they wished to continue to receive over-award pay for a (below-award) 38-hour week, they could do so if they signed a no-strike agreement; but, if they wanted to work a 36-hour week, they would have to find it elsewhere. Twelve employees accepted Stauder's offer, whereas the other 15 refused to sign the no-strike agreement and were subsequently sacked by the company, with the company employing another 15 workers in their place on existing conditions. On 22 July 1985, a picket line was established by the sacked workers outside the Dollar Sweets factory. The picket line remained for 143 days, with the company refusing to reinstate the workers. By October 1985, the company was still refusing to reinstate the sacked workers but through the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission had provided \\"an offer to assist in finding alternate employment within the industry and also to supply references to those people.\\" Commissioner Bain recommended \\"that those who have been picketing should accept the employer's offer and cease their picketing forthwith.\\". A number of bomb and arson threats were made against Dollar Sweets and one strike-breaking driver was assaulted and his truck vandalised. At one point, phone and telex lines were cut to the factory with telecom workers refusing to cross the picket line to repair the services. Dollar Sweets received strong support and assistance from Richard Mulcahy, chief executive officer of the Confectionery Manufacturers of Australia. By December 1985, it was decided to seek an injunction under common law against the union in the Supreme Court of Victoria, with solicitor Michael Kroger engaging Alan Goldberg to lead junior barrister and future federal Treasurer Peter Costello to represent the company. The case was financed by the Victorian Chamber of Commerce. The company alleged union interference with contractual relations, intimidation, nuisance, and a conspiracy to injure the plaintiff and sought an injunction and punitive damages. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Peter Murphy gave judgement, issued restraining orders on 12 December with the picket ending the next day. In his judgement, Murphy described the picketing as \\"stupid and nihilistic.\\" He ruled that this was not a \\"lawful form of picketing, but a... nuisance involving obstruction, harassment, and besetting\\". It was beside the point that there were specialist courts for industrial disputes. \\"This court is not without power ... and should intervene\\". He issued an interlocutory injunction against the picket,. The common law damages claim was settled in April 1988, when the union paid the sum of $175,000 to Dollar Sweets as compensation for the losses it suffered as a result of the picket. Aftermath Fred Stauder sold Dollar Sweets Holding Limited in 1999, which is now called Snack Foods Limited. Peter Costello described the case as \\"It came to be bracketed with the Mudginberri Abattoir case as a great victory against militant unionism\\".. Doug Cameron, the secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, with which the Federated Confectioners Association amalgamated, saw the dispute as a turning point. \\"It was when the social contract between workers, business and the government started to collapse,\\" and \\"It became a cause celebre for the big end of town and lawyers started to realise they could make money ripping off the pay and conditions of workers.\\" References Category:Arbitration cases Category:1985 in Australia Category:1985 labor disputes and strikes Category:History of Victoria (Australia) Category:Labour disputes in Australia Category:Labour history of Australia Category:1985 in Australian law Category:1980s in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Dollar Sweets dispute"},{"id":"18739915","text":"3R or three Rs may refer to: * The three Rs, a widely used abbreviation for the basic elements of a primary school curriculum: reading, 'riting (writing), and 'rithmetic (arithmetic) * The three Rs, a widely used abbreviation for the waste management hierarchy: reduce, reuse, and recycle * The Three Rs (animals), principles for ethical use of animals in testing: replacement, reduction, refinement * 3R (optical regenerator), an optical communications repeater that performs reamplification, reshaping, and retiming * Intelsat 3R, a former communications satellite * Yaesu VX-3R, an ultra-compact dual-band amateur radio transceiver * British Rail Class 206, Southern Region designation 3R from 3-car Reading Line stock * 3R (print size), a standard consumer print size for photographs * The 3Rs of Junior Forest Wardens (a Canadian outdoor-education program for families): Responsibility to yourself, Responsibility to others, Responsibility to your community and the planet * Return, Reclamation, Rehabilitation, rebel group in Central African Republic See also these *RRR (disambiguation) *R3 (disambiguation) ","title":"3R"},{"id":"18739932","text":"Trichosirius is a genus of small sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Capulidae (previously Trichotropidae).Rosenberg, G.

It was developed by Atle Selberg in the 1940s. Description In terms of sieve theory the Selberg sieve is of combinatorial type: that is, derives from a careful use of the inclusion‚Äìexclusion principle. Selberg replaced the values of the M√∂bius function which arise in this by a system of weights which are then optimised to fit the given problem. The result gives an upper bound for the size of the sifted set. Let A be a set of positive integers ‚â§ x and let P be a set of primes. Let Ad denote the set of elements of A divisible by d when d is a product of distinct primes from P. Further let A1 denote A itself. Let z be a positive real number and P(z) denote the product of the primes in P which are ‚â§ z. The object of the sieve is to estimate :S(A,P,z) = \\\\left\\\\vert A \\\\setminus \\\\bigcup_{p \\\\mid P(z)} A_p \\\\right\\\\vert . We assume that Ad may be estimated by : \\\\left\\\\vert A_d \\\\right\\\\vert = \\\\frac{1}{f(d)} X + R_d . where f is a multiplicative function and X = A. Let the function g be obtained from f by M√∂bius inversion, that is : g(n) = \\\\sum_{d \\\\mid n} \\\\mu(d) f(n/d) : f(n) = \\\\sum_{d \\\\mid n} g(d) where Œº is the M√∂bius function. Put : V(z) = \\\\sum_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix}d < z \\\\ d \\\\mid P(z)\\\\end{smallmatrix}} \\\\frac{1}{g(d)} . Then : S(A,P,z) \\\\le \\\\frac{X}{V(z)} + O\\\\left({\\\\sum_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} d_1,d_2 < z \\\\ d_1,d_2 \\\\mid P(z)\\\\end{smallmatrix}} \\\\left\\\\vert R_{[d_1,d_2]} \\\\right\\\\vert} \\\\right) where [d1,d2] denotes the least common multiple of d1 and d2.

H√§fele is the leading international manufacturer and supplier of furniture fittings and architectural hardware, with customers in more than 150 countries. H√§fele's furniture fittings (hinges, drawer systems, handles, connectors, ambient lighting), architectural hardware (door hardware and electronic locking systems), and other related fittings are specifically designed for the furniture, building, and hardware supply industries. H√§fele manufactures a diverse range of products from ironing boards to door closers. In the 2016 financial year the H√§fele group had a turnover of 1.311 billion Euros with 37 subsidiaries in 6 continents. In 2017, the turnover grew to 1.375 billion Euros and reached 1.5 billion Euros in 2019.https://www.haefele.de/en/info/about-haefele/company-profile/business- figures/462/ The turnover share abroad was 80%. The company has 8,100 employees worldwide.http://www.hafele.com/us/about-us/haefele-group/229.asp History= Foundation Phase  On December the 1st of 1923, the merchant Adolf H√§fele, together with Hermann Funk, founded the business \\"Products of the hardware and tool industry\\" in Aulendorf. Four years later this became a sole proprietorship with H√§fele as sole owner. A few months later, the company moved to Nagold, which was then the centre of W√ºrttemberg furniture production. At that time H√§fele had three employees, customers were mainly carpentries in the surrounding area. In order to guarantee fast delivery, a wholesale warehouse was set up.  Internationalization  The first exports to foreign countries were in 1933, in the same year the company was awarded the Golden Medal for the design of the exhibition stand at the Strasbourg Fair. Shortly before the end of the decade, the first furniture fittings catalogue appeared with a circulation of 20,000 copies, which was referred to as the \\"World Globe Catalogue\\" because of its title page. In 1948, the Adolf H√§fele company celebrated its 25th anniversary and the number of employees was 29. Four months later the company founder died. His nephew Walther Thierer took over the management. A major fire destroyed the administration and warehouse in 1950, and it was not until a year later that the company was able to move into its new premises. In the following 30 years the company grew to up to 700 employees, with whom an annual turnover of over 150 million DM was achieved, and expanded its sphere of activity to 120 countries. Sales subsidiaries were founded in Switzerland, France, Great Britain, the USA and Australia. In addition, the company was distributed among four production companies in Germany. At the beginning of the 1960s, computer-controlled shipping was introduced. At the beginning of the 70s, a dispatch center with a high-bay warehouse was built. By 1977, the area available for storage had doubled to 8,400 square meters; today, the company operates a central warehouse with over 50,000 items, some of which is fully automated. After the death of Walter Thierer in 1982, Hans Nock, until then export manager, took over the management of the company. Until 2003 he managed the company, which during this time grew to 2900 employees with a turnover of 534 million euros, and the share of foreign business in this increased to around 70 percent. As Hans Nock's successor, Sibylle Thierer has been the third generation of the family to run the company since 2003. According to the company, more than 160,000 customers are served in more than 150 countries.  Catalog  At the beginning of the 1970s, Walther Thierer developed a reference book for furniture fittings with 25,000 articles based on the model of his uncle's \\"World Globe Catalogue\\". In 1971 \\"Der Gro√üe H√§fele\\" was published with a print run of 60,000 copies, followed two years later by editions in English, French and Spanish. A first catalogue for building and object fittings followed in 1981.  Production  H√§fele produces fittings in four plants in Germany, since 1983 also furniture connectors sold under the brand name \\"ixConnect\\", and since 2009 also lift fittings branded \\"Free\\" and sliding door fittings under the brand \\"Slido\\". With effect from 1 September 2009, H√§fele GmbH & Co KG together with Heinrich J. Kesseb√∂hmer KG took over the lift fittings and sliding door fittings divisions of Huwil Werke GmbH and a production facility in Hungary re-branding the operation \\"FCC\\" of \\"Flap Competency Center\\" and the product line \\"Free\\".  Company Structure = Sales Offices  In addition to the headquarters in Nagold, there are ten sales offices in Germany. These are in Berlin (founded in 1995), Frankfurt am Main, Kaltenkirchen, Cologne (1991), Hanover, Munich (1985), M√ºnster (2001), Naumburg (1990), Nuremberg and Stuttgart Airport (2012). Abroad there are sales offices in Dubai (since 1998), Lahti in Finland, Marousi in Greece, Hong Kong, Bolzano, Zagreb, Maia in Portugal (1999), Budapest in Hungary, J√∂nk√∂ping in Sweden (1999) in Kru≈°evac in Serbia and Dar es salaam in Tanzania (2019). A second warehouse and dispatch centre is to be opened in Lehrte (near Hanover) in summer 2019 in addition to the existing dispatch centre in the \\"Wolfsberg\\" industrial estate in Nagold.  Subsidiaries  H√§fele has subsidiaries in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland (since 1963), Archdale, North Carolina, USA (since 1975) and Rugby, UK (since 1980). This was followed by the establishment of companies in Dandenong, Australia, in 1982, a year later in Burlington, Canada, and in Taverny, France, in 1985. In 1986 more were added in Kilcoole in Ireland and Lentate sul Seveso in Italy. In the following years, subsidiaries were established in the Netherlands (Apeldoorn, 1987), in Singapore (1988) and in Botany, New Zealand, in 1989. A further expansion took place in the 1990s, when subsidiaries were established in Shah Alam, Malaysia (1993), Yokohama, Japan (1994), Bangkok, Thailand (1994), South Korea's capital Seoul, Manila, Philippines, and Serpong, Indonesia (all three in 1996), with a focus on Asia. Other companies were also added on other continents, such as Madrid, Spain, in 1997, Quer√©taro, Mexico and Honeydew, South Africa (both in 1997), and then twice in South America: in 1998 in Piraquara, Brazil, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1999. In the same year, the Danish Skive was added, followed by Wugu Shiang, Taiwan, in 2000, and Hof, Salzburg, Austria, a year later. Since 2002 there has been a subsidiary in the Polish town of D≈Çugo≈Çƒôka, followed a year later by Zele in Belgium and Mumbai in India. Beijing (China) and Turkish Istanbul were added in 2005.

It is named after its colourful plumage, and is a 'color canary', bred for the novelty of its color rather than for its song. It is kept by those who want a pet, as well as those who enjoy showing. It is an active bird, hardy and very easy to keep; however, it is not easy to breed. First bred in the 1920s, it is the only colour canary that has an element of red as part of its plumage. It was developed as a cross between another type of finch, the now- endangered Venezuelan red siskin (Spinus cucullata), and a yellow domestic canary (Serinus canaria forma domestica). A well-built bird, the red factor canary is about in length. These canaries are bred for showing, so therefore many versions of this canary exist today. They are divided into the Melanins and the Lipochromes classes. These are further divided into frosts (soft feather) or non-frosts (hard feather), which affect how bright their color appears. Red factor canaries are usually available at most pet stores, and can also be found through bird shows, bird clubs, breeders, and on the Internet.

M√≠mamei√∞r is solely attested in the Old Norse poem Fj√∂lsvinnsm√°l. Due to parallels between descriptions of the two, scholars generally consider M√≠mamei√∞r to be another name for the world tree Yggdrasil, along with the similarly named Hoddm√≠mis holt, a wood within which L√≠f and L√≠fthrasir are foretold to take refuge during the events of Ragnar√∂k. M√≠mamei√∞r is sometimes modernly anglicized as Mimameid or Mimameith.The anglicization Mimameid is used in such modern works as Lindow (2001:232), whereas Mimameith appears in Bellows (1923:242). Fj√∂lsvinnsm√°l M√≠mamei√∞r is mentioned in stanzas of the eddic-meter poem Fj√∂lsvinnsm√°l, where the tree is described as having limbs that stretch over every land, bearing helpful fruit, and as harboring the cock V√≠√∞√≥pnir.

Fjolsvith responds that: > {::Benjamin Thorpe translation: :Mimameidir it is called; :but few men > know from what roots it springs: :it by that will fall which fewest know. > :Nore fire nor iron will harm it.Thorpe (1907:98).  ::Henry Adams Bellows > translation: :\\"Mimameith its name, and no man knows :What root beneath it > runs; :And few can guess what shall fell the tree, :For fire nor iron shall > fell it.\\"Bellows (1923:242).  } This stanza is followed by another where Svipdagr asks Fj√∂lsvi√∞r what grows from the seed of the tree. Fj√∂lsvi√∞r responds that fruit grows from the tree: > {::Benjamin Thorpe translation: :Its fruit shall on the fire be laid, > :for labouring women; :out then will pass what would in remain: :so is it a > creator of mankind.\\"  ::Henry Adams Bellows translation: :\\"Women, sick with > child shall seek :Its fruit to the flames to bear; :Then out shall come what > within was hid, :And so is it mighty with men.\\"Bellows (1923:243).  } In the notes to his translation of this stanza, Bellows comments this stanza is to be understood as explaining that, when cooked, the fruit of M√≠mamei√∞r‚Äîwhich he identifies as Yggdrasil‚Äîwill assure safe childbirth. A third mention occurs when Svipdagr tells Fj√∂lsvi√∞r to tell him what the name of the glittering, golden cock is that sits \\"on the highest bough\\". Fj√∂lsvi√∞r complies, revealing that the cock is named V√≠√∞√≥pnir: > {::Benjamin Thorpe translation: :\\"Vidofnir he is called; in the clear > air he stands, :in the boughs of Mima's tree: :affliction only brings, > together indissoluble, :the swart bird at his lonely meal.\\"Thorpe (1907:98). >  ::Henry Adams Bellows translation: :\\"Vithofnir his name, and now he shines > :Like lightning on Mimameith's limbs; :And great is the trouble with which > he grieves :Both Surt and Sinmora.\\"  } Theories Scholar Rudolf Simek connects M√≠mamei√∞r with M√≠misbrunnr (\\"M√≠mir's well\\"), which is located beneath one of the three roots of the cosmological tree Yggdrasil. Simek concludes that due to the location of the well, M√≠mamei√∞r is potentially another name for Yggdrasil. In addition, Simek says that Hoddm√≠mis holt (\\"Hoard-M√≠mir's\\" holt)‚Äîa wood whose name refers to the same figure and wherein L√≠f and L√≠f√ærasir survive Ragnar√∂k‚Äîmay also be another name for Yggdrasil, and therefore is likely the same location as M√≠mamei√∞r.Simek (1995:216 and 154). Scholar John Lindow concurs, noting that if the figures within the location names are the same, then the identification of all the locations as within close vicinity is likely.Lindow (2001:179).

Description Norfolk Biffins, or Beefings, are round, slightly flat, apples about three inches across and two and a half inches high (about seven by six centimetres). The skin is yellow-green, but with brown-purple and dark red streaks. Inside, the flesh has a green tint, is crisp, and is said to have a hint of the flavour of cinnamon. The apples store well, getting sweeter with keeping, and are good for cooking and drying.Norfolk Beefing at probertencyclopaedia.comNorfolk Beefing at practicallyedible.com By March of the year after harvesting, they are sweet enough to use as dessert apples.APPLES - COOKING VARIETIES at chrisbowers.co.uk With keeping, they turn a deeper brown or maroon colour, with harder, more solid flesh.Don, Monty, Mistletoe and vine in The Observer dated Sunday December 16 2001, online at guardian.co.uk These apples were popular with Norwich bakers and were sent to London fruiterers as a delicacy. They were also used for cider making. The trees are vigorous, with heavy crops of fruit. Some thinning is necessary in good years. Biffins Norfolk Biffins dried in the oven are known as \\"biffins\\" (cf. baked apple). Flat in appearance and soft to the touch, biffins are prepared in large quantities in Norfolk, England. The apples are baked very slowly in an oven for a long period of time. Children used to be given them as a treat, as they might receive ice-cream or crisps nowadays, or they could be taken home to eat with cream. These were slowly cooked whole, then cored, then rubbed with sugar. To eat, you would peel off the tough skin, and garnish with more sugar and cream. You would eat them cold or room temperature. Very popular in Victorian times but largely died out commercially after World War II. In Asia, the large native persimmon is treated to a processing and flattening to be used in cooking reminiscent of the Biffin. History Robert Walpole, an early Norfolk Biffin admirer The Norfolk Biffin is an apple variety grown over some three hundred years, often for drying to make 'biffins' (viz., \\"a baked apple flattened in the form of a cake\\"). The estate records for Mannington, Norfolk, dating from 1698, of Robert Walpole (later the first Prime Minister of Great Britain) mention Norfolk Biffin apples which Walpole had sent up to his house in London. The apple is documented in the United States from the 1840s.Barnes, G. C., Norfolk's Biodiversity Habitat Action Plans - Traditional orchards at norfolkbiodiversity.org The Norfolk Biffin is also mentioned by Charles Dickens, first in A Christmas Carol and in Martin Chuzzlewit (1843), later in Dombey and Son (1846-1848)Dickens, Charles, Dombey and Son (1846-1848), Chapter 60, online at wikisource.org and in Boots at the Holly-tree Inn (1858). The first of these says: \\"Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the yellow of oranges and lemons, and in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner\\". The last of these has: \\"Cobbs, do you think you could bring a biffin, please?... I think a Norfolk biffin would rouse her, Cobbs. She is very fond of them.\\"Dickens, Charles The Holly Tree: Second Branch - The Boots at pagebypagebooks.com The Victorian food writer and poet Eliza Acton recommends the apple in her Modern cookery, in all its branches (1845) as the best apple to use when baking 'Black Caps par Excellence' (a sugared baked apple made with wine and lemon peel): \\"The Norfolk biffin answers for this dish far better than any other kind of apple\\".Acton, Eliza, Modern cookery, in all its branches (London: Longman, Brown, Green & Longmans, 1845) p. 531 online A recipe for biffins of 1882 advises: \\"... choose Norfolk Biffins with the clearest most blemish free rinds, then lay them on clean straw on baking wire and cover well with more straw. Set them in a very slow oven for four to five hours. Draw them out and press them very gently, otherwise their skins will burst. Return them now to the oven for another hour, then press them again. When cold, rub them over with clarified sugar\\".Fruit Group Newsletter 03 at rhs.org.uk, accessed 7 August 2008 In Victorian London, there was a Christmas trade in biffins, supplied by Norwich bakers, who cooked the apples in their bread-ovens, weighed down with an iron plate to exclude air. The apple is now only rarely seen in English orchards, having been widely replaced by such varieties as the Cox's Orange Pippin. However, it is still grown by gardeners for home consumption and the cultivar can still be bought commercially.

Beginning in February, it lasted 32 days and as a result, virtually wiped out all of spring training. Also because of the lockout, Opening Day was moved back a week to April 9. In addition to this, the season had to be extended by three days in order to accommodate the normal 162-game schedule. History=Background The five-year Basic Agreement between the players and owners was set to expire on December 31, 1989. During the buildup to the lockout, the two sides spent months trying to iron out long- standing disagreements over free agency and arbitration. By the end of the 1989 season, salaries for top players were already nearing the $3 million-a- year level. Desperate to stop the salary hike, the owners proposed an economic partnership in which revenue sharing would play a major role. =The owners' plan= Therefore, the owners set forth a plan in which 48% of gate receipts and all revenue from local and network broadcasting would go toward paying player salaries. These salaries would be based on a pay-for-performance scale, in which players with less than six years of experience would be compensated based on a ranking against their peers. Perhaps most importantly, a salary cap would be placed on each club. In the process, there would be a stipulation put in place that teams reaching the said cap could make no more free agent signings or salary increases. Owners claimed that under the plan, average player salaries would proceed to rise over 20% to $770,000 by the 1993 season. They cited rising attendance figures as well as solid television contracts with CBS and ESPN. =The MLBPA's response= Although revenue sharing of this type had worked considerably well in the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) Executive Director Donald Fehr, feared that a salary cap would restrict the number of choices free agents could make. Also, Fehr argued that a pay-for-performance scale would eliminate multi-year contracts. Resolution Commissioner Fay Vincent worked feverishly with both sides, and ultimately on March 19, a new Basic Agreement was reached. The minimum major league salary was raised from $68,000 to $100,000. Meanwhile, a six-man study committee on revenue sharing was established.

History=Later Zhao In the Yezhongji (ÈÑ¥‰∏≠Ë®ò) ('Record of Affairs at the Capital of the Later Zhao Dynasty') by Lu Hui, covering the history of the Later Zhao (319-351 AD) court in China, the text describes various mechanical devices used, including the wheeled odometer for measuring distance and the south-pointing chariot for indicating cardinal direction.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 256. Two engineers in particular, the Palace Officer Xie Fei and Director of Imperial Workshops Wei Mengbian,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 257. were known for their designs and worked at the court of Shi Hu (r. 334-349). The two had crafted a four-wheeled carriage about 6 m (20 ft) long with water-spouting dragons hanging over a large golden Buddhist statue that had a mechanical wooden statue of a Daoist continually rubbing his front.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 159. Other mechanical figures included ten Daoists dressed in monastic robes who continually rotated around the Buddha while periodically bowing, saluting, and throwing incense into a censer. All of these mechanical figures were driven only by the movement of the carriage; once the carriage halted, the figures stopped moving and the water stopped spouting from the artificial dragons.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 160. Xie and Wei created a similar device operated by wheel motion called the field mill, although it served a more practical purpose than the theatrical display of moving statues and water-spouting dragons.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 256-257. The Yezhongji states that the two devised a \\"pounding cart\\" or \\"pounding wagon\\" which had figurine statues armed with real tilt hammers who pounded and hulled rice only when the cart moved. In addition to this they had a \\"mill cart\\" (field mill or camp mill) which had rotating millstones mounted on their frames, which would rotate and grind wheat as the cart moved forward. Just like the carriage with mechanical figures mentioned above, when the carriage stopped, the devices associated with them halted. Europe Use of the field mill in China seems to have died out in use after the Later Zhao, since it was no longer mentioned in Chinese texts until Ming Dynasty.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 255 & 257. The Italian military engineer Pompeo Targone, who was most notably involved in the Siege of La Rochelle (1627-1628) in western France, invented the field mill in Europe by 1580.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 255. As shown in the Italian Vittorio Zonca's engineering treatise of 1607, two mills mounted to a wagon are rotated by a horse whim and gearing while in a stationary position at military camp or near billets. In the Yuanxi Qiqi Tushuo Luzui ('Collected Diagrams and Explanations of the Wonderful Machines of the Far West') compiled and translated in 1627 by German Jesuit Johann Schreck (1576-1630) and Ming Dynasty Chinese author Wang Zheng (ÁéãÂæµ 1571-1644), a field mill is shown amongst other devices. In this picture, two mills are operated by the gearing of a rotating bar and a whippletree harnessed to a single horse, unlike the two horses seen in Zonca's illustration.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 255-256.

It is a cosmopolitan species, that is found worldwide. In Europe, it is found in fields, on sandy heaths, or grassy commons in the autumn. It is found in rainforest and eucalypt forest as well as heathland in Australia. Taxonomy Hygrocybe miniata was first described by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus miniatus in 1821, before being renamed by the same author in 1838 as Hygrophorus miniatus. German mycologist Paul Kummer then assigned it to the genus Hygrocybe in 1871. The specific epithet miniata comes from ‚Äòminiat‚Äô, which means \\"painted with red lead\\". Description The cap is convex initially, but later flattens and becomes depressed with a wavy edges. The centre of mature fruiting bodies is noticeably scurfy, or scaly. This is a feature that is best seen on dry specimens, that have not been rained on. The cap colour is scarlet-orange with a yellow striate margin, and is 0.5‚Äì3.5 cm in diameter. The bare stem is often long, (up to 3 times the cap diameter) and tapering towards the base, with a tendency to flatten. It is the same colour as the cap, or slightly paler, with a white base. The gills are orange, adnate (with a broad attachment to the stem) or slightly decurrent; widely spaced, and somewhat notched. The flesh is orange, and is devoid of any odour. The spore print is white, and the ellipsoid spores measure 7‚Äì9 x 4‚Äì5 Œºm. A very similar species (only recently described) H. helobi (Arnolds) Bon; appears earlier in the season, prefers less acidic soils, and smells of garlic. Distribution and habitat Hygrocybe miniata is a cosmopolitan species, having been recorded in most of the temperate zones. It has been collected from Britain, Europe, America, and the equivalent zones in the Southern Hemisphere such as eastern and southern Australia, where it has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. In Britain it appears in autumn, particularly in frost-free periods, and prefers sandy heaths, grassy clearings, or unimproved fields. It is often seen in the company of mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella). In Australia, it can be found in temperate to subtropical rainforest and eucalypt forest as well as heathland. Fruiting bodies may appear in groups among the leaf litter from January to June. Edibility Edible, but of no consequence.

Mission  Set up in 1987 and operating under the supervision of the Minister of State responsible for Trade, Artisan Trades, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, Tourism and Services, the mission of Maison de la France was to promote France as a tourist destination, principally in other countries. As of May 1, 2009, ODIT France and Maison de la France merged and became a single structure: Atout France. It fully integrates the tasks of the original structures.  Offices  Atout France has operations on 5 continents, with 32 offices in 27 countries. The offices of Atout France employ 250 people and are responsible for promoting France as a tourist destination in the various markets, grouped into major geographical areas of operation, on the basis of annual action plans. They are involved in all areas of tourism promotion (information to the public, press relations, commercial promotion, etc.). Priority markets Atout France gives priority to investing in the major outbound tourism markets, which are the countries of the European Union, North America and Japan. The International Advisory Board The International Advisory Board was set up by Maison de la France at the beginning of 2003, with the collaboration of Air France and under the sponsorship of the Ministry of Tourism. This authority brings together 250 tourism professionals from all over the world recognised for their contribution to the development of France as a destination. The board members both play an advisory role with Maison de la France and act as ambassadors of the tourist image of France in their particular market, along with the offices of the EIG.  Campaign strategy  The campaign strategy is bringing in new measures, such as the creation of the Qualit√© France logo or affinity marketing, and is setting up tools for evaluating markets and campaigns. Long-haul markets The Europe approach to long-haul markets takes the form of joint promotional campaigns within the European Commission on Tourism and/or through bilateral agreements with national tourist boards.

By virtue of being programmable, tests like load regulation, battery discharge curve measurement and transient tests can be fully automated and load changes for these tests can be made without introducing switching transient that might change the measurement or operation of the power source under test.  Implementation  Programmable loads most commonly use one transistor/FET, or an array of parallel connected transistors/FETs for more current handling, to act as a variable resistor. Internal circuitry in the equipment monitors the actual current through the transistor/FET, compares it to a user-programmed desired current, and through an error amplifier changes the drive voltage to the transistor/FET to dynamically change its resistance. This 'negative feedback' results in the actual current always matching the programmed desired current, regardless of other changes in the supplied voltage or other variables. Of course, if the power source is not able to supply the desired amount of current, the DC load equipment cannot furnish the difference; it can restrict current to a level, but it cannot boost current to a higher level. Most commercial DC loads are equipped with microprocessor front end circuits that allow the user to not only program a desired current through the load ('constant current' or CC), but the user can alternatively program the load to have a constant resistance (CR) or constant power dissipation (CP). Advanced DC Programmable loads offer additional test capabilities with internal controls that can detect oscillations within a fraction of a second and immediately stabilize the load profile. By eliminating the effects of oscillation and current spikes a programmable load can protect against damage to your mission critical electronics. Electronic load testing systems for defense, aerospace, commercial electronics and utilities industries, as well as for mega data center performance often require special modes of operation such as constant voltage, constant current, constant resistance and constant power. For some demanding applications, these electronic load banks may offer fast slew rates and pulsed load profiles such as sine, square, triangle and ramp as well as internal capacitance, inductance, and time delay modes of operation. Today's most advanced programmable loads typically offer 16bit measurement and drive accuracy for superior performance. *Sophisticated internal controls guard against oscillations and current spikes  References  Category:Electronic test equipment Category:Hardware testing Category:Electronic engineering ","title":"Programmable load"},{"id":"18740438","text":"Station building is a train station in Niimi, Okayama Prefecture, Japan.

While the presence of specialized terminology is a feature of technical texts, specialized terminology alone is not sufficient for classifying a text as \\"technical\\" since numerous disciplines and subjects which are not \\"technical\\" possess what can be regarded as specialized terminology. Technical translation covers the translation of many kinds of specialized texts and requires a high level of subject knowledge and mastery of the relevant terminology and writing conventions. The importance of consistent terminology in technical translation, for example in patents, as well as the highly formulaic and repetitive nature of technical writing makes computer-assisted translation using translation memories and terminology databases especially appropriate. In his book Technical Translation Jody Byrne argues that technical translation is closely related to technical communication and that it can benefit from research in this and other areas such as usability and cognitive psychology. In addition to making texts with technical jargon accessible for a wider ranging audience, technical translation also involves linguistic features of translating technological texts from one language to another.Byrne, Jody. Technical Translation. The Netherlands: Springer, 2006. Translation as a whole is a balance of art and science influenced by both theory and practice.Larson, Mildred L., ed., Translation: Theory and Practice, Tension and Interdependence. (Binghamton: American Translators Association Scholarly Monographs, 1991). Having knowledge of both the linguistic features as well as the aesthetic features of translation applies directly to the field of technical translation.  Background  As a field, technical translation has been recognized, studied, and developed since the 1960s.Thompson, Daniel. \\"Theophilus Presbyter: Word and Meaning in Technical Translation.\\" Medieval Academy of America 42.2 (1967): 313‚Äì339. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2854679.Finch, C. An Approach to Technical Translation: An Introductory Guide for Scientific Readers. New York: Pergamon Press, 1969. Stemming from the field of translation studies, the field of technical translation traditionally emphasized much importance on the source language from which text is translated. However, over the years there has been a movement away from this traditional approach to a focus on the purpose of the translation and on the intended audience.Kingscott, Geoffrey. \\"Studies in Translatology.\\" Perspectives 10.4 (2002): 247‚Äì255. This is perhaps because only 5‚Äì10% of items in a technical document are terminology, while the other 90‚Äì95% of the text is language, most likely in a natural style of the source language.Newmark, Peter, A Textbook of Translation. New York: Prentice Hall, 1988. Though technical translation is only one subset of the different types of professional translation, it is the largest subset as far as output is concerned. Currently, more than 90% of all professionally translated work is done by technical translators, highlighting the importance and significance of the field.  Methods and practices = Technical translator  The role of the technical translator is to not only be a transmitter of information, but also to be a constructor of procedural discourse and knowledge through meaning, particularly because often, the technical translator may also take on the role of the technical writer. Research has demonstrated that technical communicators do, in fact, create new meaning as opposed to simply repackaging (198) old information. This emphasizes the important role that technical translators play in making meaning, whether they are doing technical translation in one language or in multiple languages.Rush Hovde, Marjorie. \\"Creating Procedural Discourse and Knowledge for Software Users: Beyond Translation and Transmission.\\" Journal of Business and Technical Communication 24.2 (2010): 164‚Äì205. Much like professionals in the field of technical communication, the technical translator must have a cross-curricular and multifaceted background. In addition to grasping theoretical and linguistic orientations for the actual translation process, an understanding of other subjects, such as cognitive psychology, usability engineering, and technical communication, is necessary for a successful technical translator. Additionally, most technical translators work within a specialized field such as medical or legal technical translation, which highlights the importance of an interdisciplinary background.\\"Translator Career Path.\\" ProZ Translation Workplace. 2011. http://wiki.proz.com/wiki/index.php/Translator_career_path. Finally, the technical translators should also become familiar with the field of professional translation through training.Weiss, Timothy. \\"Translation in a borderless world.\\" Technical Communication Quarterly 4 (1995): 407‚Äì25. http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ525808 Technical translation requires a solid knowledge base of technological skills, particularly if the translator chooses to utilize computer-assisted translation (CAT) or machine translation (MT). Though some technical translators complete all translation without the use of CAT or MT, this is often with pieces that require more creativity in the document. Documents dealing with mechanics or engineering that contain frequently translated phrases and concepts are often translated using CAT or MT.  Translating technical texts  Analysis Translators might read the document to understand what they will be translating, and determine the context of the text. In technical translation, the register and tone would then be determined based on the type of text and the context, although generally the tone of technical texts are neutral. The register can be very formal and scientific, or made to be easily understood by the general public. A translator might also need to use documentation techniques find resource materials as aids in order to translate the text. Comprehension Depending on the translator's experience and nature or the text, the translator might need to assess the degree of difficulty and type of difficulty in a text, such as whether they are able to translate the text properly in a timely manner, or whether there are more specific translation problems that they do not understand. Often, translators may have an area of expertise, and may be very familiar with certain terminology and texts. However, when a translator cannot learn all of the subject knowledge, it is possible to transfer over knowledge from other subjects that might be similar in nature, or do some research. Research enables translators to have a ‚Äúgood and solid understanding of the basic principles and technologies‚Ä¶‚Äù The translator must not only translate the terminology, but also the style in which the author originally wrote the document, to create the same effect in the target language. Along with previous subject knowledge, research helps the translator understand the basics of the text. Some of the tools a technical translator might use as well are glossaries, encyclopedias, and technical dictionaries, most of which may be recently published, as technology evolves quickly. The translator must always keep up to date with new technologies in the field they are translating into as well, by attending conferences or courses, or subscribing to magazines, so that they are using the latest terminology. In the case of terminological or language issues that the translator cannot solve on their own, the translator may do research or call on the experts of a particular field for more clarification and explanations. This includes working with all types of workers in certain technological and industrial fields, such as engineers, managers, etc. Two types of experts that a translator may consult while translating are the author who wrote the text in the source language and the expert in the target language. The author can explain the context and what they are trying to say, whereas the expert in the target language may be able to explain the terminology or what the author was trying to convey in the target language. Translation is teamwork rather than strict cooperation between the translator and the experts. However, if the information the experts provided does not resolve problems, for example, if there are terms that are difficult to translate and some that cannot be translated, it may be possible to explain concepts in the target language through examples. Translation Translators may bounce back and forth between steps, depending on their time constraints and their experience in translation. For instance they might revise at the same time as they are translating. A translator may also go through their reference materials and research depending on how familiar they are with the type of text. If they need to find the closest matches for clients, they may use translation memories or machine translation software. The translation process also depends on the laws and ethics codes put into place in certain regions, as well as any censorship, which might affect the outcome of the text. Revision Revision may depend on the translator's experience or nature of the text. In translation agencies, revisers may be hired to do the revising, but a freelancer may have to revise their own work. In the case of a pharmaceutical text, depending on the laws, it would require revision since the information in the source text could cause potential harm if mistranslated. There also may be certain style guides that the translation agencies may use that must be followed. = Technical writing = Although technical writing and technical translation may be similar in the content they work with, they are different as translators translate what the technical writers produce. The purpose of technical writing, is to explain how to do something. Technical translating is similar, however it attempts to communicate how someone else explains how something is done. ‚ÄúThe technical translator, like the technical writer, wants to produce a document that is clear and easy to understand‚Äù. Translators may also consider controlled language and whether it applies in their target language culture.  Machine translation  Overview = Practitioners within the field of technical translation often employ what is called machine translation (MT), or machine- assisted translation. This method of translation uses various types of computer software to generate translations from a source language to a target language without the assistance of a human.Zhang, H. \\"Babel not: Machine translation for the technical communicator.\\" ProZ The Translation Workplace. 2008. http://www.proz.com/doc/1717. There are different methods of machine translation. A plethora of machine translators in the form of free search engines are available online. However, within the field of technical communication, there are two basic types of machine translators, which are able to translate massive amounts of text at a time. There are transfer-based and data-driven machine translators. Transfer-based machine translation systems, which are quite costly to develop, are built by linguists who determine the grammar rules for the source and target languages. The machine works within the rules and guidelines developed by the linguist. Due to the nature of developing rules for the system, this can be very time-consuming and requires an extensive knowledge base about the structures of the languages on the part of the linguist; nonetheless, the majority of commercial machine translators are transfer-based machines. Yahoo! BabelFish is a common example of a platform that uses this type of translation technology.Smarter Technology. \\"Hybrid Systems Offer Smarter Machine Translation Among Languages.\\" Last modified November 23, 2009. http://www.smartertechnology.com/c/a/Technology-For-Change/Hybrid-Systems- Offer-Smarter-Machine-Translation-Among-Languages/. Data-driven machine translators, also known as statistical-based machine translators, work by aggregating massive amounts of previously translated bits of information, and uses statistical analysis to determine matches between the source language and target language with the previously aggregated corpora. This method is less expensive and requires less development time than transfer-based machine translation, but the generated translation is often not to the same quality as transfer-based translation. The translation services offered through Google use transfer-based translation technology.Google. \\"About Google Research.\\" Last modified 2011. http://research.google.com/about.html. Technical translation could raise privacy concerns for some professional or corporate translators. = Effectiveness = For technical translators without access to expensive machinery, the Internet hosts many online translation sites that are either free or require a small fee. Some research has been done in order to test the effectiveness of various online translation tools. In one article, researchers looked at the success of online machine translators in retrieving appropriate search results. Looking at Google translator, Babelfish (previous to the merge of Babelfish and Yahoo!), Yahoo!, and Prompt, test searches were based on translating key search words and comparing the search results with a monolingual search. Using computer-based statistical analysis, the results showed that translated search results were only 10% less effective than a monolingual search, making the translated search fairly successful in retrieving appropriate information. However, the success in this particular study was only possible when English was one of the target languages.Savory, Jaques, and Ljiljana, Dolmamic. \\"How Effective is Google's Translation Service in Search?.\\" Communications of the ACM 52.10 (2009): 139‚Äì143. http://0-search.ebscohost.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=iih&AN;=44619003&site;=ehost- live&scope;=site. Other research points to the effectiveness of machine translation when paired with human interaction. In a mixed methods experiment, researchers first examined the effectiveness of machine translations using statistical analysis and then used subjects to test out a new type of machine translation (TransType2) that required human interaction as a part of the translation process. The results of the experiment showed that human interaction is a vital supplement for overall accuracy in machine translations. This research demonstrates the importance of the role that technical translators can play in the process of translating technical documents.Casacuberta, Franciso, Jorge Civera, Elsa Cubel, Antonio L. Lagarda, Guy Lapalme, Elliot Macklovitch, and Enrique Vidal. \\"Human Interaction for High-Quality Machine Translation.\\" Communications of the ACM 52.10 (2009): 135‚Äì138. = Advantages = While no machine translation device is able to replicate or replace the dynamics of a human translator,Krauwer, Steven. \\"Machine Translation: State of the Art, Trends and User Perspective.\\" In Language Resources for Language Technology: Proceedings of the TELRI (Trans- European Language Resources Infrastructure) European Seminar. Tihany, Hungary: 1995. machine translation certainly poses important advantages. In fact, there are many practical uses for and implications of machine translation for the field of technical translation. Machine translation has major cost advantages as compared to human translation. In fields of technical communication where information is constantly changing, for example, the stock market or jobs related to the weather, the cost of paying a human translator to constantly update information would become quite expensive. Additionally, situations that involve translating massive volumes of information over a short period of time, or situations that require speedy and frequent communication would benefit from machine translation. In such circumstances, a machine translator would be advantageous from a financial perspective.  Culture = Translating culture  Just as important as proper translation of linguistic qualities of languages is the subject of culture and how specific cultural features are transferred and communicated in the field of technical translation. In fact, a mutual understanding of cultural components is just as important as linguistic knowledge in technical translation. This highlights the complicated nature of working with technical translation. Various cultures can exhibit drastic differences in how communication occurs, even when both cultures are working with the same target language. One Canadian technical translator and consultant working with Russian colleagues detailed difficulties while working with both North American English and global English. Encountering discrepancies in rhetorical writing strategies, differentiation in tones, document formatting issues, and conflicting conceptual goals for engineering reports, the author emphasizes cultural practices, outside of the direct realm of linguistic forms, that can impede proper communication in technical translation.Aetemeva, Natasha. \\"The Writing Consultant as Cultural Interpreter: Bridging Cultural Perspectives on the Genre of..\\" Technical Communication Quarterly 7.3 (1998): 285. In an example using a commonly translated document, the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a researcher used correlation analyses, including semantic network analysis and spatial modeling, to interpret data describing differences among seven different translated versions of the document. Demonstrating how culture plays an important role in the process of technical translation, the results of the study showed that while the translations were fairly similar, cultural subtleties and differences existed in each language's translated version. For example, across the seven languages, common words such as \\"people\\", \\"individual\\", \\"man\\", \\"nation\\", \\"law\\", \\"faith\\", and \\"family' had differing levels of importance in relation to other words in the language. While in Arabic the word \\"man\\" exhibited high levels of importance in the text, other languages placed higher levels of importance with words such as \\"person\\" or \\"individual\\". In another example, the English word for \\"entitle\\" and the Chinese word for \\"enjoy\\" carried connotations attached to the concept of \\"rights\\",Kyounghee, Kwon, and George Barnett. \\"Assessing Cultural Differences in Translations: A Semantic Network Analysis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\" Conference Papers ‚Äì International Communication Association (2008): 1‚Äì59. http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/0/3/1/p230314_index.html. demonstrating a linkage of concepts unique to each individual language. These slight differences demonstrate the culturally specific nuances that exist across languages. As with any type of non-MT, it is still a process completed by human beings, making it impossible for total objectivity. International technical communication cannot ignore cultural differences, so seeing how the differences affect translation is fundamental for professionals in the field. Additionally, one's cultural knowledge base, or lack thereof, can be detrimental to the effectiveness of communication, particularly when communicating warnings or risk factors. Considering how differing knowledge paradigms as a result of cultural factors can prompt people to respond in a variety of ways to different rhetorical strategies, particularly when communicating messages containing warnings of hazards or risks, understanding culture must be a priority in technical translation. One researcher found that a variance of definition of terms and inconsistent paradigms of cultural knowledge highlight the need for a new delineation of what technical writers consider as the target audience while communicating risk factors. What might be appropriate for one audience must be reconsidered for a culturally different audience.Sauer, Beverly A. \\" Communicating Risk in a Cross-Cultural Context: A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Rhetorical and Social Understandings in U.S. and British Mine Safety Training Programs.\\" Journal of Business and Technical Communication 10.3 (1996): 306‚Äì329. Looking at a specific example concerning the hazardous occupation of mining, one piece of research demonstrates how different cultures different perceptions about safety information. Comparing risk communication in mining in the United States and the United Kingdom, the researcher discovered variations among the perceptions of who is responsible for promoting safety in the workplace. While one culture felt that the user or worker was responsible for promoting his or her own safety in the workplace, another culture perceived the science behind the process or document to be responsible for the promotion of safety. As risks, warnings, or cautions are often important components of a technical document in need of translation, the technical translator will understand how such cultural differences can affect the effectiveness of the translated message. Avoiding assumptions about a culture and allowing one's own knowledge base to consider more diverse populations will create more effective cross-cultural communication not only when working with risky environments, but in general communication as well. Some research has investigated the possibility of a universal writing style in order to help with the translatability of writing across different cultures and languages. However, demonstrating the difficulty of such a task, one researcher addressed the assumption that unambiguous wording eases effective communication. He gave examples from certain Asian contexts when unclear communication was actually helpful because the unequivocal language forced communicators to rely more heavily on oral discourse than on written documents.Weiss, Timothy. \\"Reading Culture: Professional Communication as Translation.\\" Journal of Business and Technical Communication 11.3 (1998): 321‚Äì338. The example of the effectiveness about ambiguous language not only shows problems with a universal writing style for technical translation, but also reiterates another example of how culture plays an important role in proper technical translation.  Culture and technology  In an age where technology allows for increased accessibility and faster communication, the technical translator must understand the role that culture plays in how people interact with, react to, and utilize technology and how these culturally related concepts can affect communicated messages. Demonstrating how technology use differs across cultures, one researcher created a presentation that took a holistic look at preparing documents for ethnically diverse audiences, pointing out other non-linguistic topics that require special attention in communication across cultures. For example, the presenter noted items to be considered including measurement systems, types of graphics and symbols, and types of media presentation tools. The author also pointed out significant differences that would affect communication among English languages including paper layouts, spelling, meaning, and use of humor.Mulvihill, Teresa. (2001). \\"International Technical Communication and Today's Technologies.\\" PowerPoint presentation, 2001. Retrieved from www.binarything.com/binarything/openpublish/TeresaMulvihill.ppt. This important and practical information can be used by professionals working with technical translation. Additionally, technical translation involves understanding how the Internet has influenced different cultures across the globe. Varying languages, cultural influences on Internet usage patterns, and media preferences force professionals in the field of technical communication to utilize a number of different strategies in order to effectively reach diverse populations across the globe. With international online populations the technical translator must be culturally diverse in a technological sense.St. Amant, Kirk. Culture, Communication & Cyberspace: Rethinking Technical Communication for International Online Environment. Amnityville, NY: Baywood Publishing CO, 2011. Finally, as technology makes intercultural and international communication easier, the technical translator must understand intercultural communication as it relates to ethics. Traditional models for ethical decision-making can be applied to difficult situations in technical translation, but the professional must avoid stereotyping and ethnocentrism in technical communication and translationVoss, Daniel, and Flammia, Marcia.

English as a lingua franca = English effect on translation  Technical translation is the medium through which language, discourse and communication can exist in a global world.Hermans, Johan, and Lambert, Jos√©. \\"From Translation Markets to Language Management: The Implications of Translation Services\\" Target 10.1 (1998): 113‚Äì132. http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/targ/1998/00000010/00000001/art00005. As technology creates easier and faster means of communication and the world moves toward becoming a global community, the need to communicate with people from multiple language backgrounds also grows. Rather than working with multiple languages, some have proposed the idea of using English as the primary language for global communication, making English the lingua francaCharles, Mirjaliisa. \\"Language Matters in Global Communication.\\" Journal of Business Communication 44.3 (2007): 260‚Äì282.‚Äîor a common world language. However, English as a lingua franca has various implications for the field of technical communication. Particularly for technical translators who are native speakers of English, there is the tendency to assume a unilateral stance on translation. In other words, the technical translator's objective is to translate to and from English, with the English message being the main focus. While English is a language of global communication, it is not the only language being used for communication, highlighting the importance of moving away from \\"singular perspective\\" of only communicating in English.St. Amant, Kirk. \\"Expanding Translation Use to Improve the Quality of Technical Communication.\\" Professional Communication, IEEE Transactions 43 (2002): 323‚Äì326. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=867949. The concept of maintaining technical communication in languages other than English is of particular significance in countries with high volumes of multilingual speakers. For example, research has shown that the English-speaking bias, due to the language's position as the lingua franca, within technical translation and communication has negatively affected native Spanish speakers in the United States. Lacking both in quality and quantity, user manuals for various electronic devices exemplified sub-par translations into Spanish, demonstrating the limited accessibility of certain technical documents to speakers of languages other than English, perhaps partly as a result of English as the lingua franca.St. Germaine-Madison, Nicole. \\"Instructions, Visuals, and the English-speaking Bias of Technical Communication.\\" Technical Communication 53.2 (2006): 184‚Äì194. http://0-www.ingentaconnect.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/content/stc/tc/2006/00000053/00000002/art00004. Finally, when discussing English as a lingua franca it is noteworthy to mention what some researchers call \\"untranslatable\\" wordsBlenkinsopp, John, and Maryam Shademan Pajouh. \\"Lost in translation? Culture, Language and the Role of the Translator in International Business.\\" Critical Perspectives on International Business 6.1 (2010): 38‚Äì52. and what that means for technical translation. Such words or phrases are composed of concepts that are not easily translated from one language to another. A word is considered \\"untranslatable\\" when there is either no direct corresponding word in the target language, requiring the word to be described or when important cultural connotations from the source language are not properly communicated through the target word. For example, a common example in English of an untranslatable word is the German word \\"schadenfreude\\", which means to exhibit joy as a result of someone else's misfortune. This word exemplifies untranslatability due to the lack of a corresponding word; however words can be untranslatable due to a lack of a corresponding word, loss of cultural meaning, or for both reasons. One study demonstrated that when faced with untranslatable words, technical translators resorted to avoidance tactics that evaded using the words altogether. The implications of untranslatable words and phrases suggest that the technical translation may not benefit from only utilizing English as a lingua franca, and rather, should focus efforts toward having more effective means of translating documents among multiple languages. It is notable that technical documentation contains multilingual lexical language, such as use of Latin and Greece terms in English such as \\"subdural hematoma\\" referring to \\"blood clot under the skull\\", drawing from Latin \\"sub\\", \\"duro\\", \\"hematoma\\"; and the use of Japanese in Chinese terms, e.g. \\"ÊÄ•ÊÄßÁõ¥ËÖ∏ÁÇéÈñãÂàÄÊâãË°ì\\" in which \\"Áõ≤ËÖ∏\\" \\"blind instestine\\" first appeared in Japanese as \\"Ëü≤ÂûÇ\\" \\"hanging worm\\".

In 1384 he served on a number of royal commissions and was knighted. After serving with Richard II on an ill-fated Scottish campaign in 1385 he accompanied John of Gaunt in 1386 on his expedition to Spain. In 1389, 1392 and 1397 he served as High Sheriff of Lincolnshire and represented Lincolnshire in parliament as Knight of the Shire for 1400, and in 1401 was summoned to the privy council. In 1402 he again represented Lincolnshire in the parliament that met on 1 Oct 1402 and two days later he was elected speaker. The parliament was held at Coventry before moving to Westminster (due to problems with lodgings and food), with the Lord Chancellor asking for: > Ways and means for maintaining the war against Scotland, for utterly > subjecting the enemies of Wales, for wholly conquering Ireland and for > defending Guienne, Calais and the Marches thereof. Alarmed at the scale of the request, Parliament took several days to consider it, but found they couldn't come to any conclusion. On 10 October they asked permission to confer with members of the House of Lords, which the King granted under duress. As a result, 4 Bishops, 4 Earls and 4 Barons were ordered to attend, and the end decision was a three-shilling tax on wine and a 15 pence tax on merchandise to sponsor the King's efforts. It is reported that Henry was so pleased with the result that he invited both houses to dine with him privately.The Lives of the Speakers of the House of Commons, from the Time of King Edward III to Queen Victoria, James Alexander Manning, G.

These features may be built up from sand or snow, or eroded into rock, snow, or ice. Aeolian landforms are commonly observed in sandy deserts and on frozen lakes or sea ice and have observed and studied across Earth and on other planets, including Mars and Pluto Terminology The word \\"aeolian\\" derives from √Üolus, the Greek god of the winds, and the son of Hellen and the nymph Orseis, and a brother of Dorus, Xuthus and Amphictyon. Mechanisms Sand blowing off a crest in the Kelso Dunes of the Mojave Desert, California. Aeolian landforms are formed when wind moves sediment (see aeolian processes). Sediment particles move when they are lifted by upwards Bernoulli forces that exceed their downwards weight. Depending on the balance of these forces, particles may either creep (roll) across the surface; saltate (hop) from point to point; or be suspended entirely in the air. Once sediment transport begins, it continues via gravity and momentum: particles that fall out of the air typically impact the surface with enough force to dislodge further particles (called reptation). These impacts are separated in space by the saltation hop length of the traveling particles, which creates distinct areas of erosion and/or deposition. As time passes, the surface rises in areas with net deposition, and lowers in areas with net erosion, creating initial landforms. Larger aeolian landforms alter the surface wind field in patterns that promote their growth. They are thus very stable, once formed. Aeolian landforms are typically described in two categories: erosional and depositional.  Types of landform =Depositional  Depositional landforms grow when sediment is deposited into an area faster than it is removed. These bedforms grow from snow during blizzards, or from sand and dust in areas where wind patterns trap particles. For example, the Great Sand Dunes in Colorado grow as sand blown from a wide plain is deposited against the edge of the Sangre de Cristo mountains. Depositional landforms include dunes, barchan dunes, ripple marks, and loess. Erosional  Erosional landforms grow when more sediment is removed from an area faster than it is deposited. They are widespread in hardened, wind-swept snow surfaces, such as the Antarctic Plateau: see sastrugi. In sand and rock, they are rarely preserved except in arid regions. Outside of arid regions, moving water - which is heavier and more erosive than wind - erases aeolian landforms. There are several types of landforms associated with erosion: lag deposits, ventifacts, yardangs and pans. Large basins are complex and there is often one or more non-aeolian process at work, including tectonics, glacial and alluvial forces.

They are often used by the military for aerial combat training and analysis.  Subsystems  ACMI usually includes 4 major subsystems. ; Control and Computation : The Control and Computation Subsystem (CCS) is usually a rack-mounted personal computer running applications that calculate Time-Space-Position-Information (TSPI). ; Transmission Instrumentation : The Transmission Instrumentation Subsystem (TIS) is firmware running at or near a communications tower on the range the aircraft are flying around. The TIS will have 1-9 remote interrogators (remotes) scattered throughout the range. One of these remotes is at the TIS, and is referred to as the \\"remote at Master\\". Each remote interrogates an AIS pod (see below) loaded on each aircraft flying on range, and receives the response and relays it to the TIS. ; Airborne Instrumentation : Antiquated ACMI systems triangulated each pod's position and relayed that TSPI back to the CCS. Modern ACMI systems no longer triangulate; instead, a GPS unit is installed in each Airborne Instrumentation Subsystem (AIS) pod to calculate its own position, thereby relieving the CCS of the triangulation algorithm. The CCS now gets a complete TSPI message from the AIS pod via the TIS, and forwards this data to a display system. ; Advanced Display and Debriefing or Individual Combat Aircrew Display : Advanced Display and Debriefing Subsystems (ADDS) are quickly vanishing and being replaced by Individual Combat Aircrew Display Systems (ICADS) because the ICADS software can run on any compatible personal computer. ICADS is the display software that receives data from the CCS and displays it in a three-dimensional graphical user interface.  Autonomous air combat maneuvering instrumentation  Autonomous air combat maneuvering instrumentation (AACMI) are second-generation GPS-based ACMI systems. Unlike first-generation ACMI systems, which use ground radars to track and record the position of the aircraft on the range, AACMI systems use aircraft-mounted satellite navigation systems such as the US NAVSTAR GPS system. Recording of aircraft tracks can therefore be independent of ground- based radar, and are sometimes called range-less or autonomous.

This enables real-time air-to-air exercises to be carried out and also complex ground debriefs (after-action review or AAR) based on data recorded at the time. Such de- briefs involve the use of modern graphics and display techniques that can bring out training and other points to aircrew and ground staff.

In 1996, he moved to SV ADO and then Neptunus in 1997. With Neptunus, he became Hoofdklasse champion each year from 1998‚Äì2005, one of the greatest dynasties in Netherlands baseball history. He went 2 for 5 in the 1997 World Port Tournament, his lone Dutch national team appearance of the 20th Century. Sluijter returned to the national team in 2002, appearing in the Haarlem Baseball Week. He went 1 for 4 as a backup infielder; in the Gold Medal game, he was a late substitute for Evert-Jan 't Hoen and did not bat in a 5-4 loss to the United States. In the 2002 Intercontinental Cup, he was 1 for 3, backing up former AAA player 't Hoen at second and former major leaguer Ralph Milliard at shortstop. Sluijter played for the Dutch in three events in 2003. In the 2003 World Port Tournament, he was a starter and hit .292/.452/.292 and led the event with 7 walks. He led the Netherlands with 2 hits (in 3 tries) in a 3-2 loss to Cuba in the Gold Medal game, though he did make one error at third base. He was 0 for 2 with 2 walks and a run in the 2003 European Championship and did not play in the Gold Medal game, which the Netherlands won. In the 2003 Baseball World Cup, he only played one inning in the field as the backup 2B to 't Hoen and went 0 for 1 at the plate. In the 2004 Hoofdklasse season, Sluijter tied for 6th with 9 doubles. He was 0 for 3 in the 2004 Haarlem Baseball Week and did not play in the Gold Medal game, which the Orange won against Cuba. It was his last time on the national team for four years. In 2005, Sluijter tied for 8th in the Hoofdklasse with 26 runs, albeit only tied for 5th on Neptunus. He hit only .213/.323/.272 that year and fielded .940 at the hot corner. The next year, he had his best season yet, batting .324/.380/.394. He tied Sidney de Jong and Reily Legito for 7th in the loop with 10 doubles and was 12th in average. His .947 fielding percentage led the Hoofdklasse third baseman. 2007 was a down year as he hit .220/.348/.295 and fielded .899 at third. In the 2008 European Cup in Regensburg, Sluijter hit .444/.500/.833 with 7 runs and 7 RBI in 5 games. Against the Templiers de S√©nart, he was 3 for 3 with 2 homers and a walk to lead the Neptunus charge.

Hamilton, and Claus Valca. The Japanese animated television series Last Exile has a cast of characters designed by artist Range Murata. All names are displayed according to their spelling in the English subtitled version of the series, as released by Funimation Entertainment or in the romanization of the Japanese names as they appear on official merchandise published after the English localization of the series. Creation and conception Tatiana Wisla, a supporting character serving as a vanship pilot on the battleship Silvana, wearing a modern flight suit. The initial concept designs for Last Exile were created by character designer Range Murata. Murata also spent a great amount of time on costume design. Wanting to portray each character's personality more fully, he \\"tried to draw in the kind of material that would have been used in creating their clothes and try to represent the stitches connecting the fabric\\". Although Gonzo initially intended for Last Exile to be shown in a space setting, it did not want characters who use sterile space suits. As a result, Murata's designs placed the show in its current setting. Although the fictional world of Prester is not a representation of Earth, it features technology reminiscent of nineteenth century Europe at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Many of its designs were also inspired by Germany's technological advances during the interwar period. Uniform designs for Anatoray's musketeers were based on Napoleon Bonaparte's army and American Civil War soldiers. On the other hand, Soviet Red Army fur coats provided the basis for Disith uniforms. The crew of the Silvana wore uniforms that were more modern and utilitarian. Production of Last Exile relied heavily on 3D computer animation. The animation for Last Exile was also supplemented with Victorian era flourishes. In order to combine hand-drawn animation with computer-generated ones, the production team used a technique for non-photorealistic rendering, which could not be used for Blue Submarine No. 6 (a previous work of Gonzo and one of the first CG anime series) because of a stylistic conflict. At the 2003 Anime Expo, production designer Mahiro Maeda, who also worked with Studio Ghibli's production of Laputa: Castle in the Sky, commented that \\"[Last Exile] is very advanced in how it will incorporate the two mediums\\". Last Exile=Protagonists The story of Last Exile revolves Claus Valca and Lavie Head, who fly their vanship as sky couriers. Although they usually take up missions of relatively low difficulty, they are one day asked to complete the mission of dying courier Ralph Wednesday. The mission, rated seven stars out of ten, is to deliver a young girl named Alvis E. Hamilton to the mysterious battleship Silvana. Despite their fears, Claus and Lavie deliver Alvis to the battleship but decide to remain aboard to keep her safe. It is later revealed that Alvis holds the key to uniting the two warring nations of Anatoray and Disith. =Claus Valca= : is a fifteen-year-old pilot employed by the Norkia Vanship Union, a sky courier service for the nation of Anatoray. Claus is known for his signature flight technique, the Immelmann turn, and possesses a flight record \\"not even an adult could outdo\\". Claus is no stranger to the vanship courier lifestyle, having been born into and raised for the lifestyle by his late father Hamilcar Valca (much like navigator Georges Head raised daughter Lavie). Their fathers died while attempting to cross the \\"Grand Stream\\" on a mission that would have brought peace to Prester.The two were delivering a message that would have ended a long-standing feud, had it arrived. After this and his mother's death, Claus followed in his father's footsteps throughout his childhood and early adolescence to become a top-notch pilot.It is mentioned by several characters (Lavie, \\"Hurricane Hawk\\", several unnamed couriers in the first episode, etc.) that Claus is at least equal to his father in piloting ability, who is in turn referred to as an experienced and talented pilot. While transporting their special \\"cargo\\", Alvis Hamilton, Claus and Lavie's vanship is damaged and they are forced to stay onboard the Silvana. The captain of the ship, Alex Row, had been the young pilot who delivered news of his father's death to his family. On top of that, he caught the eye of Dio Eraclea, who was fascinated with his skills as a vanship pilot. Though uncomfortable in his presence, Claus treats Dio as a friend. =Lavie Head= : is Claus Valca's navigator and vanship mechanic. The moody, outspoken redhead is proud of her lineage as seen in her protectiveness of her vanship (thought to have belonged to their fathers). Unlike Claus, she is relatively reluctant to stay on the Silvana and favors the freedom of the vanship lifestyle. She abhors the use of vanships for military purposes, and deplores Claus's interest in becoming a combat pilot. Along with her friendly nature, she can hold grudges with others. Her feelings for Claus are obviously conflicted. She treats Claus mostly like a dear friend and sibling, sometimes acts the part of nagging but caring wife, insofar as she cooks for him and rustles him out of bed. She seems to have repressed romantic feelings for Claus, judging by the somewhat simmering jealously she feels when Tatiana Wisla starts showing an interest in Claus. This most prominently appears when Claus and Tatiana return to the Silvana with Tatiana wearing Claus's pilot suit. As the events of the series unfold, the emphasis of the story began to shift away from her and Claus, instead focusing on the plights of the two countries in Prester, and the treachery of the Guild. However, she and Claus bore witness to Alvis' release of \\"Exile,\\" and in the end, chose to settle in the new world. =Alvis E. Hamilton= : is a peculiar eleven-year-old child and \\"the cargo.\\" Alvis (or \\"Al\\") is targeted by the Guild and it becomes apparent that she is the \\"key to Exile.\\" Her nurse, Guita, and the pilot who was commissioned to transport her, Ralph Wednesday, were killed as a result of the Guild's pursuit. Claus Valca tended to Ralph when he crash landed and that's how they met Al. Ralph knew he was going to die and asked Claus to take his dangerous mission in delivering Al to the Silvana. While Ralph distracted the Guild pilot with his engine, Claus and Lavie drifted downstream with their vanship and Ralph self detonates his ship to save the three of them. When Al woke up, she was confused and scared of Claus and Lavie Head because she was unconscious during the whole ordeal. She wanted to know whatever happened to her previous guardians, but Claus and Lavie made up an excuse that they were simply away. Al's intuition was enough for her to figure out they are dead. During the night while Claus planned their route, the Guild already caught up to their house and had to make an early run before morning. They did not run far before the Guild fighter caught up to them. At the last moment Alex used a pistol to kill the pilot and recovered their \\"cargo.\\" Al was knocked out during the Guild fighter assault. After she came to, she woke up again to new strangers (Silvana crew). Claus during that time didn't like Alex's facial expression and worries the safety of Al. He steals highly purified fuel from what's left of the Guild fighter and flew to the Silvana to find Al. After everyone was reunited, Claus remained with the Silvana crew to look after Lavie and protect Al. Al does not know of her importance, but learns of it while under the care of the Silvana. Al is revealed to be member of the Guild House of Hamilton which has the ability to control Exile and unlocking it by knowing the answers to the questions that form the four Mysteria (see below). The Guild's Maestro Delphine Eraclea kidnapped Al and Claus to discover the secrets of Exile. She needed to recite all four passages, but Alex was smart enough to not know of the fourth and final one should he ever get captured and interrogated. After Lucciola helped Al and Claus escape from the Guild, Al ended up back in Norkia with Claus. They ventured back into the Grand Stream to use the vanship Lavie worked so hard on to adapt to Grand Stream conditions. After they entered the domain, Al and Claus got to the other side of the Grand Stream, she finished reciting the poem that would unlock Exile's true form. At the end of the series, Claus and Alvis recite the four Mysteria, allowing Exile to shed its defensive cocoon and reveal itself. The Mysteria, in their correct order of recitation, and their responses are: #\\"What lies in the furthest reaches of the sky?\\" \\"That which will guide the lost child back to her mother's arms: Exile.\\" #\\"The waves that dye the land gold.\\" \\"The blessed breath which nurtures life: a land of wheat.\\" #\\"The path the angels descend upon.\\" \\"The path of great winds: the Grand Stream.\\" #\\"What lies in the furthest depths of memory?\\" \\"The place where all are born and where all will return: a blue star.\\"Although it is never stated that the blue world is indeed Earth, an image of a planet whose landscape resembles that of Earth is shown when Alvis speaks the phrase \\"a blue star\\". Supporting characters The majority of the events in Last Exile occurred on the fictional lone aerial battleship and aircraft carrier . The ship is known as the \\"Kill-'em-all\\" Silvana for its reputation of destroying other battleships regardless of which faction they belong to. Because it has never lost in a battle, the ship became an object of superstition and rumor. Despite being powered by a Claudia unit of Guild origin, the Silvana cannot be controlled by the Guild because the unit itself was stolen. The ship also employs armaments that differ from battleships used by the Anatoray navy. They were developed in secrecy and use a propellant fluid system rather a steam-based one. The nation of is at risk of experiencing drought. The nation of , on the other hand, is experiencing a deep freeze. Anatoray Prime Minister Marius Bassianus likened Disith to a \\"wounded lion\\" after its lands fell into a deep freeze due to climate changes. =Alexander Row= : Twenty-eight-year-old Alexander Row,Although not mentioned during the series, the full names of some characters appear in promotion material such as \\"Aerial Log\\" published by Gonzo or in Range Murata's \\"Range Murata Anime Works 1998-2006 Prismtone\\" published by Wani Magazine. or most commonly known as , acts as the captain of the Silvana. In the series, he is portrayed as emotionally distant from the other characters, including his first officer, who resembles his deceased fianc√©e . Alex Row: What do you [Sophia Forrester] want from me? Are you such a weak woman that you'd decide on a course of action based on my words? Alex's actions are driven by one purpose: to kill Guild Maestro Delphine Eraclea, whom he holds responsible for his fianc√©e's death. Sophia Forrester: Did you really intend to kill Maestro Delphine? Alex Row: It's that thought that keeps me alive. After being confronted about his past, Alex reveals himself to be a friend of the legendary vanship duo of Hamilcar Valca and Georges Head and the former owner of Claus's and Lavie's vanship. Character designer Range Murata has described the character as a \\"loner\\". Alex Row was based on Captain Harlock, a space pirate character created by manga artist Leiji Matsumoto. According to Murata, the design for his clothing \\"turned out all black, no matter how carefully or subtly I put in the lines; they were all the same when I colored it in\\". Animators also experienced difficulties in animating his hair and flowing cape. =Sophia Forrester= : is the Silvana's nineteen-year-old first officer and holds the title of Vice-Captain. Another graduate of the Anatoray Officer's Academy along with Vincent Alzey, she is one of the few people Alex Row trusts and is often seen left in command of the ship when the Captain is out in pursuit of his own agenda. Sophia was assigned to be an onboard spy to reveal everything to the emperor, but Sophia fell in love with Alex and never revealed anything compromising about Alex. During the series, it is revealed that Sophia is actually the daughter of the Anatoray emperor and the princess of Anatoray, which comes as a surprise to Claus and others. But all of the feelings of unrest about Sophia's true identity comes to rest when they see that deep inside she is still their executive officer, and loyal to both the Silvanna and Alex. Her feelings for Alex sometimes reveal too much, much to Row's chagrin in his sometimes snarky comments to her. Marius tells her to love \\"all [her] subjects, not just one man\\". At times in the series, she feels that she is unloved, both by Row's visible actions to her and her father's response to her when she returns to the capital city. On her final night on the Silvana, she put her hair down. Since this gave her an even stronger resemblance to Euris, Alex's dead fianc√©e, Alex wasn't pleased at all with her appearance and told her off, calling her free flowing hair unbecoming of an officer. Feeling down she went outside to look at the skies when Claus Valca happened to be there and they had a heartful conversation. Sophia felt better after talking to Claus and even gave him his first kiss on the lips. With the death of her father, she becomes empress of Anatoray and sought the alliance of Disith against the Guild, having realized that the Guild was playing both countries against each other. She became the captain of the Silvana after Alex's capture, having ordered the ship to attack the Guild's flagship, with Alex and Maestro Delphine Eraclea on board. =Tatiana Wisla= : is the only child of \\"the proud and noble\\" Wisla house of Anatoray. At the age of seventeen, Tatiana left home to become a member of the newly formed Anatoray Military Vanship Corps, a new military division dedicated to using vanships as weapons as opposed to just couriers and transports. She excelled in both piloting and dogfighting, quickly becoming one of the best vanship pilots in the sky, possibly second only to Alex Row. She sent all the extra money she made as an ace pilot back to her family so that her mother could care for her ailing father. Before too long, she found herself on the Silvana as Row's handpicked wing commander for his small vanship fighter fleet. She pilots a twin-engine vanship fighter which she painted red to distinguish herself from the other pilots as well as all other vanships in the sky. Tatiana Wisla: This [the Silvana] is the only place I have that I can call home. With her trusted friend, confidant, and navigator, Alister Agrew, she quickly becomes one of the most dreaded forces in the sky next to the Silvana herself, for which the technicians on board the Silvana start calling her the \\"princess.\\" Her cold demeanor manages to alienate even her close friend Alister. This leads to Alister flying with Claus Valca as his \\"navi\\" (short for \\"navigator\\") for a time, both as a rebuke to Tatiana and because Claus's navigator, Lavie Head, does not want to fly any more combat missions. Tatiana is second best to none in her own mind, but her overconfident self-view is challenged when she meets Claus, whose piloting skills rival her own. From then on, her feelings toward Claus go on a roller coaster, making her feel anger, disgust, awe, respect, fear, and even attraction to the young vanship pilot. Her frosty aloofness is clearly a self- defensive fa√ßade; she suffers a mental breakdown of sorts after getting shot down over the desert, but recovers, and from that time she begins to show a greater depth of feeling, especially towards Claus, whom she develops a crush on. In Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing, Tatiana is now Captain of the Submersible Aircraft Carrier Silvius with Alister as her Vice-Captain. =Alister Agrew= : , or \\"Alis\\" to her friends, is Tatiana Wisla's trusted confidant, best friend of the same age, and expert navigator. By her nature she is very quiet, reserved, and otherwise unflappable, reacting very little to even the strangest of circumstances. Her only reactions are shown in the way she carries herself, and the quickest way to earn her loyalty is to not dismiss her, or act like she is not around. From her behavior, it is shown that she is a consummate professional, just like Tatiana, which explains why they work so well together. However, she is far more than that, but will do nothing to prove it outright. She has displayed unfathomable respect for Tatiana, a strange attraction to Claus Valca, and even motherly behavior towards Alvis Hamilton. Alister returns in Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing serving as Tatiana's Second-in-Command in the Submersible Aircraft Carrier Silvius. =Mullin Shetland= : is a nineteen-year-old rifleman on the battleship Claihm Solais, which is the flagship of the Anatoray fleet. He has fought in nineteen battles and needs only one more survivor medal (received from surviving a battle) to become promoted out of the rifleman line. A third of the way through the series he joins the Silvana and becomes a mechanic servicing the vanships. He has a brief crush on the vanship captain Tatiana Wisla but soon forgets about it realizing the futility of it as he moves on to other things. Around the end he leaves the Silvana to train again as a rifleman in a secret joint operation to take back the battleships' Claudia engines and free the world of the Guild. At this time he meets Dunya Scheer from the Disith fleet, also involved in the operation. He and Dunya fall in love with each other, cumulating in Mullin asking Dunya to go on the same ship together. Dunya accepts his request, as the operation to take back the ship's Claudia unit begins. The operation ends with Mullin taking the unit back, but being gravely wounded in the process, believed dead. The epilogue reveals he survived and is living with Dunya on a farm with her siblings. =Vincent Alzey= : is a naval officer of Anatoray and a friend of Alex Row and Sophia Forrester. Initially appointed Admiral of Anatoray's fleet, he was relieved of his command after Alex sank four out of five of his Urbanus ships. Despite this, he respects Alex, knowing his strengths in combat and strategy (they were in the Officers' Academy together and the same age; indeed, before the battle, Vincent met Alex to try to persuade him to keep the Silvana out of battles). A great lover of coffee, Vincent likes to enjoy life. But when duty calls, he's not about to sit back either. When Sophia was imprisoned by her father and about to be killed by a guard, he barges into her room and saves her. Some of his dialogue also hints at a romantic interest in Sophia, despite her obvious affections for Alex. With her command as Empress, Vincent resumed his command as Admiral, this time leading his ships into a grand battle together with Disith against the Guild. Vincent returns in Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Vanguard Unit of the United Kingdom of Anatoray-Disith. =Dunya Scheer= : was first introduced in episode 13 (Isolated Pawn) as a seventeen-year-old woman soldier in the army of Disith. She appeared for the first time as one of the members of a small Disith patrol that captured Tatiana Wisla and Claus Valca while they were trying to reach into one of Silvana emergency resorts. However, the patrol is abandoned when migration ships from Disith arrive nearby. When Dunya reaches the landing field, she realizes no civilian ships survived the launch. She sets off her gun while crying in grief. She is later involved as part of the ground force in the Disith operation to raze the Anatoray capital which is successfully completed. We next see her involved in the same operation Mullin Shetland is involved in; they first meet when she falls over Mullin trying to catch a dove to eat. Over the course of their training, they meet several times and eventually develop a relationship. The relationship between her and Mullin culminates in Mullin asking Dunya if she would join him on the Silvana. Dunya accepts with the approval of other Disith soldiers and Mullin is overjoyed. The operation commenced shortly thereafter and was successful, though Mullin was gravely wounded and presumed dead. Dunya is seen crying over him. No more reference is made to either of them until the last episode where she is seen getting the message Lavie Head and Claus's fathers were supposed to have delivered over their new grave. She is then seen in the new world with the others. Crew of the SilvanaGodwin Austin= : is the thirty- six-year-old mechanic of the Silvana flight deck crew. He is the largest and most aggressive member of the flight deck crew, and usually the first to throw a punch in any fight on anyone who insult the Silvana. Despite this, he has a hidden sensitive side. =Gale Frank= : is a twenty-seven-year-old bald mechanic. Notable for wearing metal ear-cuffs that make his ears look pointed, Gale is openly gay and has a crush on Claus. =Anthony Kostabi= : is a twenty-two-year-old mechanic with glasses. Mostly known as Kostabi, he is a cool and calculating type, who is probably more sinister than he looks. =Ethan Pelerin= : is a nineteen-year-old mechanic. As the \\"new guy\\", he is responsible for many hard chores on the Silvana until Mullin arrived. =Arthur Campbell= : is the second officer of the Silvana. Although he shows unswerving loyalty towards both his superiors, Alex Row and Sophia Forrester, he also does not follow them blindly. When Alex orders the Silvana to attack Delphine's ship at Sophia's coronation ceremony, Campbell refuses to obey on grounds that it will risk endangering the Empress and other military commanders below. =Wina Lightning= : is the listening officer of the Silvana. Gifted with a perceptive hearing, she is tasked with matching the acoustic signature provided by Disith to that of Exile. She trains herself by continuously listening to the different acoustic signatures present in the Grand Stream, from the sound of a rainbird flock to the signature of a Disith battleship's remains. During the Silvana's final attack run at Delphine's base ship, she is able to hear Alex Row's final words before he dies with the base ship's destruction. =Lescius Dagobert= : Sixty-six-year-old is the Silvana's chief engineer and a member of one of the three Guild houses purged by Delphine Eraclea. Like other members of the Guild, he is interested in playing chess in his spare time and often provides counsel to Alex Row through the game. He is entrusted with the Mysterion held by his family but hands it to Alex on the eve of the assault against the Guild. Lescius returns in Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing now serving as the chief engineer of the Silvius. Anatoray's NobilityMarius Bassianus= : Fifty-two-year-old Prime Minister is a member of one of three Guild houses purged by Delphine Eraclea who was taken under the protection of the Anatoray royal family. After the death of his daughter Euris, Marius took care of Princess Sophia as if she were his own daughter. He and the Emperor killed each other during the Disith attack on the Anatoray capital after a dispute on Sophia's status as heir to the throne. He is entrusted with the Mysterion held by his family but surrenders it to Alex Row before his death so that it can be kept safe. His generosity is shown in the desire to grant land to Disith's people after its collapse and when he allows his Guild ship as training ground for the allied assault on Guild forces. Marius was the signatory of the proposed peace treaty with Disith that was lost ten years earlier. =David Mad-thane= : Duke is the commander of Anatoray's military defending the regions of Minagith and Norkia. Claus's and Lavie's attempt to cover his fleet's retreat in the battle at Minagith using only their vanship inspired Mad-thane. Seeing the potential of a vanship in battle, he sponsors the formation of vanship squadrons to act as fighter support in the assault against the Guild. He is portrayed as an optimistic character who wishes for peace, once believing \\"[t]here is hope yet for the world's survival\\" after meeting Disith commander Nestor Messina. Because of this attitude, he is often ridiculed by other commanding officers in the military who deem his actions are those of a coward. =Lady Mad- thane= : is the head of the Mad-thane residence in Norkia in her husband's absence. She assigned Claus and Lavie the delivery mission that takes them to the battle at Minagith. She later turns the residence into a makeshift hospital to care for Anatoray's and Disith's wounded soldiers during the assault against the Guild. =Holly Mad-thane= : is the nine-year-old daughter of Duke and Lady Mad-thane. She asks Claus and Lavie to deliver her message (in addition to her mother's) to her father, who she fears will not return home from the battle at Minagith. After her message is broadcast aboard the Claimh Solais by Claus and Lavie, her father decides to hide his shame and retreat from the losing battle. Although Holly \\"used to always cry\\", her personality grows stronger by the end of the series. She later helps her mother care for the wounded soldiers of both Anatoray and Disith. She is one of the children taken by Exile to the new world. She also develops a friendship with Alvis Hamilton. =Emperor= : The of Anatoray no longer pays attention to the suffering of his people. David Mad-thane: His majesty had forgotten about the people. Sophia Forrester: My father...is the past. He is the father of Sophia and, at the age of sixty-five, dies during the invasion of the capital city not by the Disith forces, but at the hands of Marius Bassianus. His death leads to the succession of Sophia to the throne. =Vitellius Glamis= : General is a secondary character introduced in episode 15 who commands the Anatoray military. Upon learning of the Emperor's death during the Disith assault on the Anatoray capital, he orders his men to defend the capital with their own lives. His ambition drives him to defy a ceasefire order with Disith to the point that he is willing to kill heir apparent Princess Sophia in order to set \\"the foundation of a reborn Anatoray\\". The sixty-year-old is killed when the Urbanus destroys the Scolopendra Cannon used to bombard the attacking Disith ships. His name was based on the actual historical figure Vitellius, who led the Roman Empire for several months during the Year of the Four Emperors. =Charles Knowles= : Count is the commanding officer of the Anatoray battleship Goliath, assigned to Mad-thane's fleet at Minagith. His ship is the first to retreat from the battlefield during the surprise attack by Disith, giving it the nickname the \\"Fleeing\\" Goliath. Charles is portrayed as a vain and egotistical character and orders his own face painted on the bow of the Goliath. He unknowingly challenges Alex Row to a ship-to-ship duel but regrets his action after realizing he is facing the Silvana. Charles orders his men to fire before the signal to commence is fired, expecting to destroy the Silvana in a surprise attack, but the Silvana is unharmed and sinks his ship in one volley. He perishes with the entire crew of the Goliath. =Henry Knowles= : Duke is a ranking Anatoray noble and the father of Count Charles Knowles, whom Alex Row defeats in a ship duel. He is provided with the opportunity to seek revenge for the \\"unnecessary\\" death of his son when Alex makes an appearance at the Horizon Cave black market auction. His men captures Alex at gunpoint, but Horizon Cave experiences a blackout when bombs destroy its power generators. Alex kills Henry's men in the confusion and escapes, leaving the sixty-nine-year-old nobleman empty-handed. =Giancarlo= : Forty-three- year-old is the manager of the Horizon Cave station and a subordinate to Duke Henry Knowles. He also serves as an auctioneer when the supposed Exile artifact is opened for bidding at the black market. He takes the artifact, auctioned at 50 billion Claudia, to Maestro Delphine Eraclea but discovers it to be fake. Delphine gives him a Guild ring as a \\"reward\\", but the ring's power kills him by turning him into dust. Vanship pilotsRalph Wednesday= : is the courier who is initially responsible for delivering Alvis Hamilton to the Silvana. After receiving his mission at the age of twenty-eight, Ralph is relentlessly pursued by the Guild and is mortally wounded. On the day of the 75th Norkia Cup race, his vanship crosses path with that of Claus's and Lavie's. He asks the two to complete the mission in his stead and acts as a decoy to cover for their escape from the Guild. Ralph has an elder brother named Mikhail, who is also a vanship pilot. =Hurricane Hawk= : is the nickname of a vanship race pilot. He is known throughout the frontier town of Norkia for his two prior consecutive wins in the Norkia Cup race. Hawk begins the race in the pole position but is overtaken by Claus and Lavie during its final stage. He is forced to withdraw when his vanship collides with that of Ralph Wednesday. Hawk is one of the pilots recruited to fly as fighter support in the assault against the Guild. =Fat Chicken= : is the nickname of a vanship pilot whom Lavie alternatively names as \\"Piggy Bird\\" due to her weight. She starts the 75th Norkia Cup race in second position but is forced to withdraw after experiencing difficulty in navigating a narrow segment of the track. She is one of the pilots recruited to fly as fighter support in the assault against the Guild. =Sunny Boy= : is the nickname of a vanship pilot whom Lavie alternatively names as \\"Nosehair\\". He wins the 75th Norkia Cup race when Claus and Hurricane Hawk withdraw after colliding with Ralph Wednesday. He is one of the pilots recruited to fly as fighter support in the assault against the Guild. OthersNestor Messina= :It is unclear who some of the voice actors are as the credits for the English cast did not associate actors with their corresponding roles and the Japanese credits did not associate actors with minor roles. Sixty-year-old is the commander of the Disith forces that invaded Anatoray. He fell victim to a blizzard in Disith, leaving him unable to open his right hand. After Sophia assumes the throne of Anatoray, she goes to parley with Nestor in hopes of forming an alliance and reveals to him the proposed peace treaty to Disith that was lost ten years earlier. Nestor ascertains Sophia's sincerity and provides Anatoray with a map of the Grand Stream and the acoustic signature of Exile. Nestor is well respected by his Anatoray counterparts, especially by Duke David Mad-thane, because he \\"seems to understand the meaning of chivalry\\" and is unwilling to sacrifice his men in a meaningless battle. =Hamilcar Valca= : is the father of Claus Valca. Although Valca came from nobility, he took his family to Norkia out of love for its free skies. He became immediate friends with Georges Head, and the two became a famous vanship courier duo. They died in the attempt to deliver a peace offer to Disith when Exile's defense system reacted to their presence in the Grand Stream. Valca died at the age of thirty-four and when Claus was five years old. His name was derived from the actual historical figure Hamilcar Barca, Carthaginian general during the First Punic War and father of the famous tactician Hannibal. =Justina Valca= : is the mother of Claus Valca. After the Valca family moved to Norkia and became neighbors with the Heads, Justina took care of Lavie, whose mother died in childbirth. According to Lavie, Justina died at the age of twenty-eight, just six months after her husband disappeared in the Grand Stream, leaving both Claus and Lavie as orphans. =Georges Head= : is the father of Lavie Head. His wife died in childbirth, leaving him to raise Lavie as a single parent. When the Valca family moved next door, he immediately became good friends with Hamilcar Valca and served as his vanship navigator. Head died at the age of thirty-five attempting to cross the Grand Stream with Valca when Lavie was five years old. Lavie later finds his remains inside Exile. =Walker= : is the owner of the Casino Royale, an airborne casino and repair station where many ships arrive for their shore leave. He is an acquaintance of Alex Row and refers to the Silvana as his \\"outlaw friends\\". When the Silvana arrives for repairs from its battle against Guild fighters, Walker provides a tip to Alex Row on the Exile artifact being sold in auction at Horizon Cave. He provides repair services for the ship again after its battle with the Urbanus. He is seen throughout the series wearing an eyepatch and is thirty-years-old. The Guild The Guild crest is one of the many allusions made throughout the series that the world of Prester is in the shape of an hourglass. The serves as the arbitrator between the Anatoray and Disith nations. =Dio Eraclea= : Principal is the sixteen-year-old younger brother of the most powerful Guild member, Maestro Delphine Eraclea. People see him as a rare find that will someday take over the Guild. He is very playful and fearless, and treats many things like they were games. His odd nature can be seen in his awe of Claus Valca's skills and giving him the nickname \\"Immelmann\\" (referring to the World War I German ace, Max Immelmann and the maneuver Claus frequently used while flying, the Immelmann turn). This strange nature is mostly due to the Guild lifestyle and fear of his sister Delphine. His first appearance in the series is marked by a chess-match with his beloved friend Lucciola and with the Guild's power and surveillance, watches the skies of a skirmish between Guild ships searching for Alvis Hamilton and the Silvana. He finds extraordinary talent in Claus's vanship piloting, and after the Horizon Cave Eight vanship race, he starts to have strong interactions with the main characters. He later joins them on the Silvana in order to escape his sister. Though his initial presence with the Silvana was unwanted, his participations and interactions with Claus and Alvis eventually earn the entire crew's trust, and is acknowledged as one of them, during a birthday party proposed by Alvis. He is forced back to the Guild during the end of the series, and is brainwashed by a Guild device in preparation for the \\"Rite of the Covenant\\". Driven to insanity, he participates in the Rite of the Covenant, where the next Maestro is chosen, and emerges victorious. He escapes with Claus and Alvis soon after and is nursed back to health in the Mad-Thane residence. He flees from there in a vanship and travels to the Grand Stream. Being delirious, his memory resets to the moment of the race in Horizon Cave, and he attempts to pass Claus. At that moment he tells his navi, Lucciola (who isn't there), to jump out so they can get more speed. He crosses a flock of rainbirds believing them to be the finish line and congratulates Lucciola on their victory and invites him to celebrate, but he then turns around to find he is not there. Believing Lucciola had actually jumped from the vanship, he attempts to cross to his seat while crying, but his vanship is then hit by a gust of wind and he is swallowed by the Grand Stream. Despite this, his voice is heard during a later scene in the Silvana's engine room cheering \\"Ascending!\\" In addition, there is a scene depicted in the series' official artwork showing Claus, Lavie, and their friends living on the farm turning and smiling at an individual. Though all that can be seen is one foot and a waving hand, the individual appears to be wearing a Guild uniform. In the Last Exile Aerial Log artbook, notes by the creators revealed that Dio survived after being rescued by a passing Guild ship and later joining Claus, Lavie, and their friends journey to Earth. In Last Exile -Fam, The Silver Wing, Dio is a member of the Sky Pirates yet is secretly a scout for the Silvius. Since the events of Last Exile, his personality is back to normal and remembers what happened to Lucciola which he honors his late friend's memory by riding his vanship alone and telling those who ride the backseat not to touch anything. Dio is also the Italian word for \\"God\\"; many of the Guild members have Italian names. =Lucciola= : is a member of the Guild and personal bodyguard to Dio Eraclea. He is an exceptional martial artist and is one year older than Dio. He was assigned the role of protecting him from a very early age, and Dio considers Lucciola not just a servant, but also a friend. Lucciola is forced to betray that trust out of fear of Maestro Delphine Eraclea when Maestro ordered him to bring Dio back before her. Lucciola then redeems himself by helping Claus, and Alvis and Dio escape from the grasp of the Maestro. In a confrontation against the Maestro, Lucciola kills his brother, Cicada, and is then disintegrated by a ring that is given to him by Maestro Delphine as a \\"gift.\\" Lucciola's name is Italian and means firefly. =Delphine Eraclea= : Maestro is the series' main antagonist, Dio's twenty-four-year-old older sister, and head of the Guild. A run-in between her and Alex Row in the past has left her the sole target of his vengeance, and one of his only goals is to personally kill Delphine. The Maestro is portrayed as a decadent aristocrat, callous and ruthless in her ways. When Lucciola decided to let Dio escape, the Maestro, feigning interest in his plea to let Dio go free, killed him with a device (in the shape of a ring) that essentially disintegrated him. However, she did not go unpunished, for Alex managed to strangle and break her neck, even though he had been tied in place by rose tendrils. Like her favorite flower, the rose, the Maestro is beautiful but dangerous. With her death and the release of Exile by Alvis Hamilton, the might of the Guild was broken, never to be restored again. Delphine possesses a veritable arsenal of psychological weapons she uses frequently, which explains Dio's fear of her. She is truly heartless when it comes to the Guild, and takes great delight in the wastefulness that her people go through to attain and prepare meals, such as the meat of a type of yak from the frozen wastes, the capture of which leads to the deaths of countless hunters, Kerasion mousse, which contains an ingredient so rare only a handful is gathered each year, and catfish that took 100 gallons of First Water to remove the mud. During the Trial of Agoon, she demonstrated an ability to restore the dead to life; everyone who died in the Trial was seen scampering to her feet as she said \\"I have renewed your lives.\\" It is unknown whether she has any real combative power of her own. Due to her impossibly immense oppressive influence, she really only needs her truly loyal subordinates to do her work, namely Cicada and his attack force. The only evidence of power she may have is in that she killed off the other families and remained as the sole house of the keys to Exile, which she stole the Mysteria from each house-except for house Hamilton's, the one she lost to Alex Row at Giancarlos' auction at the price of 500 billion Claudia. =Guild Agents= The Maestro Delphine has many loyal Guild members at her disposal. Some include bodyguards and maids, to fighter pilots and counselors. They tend to fall into two groups: and . The names of the Guild servants all seemed to be named after insects. The most powerful of the Maestro's entourage is , the servant to Maestro Delphine and the elder brother of Lucciola. A man of thirty-one, he is skilled in hand-to-hand combat and prevents Alex Row from assassinating Delphine when the Guild boards the Silvana. However, Lucciola kills him in combat in front of Delphine after Claus, Alvis, and Dio escape from the Guild stronghold. The Maestro also has two maids, and who are part of the Maestro's Aspis. The nineteen-year-old male servants and are also a part of the Aspis. Twenty-three-year-old , twenty-six-year-old , twenty-eight-year- old , and twenty-seven-year-old are her other agents and a part of the Scutum.

The main character Fam Fan Fan is part of the Sky Pirates, a group that assaults ships following the code of the \\"First Harpoon\\". The code of the First Harpoon means that the first pilot to hit the target with a harpoon has the right to decide how to proceed on the assault.

She is affectionately called \\"Gisey\\" by Fam. =Millia il Velch Cutrettola Turan= : Fifteen-year-old is the younger princess of the Kingdom of Turan. Millia and her older sister Liliana have taken on the task of ruling the kingdom despite their young ages due to the illness of their father, the King of Turan. In contrast to her more composed older sister Liliana, Millia is a bit more brash and impulsive. She was also the assistant pilot for Fam, once for taking her sister Liliana's cup; and again for successfully scuttling the Ades Federation battleship Anshar, which they later restored. She can speak the Glacian language and serves as an interpreter for Fam and Giselle when speaking with Dian. She is now the interim captain of the battleship Sylvius, while captain Tatiana Wisla was gone riding with her vanship to Grand Exile. And she inherits the power of Exile after her sister was shot down by Dian while shielding Luscinia/Lukea.

As a man with overwhelming charisma, he receives strong support from members of the military. He is shown to have a soft heart towards SƒÅrƒÅ Augusta. He and Liliana were childhood friends in the past. In the flashback of Last Exile 10 years ago, during Empress FarahnƒÅz's era, he is the bodyguard under the name of Lukea, along with his friend Alauda. He is kind and calm, rarely smiling except when he helped the young Princess Lilliana after she slipped. He feels guilty for failing to protect the late Empress, and has planned to take revenge for the Empress' assassination by mercilessly killing those who turned against Empress FarahnƒÅz's rule, and intends to fulfill her dream by uniting the world in peace under the control of the empire. She was killed while protecting Princess Lilliana from the assassin's bullet.

He commands the Third Fleet Admirari, which is balanced in both its offensive and defensive powers. He utilizes his fleet alongside the Fourth Fleet to serve as an advance guard. During the battle of Boreas he decides to switch sides and support SƒÅrƒÅ Augusta's fraction rather than Luscinia's. He opens on fire on Sor≈´sh's flagship to prevent him from attacking SƒÅrƒÅ's forces and taking her captive. His fleet suffers big damage while defending Boreas during the First Fleet attack. =Sor≈´sh= : is one of the five leading generals of the Ades Federation. He commands the Fourth Fleet Senapati, which comprises fast battleships that specialize in surprise attacks. Having attended the military academy together with ≈årang, the pair make a formidable combination. During the battle of Boreas, out of loyalty to Empress SƒÅrƒÅ, ≈årang prevents Sor≈´sh from attacking the ship that carried her by opening fire on Sor≈´sh's flagship. As a result of the attack, Senapati crashes into the valley. =Vasant= : is one of the five leading generals of the Ades Federation.

Regretting what the wars have done, she hoped the peace treaty would lead to both races to be peacefully united and live in a world without hatred, especially for her infant daughter SƒÅrƒÅ. FarahnƒÅz was well loved and a kind leader who treated her Guild bodyguards, Luscinia and Alauda, like her own sons whom she also shared her dreams of peace with them. However, during the Grand Race, a vanship race to celebrate the signing of the peace treaties, FarahnƒÅz was assassinated by Exile terrorists who wanted revenge for their comrades' death due to the war. Her death led to a huge impact on everyone who knew her, especially Luscinia, who started to hate the Exiles and later becoming the Ades Federation Premier where he wants to fulfill FarahnƒÅz's late dream of uniting the people of Earth by force by leading a war of conquest.

Merchandise A 136-page art book containing character sketches and supplemental material was published in 2005 but has since gone out of print. Murata has also released several self- published art books, under the collective title of SPHERES, containing additional character and design sketches used in Last Exile promotional posters. Seven promotional busts were made by Alter, a Japanese figure company, in 2006 depicting Claus, Lavie, Alvis, Tatiana, Alex, Dio and Lucciola as chess pieces. The seventh figure was of the iconic silver vanship. Reception Reviewers have praised Murata's work in designing the characters of Last Exile. South African magazine New Age Gaming called him an artist \\"who is quickly making a name for himself with a style that is as recognizable as works by artists like Masamune Shirow or Tetsuya Nomura\\". (Shirow is known for his work in Ghost in the Shell, and Nomura is known for his work in the Final Fantasy series.) His signature style is easily distinguishable and can also be recognized from Blue Submarine No. 6 and his art book Robot and Rule. According to the magazine, \\"his female characters have very round, cue-ball like heads you just want to sink in the corner pocket\\". The unique style also brought some reviewers to believe that the series more resembles a work of Hayao Miyazaki rather than Gonzo. The English dubbed version of the series, first released by Geneon Entertainment, was also well received by reviewers. Geneon hired Bang Zoom! Entertainment to produce the dubbed version of Last Exile, which Ryan Mathews of Anime News Network has praised as \\"the best Bang Zoom dub of all I've experienced\\". Production of the English version of the series was directed by Eric Sherman. Mathews goes on to say that \\"[t]he role of spunky young Lavie is a perfect fit for [Kari Wahlgren]\\". On the other hand, Johnny Yong Bosch's performance as Claus Valca was called \\"one of his softest performances\\". The dubbed version also demonstrated \\"a clear delineation...in terms of emotionality and overall tone\\" between the two main characters and the crew of the Silvana. A comparison to the original Japanese version of Last Exile shows that the English adaptation stays true to the original dialogue and only deviates to accommodate for pacing.

Due to the success of the British Army Commandos‚Äô operations in Norway, the Channel Islands, St. Nazaire, and the Middle East, the Admiralty dissolved the Royal Marines Division in late 1942 and reorganized its amphibious assault infantry into eight additional Commando units. The Brigade invaded Normandy on 6 June 1944 during Operation Overlord; it subsequently participated in the Battle of the Scheldt and the assault of the Walcheren Islands.Army Commandos 1940-45 By Mike Chappell, p 31 On 6 December the same year, the Brigade was renamed 4th Commando Brigade, removing the hated title Special Service and its association with the German SS.British Commandos 1940-46 By Timothy Robert Moreman, p 32 Formation *Commander : Brigadier B.

The newly raised 46 and 47 Commandos joined 41 Commando and it became apparent to the Allied planners that a fourth Commando unit was needed for the brigade's mission, so in mid- March the remaining men of the Royal Marine Division and other volunteers began training to form No. 48 Commando in time for the invasion. The Brigade was expected to be in combat for at most a week before being returned home. * No 41 Cdo (RM) to land at the far right (west) of Sword. * No 46 Cdo (RM) at Juno to scale the cliffs on the left (east) side of the Orne River estuary and to destroy a battery. * No 47 Cdo (RM) to go to the west flank of Gold Beach. * No 48 Cdo (RM) to go to Juno beach with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. Sword No 41 RM Commando was the senior unit in the Brigade, it landed at Hermanville-sur-Mer and then moved west to Lion-sur-Mer. The unit's first task was to link up with their fellow commandos at Luc-sur-Mer. As the Commando came ashore under moderate fire, it lost several men including their Regimental Sergeant Major, the Naval Forward Observation Officer and the second-in-command. Once clear of the beach defences it found itself in a relatively quiet sector. From its assembly area, it marched down the coastal road toward Lion-sur-Mer joined by three Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE)s. As P and Y troops approached the town, a well-concealed German PaK 38 gun ambushed the tanks, knocking all three out and stalling the assault. A and B troops had been moving ahead on to their second objective at the Chateau, but were attacked on their approach and forced back. Facing overwhelming defences and artillery, the commandos dug in and awaited reinforcements. At 1330 Hours the 2nd Battalions, Lincolnshire Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles moved up to the commandos' position, bringing with them a replacement Naval Observation Officer. As soon as he arrived, the destroyers offshore began a one-hour-long naval bombardment, battering the strong point and chateau. It was now too late for the commandos to launch an effective assault, so they dug-in for the night. When dawn broke the German artillery fire began once again, pinning the commandos and supporting infantry down for another two hours. They were then subject to a bombing attack by German Heinkel bombers which dropped anti- personnel bombs onto their position, killing several men, including their royal artillery observer and severely wounding the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Gray. Having already lost the second-in-command, Major Barclay, command fell to the Adjutant John Taplin. Under his leadership the Commando joined the Lincolnshire Regiment in the final assault on the strongpoint and chateau. Once the two units had seized the position, 41 Commando moved on alone to Luc-sur-mer. They found the town undefended and dug-in to wait for their colleagues to join them from the Canadian beach. Juno Beach (48 Commando) Headquarters personnel of 4th Special Service Brigade, making their way from LCI(S)s (Landing Craft Infantry Small) onto 'Nan Red' Beach, JUNO Area, at St Aubin-sur-Mer at about 9 am on 6 June 1944 Canadian infantry wait in ditches, as 48 RM Commando take cover from mortar fire on the roadside near St Aubin sur Mer 48 Commando were to land at Nan Red sector of Juno Beach with the objective of assaulting the strongpoint at Langrune-sur-Mer and then to link-up with 41 Commando, sealing the breach between the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the British 3rd Infantry Divisions. On their approach to the shore, two of their ships struck underwater obstacles and sank. Weighed down by their equipment, many of the marines drowned in the surf. Those that did get ashore faced intense German small arms fire. The combined effect of these two situations was that only fifty percent of the Commando got off the beach unscathed. Once off the beach, 48 Commando advanced to their objective, the heavily defended guns at Langrune. As they approached, the destroyer HMS Vigilant bombarded the position, with little effect due to the heavy fortifications. The commandos found the strong-point protected by snipers, mines, machine guns and a concrete wall. They were then joined by two Centaur Support Tanks from the 1st Royal Marine Support Regiment. The first of these tanks moved toward the wall firing its 95mm howitzer and obliterated a machine-gun bunker that had been covering the crossroads. The second Centaur began to move into position, but struck a mine while approaching the wall, forcing the crew to bail out and join the commandos. With the Centaurs out of ammunition or disabled, the attack faltered. B Troop raced across the intersection to a house opposite only to discover that it had been fortified, with the windows and doors facing the strongpoint filled with concrete. The commandos had no choice but to bring down the wall. They set a charge at its base, but the fortification was too strong. The commandos then received news that the 21st Panzer Division‚Äôs counter-attack had already stopped the British advance on Caen and was pushing on toward Lion-sur-Mer. The commandos were ordered to cease the assault and take up defensive positions. The German Panzer grenadiers reached the 716th Infantry Division's positions only to find that they were still manned and situated between the two units of the 4th Special Service Brigade. The next event was the glider assault landing of the 6th Airlanding Brigade of the 6th Airborne Division to the east. Seeing the gliders landing, the German commander feared he would be outflanked and ordered his force to withdraw towards Caen. Had he pushed onward and attacked the commandos, Sword would have been isolated and the entire eastern flank of the Allied invasion may have collapsed. In the morning the commandos were joined by a pair of Canadian M10 tank destroyers, which fired anti-tank rounds at the wall; for the next hour the M10s peppered the wall with solid shot and the fortification began to disintegrate. A Sherman tank of the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group then appeared and opened fire on the wall and allowed the commandos to launch an assault. Advancing behind the Sherman, covered by its guns, the commandos seized the interior of the strongpoint and spent the rest of the day silencing the remaining pockets of resistance around Langrune. Juno Beach (46 Commando) The brigade's reserve element, No. 46 Commando, landed on Juno beach at 0900 on 7 June and advanced on to Petit Enfer. They faced stiff German resistance, but were able to force their way through the German positions and on to Luc-sur-Mer. There they met up with 41 Commando, linking Juno and Sword. Gold Beach No. 47 Commando was the last British unit to land and came ashore on Gold Beach east of Le Hamel. Their task was to go inland then turn right (west) and make a twelve-mile (19.3 km) march through enemy territory to attack Port en Bessin from the rear. This small harbour, on the British far right, was well sheltered in the chalk cliffs and significant in that it was to be a prime means of supplies being brought in, including fuel by underwater pipe-line from tankers moored offshore. On 47's approach they could see the preceding units were struggling. Due to intense fire, the Hampshire Regiment had landed one and a half miles further to the east than originally planned. Ordered to avoid contact with the enemy and advance on Port en Bessin, the commanding officer, Lt. Col. Phillips, ordered his LCAs to approach the beach behind the Hampshires near Les Roquettes. The commandos landed under intense fire, five of their craft being sunk before reaching the shore and almost all the others were damaged, resulting in five officers, (including Lt. Col. Phillips, swimming to shore late in the day), 71 other ranks were reported missing. Unable to locate Phillips, the second-in-command, Major P.M. Donnell led his men off the beach and turned inland to avoid engaging the enemy. Behind the lines, the commando moved quickly to Buhot where Phillips rejoined it after his long swim. For the next several hours the Commando pushed steadily on, occasionally encountering snipers and small units of unsuspecting rear guards from whom they captured several \\"spandau\\" (MG-34 machine guns) and other small arms. As dusk descended upon the Commando they reached Point 72, the highest point on a ridge near Escures, which they discovered was undefended. They dug-in for the night and prepared for the attack on Port-en- Bessin at dawn. Originally the attack on Port-en-Bessin was planned to be supported by American artillery, but having no working radio made this coordination impossible. The arrival of two French civilians, a replacement Forward Observation Officer and a Gendarme named Gouget, assisted the planned assault. The two civilians identified the German positions and the artillery officer repaired the unit's wireless set, allowing him to contact the navy ships off-shore. At 1400 hours two Landing Craft Gun (Large), \\"LCG(L)\\", opened fire on the port and were joined by HMS Emerald‚Äôs six-inch (152 mm) main armament an hour later. By 1600 hours the city was hit by RAF Hawker Typhoon air strikes and the Royal Artillery bombarded the area with smoke in preparation for the commando's assault. Gouget guided A and B troops through ditches surrounding the town, past the outer ring of gunpits, while X Troop fixed bayonets and charged the machine-gun nests, quickly taking the positions. Once the outer ring of defences had been breached, A Troop advanced on the western feature, but were repelled when two Kriegsmarine Flak ships, that had moved into the port on 5 June, opened fire on the men with their rapid fire cannons. B Troop also launched an assault on the town itself, but were pinned down by a pillbox on the heights and machine-gun positions in houses throughout the village. Philips next ordered his men to launch an assault on the Flak ships, but were repelled once again. Seeing their problem, the captains of HMS Ursa and the Polish ship ORP Krakowiak approached the port, but were unable to open fire on the Flak ships, which were behind the port's concrete and stone breakwater. The navy then formed boarding parties and launched their motorboats, which crossed the harbour net and attacked the German vessels. With the Flak ships silenced, B and Heavy weapons troops made their way up the eastern feature and assaulted the German blockhouse, forcing the defenders to surrender. Sporadic fighting continued on until dawn of 8 June when the remaining defenders on the western feature surrendered. On 9 June PLUTO (Pipe Line Under the Ocean) [the fuel pipe], arrived in the form of an army port company and the petrol started to flow, supplying Allied vehicles across the Normandy front. Douvre radar station After being rested and reinforced, the Brigade less 41 Commando moved south to the Douvres-la-D√©livrande Radar Station. This fortified position was the primary Luftwaffe radar station in the area. It was covered with gun pits, minefields, tunnels, bunkers, five 5 cm anti-tank guns, a 7.5 cm field gun and a ring of barbed wire in height. The Brigade was to isolate the station which would allow other Allied forces to pass by and advance on Caen. After securing the perimeter, 46, 47 and 48 Commandos were sent to support the Canadians and Airborne divisions while 41 Commando stayed behind. For the next week, the commandos continued to harass the strongpoint with occasional mortar fire, Typhoon strikes and volleys from two attached Royal Marine Support Group (RMASG) Centaurs. Although the site did not actively threaten Allied movements in the area, it did provide radar- ranging information for Luftwaffe night fighters and constantly reported on British movements. On 17 June the assault began with a bombardment from the Royal Artillery's guns and ships off-shore. Under their new commander, Lt. Col Palmer, 41 Commando and forty-four armoured engineering vehicles attacked from the north while other tanks created a diversion from the southwest. Sherman Crabs (a mine-clearing tank), cleared the way through the minefields while the AVREs battered the bunkers with their guns. The effect of such fire was devastating on the German defenders. When the commandos entered the entrenchment and opened fire, it was clear that the station could no longer be defended. The two hundred and twenty seven remaining Luftwaffe force surrendered and the last of the 4th Special Service Brigade's D-Day objectives was finally achieved. 6th Airborne Division The Brigade less No 41 Commando moved to the Orne River, where they joined 1st Special Service Brigade and the 6th Airborne Division, under the command of Major General Richard 'Windy' Gale. The Brigade would remain in the Orne area until mid- August while the British Second Army launched a series of assaults on Caen. In mid-August, following the capture of Caen, General Gale's forces broke out of their positions and launched a major offensive. Before sunrise on 20 August, 46 Commando launched an attack on the heights above Putot and the commandos seized the position overlooking the entire Dozul√© area. For the remainder of the day, 48 Commando pushed through the bocage, without support, to Point 134 and Point 120 followed by 41 Commando. This location nearly cut the Germans escape route from the town; realizing that they had been out-flanked, they set the village ablaze and withdrew. Battle of the Scheldt With Dozul√© captured the Commandos pushed on through Beuzeville to the Risle River. On many occasions the commandos and airborne troops would arrive in a village less than hour after the Germans had made a hasty withdrawal. Following the capture of Pont-Audemer, the 6th Airborne and 1st Special Service Brigade were relieved by the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and returned to England. Leaving behind the 4th Special Service Brigade, which remained in the area for several weeks, clearing pockets of resistance between the Seine and Valmont, they then took up the role of garrison troops in and around the shattered city of Le Havre before finally moving up to positions near Dunkirk where they probed the German lines with small raids. Walcheren Islands On 27 September the Brigade was withdrawn to an assembly area in De Haan, Belgium. It then prepared for another amphibious assault, on the Dutch island of Walcheren. The island lay at the mouth of the Scheldt River, which ran from Antwerp to the sea. Until the island and the northern banks of the river were cleared, the port could not be used to support the Allied advance. Allied bombers breached the dykes on 3 October at Westkapelle, Flushing and Veere, flooding the island, leaving only a few dry areas around its perimeter and greatly restricting the Germans‚Äô freedom of movement. The 4th Special Service Brigade formed the seaborne element of the attack while British and Canadian infantry attacked overland from the mainland. This time the commandos came ashore in Landing Vehicle Tracked, (also known as Buffaloes), which had already proven their worth in the Pacific campaign. 41 Commando was tasked with assaulting the town of Westkapelle and then to move north along the causeway to Domburg. Just to their south, 48 Commando took on a radar station and naval gun battery, while 47 completed the encirclement of the western part of the island by moving south towards Flushing. The brigade would spend the rest of the war making raids across the Maas River in Operations Incalculable and Bogart. After occupation duties in Germany, the Brigade returned to the United Kingdom in 1946 and was disbanded.

Indonesia is geographically and climatologically well-suited for coffee plantations, near the equator and with numerous interior mountainous regions on its main islands, creating well-suited microclimates for the growth and production of coffee. Indonesia produced an estimated 660,000 metric tons of coffee in 2017. Of this total, it is estimated that 154,800 tons were slated for domestic consumption in the 2013/2014 financial year.USDA GAIN (2014).

History Replica of an East Indiaman of the Dutch East India Company/United East India Company (VOC). Coffee plantation in Dutch East Indies circa 1870‚Äì1900 The Dutch governor in Malabar (India) sent arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) seedlings from Yemen to the Dutch governor of Batavia (now Jakarta) in 1696. The first seedlings failed due to flooding in Batavia. The second shipment of seedlings was sent in 1699 with Hendrik Zwaardecroon.De Landbouw in de Indische Archipel / uitgegeven onder redactie van C.J.J. van Hall en C. van de Koppel, 's-Gravenhage [The Hague, N.V.] : Uitgeverij W. Van Hoeve, 1946-50. The plants grew, and in 1711 the first exports were sent from Java to Europe by the Dutch East India Company, reaching 2000 pounds shipped in 1717.Cramer, P. J. S. (1957). A Review of Coffee Literature in Indonesia, published by Inter-American Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Turrialba, Costa Rica Indonesia was the first place, outside of Arabia and Ethiopia, where coffee was widely cultivated.Neilson, J. (2012). Coffee (Indonesia): 1900 to present: East and Southeast Asia. In A. Stanton, E. Ramsamy, P. Seybolt, & C. Elliott (Eds.), Cultural sociology of the Middle East, Asia, & Africa: An encyclopedia. (pp. III240-III242). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. The coffee was shipped to Europe from the port of Batavia (now Jakarta). There has been a port at the mouth of Ciliwung River since 397 AD, when King Purnawarman established the city he called Sunda Kelapa. Today, in the Kota area of Jakarta, one can find echoes of the seagoing legacy that built the city. Sail driven ships still load cargo in the old port. The Bahari museum occupies a former warehouse of the VOC, which was used to store spices and coffee. Menara Syahbandar (or Lookout Tower) was built in 1839 to replace the flag pole that stood at the head of wharves, where the VOC ships docked to load their cargos. In the 18th century, coffee shipped from Batavia sold for 3 Guilders per kilogram in Amsterdam. Since annual incomes in Holland in the 18th century were between 200 and 400 Guilders, this was equivalent to several hundred dollars per kilogram today. By the end of the 18th century, the price had dropped to 0.6 Guilders per kilogram and coffee drinking spread from the elite to the general population. The East Indies were the most important coffee supplier in the world during this period and it was only in the 1840s that their stranglehold on supply was eclipsed by Brazil. The coffee trade was very profitable for the VOC, and for the Dutch East Indies government that replaced it in 1800, but was less so for the Indonesian farmers who were forced to grow it by the colonial government from 1830 to around 1870 under the Cultuurstelsel (Cultivation system). Production of export crops were delivered to government warehouses instead of taxes. Coffee, along with sugar and indigo, was one of the main crops produced under this highly exploitative colonial system. Cultuurstelsel was applied to coffee in the Preanger region of West Java, as well as in West Sumatra, South Sulawesi and the Minahasa region of North Sulawesi. This corrupt system, which diverted labor from rice production and caused great hardship for farmers, was immortalized through an influential novel by Eduard Douwes Dekker (pen name - Multatuli) in 1860 titled Max Havelaar: Or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company. This book helped to change Dutch public opinion about the \\"Cultivation System\\" and colonialism in general. More recently, the name Max Havelaar was adopted by one of the first fair trade organizations. By the mid 1870s the Dutch East Indies expanded arabica coffee-growing areas in Sumatra, Bali, Sulawesi and Timor. In Sulawesi the coffee was thought to have been planted around 1850.Paerels, B. H. (1927). Agronomische beschrijving van de koffiecultuur in de zuidelijke Toradjalanden Mededeelingen van de Afdeeling Landbouw No. 11., Departement van Landbouw, nijverheid en Handel, Batavia. In North Sumatra highlands coffee was first grown near Lake Toba in 1888, followed in Gayo highland (Aceh) near Lake Laut Tawar in 1924. Coffee at the time was also grown in East Indonesia- East Timor and Flores. Both of these islands were originally under Portuguese control and the coffee was also C. arabica, but from different root stocks. The coffee in Eastern Indonesia was not affected to the same degree by rust, and even today, it is believed that some coffee in East Timor can be traced back to the 18th century. In the late eighteen hundreds, Dutch colonialists established large coffee plantations on the Ijen Plateau in eastern Java. However, disaster struck in the 1876, when the coffee rust disease, Hemileia vastatrix, swept through Indonesia, wiping out most of the Arabica Typica cultivar. Robusta coffee (C. canephor var. robusta) was introduced to East Java in 1900 as a substitute, especially at lower altitudes, where the rust was particularly devastating. Robusta coffee was introduced to smallholders around Kerinci around 1915, and then spread quickly across southern Sumatra during the 1920s, where production soon eclipsed Java. The region remains the most important producing region by volume today. Dutch- owned plantations on Java were nationalized in the 1950s, soon after independence. and are now managed as state-owned plantations under PTPN - Perusahaan Terbatas Perkebunan Nusantara, and revitalized with new varieties of Coffea arabica in the 1950s.Mackie, J. A. C. \\"Indonesia‚Äôs Government Estates and their Masters\\". Pacific Affairs, (v34/4, 1961), 337-360. These varieties were also adopted by smallholders through the government and various development programs. Cultivation Today, more than 90% of Indonesia's coffee is grown by smallholders on farms averaging around one hectare. Some of this production is organic and many farmers‚Äô cooperatives and exporters are internationally certified to market organic coffee. There are more than 20 varieties of Coffea arabica being grown commercially in Indonesia. They fall into six main categories: * Typica ‚Äì this is the original cultivar introduced by the Dutch. Much of the Typica was lost in the late 1880s, when coffee leaf rust swept through Indonesia. However, both the Bergandal and Sidikalang varieties of Typica can still be found in Sumatra, especially at higher altitudes. * Hibrido de Timor (HDT) ‚Äì This variety, which is also called \\"Tim Tim\\", is a natural cross between Arabica and Robusta. This variety originated likely from a single coffee tree planted in 1917‚Äì18 or 1926.http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cesa/Jornadas%20Timor-vers%E3o%20final..pdf ; Rodrigues C. J.; Mayer Gon√ßalves, M.; V√°rzea, V.M.P.; \\"Import√¢ncia do H√≠brido de Timor para o territ√≥rio e para o melhoramento da cafeicultura mundial\\"; Revista de Ci√™ncias Agr√°rias, 2004. Vol. XXVII, N√∫mero(s) 2/4. pp 203‚Äì216. The HDT was planted in Aceh in 1979. * Linie S ‚Äì This is a group of varieties was originally developed in India, from the Bourbon cultivar. The most common are S-288 and S-795, which are found in Lintong, Aceh, Flores and other areas. * Ethiopian lines ‚Äì These include Rambung and Abyssinia, which were brought to Java in 1928. Since then, they have been brought to Aceh as well. Another group of Ethiopian varieties found in Sumatra are called \\"USDA\\", after an American project that brought them to Indonesia in the 1950s. * Caturra cultivars: Caturra is a mutation of Bourbon coffee, which originated in Brazil. * Catimor lines ‚Äì This cross between arabica and robusta has a reputation for poor flavour. However, there are numerous types of Catimor, including one that farmers have named \\"Ateng-Jaluk\\". On-going research in Aceh has revealed locally adapted Catimor varieties with excellent cup characteristics. Sumatra (Mandheling, Lintong and Gayo) Coffee from this western-most island in Indonesia is intriguing and complex, due to the large number of small-holder producers and the unique \\"giling basah\\" (wet hulling) processing technique they use. At the green bean stage, coffee from this area has a distinctive bluish colour, which is attributed to processing method and lack of iron in the soil.Mawardi S., Yusianto, R. Hulupi, Khalid and A. Marsh. (2008). Evaluation of Variety Cupping Profile of Arabica Coffee Grown at Different Altitudes and Processing Methods in Gayo Highland of Aceh (Sumatra). Proc. 22nd Int. Conf. on Coffee Science, Ass. Sci. and Inf. on Coffee (ASIC), Campinas, Brazil. Coffees from Sumatra are known for smooth, sweet body that is balanced and intense. Depending on the region, or blend of regions, the flavours of the land and processing can be very pronounced. Notes of cocoa, tobacco, smoke, earth and cedar wood can show well in the cup. Occasionally, Sumatran coffees can show greater acidity, which balances the body. This acidity takes on tropical fruit notes and sometimes an impression of grapefruit or lime. Mandheling is a trade name, used for arabica coffee from northern Sumatra. It was derived from the name of the Mandailing people, who produce coffee in the Tapanuli region of Sumatra. Mandheling coffee comes from Northern Sumatra, as well as Aceh. ;Lintong Lintong coffee is grown in the District of Lintong Nihuta, to the south-west of Lake Toba. This large lake is one of the deepest in the world, at 505 meters. The coffee production area is a high plateau, known for its diversity of tree fern species. This area produces 15,000 to 18,000 tons of arabica per year. A neighbouring region, called Sidikalang, also produces arabica coffee. Gayo is a region on the hillsides surrounding the town of Takengon and Lake Laut Tawar, at the northern tip of Sumatra, in the region of Aceh. The altitude in the production area averages between 1,110 and 1,600 meters. The coffee is grown by smallholders under shade trees. Coffee from this region is generally processed at farm-level, using traditional wet methods. Due to the giling basah processing, Gayo Mountain coffee is described as higher toned and lighter bodied than Lintong and Mandheling coffees from further east in Sumatra. Sulawesi (Toraja, Kalosi, Mamasa and Gowa) The Indonesian island of Sulawesi, formerly called the Celebes, lies to the east of Borneo island. The primary region for high altitude Arabica production covers the Toraja highlands, and the district of Enrekang to its south, where coffee is commonly traded through the town of Kalosi, which is a well-known brand of specialty coffee. The regions of Mamasa (to the west of Toraja) and Gowa (further to the south near Makassar), also produce Arabica, although they are less well known. Sulawesi coffees are clean and sound in the cup. They generally display nutty or warm spice notes, like cinnamon or cardamom. Hints of black pepper are sometimes found. Their sweetness, as with most Indonesian coffees, is closely related to the body of the coffee. The after-taste coats the palate on the finish and is smooth and soft. Most of Sulawesi's coffee is grown by smallholders, with about 5% coming from seven larger estates.Neilson, J (2004) ‚ÄòEmbedded geographies and quality construction in Sulawesi coffee commodity chains‚Äô, PhD. University of Sydney. Available from: http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/9222 The people of Tana Toraja build distinctively shaped houses and maintain ancient and complex rituals related to death and the afterlife. This respect for tradition is also found in way that small-holders process their coffee. Sulawesi farmers use a unique process called \\"giling basah\\" (wet hulling). Java West Java was the region where the earliest coffee plantations were established by the VOC. The Dutch began cultivation and exportation of coffee trees on Java (part of the Dutch East Indies) in the 17th century. Agricultural systems in Java have changed considerably over time. A rust plague in the late 1880s killed off much of the plantation stocks in the Sukabumi area before spreading to Central Java and parts of East Java. The Dutch responded by replacing the Arabica firstly with Liberica (a tough, but somewhat unpalatable coffee) and later with Robusta. Java's old colonial-era plantations provide just a fraction of the coffee grown on the island; they produce primarily the higher-valued Arabica variety. The Paniis coffee planters cooperation in Sumedang can produce 15 tonnes, 2.5 tonnes of them are produced as kopi luwak. Java's arabica coffee production is centred on the Ijen Plateau, at the eastern end of Java, at an altitude of more than 1,400 meters. The coffee is primarily grown on large estates that were built by the Dutch in the 18th century. The five largest estates are Blawan (also spelled Belawan or Blauan), Jampit (or Djampit), Pancoer (or Pancur), Kayumas and Tugosari, and they cover more than 4,000 hectares.Specialty Coffee Association of Indonesia (2008): . Retrieved 8 August 2008 These estates transport ripe cherries quickly to their mills after harvest. The pulp is then fermented and washed off, using the wet process, with rigorous quality control. This results in coffee with good, heavy body and a sweet overall impression. They are sometimes rustic in their flavour profiles, but display a lasting finish. At their best, they are smooth and supple and sometimes have a subtle herbaceous note in the after-taste. This coffee is prized as one component in the traditional \\"Mocha Java\\" blend, which pairs coffee from Yemen and Java. Certain estates age a portion of their coffee for up to five years, normally in large burlap sacks, which are regularly aired, dusted, and flipped. As they age, the beans turn from green to light brown, and their flavour gains strength while losing acidity. Aged coffees can display flavours ranging from cedar to spices such as cinnamon or clove, and often develop a thick, almost syrupy body. These aged coffees are called Old Government, Old Brown or Old Java. Bali The highland region of Kintamani, between the volcanoes of Batukaru and Agung, is the main coffee- growing area on Bali. Many coffee farmers on Bali are members of a traditional farming system called Subak Abian, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of \\"Tri Hita Karana\\". According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people and the environment. This philosophy, specifically 'happiness with the environment' favors the production of organic coffee, or at least the use of organic fertilizers and the lack of use of agrochemicals. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of fair trade coffee production because the Subak organizes smallholders, which is often a requirement of fair trade certification. Stakeholders in Bali, including the Subak Abian, have created Indonesia's first Geographic Indication (G.I.). Issued in 2008,, ESTABLISHMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATION PROTECTION SYSTEM IN INDONESIA, CASE IN COFFEE, Mawardi, 2009, p. 2 the G.I. establishes legal protection for coffee produced in the Kintamani region. It also serves as a marketing tool to differentiate Kintamani coffee from coffees produced in other regions. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavors include lemon and other citrus notes. Balinese coffee Sumbawa The western slopes of Mount Tambora in Sanggar peninsula is the main coffee-growing area in Sumbawa island, thus the coffee from this area is marketed as Tambora coffee. The intensive coffee plantation were begun in colonial era after the area was cleared up because of the eruption of Tambora volcano in 1815. However archaeological findings discover some coffee seeds in Tambora culture sites suggesting the local Tambora and Pekat kingdoms already cultivating the seeds acquired from Dutch East Indies Company, grow and harvest them and trade with them. Flores Flores (or Flower) Island is 360 miles long, and is located 200 miles to the east of Bali. The terrain of Flores is rugged, with numerous active and inactive volcanoes. Ash from these volcanoes has created especially fertile Andosols, ideal for organic coffee production. Arabica coffee is grown at 1,200 to 1,800 meters on hillsides and plateaus. Most of the production is grown under shade trees and wet processed at farm level. Coffee from Flores is known for sweet chocolate, floral and woody notes. A traditional style of processing, known as pulped natural, where parchment coffee is dried in its mucilage without fermentation, produces a floral coffee that has been found to be highly sought after by some buyers.Marsh, A., Yusianto, Mawardi, S. (2010). The Influence of Primary Processing Methods on the Cup Taste of Arabica Coffee from the Indonesian Island of Flores. Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Coffee Science, Bali, October 3‚Äì8, 2010. (). Papua New Guinea is the second largest island in the world. The western half of New Guinea is part of Indonesia. The Indonesian half of the island was formerly called \\"Irian Jaya\\". Today, it is known as Papua, and it is divided into two provinces ‚Äì Papua and West Papua. There are two main coffee-growing areas in Papua. The first is the Baliem Valley, in the central highlands of the Jayawijaya region, surrounding the town of Wamena. The second is the Kamu Valley in the Nabire Region, at the eastern edge of the central highlands, surrounding the town of Moanemani. Both areas lie at altitudes between 1,400 and 2000 meters, creating ideal conditions for Arabica production. Together, these areas produce about 230 tons of coffee per year. This is set to rise, as new companies are setting up buying and processing operations. One of them is Koperasi Serba Usaha Baliem Arabica or commonly known in Indonesia as Koperasi Serba Usaha Baliem Arabica. These companies are assisting farmers to obtain organic and fair trade certification, which will significantly improve incomes. The area is extremely remote, with most coffee-growing areas inaccessible by road and nearly untouched by the modern world. All coffee is shade grown under Calliandra, Erythrina and Albizia trees. Farmers in Papua use a wet hulled process. Chemical fertilizer pesticide and herbicide are unknown in this origin, which makes this coffee both rare and valuable. Harvesting and processing Kopi luwak, coffee seeds from faeces of palm civet, Lampung, Indonesia All arabica coffee in Indonesia is picked by hand, whether it is grown by smallholders or on medium-sized estates. After harvest, the coffee is processed in a variety of ways, each imparting its own flavours and aromas to the final product. A small number of Arabica farmers in Sulawesi, Flores and Bali, and almost all Robusta farmers across Indonesia, use the most traditional method of all, dry processing. The coffee cherries are dried in the sun, and then de-hulled in a dry state. Most farmers on Sulawesi, Sumatra, Flores, and Papua use the \\"giling basah\\" (or wet hulling) process. In this technique, farmers remove the outer skin from the cherries mechanically, using rustic pulping machines, called \\"luwak\\". The coffee beans, still coated with mucilage, are then stored for up to a day. Following this waiting period, the mucilage is washed off and the coffee is partially dried for sale. At least one U.S. manufacturer, soft drink producer Bai, purchases the non-bean remnants of coffee cherries for use in their products.Meet our superfruit. Bai Brands. Retrieved January 4, 2018. Otherwise, these remnants are discarded. Collectors and processors then hull the coffee in a semi-wet state, which gives the beans a distinctive bluish- green appearance. This process reduces acidity and increases body, resulting in the classic Indonesian cup profile. Larger processing mills, estates and some farmers' cooperatives on Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi and Bali produce \\"fully washed\\" coffee. The most unusual form of coffee processing in Indonesia is \\"kopi luwak\\". This coffee is processed by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). The animals eat ripe coffee cherries and their digestive process removes the outer layers of the fruit. The remaining coffee beans are collected and washed. Coffee experts believe that the unique flavour of kopi luwak comes, at least in part, from the extraction of naturally occurring potassium salts from the beans during the digestive process. This results in a smooth, mild cup, with a sweet after-taste. Kopi luwak is very rare, and can retail for more than $600 per kilogram. Coffee research The Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI) is located in Jember, Java. Current activities of ICCRI in the coffee sector include: * Land mapping to identify new areas for coffee production * Research on coffee diseases and identification of resistant planting material * Farmer training on improved production and processing techniques * Supply of coffee seedlings for improved varieties * Supply of coffee processing and testing equipment The Agribusiness Market and Support Activity (AMARTA) conducted research on the effectiveness of the Brocap Trap technology in Toraja, Sidikilang and Gayo. This trap is designed to catch the coffee berry borer (CBB) insect, a major pest in coffee. It was developed by CIRAD, a French agricultural research institute. Brocap traps have been extensively adopted by coffee farmers in Central America. Coffee associations Indonesia's coffee industry is represented by three associations. The Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE), also known by its Indonesian acronym \\"AEKI\\", is composed of Arabica and Robusta coffee exporters. AICE was founded in 1979 and was responsible for managing export quotas under the International Coffee Agreements up until 1989. A second association, Gabungan Eksportir Kopi Indonesia (GAEKI) was established in 2011.http://gaeki.or.id/en/ The Specialty Coffee Association of Indonesia (SCAI) formed in 2008. SCAI members focus exclusively on the production, export and marketing of Indonesia's arabica coffees. This includes farmers' cooperatives with 8,050 members, exporters, roasters, importers and coffee retailers in the Arabic coffee industry. Current status of the industry Making coffee by hand in Sumatra, Indonesia The Indonesian coffee sector is large, internally diverse and scattered. Production is dominated by an estimated 2 million smallholders living in often remote villages located right across the archipelago‚Äîwith different coffee regions showing variations in terms of production systems, environmental conditions, product quality, post- harvest processing, and value chain structures. This distinctive geography poses challenges for logistics, for supporting improved technologies, and for developing cohesive industry organizations. Common to most of the coffee- producing regions are circumstances of low yields, weak farmer organization, and limited government support‚Äîas coffee has hitherto not been regarded as a crop of strategic importance. Coffee is often grown as a forest margin crop in Indonesia and, in January 2007, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) reported that land was illegally cleared for coffee farming in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on the island of Sumatra. The protected park is home to endangered tigers, elephants and rhinos, and WWF predicts that these species will be extinct in a decade should the clearing and farming continue.WWF (2007). Gone in an Instant: How the trade in legally grown coffee is driving the destruction of Rhino, Tiger and Elephant Habitat Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park Sumatra, Indonesia. WWF These claims were further supported by the use of remote sensing imagery in the region. WWF states that the illegal coffee is sold to Western companies such as Nestl√© and Kraft Foods. Robusta coffee ;Growing areas Coffea robusta is grown at lower altitudes than Coffea arabica. The island of Sumatra is the largest producer, with the provinces of Lampung, South Sumatra and Bengkulu accounting for 50% of total national coffee production and up to 75% of Robusta production.http://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1672 , accessed 3 May 2015 Smaller volumes are also grown in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and Flores. ;Production and processing Robusta is grown on small farms that average one hectare. The crop is harvested by stripping off all the fruit on the branch, resulting in a mix of ripe and green cherries. Farmers dry the coffee cherries whole, for up to three weeks. After the drying, the dry cherries are hulled. Farmers sell the cherries to collectors, who sell them to both exporters and for sale on the domestic market. The exporters dry the crop to 12 to 13% moisture, and it is then sorted and graded. Exports are usually made in break bulk shipments, rather than in containers as with C. arabica. A small portion of the crop is harvested and processed was washed coffee as with Arabica coffee. ;Markets Most of Indonesia's robusta is used in instant coffee and other manufactured products. The domestic market consumes about 150,000 metric tons of robusta annually. The main markets are the United States, western Europe and Japan, although demand from emerging markets such as Russia, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia is increasing.http://www.uncomtrade.com Robusta is also an important part of traditional espresso blends, where it adds characteristic flavours and the all important crema on top of the coffee.

The United States battleship retirement debate was a debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and independent groups over the effectiveness of naval gunfire support (NGFS) provided by Iowa-class battleships, and whether or not an alternative should be implemented. The debate centered on the best way to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops near a shoreline. The debate at large traced its roots back to the end of World War II, but this round of the debate began in 1992 with the decommissioning of the last active battleship, , and ended when the last of these ships was finally completely retired in 2011. The Navy decommissioned Missouri after determining that her fire support function could be replaced by ship and submarine-launched missiles and aircraft-launched precision guided munitions. Many still viewed the battleships as essential for gunfire support, and questioned the Navy's decision. Congress required the Navy to retain at least two of the four remaining battleships on the Naval Vessel Registry (NVR) instead of disposing of them. The debate played out across a wide spectrum of media, including newspapers, magazines, web blogs, and congressional research arms including the Government Accountability Office. Each side presented different arguments on the best approach to the problem. Many participants favored the continuation of the or the reinstatement of the Iowa-class battleships to the NVR. The Iowa-class battleships and the - and Zumwalt-class destroyers all entered the debate as options put forward for naval gunfire support, while others advocated the use of specifically designed close air support planes and newer missile systems that can loiter in an area as a replacement for naval gunfire. The debate about retention of the battleships became completely academic in 2011 when the last battleship owned by the Navy, , was donated to a non-profit group to be used as a museum ship.  Background  , shown moored in Norfolk, Virginia, is one of four Iowa-class battleships open to the public as museums, and was one of two maintained for potential reactivation until 2009. By 1947, the United States had deactivated all of its remaining battleships (bar Missouri) and placed them in the United States Navy reserve fleets. By 1964, all but the four Iowa-class battleships had been stricken from the Naval Vessel Registry (NVR), but on several occasions one or more of those four battleships were reactivated to provide naval gunfire support. The U.S. Navy retained the four Iowa-class battleships long after other nations scrapped their big-gun fleets in favor of aircraft carriers and submarines. Congress was largely responsible for keeping the four Iowa-class battleships in the United States Navy reserve fleets and on the NVR as long as they did. The lawmakers argued that the battleships' large-caliber guns had a useful destructive power that was lacking in the smaller, cheaper, and faster guns mounted by U.S. cruisers and destroyers.* In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan proposed creating a 600-ship navy as part of the overall defense department build-up to counter the threat of the armed forces of the Soviet Union; both the Soviet Army and Navy had grown in the aftermath of the unification of Vietnam in 1975 and the loss of faith that Americans had in their armed services. As part of this, all four Iowa-class battleships were modernized and reactivated. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the 600-ship navy was seen as unnecessary, and the navy made plans to return to its traditional 313-ship fleet. This led to the deactivation of many ships in the navy's fleet, including the four reactivated battleships; all were removed from service between 1990 and 1992. The navy struck all four ships and had made plans to donate them, but Congress intervened with the passing of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996. Section 1011 required the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the Iowa-class battleships that had been struck by the navy in 1995; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy Reserve Fleets. The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in Marine Corps' amphibious operations. Both battleships were to be maintained with the reserve fleet until such a time as the navy could certify that it had within its fleet the operational capacity to meet or exceed the gunfire support that both battleships could provide.104th Congress, House of Representatives. National Defense Authorization Act of 1996. p. 237. Retrieved 17 December 2006. To comply with this requirement, the navy selected the battleships and for reinstatement to the Naval Vessel Register.  Replacing the battleships  The Navy saw the battleships as prohibitively expensive, and worked to persuade Congress to allow it to remove Iowa and Wisconsin from the Naval Vessel Register by developing extended-range guided munitions and a new ship to fulfill Marine Corps requirements for naval gunfire support (NGFS). gun on an Arleigh Burke-class DDG The navy plan originally called for the extension of the range of the gun on the guided missile destroyers with Extended Range Guided Munitions (ERGMs) that would enable the ships to fire precision guided projectiles about inland. The ERGM program was initiated in 1996, but cancelled in 2008 due to rising cost and disappointing results. The similar Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition (BTERM) program was also cancelled in 2008 for the same reasons. These weapons were not intended or expected to satisfy the full range of the marine corps requirements. The Navy initiated the SC-21 program in 1994 to design and build a ship that could provide effective fire support. This evolved into the DD(X) program and eventually resulted in the program. The ship was to mount a pair of Advanced Gun Systems capable of firing specially designed Long Range Land Attack Projectiles some inland. Originally, the navy had planned to build a total of 32 of these destroyers, but the increasing cost of the program led the navy to reduce the overall number of destroyers from 32 to 24.\\"National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 \\" (pdf) pp. 109th Congress, United States Senate and House of Representatives. 69‚Äì70. Retrieved on 2008-08-01. In 2007 the total procurement of Zumwalt-class destroyers was further reduced to seven, before being discontinued at a total of three destroyers in July 2008 as a result of the high per-ship cost. The discontinuation of the class was due in part to concerns that the Zumwalt- class ships would deprive other projects of needed funding, a concern that was raised by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Congressional Research Service (CRS), and the Government Accountability Office, all of which issued reports that suggested that total cost of each ship would be as high as $5 billion or more. In addition to the high cost, naval officials discussing the cancellation of the DD(X) program cited the inability of the DD(X) to fire the Standard missile or provide adequate air defense coverage, and a \\"classified threat\\" which the navy thought could be better handled by existing or new Arleigh Burke-class destroyers than by the Zumwalt-class destroyers. The article also reported that the Marine Corps no longer needed the long-range fire support from the Zumwalts‚Äô 155 mm Advanced Gun System because such fire support can be provided by much longer-ranged Tactical Tomahawk cruise missiles and precision airstrikes.  Striking the Iowa-class battleships  On 17 March 2006, while the ERGM and DD(X) programs were under development, the Secretary of the Navy exercised his authority to strike Iowa and Wisconsin from the Naval Vessel Register, which cleared the way for both ships to be donated for use as museum ships. The United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps had both certified that battleships would not be needed in any future war, and had turned their attention to completion of the next generation Zumwalt-class destroyers. This move drew fire from sources familiar with the subject; among them were dissenting members of the United States Marine Corps. These dissenters argued that battleships were still a viable solution to naval gunfire support,The Marine Corps supported the strategic purpose of reactivating two battleships in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 and supported the Navy's modernization efforts to deliver a sufficient NGFS capability that would exceed that of the Iowa-class battleships. See: Government Accountability Office. Information on Options for Naval Surface Fire Support. including members of Congress who remained \\"deeply concerned\\" over the loss of naval surface gunfire support that the battleships provided, and a number of independent groups such as the United States' Naval Fire Support Association (USNFSA) whose ranks included former members of the armed service and fans of the battleships. Although the arguments presented from each group differed, they all agreed that the United States Navy had not in good faith considered the potential of reactivated battleships for use in the field, a position that was supported by a 1999 Government Accountability Office report regarding the United States Navy's gunfire support program. In response, the navy pointed to the cost of reactivating the two Iowa-class battleships to their decommissioned capability. The navy estimated costs in excess of $500 million,This number was based on a 1999 estimate with a 4% annual inflation rate. See: Government Accountability Office. Information on Options for Naval Surface Fire Support.The U.S. Navy reported in the April 1987 edition of All Hands that the original cost of bringing the battleships back in the 1980s was $110 million per ship, but the actual cost after modernization and recommissioning was $455 million. See: Bureau of Naval Personnel, \\"Back on the battle line\\". but this did not include an additional $110 million needed to replenish the gunpowder for the guns, needed because a survey found the powder to be unsafe. In terms of schedule, the Navy's program management office estimated that reactivation would take 20 to 40 months, given the loss of corporate memory and the shipyard industrial base. Reactivating the battleships would have required a wide range of battleship modernization improvements, according to the navy's program management office. At a minimum, these modernization improvements included command and control, communications, computers, and intelligence equipment; environmental protection (including ozone-depleting substances); a plastic-waste processor; pulper/shredder and wastewater alterations; firefighting/fire safety and women-at-sea alterations; a modernized sensor suite (air and surface search radar); and new combat and self-defense systems. The navy's program management office also identified other issues that would strongly discourage the Navy from reactivating and modernizing the battleships. For example, personnel needed to operate the battleships would have been extensive, and the skills needed might not have been available or easily reconstituted.The U.S. Navy reported in the April 1987 edition of All Hands that while battleships had larger crews than other vessels the level of training required and the criticality of that training were less than that required of a crew aboard an . See: Bureau of Naval Personnel, \\"Back on the battle line\\". Other issues included the age and unreliability of the battleships' propulsion systems and the fact that the navy no longer maintained the capability to manufacture their 16-inch gun system components and ordnance. Although the navy firmly believed in the capabilities of the DD(X) destroyer program, members of the United States Congress remained skeptical about the efficiency of the new destroyers when compared to the battleships. Partially as a consequence, Congress passed Pub. L. 109-364, the National Defense Authorization Act 2007, requiring the battleships be kept and maintained in a state of readiness should they ever have been needed again.109th Congress, House of Representatives. Report 109‚Äì452. National Defense Authorization Act of 2007. p. 68. Retrieved 26 November 2006. Congress ordered that the following measures be implemented to ensure that, if need be, Iowa and Wisconsin could be returned to active duty: #Iowa and Wisconsin must not be altered in any way that would impair their military utility; #The battleships must be preserved in their present condition through the continued use of cathodic protection, dehumidification systems, and any other preservation methods as needed; #Spare parts and unique equipment such as the 16-inch gun barrels and projectiles be preserved in adequate numbers to support Iowa and Wisconsin, if reactivated; #The navy must prepare plans for the rapid reactivation of Iowa and Wisconsin should they be returned to the navy in the event of a national emergency. These four conditions closely mirrored the original three conditions that the Nation Defense Authorization Act of 1996 laid out for the maintenance of Iowa and Wisconsin while they were in the Mothball Fleet.  Alternatives to battleship gunfire  During the period of time in which the battleships were out of commission in the United States, several technological updates and breakthroughs enabled naval ships, submarines, and aircraft to compensate for the absence of big guns within the fleet.  Air superiority  During World War II, aircraft were used with devastating effect for both strategic bombing and for close support of ground troops, by all combatants. Land-based aircraft were effective when the airfields were in range of the targets and when a degree of air superiority could be established. Carrier-based aircraft were originally intended for use against enemy ships. In addition to this role, several aircraft like the P-47 Thunderbolt were employed for close air support for ground based troops in Europe and in the Pacific. F4U-5 Corsairs provide close air support to U.S. Marines during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, December 1950. By the time of the Korean War, air power had been supplemented by the introduction of the jet engine, which allowed fighter and bomber aircraft to fly faster. As with their World predecessors, the newer jet aircraft proved capable of providing close air support for ground based troops, and were instrumental in aiding UN ground forces during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.National Museum of the USAF - Fact Sheet Media (F-86A/E/F Sabre) The Vietnam War saw the introduction of helicopter gunships which could be employed to support ground based forces, and the experience gained in Vietnam would spawn the creation of several aircraft during and after the war designed specifically to aid ground forces, including the AC-47 Spooky, Fairchild AC-119, Lockheed AC-130, and A-10 Thunderbolt II, all of which are operated by the Air Force, and the F/A-18 Hornet which is operated by the Navy. In addition, the Army and Marine Corps operate UH-1 Iroquois, AH-1 Cobra, and AH-64 Apache helicopters for close air support, and these helicopters can be stationed onboard amphibious assault ships to provide ship-to-shore air support for ground forces. These aircraft would later prove instrumental in aiding ground forces from the 1980s onwards, and would be involved in the 1991 Gulf War, the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Starting after the invasion of Iraq, the air force began arming unmanned drone aircraft to perform strike missions. Originally designed for prolonged surveillance (and ironically to act as spotters for naval artillery), these aircraft typically have greater endurance than manned strike aircraft and some degree of automation to allow them to patrol for activity without requiring the constant attention of a pilot. This permitted the fielding of a less expensive aerial force which could maintain constant surveillance for enemy targets and conduct strikes on any targets encountered.  Missiles  guided missile destroyers use their Vertical Launch Systems to fire Standard missiles during a live fire exercise. The rise of precision strike munitions in the 1970s and 1980s reduced the need for a massive naval bombardment against an enemy force, as missiles could now be used against such targets to support ground forces and to destroy targets in advance of the arrival of troops. Guided missiles could also fire much further than any naval gun, allowing for strikes deep into the heart of enemy territory without risking the lives of pilots or airplanes. This led to a major shift in naval thinking, and as a result ships became more dependent on missile magazines than on their guns for offensive and defensive capabilities. This was demonstrated in the 1980s, when all four recommissioned battleships were outfitted with missile magazines, and again in the 1991 Gulf War, when both Missouri and Wisconsin launched missile volleys against targets in Iraq before using their guns against Iraqi targets on the coast. The same conflict saw the first use of submarine-launched cruise missiles when the attack submarine fired Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles into Iraq from the Red Sea. Between 2002 and 2008, four of the s were converted to SSGNs carrying cruise missiles instead of SSBNs carrying ballistic missiles. Each SSGN carries 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles.  Gun support from other ships  Test firing a railgun at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, January 2008 The Iowa-class battleships were maintained and used because their 16\\" Mark 7 guns were considered more effective than the smaller 5\\" Mark 45 guns found on modern frigates, cruisers, and destroyers. Each battleship had a main battery of nine 16\\" guns and a secondary battery of twenty 5\\" guns, while the smaller modern ships have a single 5\\" gun. The 5\\" gun was the largest gun remaining in active Navy service after the battleships were decommissioned. In the 1960s, following a requirement established by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) for a new gun capable of firing semi-active laser guided projectiles (SAL GP), the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division worked on the Major Caliber Lightweight Gun (MCLWG) program, testing capability of destroyer-sized ships to provide shore bombardment support with the range previously available from decommissioned cruisers. The 8\\"/55 caliber Mark 71 gun, a single gun version of the 8\\"/55 Mark 16 caliber gun was mounted aboard the . After at-sea technical evaluation in 1975 and operational testing that followed through 1976, The Operational Test and Evaluation Force determined inaccuracy made the gun operationally unsuitable. The lightweight 8\\"/55 was concluded to be no more effective than the 5\\"/54 with Rocket Assisted Projectiles. Program funding was terminated in 1978.Miller, John C., Col USMC & Peterson, H.W., Major USMC \\"Guns vs. Butter - Without the Guns?\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings January 1982 pp.33‚Äì34 In the 1980s, conventional guns were used by US destroyers during the Lebanese Civil War to shell positions for the Multinational Force in Lebanon operating on the ground. Guns were also used by the Royal Navy in the Falklands War to support British forces during the operations to recapture the islands from the Argentinians. For example, the Type 42 destroyer was required to fire at enemy positions on the islands with her 4.5-inch gun. In one engagement she fired 277 high-explosive rounds, although later problems with the gun prevented continual use. Ship-based gunfire was also used during Operation Praying Mantis in 1988 to neutralize Iranian gun emplacements on oil platforms in the Persian Gulf. Although the smaller caliber guns are effective in combat, larger caliber guns can have a large psychological effect, as occurred during the bombardment of Iraqi shore defenses by the battleships and Wisconsin in the Gulf War. When the latter battleship returned to resume shelling the island, the enemy troops surrendered to her Pioneer UAV launched to spot for the battleships' guns rather than face another round of heavy naval artillery.Federation of American Scientists. Pioneer Short Range (SR) UAV. Retrieved 26 November 2006.National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution. Pioneer RQ-2A. 14 September 2001. Retrieved 26 November 2006. The navy looked into creating precision guided artillery rounds for use with the current fleet of cruisers and destroyers. The most recent attempt to modify the guns for longer range came with the Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) munitions for the Advanced Gun System mounts installed aboard the Zumwalt-class destroyers. The navy was involved in the LRLAP and Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition, both cancelled efforts to develop Extended Range Guided Munitions. In addition to funding research into various extended range munitions, the navy is also working on developing railguns for use with the fleet at some point in the future. The United States Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division demonstrated an 8 MJ rail gun firing 3.2 kilogram (slightly more than 7 pounds) projectiles in October 2006 as a prototype of a 64 MJ weapon to be deployed aboard navy warships. The main problem the navy has had with implementing a railgun cannon system is that the guns wear out due to the immense heat produced by firing. Such weapons are expected to be powerful enough to do a little more damage than a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile at a fraction of the projectile cost. Since then, BAE Systems has delivered a 32 MJ prototype to the Navy. On January 31, 2008, the US Navy tested a magnetic railgun; it fired a shell at 2520 m/s using 10.64 megajoules of energy. Its expected performance is over 5800 m/s muzzle velocity, accurate enough to hit a 5-meter target from away while shooting at 10 shots per minute. It is expected to be ready between 2020 and 2025. Apart from railguns, 16 inch scramjet rounds with ranges of up to 400 nautical miles that have a 9-minute time of flight were proposed by Pratt and Whitney, working with Dr. Dennis Reilly, a plasma physicist with extensive experience with munitions, but the navy had no interested sponsor.Shawn Welch, Colonel, Corps of Engineers United States Army. Joint and Interdependent Requirements: A Case Study in Solving the Naval Surface Fire Support Capabilities Gap . Joint Advanced Warfighting School Masters Thesis. Retrieved 2012-11-19 from Defense Technical Information Center.  Subsequent developments  The s were to replace battleship gunfire support. New Jersey remained on the NVR until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 passed through Congress 18 October 1998. Section 1011 required the United States Secretary of the Navy to list and maintain and Wisconsin on the Naval Vessel Register, while Section 1012 required the Secretary of the Navy to strike New Jersey from the Naval Vessel Register and transfer the battleship to a not-for-profit entity in accordance with section 7306 of Title 10, United States Code. Section 1012 also required the transferee to locate the battleship in the State of New Jersey. The navy made the switch in January 1999. Iowa and Wisconsin were finally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in 2006. Prior to the reduction of ships in the program, it seemed unlikely that the above four conditions would have impeded the plan to turn Iowa and Wisconsin into museum ships because the navy had expected a sufficient number of Zumwalt destroyers to be ready to help fill the NGFS gap by 2018 at the earliest, but the July 2008 decision by the navy to cancel the Zumwalt program left the Navy without a ship class capable of replacing the two battleships removed from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2006. James T. Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps has said that missiles fired from the littoral combat ship could fulfill the USMC needs for NGFS. This would not be the current NLOS-LS program as the range of the PAM missile at falls short of the threshold requirement for NGFS of and the number of CLUs the current LCS designs can carry in a ready to fire configuration is also short of the required volume of fire. The Loitering Attack Missile could have matched the required range, but it was cancelled in 2011 and the LCS would still have fallen short in terms of rounds ready to fire. On 15 September 2015, then Presidential candidate Donald Trump, while giving a speech on defense during the campaign for the 2016 presidential election on board the battleship Iowa in San Pedro, California, briefly remarked in having interest in recommissioning the s. After the completion of sea trials which began in 2014 was officially commissioned into the US Navy on 15 October 2016 at Baltimore, Maryland. But in November 2016 the principal and only ammunition for Zumwalt's two 155 mm Advanced Gun Systems, the Long Range Land Attack Projectile, was cancelled due to increased costs. Zumwalt is currently assigned to the US Pacific Fleet and is homeported in San Diego, California.  Notes  References  * * Coram, Robert. Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War.

Functionality includes automatic interface composition, database generation and updates, data insertion, programming interface publishing and web service generation. The modeling takes place in Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD). The layout for these diagrams can be changed to Relational Database or Unified Modeling Language (UML), the functionality stays the same though. Philosophy of RISE The purpose of RISE is to make information system engineering a more manageable process. Technically speaking, RISE is a model-driven engineering (MDE) tool with semantics and functionality that is specialized for the application-domain of information systems. The model in RISE is more than an information model, it's an information model complete with the methods needed to govern the use of the information in the model. Such a model is referred to as a MIM, or managed information model. Using code generators a managed information model is automatically transformed into a system. All in all, this is what's commonly referred to as a model-driven architecture. A domain is a suitable candidate for model-driven engineering if different solutions for the domain show noticeable similarities. A good MDE tool is one that focuses on and addresses these similarities whereas a bad MDE tool is one that diverts attentions from the problem domain. The domain of RISE, information systems in the sense of database-centric systems managing business information, is an obvious candidate for MDE. Below are some examples on how RISE boosts efficiency and simplicity in the engineering process simply by adhering to the specifics of the domain. * Information models are drawn in and shown using Entity Relationship Diagrams. This is a space efficient and unambiguous way to represent an information model. ER doesn't introduce any constructs or abstractions that aren't native in the world of information modeling. * Method modeling is based on the fact that methods operate on an information model, i.e. ER, elements. This allows the creation and maintenance of basic methods to be automated and it reduces the construction of higher level methods to sheer drag-and-drop. * Databases are incrementally updated during code generation, assuring sync with the modeling project while preserving the current data. Actually, this could be seen as a requirement for efficient model-driven engineering in the information system domain. The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle states that \\"every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system\\". In essence, unnecessary duplication of information - such as business logics, rules, configuration, etc. - decreases clarity and predictability of a system. Redundancy always poses a risk of causing inconsistencies and contradictions. This said, DRY is actually one of those principles that all skilled developers adhere to even though some might be unfamiliar with the term itself. RISE is currently used at e.g. Bundeswehr University Munich, Universit√§t Z√ºrich, and Universit√† di Bologna. Code Generation The RISE suit provides a range of code generators for transforming RISE models into software. A RISE code generator is a separate software application that operates on a RISE model (XML file) and produces some kind of output. There are two main categories of code generators: database script generators and application source code generators. RISE code generators can be launched in several different ways: * As an integrated part of the RISE Editor. * As a standalone application. * Using a script or from command line. Database script generators The database code generators write incremental scripts for creating, and updating, relational database models based on the RISE model. A RISE model contains - unless it's been refactored - the entire life-cycle of the data model. The code generator translates this life-cycle into an incremental database specific script. Currently, code generators for SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL are available. Application source code generators The application source code generators render code, in a particular programming language, for working with databases based on the same RISE model. The generated code includes classes for managing database access and for publishing the access layer as web services. Both SOAP and JSON style web services are supported. Currently, two languages are supported C# (.NET) and PHP. The C# for ODBC code generator outputs code handling three databases (SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL). For PHP there are two different code generators, PHP for MySQL and PHP for PostgreSQL, creating source code using the respective database native driver. There is also an AJAX code generator for RISE. It renders JavaScript source code, that uses jQuery, for accessing JSON enabled web services in Rich Internet Applications or AJAX applications. The generated code is compliant with any JSON enabled web service, .NET as well as PHP, generated from the same RISE model.  Major features  * Graphical modeling using: ** Entity Relationship Diagrams in Information Engineering notation (crow‚Äôs foot) ** UML (Unified Modeling Language)-style class diagram ** Relational Database Diagrams * Collaborative features such as: ** Deployment directly in database ** Deployment directly on web site ** Multiple developers using a centralized server * Relational database generators for creating and incrementally updating of: ** SQL Server ** PostgreSQL ** MySQL * Application code generators for persistent layer, programming interface, web services: ** C# for ODBC supporting Microsofts JSON-mechanism ** PHP for MySQL ** PHP for PostgreSQL ** AJAX * Miscellaneous ** Refactoring ** Model consistency ** Automatic model documentation ** web service test utility ** Drag-n-drop to aggregate methods ** Custom code method support ** Modeling and code generation convention handling ** Database schema import ** Data manager for embedding configuration data in models ** Embedded SQL utility tool for browsing and analyzing SQL databases(1) directly from within RISE. 1) The utility tool and import functionality works with most ODBC compliant databases.

The diocese was founded in 1984, having previously formed part of the Diocese of Cabanatuan. It is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan. The diocese held its first Diocesan Synod in March 2011 led by the Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines. The diocese celebrated its Silver Anniversary of Canonical Erection last July 14, 2009. On April 20, Pope Benedict XVI named its third bishop, Most Rev. Mylo Hubert C. Vergara, as the bishop of Pasig. At present, the diocese is headed by its fourth bishop Most Rev. Roberto C. Mallari D.D., former Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of San Fernando, Pampanga. Brief History The Diocese of San Jose, Nueva Ecija, was created on Feb. 16, 1984 by Pope John Paul II and canonically erected on July 14, 1984. Its territory was taken from the Diocese of Cabanatuan which at same time of the division comprised the entire province of Nueva Ecija. Sixteen parishes, out of forty one parishes of the Diocese of Cabanatuan were adjudicated to the Diocese of San Jose, Nueva Ecija. 80 percent of the people are Roman Catholics and the rest of 20 percent are members of different sects and denominations. Bishop Florentino F. Cinense, DD, was appointed the diocese's first diocesan bishop on July 14, 1984. When appointed coadjutor bishop of Tarlac, he remained as Apostolic Administrator of San Jose, until the appointment of his successor Bishop Leo M. Drona, SDB, DD, on July 25, 1987. Bishop Leo M. Drona had been a Salesian of Don Bosco for twenty nine- years prior to his Episcopal appointment. He is the first Filipino Salesian priest as well as the first Filipino Salesian Bishop. In June 2004, Bishop Drona was transferred to the Diocese of San Pablo, Laguna as its third bishop. He was succeeded by Bishop Mylo Hubert C. Vergara who was installed as the third bishop of the Diocese of San Jose de Nueva Ecija on May 14, 2005. Then Bishop Mylo C Vergara transferred to the Diocese of Pasig. It was May 15 when Pope Benedict XVI named the current Bishop Roberto C. Mallari.

Life Hawarden was born in Lancashire, England. His family were recusants who maintained domestic chapels in their residences in Appleton and Widnes. Edward, after a course at the English College, Douai, remained there as a classical tutor, and after his ordination (7 June 1686), as professor of philosophy.Rudge, F.M. \\"Edward Hawarden.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 17 January 2019 In 1688, having taken the bachelor's degree at the University of Douai, he spent two months as tutor of divinity at Magdalen College, Oxford, which James II of England purposed making a seat of Catholic education. The impending revolution against James forced Hawarden to return to Douai, where he soon proceeded D.D. and was installed in the chair of divinity. One of his students was the historian Hugh Tootell.\\"Hugh Tootell (alias Charles Dodd)\\", Firmly I Believe and Truly: The Spiritual Tradition of Catholic England, (John Saward, John Morrill, Michael Tomko, eds.), OUP Oxford, 2013, p. 302 In 1702 he was persuaded to take part in the concurrence for one of the royal chair of divinity in the university, but the influence of a hostile minority secured the installation of another candidate by mandatory letters from the court. Shortly afterwards complaints were lodged at Rome that the Douai professors, Dr. Hawarden in particular, were propagating the errors of Jansenism. Hawarden was dismissed from the university,\\"Hawarden, Letter March 14, 1711\\", Pitts Theology Library but a subsequent official investigation completely exonerated all. In 1707 Hawarden left Douai to take charge of the mission of Gilligate, Durham, and later Aldcliffe Hall, near Lancaster. Brief entries in the Tyldesley Diary give an idea of his daily life until the seizure of Aldcliffe Hall in 1717, after which he moved to London, probably on his appointment as Controversy-writer. Dr. Hawarden received the thanks of the University of Oxford for his defence of the Blessed Trinity in the famous conference with Dr. Samuel Clarke (1719). He died, aged 73, in London. Works Among his works are: *\\"The True Church of Christ, shewed by Concurrent Testimonies of Scripture and Primitive Tradition\\" (London, 1714); *\\"The Rule of Faith truly stated in a new and easy Method\\" (London, 1721); *\\"Charity and Truth or Catholicks not uncharitable in saying that none are saved out of the Catholick Communion, because the Rule is not Universal\\" (Brussels, 1728); *\\"An Answer to Dr. Clarke and Mr. Whiston concerning the Divinity of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\\" (London, 1729); a collective edition of his works was published at Dublin in 1808.

His father (George) was the Headmaster of the school. In 1896, he started working as a probationary teacher at the school and in 1901 received the Pupil Teacher's Bishops of London Prize for Religious Knowledge. In 1902, Smyth entered St Marks College, Chelsea where he studied until 1904. Subsequently he taught in Holy Trinity Boys School, Sloane Square (1904) and Blackstock Road London County Council School (1908). Around this time the Hampstead Sketch Club was formed, with Paul Smyth as the secretary. In 1913, he received the honour of having his painting ‚Äì 'The Ferry Boat Inn' at Holywell in Cambridgeshire being displayed in the Royal Academy. It was sold to a Mr Smith for ¬£20. World War I Paul Smyth joined the 2/7th Middlesex Regiment in July 1914. In January 1915 he sailed on the 'Grantully Castle' Photos of the Grantully Castle at MaritimeQuest to Gibraltar. He arrived in Cairo in August 1915. Whilst in both places he was able to do some painting when time allowed. In 1916, his commission came through while at home in England, and he left for France as a second lieutenant in the 19th Manchester Regiment. He was wounded on the first day of the Battle of Passchendale in the Summer of 1917 and was returned to Netley Hospital on Southampton Water, where he was to stay for the next nine months recovering from his wounds. Inter War Period In the years leading up to the First World War Paul Smyth visited and painted on Canvey Island, Essex many times. It was here that he met Elsie Mulley whom he married in Highgate, London on 20 July 1918. Now living in Highgate and from 1922 teaching at Whittington School (Highgate), Smyth began to hold numerous painting exhibitions. Paul Smyth was Headmaster of Upper Marylebone St. London County Council School from 1929 and Headmaster of Old Oak Senior Boys School from 1933.

A great fire reduced the town into ashes and it was thereafter renamed Sarapsap. The actual name was taken after Governor General Juan de Alaminos who visited it in 1872. Among other edifices constructed by Recollects is the majestic cathedral dedicated to Saint Joseph. Father Manuel Bosquete who was at the helm of the San Jose de Casborran mission from 1838‚Äì1849 started the construction of the divine temple. His successor Father Jose Tornos, who was proficient in Pangasinense, inaugurated it in 1857. This Recollect minister who took over the parochial administration in 1849 remained in Alaminos for almost thirty years and endowed the church with the best ornaments. Father Tornos died in 1878 and was buried in the future cathedral. At the church pavement one can view his tombstone in Spanish. Father Patricio Marcellan writes in 1879: \\"The present church and parochial house are made of brick manufactured in the same town. The first oven for brick-making making was built under the supervision of Father Manuel Bosquete, the first Recollect parish priest of this town [sic], and the edifices are the tallest and most spacious in the province, which draws naturally any visitor's attention.\\" The church still attracts attention up to this day, already as a cathedral since its erection of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Alaminos in 1985. Alaminos is not a big city in terms of population, with only about 75,000 inhabitants. But the faithful can boast of the structure of their cathedral‚Äîspacious, majestic and well- proportioned‚Äîand equally stable belfry made of bricks.

At the beginning of the century, the sack-back gown was a very informal style of dress. At its most informal, it was unfitted both front and back and called a sacque, contouche, or robe battante. By the 1770s the sack-back gown was second only to court dress in its formality. This style of gown had fabric at the back arranged in box pleats which fell loose from the shoulder to the floor with a slight train. In front, the gown was open, showing off a decorative stomacher and petticoat. It would have been worn with a wide square hoop or panniers under the petticoat. Scalloped ruffles often trimmed elbow-length sleeves, which were worn with separate frills called engageantes. The casaquin (popularly known from the 1740s onwards as a pet-en-l'air) was an abbreviated version of the robe √† la fran√ßaise worn as a jacket for informal wear with a matching or contrasting petticoat. The skirt of the casaquin was knee-length but gradually shortened until by the 1780s it resembled a peplum. The loose box pleats which are a feature of this style are sometimes called Watteau pleats from their appearance in the paintings of Antoine Watteau. The various Watteau terms, such as Watteau pleat, Watteau back, Watteau gown etc., date from the mid-19th century rather than reflecting authentic 18th century terminology, and normally describe 19th and 20th century revivals of the sack-back. Notable wearers A popular story, traced back to the correspondence of √âlisabeth Charlotte d'Orl√©ans, Duchess d'Orl√©ans, is that the earliest form of the sack- back gown, the robe battante, was invented as maternity clothing in the 1670s by Louis XIV's mistress to conceal her clandestine pregnancies. However, people would comment: \\"Madame de Montespan has put on her robe battante, therefore she must be pregnant.\\" A similar story is associated with Marie Louise √âlisabeth d'Orl√©ans, Duchess of Berry, who during the French Regency of 1715-1723 was known for wearing this style of gown which showcased her bosom and face whilst, as with Madame de Montespan, disguising illicit pregnancies.Philippe Erlanger, Le R√©gent, Paris, Gallimard, 1966 (1st ed. 1938), pp. 227-228 Galleries=18th century File:Gersaint- detail.jpgL'Enseigne de Gersaint (detail), 1720, by Antoine Watteau.

The descendants of the Maharajahs were considered as members of these Ammaveedus, with a status subordinate only to royalty. The chief four Ammaveedus are the Arumana, Vadasseri, Thiruvattar and Nagercoil Ammaveedus. Origin The consorts of the Travancore kings were known generally as \\"Ammachis\\" and held the title of Panapillai Amma which meant royal consort. As per the Marumakkathayam law of inheritance and succession in the Royal family of Travancore the Maharajahs were succeeded by their nephews from their sisters, the Maharanis. The Ammachi Panapillai Amma was granted privileges as befitting their status, vast areas of lands and other valuable property and \\"a liberal provision is made from the State funds for their maintenance in comfort and dignity\\".Nagam Aiya Travancore Manual Vol II page 335 The Ammachi was not a member of the royal household, and was in no way associated with the royal court and could not, earlier, even be seen in public with the ruler whose wife she was. Ammachis, if put away or widowed, were not allowed to marry any other man and were restricted and guarded in their own residences.Native life in Travancore By Samuel Mateer Published in 1883, W. H. Allen & Co. (London) The male and female children born to the Maharajah were dignified with the honorific of Thampi and Kochamma/Thankachi respectively. Etymology The Maharajah's spouse was known as the Ammachi Panapillai Amma, and her \\"veedu\\" or residence was known as an Ammaveedu. The names of the Ammaveedus corresponded to the place from where the consort hailed. For example, the Arumana Ammaveedu had its origin when a lady from Arumana village in Vilavancode, Kanyakumari was espoused by a former Maharajah of Travancore. Other Ammaveedus of prominence were Vadasseri Ammaveedu, Nagercoil Ammaveedu, Thanjavur Ammaveedu, Thiruvattar Ammaveedu, Puthumana Ammaveedu (of Ravi Varman Thampi) etc., all named after the villages from where the original Ammachis came.Velu Pillai Travancore Manual Volume II page 709 The Ammaveedus There are several Ammaveedus in Trivandrum such as the Puthumana, Kallada, Mupidakka, Chavara, Pulimoodu Ammaveedus' etc. However, from the end of the 18th century four Ammaveedus gained prominence. These were the Arumana, Vadasseri, Thiruvattar and Nagercoil Ammaveedus. Maharajah Karthika Thirunal Dharma Raja had married four ladies from the above-mentioned villages and established these Ammaveedus. Thereafter he decreed that henceforward the Maharajahs and male members of the Travancore Royal Family were to take consorts only from these four families and if an outsider was to be taken, she would have to be adopted into one of these. Balarama Varma, his successor, married from the Arumana family as did Visakham Thirunal in 1859. Swathi Thirunal and Uthram Thirunal married sisters who were adopted into the Thiruvattar family. Ayilyam Thirunal's consort was similarly adopted into the Nagercoil family. Moolam Thirunal married from Nagercoil first and following his consort's death married a commoner by adopting her into the Vadasseri Ammaveedu.Thiruvananthapurathinthe Ehithihasam Only those consorts of the Maharajahs who were born or adopted into one of these four Ammaveedus was entitled to the royal dignities and privileges that came with the title of Panapillai Amma. As late as the early 20th century when the then heir apparent, Prince Chatayam Thirunal, married a lady from outside these four families, she was not permitted to adopt the above-mentioned title and separate provisions had to be made later on the Prince's application from the state treasury.The life and times of Maharani Setu Lakshmi Bayi by Lakshmi Raghunandan See also * Nair * Thampi * Panapillai Amma * Travancore * Marumakkathayam References Category:Kerala society Category:Court titles Category:Noble titles Category:Titles in India ","title":"Ammaveedu"},{"id":"18741332","text":"Uttai Tawee (; ) is a Thai lakorn Boran that aired on Thai Channel 7 in 2003. It is a remake of a 1989 lakorn of the same name, and stars Bee Madthika and Auot. It is about a girl named Uttai Tawee. Her mother is a dragon princess and her father is a tree god. Summary Uttai Tawee is a half god and half dragon girl, who was born from an egg. Her parents met and fell in love after her father saved her mother from being kidnapped by an eagle god. Her parents were forced to part because their relationship was forbidden, since they are from different species. Her father went to the heavens to receive his punishment for falling in love with a dragon. Her mother returned to her underwater kingdom to live as a nun to atone for the sins of loving a god and having his child. She would pray to the gods not to punish her daughter for their mistakes. While Uttai Tawee was still inside the egg, her mother gave her to a group of forest creatures to raise. The forest creatures consist of a male snake, a female parrot, and a male turtle. The animals swore to raise Uttai Tawee and love her to repay her parents back for saving their lives from a forest fire and for giving them the abilities to speak and turn into humans. The dragon princess also left a magic ring, in the shape of a dragon, to her daughter for protection. Before Uttai Tawee could hatch she was swallowed by a large frog. The frog died from the protective poison her mother had placed on the shell of the egg. The animals return to her nest to find the missing egg and the dead frog nearby and argued about what had happened to the egg. Uttai Tawee emerged from the frog in a child form to end their argument. As a child Uttai Tawee grew up in the forest without knowing who her mother was. Her father visited her once to teach her how to control her magical powers, but couldn't stay with her long, since he still had to endure his punishment. Uttai Tawee hid herself in a frog skin to allow herself to freely roam around the forest. She found a small village near the forest and yearns to play with children her age. Some of the children would play with her, while others shunned her for being a stranger and not knowing who her parents were. Their rejection saddened her. One day, while Uttai Tawee was in her frog skin, she was captured by a poor old man for dinner. He took her home to feed himself and his wife. They were going to cook her but was interrupted when she started speaking and by a group of men outside. The old man was an addicted gambler and owed them money, which he couldn't pay. Feeling sorry for the couple, Uttai Tawee told them where to find jewels buried underground to pay for the debts. She made the old man swear that he would quit gambling. She would cook for them and lie about how the food got there. The couple adored her and decided to keep her as a pet. One day, they found her in human form and realized that she was not a frog, but a small child. They were going to destroy the frog skin so she could remain human with them. She caught them and asked them why they are doing that. The couple explained to her that she shouldn't have to wear a frog's skin if she was such a beautiful child. She told them that she wanted to keep the frog's skin, but will remain in human form if they wanted her too. From then on they looked after her as their granddaughter. Uttai Tawee lived with the old couple and visited her forest friends. Uttai Tawee grew up to be the most beautiful girl in the kingdom, and all of the men fell in love with her. A young prince who passed by her village saw her and they fell in love. They were not allowed to marry because Uttai Tawee was only a poor commoner, while the prince was a wealthy nobleman. The prince's mother disliked Uttai Tawee, since she had already promised that the prince would marry the daughter of a friend of hers, an evil princess from another kingdom. The queen set Uttai Tawee the task of building a house of gold, and the prince was tasked with building a bridge of gold, before they might marry. Uttai Tawee used her magic to make the golden house in seconds. While the prince instructed workers to build the bridge. The evil princess and her men destroyed every bridge the prince built because she was angry that he had rejected her for a commoner. Uttai Tawee and the prince prayed to the gods and asked them for help. If they were soul mates, please allow the bridge to be complete and it did. Finally Uttai Tawee and the prince married and lived very happily. The jealous princess would travel to the prince's kingdom to rob and terrorize his people. Everyone knew that the bandits were from her kingdom but couldn't do anything about it as there was no proof that it was them. The prince had to decide to go to the evil princess's kingdom to ask her to spare his people from her attacks. This left Uttai Tawee alone with his parents, who by now accepted her as their daughter-in-law. Before they parted the prince had life size statues of them made. He took her statue with him while she kept his. When the prince arrived the evil princess tried to make him fall in love with her, but he ignores her. Having enough the princess put a love spell on him so that he would be her love slave and stay with her. The princess sends her older brother to kill Uttai Tawee so no one would get between her and the prince. She and her minion showed her brother how Uttai Tawee looked like and the evil prince fell madly in love with her. He changed his plans and tried to seduce Uttai Tawee instead. Uttai Tawee was sad when she found out that her husband fell in love with another woman and married her. She doesn't like the evil prince but remains kind and respectful to him as he is a guest. When she discovered the evil princess' plans, Uttai made a statue of herself and placed it in the Prince's room. When the jealous princess saw it, she tried to melt it, but the statue came to life and fought her off. The jealous princess tried to drown it in the river but good overcame evil and the prince was freed of his spell. He returned to Uttai Tawee but the jealous princess sent Krok, the powerful enemy of Uttai's parents. With the help of her grandfather the king dragon, her animal friends, and her father the tree god, Uttai vanquished Krok along with the jealous princess and her brother. The jealous princess's parents were sorry for their daughter's misdeeds and returned to their kingdom. The lakorn ends with Uttai Tawee and her prince living happily together.

This ancient Holy Cross is still honorably retained on the east side wall of the Dayara building. In the year 1200 it was declared a Chapel. Kattumangattu Junior Bava Geevarghese Mar Coorilose (second Bishop of Thozhiyoor Church) who died in 1809, is buried in this Dayara. He is considered a saint by the local faithful, who celebrate his feast on 28 and 29 May. Thousands of people irrespective of religious affiliations attend this every year and receive blessings. In 1877, Parumala Thirumeni and the Malankara Metropolitan, after 40 days of meditation and fasting, consecrated the renovated Dayara and the Holy Madbaha. Soon after the consecration ceremony, the 'first Holy Synod of Malankara Church' was conducted in the Dayara. The Malankara Church was demarcated into seven dioceses in this Synod with Bishops being assigned to each Diocese. In 1976, Metropolitan Joseph Mar Pakkomios renovated the Dayara. On 10 December 1976, in the centenary year of Parumala Thirumeni's ordination as Metropolitan, the holy relics of Parumala Thirumeni were transferred and interred here.

At Larut, miners who were members of the Hai San society fought with miners who were members of the Ghee Hin society over the tin-rich fields of Kelian Pauh and Kelian Baru. The two warring factions also clashed in Selangor. The Hai San society was allied with the Penang-based Tokong or Tua Peh Kong society, members of whom financed the mining of tin in the Larut area. The incessant warfare between the Hai San and Ghee Hin brought tin mine production to a standstill. The fighting between the two societies was brought to an end with the signing of a treaty between the two parties in 1874, known as The Pangkor Treaty of 1874. Many of the new settlers were sacrificed in the wars waged among the Ghee Hin and Hai San groups. Many of these long lost tribes still hold grudges against one another.

History  Basepoint was formed in September 1988 to raise funds from the public to buy residential property to let under the assured tenancies legislation introduced by the Housing Act 1988. In 1993 the company elected to extend its interests into commercial property and in 1995 opened its first managed business centre at Romsey, Hampshire. Further centres in the same region followed at Waterlooville, High Wycombe and Weymouth. In June 2000 the company joined the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), and thereafter the pace of openings picked up markedly, with new centres opening in Havant in October 2000, Basingstoke in April 2001, and Folkestone, Southampton, Andover and Crawley in 2003. 2004 saw new centres open in Gosport and Bournemouth, while 2005 saw a new centre opened in Swindon and the company won a management contract for a centre in Northfleet, Kent, owned by Kent County Council. At the end of 2005 Basepoint plc was acquired by major shareholder the ACT Foundation, a grant- making charity with a substantial portfolio of property investments, and the company was split into a development arm, Basepoint Developments Ltd, and the division responsible for the management of the centres, Basepoint Centres Ltd. With the resources of its new parent behind it the company continued its expansion programme until by July 2011 it had 28 centres operational across the south of England and up into the Midlands, and a number of others under development, hosting well over 1,800 small businesses. Business model Premises are let on short-term licences that require as little as two weeks‚Äô notice, and a single fee covers all the premises' costs apart from consumables such as communications and electricity. Customers are typically start-ups making the first move from a spare bedroom or garage into proper business premises, small companies who would prefer to avoid the inflexibility of a long lease, and small organisations that are attracted by the support, high quality communal facilities and sense of community that all Basepoint centres offer. The company also differentiates itself from serviced office providers in that its on-site managers act as a gateway to a wide range of support and advice, and the company's strategy is to expand this over the next few years by introducing additional support for start-up companies by establishing links with grant-making agencies, suppliers of finance, expert advisors and more. Basepoint centres are often built in partnership with local or regional government bodies as part of regeneration and employment initiatives, with their ability to foster the development of new businesses seen as valuable in areas with below-average growth rates. Charitable activities Each centre is tasked to partner with a local charity and contribute money via a ¬£-for-¬£ matched funding programme by The ACT Foundation, a registered charity, up to a maximum of ¬£10,000.

The line was originally constructed for the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer du Midi (CFM), the then main line railway operator in the area to the north of the Pyrenees. As part of a program of electrifying these lines, the CFM constructed a series of hydro- electric power stations in the valley of the Ossau between the years 1920 and 1932. Significant civil engineering works were required in order to provide access to these works, and included the line now used by the petit train. Once this work was finished, the CFM recognised the tourist potential of the line, and the first tourist trains were run. Today the petit train is reached by a gondola from a lower station at Artouste-Fabr√®ges, on the Lac de Fabr√®ges in the valley of the Gave du Brousset.

Life On 25 June 1549, at the disputations held before the king's commissioners at Cambridge, Vavasour was one of the disputants in favour of Transubstantiation and the Sacrifice of the Mass. He subsequently went to Venice, where he took the degree of M.D., and on 20 November 1556, he received a licence from the College of Physicians of London to practise for two years. His house was \\"by the common school house\\" in the city of York; there Mass was said in 1570. In 1572 he was accused of having entertained Edmund Campion. In Nov., 1574, after he had been confined to his own house in the city of York for nearly nine months, he was sent into solitary confinement in Hull Castle. Edmund Grindal describes him as \\"sophistical, disdainful, and illuding arguments with irrision, when he was not able to solute the same by learning\\", and adds that \\"his great anchor-hold was in urging the literal sense of hoc est corpus meum, thereby to prove transubstantiation\\". By June, 1579, he was back again in his house, where Mass was again said. Later on, he was in the Gatehouse, Westminster, from which he was released on submitting to acknowledge the royal supremacy in religious matters; but he was again imprisoned as a recusant in Hull Castle, York where he died.

The castle is an early example of artillery defence in Scotland. History The construction of Ravenscraig Castle by the mason Henry Merlion and the master carpenter Friar Andres Lesouris was ordered by King James II (reigned 1437-1460) as a home for his wife, Mary of Guelders.Eunson, Eric Old Dysart and East Kirkcaldy p.27. The castle is considered one of the first - perhaps the very first - in Scotland to be built to withstand cannon fire and provide for artillery defence. The king was involved with the planning but, ironically, was killed in a tragic accident with a loaded cannon at the Siege of Roxburgh Castle near Floors Castle in the Scottish Borders.Lamont-Brown Fife in History and Legend pp145-146 Construction was commenced around 1460 by his widow, Mary of Guelders, as a memorial to him and as a dower house.Lamont-Brown, Raymond Fife in History and Legend, p. 148. Mary of Guelders lived in the castle until her death in 1463, when only the east tower and the basement of the central section were built.Tabraham, p.98 Ownership passed to her son James III (reigned 1460-1488) but in 1471 he gave the castle to William Sinclair, Earl of Orkney and Caithness in exchange for the Earldom of Orkney and associated lands which James annexed from Norway to the Scottish Crown.Civic Society History & Celebration p.13. After 1471 Ravenscraig was finally completed by the Sinclairs, who also had an interest in artillery fortifications. James V and Mary of Guise came to Ravenscraig on 9 April 1540 on their way to Falkland Palace. They arrived in two galleys rowed from Kinghorn.Athol Murray, 'Pursemaster's Accounts', Miscellany of the Scottish History Society X (Edinburgh, 1965), pp. 41-2. During the 1650-51 invasion of Scotland by English forces under Oliver Cromwell, Ravenscraig was invaded, attacked and damaged.Lamont Brown Fife in History and Legend 2002, p.149. The castle remained in the ownership of the Sinclairs, who built nearby Dysart House (1755-1756) on the estate, and later passed to the St Clair-Erskines, Earls of Rosslyn. The estate and castle remained in the family until sold in 1896, by the 5th Earl, to linoleum magnate Sir Michael Nairn who lived in Dysart House. The castle was used as an ammunition depot during the First World War. In 1929, of the estate, including the castle, was given to the town of Kirkcaldy by the Nairn family as a public park. Ravenscraig Castle was passed into state care in 1955 and has been open to the public by the owners Historic Scotland since 1971.Civic Society Pathhead and Ravenscraig Castle 2002, p.45. It is now managed by Historic Scotland, and is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Celtic punk band The Real McKenzies filmed the video for their song Drink Some More at Ravenscraig Castle. The castle Plan of Ravenscraig Castle Key: A=Postern B=Cellar C=Entrance passage D=Guard room E=Chamber F=Stair down Ravenscraig is a small castle, built on a narrow rocky promontory in the Firth of Forth. It is naturally defended on three sides by steep cliffs dropping to the sea, and the main part of the castle forms the northern, landward, defence. This comprises two D-plan towers, with outer walls thick, designed to withstand cannon fire. Battlements between the towers formed an artillery platform, with gun holes pointing to landward. The whole is defended by a deep, rock-cut ditch, and is accessed via a bridge. The towers The west tower stands to four storeys, and has a single small room on each floor. At the ground floor is a vaulted cellar, with a hall above, accessed via a stone forestair, or outside stairway. A spiral stair links the upper levels, although the timber floors are no longer present. Chimneys rise through the walls to form features of the castle's skyline. The east tower is of three storeys, although its base is set lower into the cliff. A well is located at the lowest level, with a single chamber on each level above, although again the timber floors are missing. The floors are linked by a straight stair within the thickness of the west wall. The rooms of both towers are windowless to landward, due to the thick walls, but have windows with stone seats to the other sides.Lindsay, pp.403-404 Linking building and courtyard The towers are linked by a central block, which contains the main gate and entrance passage. Vaulted cellars and a guard room lie to either side. These vaults support the artillery platform above. The gun holes are of the \\"inverted keyhole\\" type, which became common in the late 15th century. Beyond the main block, only the foundations remain of the buildings on the promontory. Literary inspiration ;Rosabelle by Sir Walter Scott Ravenscraig is the setting for the ballad Rosabelle, sung by Lord St. Clair's bard, Harold, at the wedding feast in the sixth canto of Sir Walter Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel. The ballad tells in elliptical style of 'the lovely Rosabelle', apparently a daughter of the St. Clair (or Sinclair) family, who insists despite dire warnings on setting out by boat from Ravenscraig (called 'Ravensheuch' by Scott) across the Firth of Forth, to attend a ball at the family seat, Roslin Castle, in Midlothian. Rosabelle knows that, as well as her parents, a certain 'Lord Lindesay's heir' will be present. However, that night an eerie light blazes on Roslin Castle and the nearby chapel where Rosabelle's ancestors lie buried, while Rosabelle herself lies drowned. Henry Sinclair I, Earl of Orkney, who built the first Rosslyn castle in the 11th century, was married to a Rosabel.

It is located on the Sone River, the largest of the Ganges' southern tributaries, in Rohtas district. It is framed by the Kaimur mountain range, to the south-east of Sasaram. Banjari has a diverse climate, subtropical in general, with hot summers and cool winters.  Economy  Bihar is a vast stretch of fertile plain. Since Sher Shah Suri introduced the zabt-e-zameen system in the entire region, agricultural activities became the primary support of the economy. The nearest market is Akbarpur market, at a distance of 4 km. Here you can find all the necessities for day-to-day life at affordable prices.  Kalyanpur Cement Limited (KCL)  One of the largest cement manufacturing facilities of the state, Kalyanpur Cements Ltd., located in Banjari, is a leading cement manufacturer of eastern India. It runs the only integrated cement manufacturing facility in Bihar and markets its cement in Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. Kalyanpur, which was established in 1937, markets its cement under the popular KC Super, KC Special and Castcrete brands. Now this factory is owned by Dalmia Cement Group Ltd.  Surya Narayan Dev Mandir  Banjari is situated on the bank of the river Sone. There is a temple known as the \\"Surya Narayan Dev Mandir\\". In front of the temple there are ghats. A fine view of the river can be seen from the ghats. The amalgamation of the naturally-made river and the man-made temple is really awesome. However the temple was made with the help of the local public and Mr. S.R.S Krishnan, president of the Kalyanpur cement company. Since Mr. Krishnan, who was from south India, had a view of a statue in his mind for the temple, and so he ordered the south Indian style statue. The statue of the temple was brought from Varanasi. And this became the symbol of Hindu religion. This temple is steadily gaining in popularity. Now the people come here to make their wishes. The great Chhath Pooja (Worshipping of the Surya Dev) is an ancient and major festival in Bihar, celebrated here during the month of November. The Chaiti Chhath Pooja (April) is also celebrated. During this pooja, people of native land gather here to offer their worship to the god Surya Dev.  Transportation  The Dehri-on-Son and Sasaram railway stations, situated on the Mughal Sarai-Gaya railway route, serve this town. Dehri-on-Sone is the nearest railway station (38 km). There is only mode of transportation that is private Bus service. Banjari is accessible by highway from a recently constructed road, called NH-2C. This was inaugurated by former Lok Sabha speaker SMT Mira Kumar, who was an MP of the constituency.  Communications  Bhojpuri is a major communicable language; Hindi and Magdhi are often heard. This place could be a good example of Hindi-Muslim unity, with a mixed culture. The paddy \\"Dhan\\" is cultivated at large scale... There is a co-ed school, namely Company high school, run by the KCL. The literacy rate is around 50%. A hospital is also run by the KCL. The Post Office Code is 821303, namely Banjari.

The alleged conspiracy, which would have diverted the British war effort, was used to justify the internment of Sinn F√©in leaders, who were actively opposing attempts to introduce conscription in Ireland. The \\"plot\\" originated on 12 April when the British arrested Joseph Dowling after he was put ashore in County Clare by a German U-boat. Dowling had been a member of the Irish Brigade, one of several schemes by Roger Casement to get German assistance for the 1916 Easter Rising. Dowling now claimed that the Germans were planning a military expedition to Ireland. William Reginald Hall and Basil Thomson believed him and convinced the authorities to intern all Sinn F√©in leaders. 150 were arrested on the night of 16‚Äì17 May and taken to prisons in England. The introduction of internment and conscription reflected a decision of the British cabinet to take a harder line on the Irish Question following the failure of the Irish Convention. Paul McMahon characterises the \\"Plot\\" as \\"a striking illustration of the apparent manipulation of intelligence in order to prod the Irish authorities into more forceful action\\". Republicans were tipped off about the impending arrests, allowing some to escape capture while others chose to be taken in order to secure a propaganda victory. The internment was counterproductive for the British, imprisoning the more accommodating Sinn F√©in leadership while failing to capture members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood more committed to physical force republicanism. This allowed Michael Collins to consolidate his control of the organisation and put it on a more focused military footing. Even at the time, the proposition that the Sinn F√©in leadership were directly planning with the German authorities to open another military front in Ireland was largely seen as spurious. Irish nationalists generally view the \\"German Plot\\" not as an intelligence failure but as a black propaganda project to discredit the Sinn F√©in movement, particularly to an uninformed public in the United States. It is still a matter of study and conjecture what impact it had on US foreign policy regarding the 1919 bid for international recognition of the Irish Republic.

History There had been a tradition of bell casting in Gloucester since before the 14th century. The family business was founded by Abraham Rudhall (1657‚Äì1736) who developed a method of tuning bells by turning on a lathe rather than the traditional chipping method with a chisel. One of the earliest ring of bells he cast was for St Nicholas' Church, Oddington in 1684. He came to be described as the greatest bell-founder of his age. The business was continued by his eldest son, also called Abraham (1680‚Äì1735), his son Abel (1714‚Äì60), and three of Abel's sons, Thomas (?1740‚Äì83), Charles (1746‚Äì1815) and John (1760‚Äì1835). In 1815 John Rudhall was declared bankrupt and the bell foundry bought by Mears & Stainbank who owned the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The business formally closed in 1828 but bells bearing John's name have been found with dates up to 1835. () Selected bells Five bells cast in 1702 by Abraham Rudhall I hang in St James the Great, West Hanney, Oxfordshire. A sixth was recast in 1856. In 1706 and 1707 Abraham Rudhall I cast three of the bells of Great Malvern Priory. In 1710 Abraham Rudhall I cast six bells for SS Michael and Wulfad's church in Stone, Staffordshire. In 2012 the four heaviest bells, including the tenor, were re-hung in the church but the other two were replaced by new bells cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The two redundant bells were moved to St Michael's Tower, Gloucester, near to where they were cast. Three of the bells of St Mary Magdalene, Adlestrop were cast by Abraham Rudhall I in 1711. Six of the bells in the Church of St Leonard, Middleton, Greater Manchester were cast by Abraham Rudhall I in 1714. Five of the bells of St Michael and All Angels, Great Torrington were cast by Abraham Rudhal I in 1716. Six of the bells in Pershore Abbey were cast in 1729 by Abraham Rudhall II: a seventh (also 1727) was recast in 1897. Six bells by Abel Rudhall (cast in 1738 and 1753) hang in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. Eight change ringing bells (tenor: in F) at Old North Church in Boston were cast by Abel Rudhall in 1744 and hung in 1745. One bell has the inscription: \\"We are the first ring of bells cast for the British Empire in North America, A.R. 1744.\\" All eight bells from the Church of St Anne, Shandon, an iconic symbol of Cork, Ireland, were cast by Abel Rudhall in 1750. They were recast in 1870. Four of the bells of Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, Cork, were cast by Abel Rudhall in 1751. Five bells cast by Abel Rudhall in 1757 still hang in Wells Cathedral.

The Steyr Valley Railway () was a narrow gauge railway in Upper Austria, which ran along the valley of the River Steyr from Garsten through Steyr, Gr√ºnburg and Molln to Klaus, with a branchline to Sierning and Bad Hall. A section of the line has been retained as a museum railway.  History  The main industries of the Steyr valley were forestry and metalworking. Timber obtained in the area was of a quality useful only for building and firewood or for the charcoal or paper production. Road transport was too expensive, and rail transport was required so the timber could be harvested profitably. In 1868 the Rudolf Railway (Rudolfsbahn) connected the city of Steyr to the railway network. By 1887 the Krems Valley Railway (Kremstalbahn) reached Bad Hall and Klaus. In 1888 Josef Ritter von Wenusch received a concession for a narrow-gauge railway from Garsten to Gr√ºnburg, with a possible extension to Klaus. In the same year the Steyr Valley Railway Company (Steyrtalbahn AG) was created and started building the railway. 1889 saw the opening of the railway to Gr√ºnburg, one year later the line was extended to Agonitz. The extension of the line to Klaus was opposed by the Krems Valley Railway Company (Kremstalbahn AG), who were afraid of losing a part their traffic to the Steyr Valley Railway. The Steyrtalbahn therefore concentrated on building the branch line from Pergern to Bad Hall, which was opened 1891. After the nationalization of the Krems Valley Railway Company in 1902, the extension of the line to Klaus was again taken up. Construction commenced in 1908 and the extension opened in 1909. Thus the Steyr Valley network achieved its largest expansion (55 km). Developments up to 1918 Apart from some early setbacks traffic on the Steyr Valley Railway developed positively. There was an operating surplus and even a modest dividend could always be paid. Growth in the railway was financed by capital increases. Large shareholders in the company included the Steyr armaments company, the Steyr savings bank. and finally also the State of Upper Austria and city of Steyr for construction of the section Agonitz to Klaus. In the First World War the line was important in providing transportation for armament makers between Steyr and Letten. A temporary roll-block wagon transfer system was provided to Letten from 1916 to 1918. Developments up to 1945 The end of the First World War saw economically difficult times began for the Steyr Valley Railway. Motor buses became a serious competitor, with motorbus lines between Steyr and Bad Hall, and Steyr to Gr√ºnburg. Particularly badly hit was the Bad Hall branch, where a connection existed to the Krems Valley Railway, and a majority of the passengers moved to the motorbus. All redevelopment efforts failed and in 1931 the railway was taken over by the Austrian Federal Railways (BB√ñ). The branch line to Bad Hall remained unprofitable under the BB√ñ, and the section Sierning to Bad Hall was closed in 1933 and dismantled at the beginning of the 'forties. After the Anschluss and the incorporation of Austria into Germany, the Steyr Valley Railway became part of the German National Railways (Deutsche Reichsbahn or DR). The Steyr Valley Railway Company was dissolved in 1940, the railway lines became the property of the DR and thus after 1945 the property of the √ñBB. Development after 1945 The Steyr Valley Railway got through the Second World War without damage, nevertheless rebuilding the track was necessary. This was not done however, as there was war damage in other areas to repair first. The light track prevented the employment of the new narrow gauge diesel locomotives (class 2095) which were introduced from 1958, so that the railway continued to operate exclusively with steam engines. Further attempts to reduce costs led in 1967 to the closure of the remaining section of the branch line, while in 1968 road buses replaced passenger trains on the section between Klaus and Molln. On 14 March 1980 a rock slide blocked the line between Leonstein and Haunoldm√ºhle. The next day the line was cleared and services started up again. 14 days later however a commission came to the conclusion that trains could not work the route reliability. As a result, the section Gr√ºnburg to Molln was closed. Two years later the remaining line to Gr√ºnburg was closed.  Locomotives  √ñBB 298.52 at Sommerhuberm√ºhle halt on the Steyr Valley Railway. This particular engine represents the original appearance of the Austrian U-class with Kobel-chimney. For the opening of the line Krauss built three saturated steam 0-6-2T locomotives. Three further locomotives were built in 1914. The locomotives are regarded as the precursors of the famous U class.  Steyrtalbahn after the shutdown  The Austrian Society for Railway History (√ñGEG) took over the line from Steyr to Gr√ºnburg and have operated it since 1985 as museum railway with steam locomotives. Museum operations are on Saturdays and Sundays from the beginning of June to the end of September with special trains at any time. All other remaining railway tracks were dismantled, with much of the route converted to a bicycle path.  References  *Christian Hager, Peter Wegenstein: Steyrtalbahn.

It was closed on February 7, 1990, after the Association for Civil Rights in Israel petitioned the High Court of Justice to shut down the jail because of inhumane conditions there. The IDF closed the facility voluntarily before the High Court could rule on the petition.

Anatot is the site of one of many quarries operated by Israeli companies in the West Bank. Yesh Din legal counsel Michael Sfard said that \\"according to international law, so long as the West Bank is not annexed to Israel, it is forbidden for Israel to exploit the natural resources there for non-security related purposes.\\" Sfard also stated that 74% of the gravel mined from these quarries is used for construction inside Israel, and that that means the existence of the quarries violates international law. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Israeli quarries in the West Bank are legal. Geography Almon is located on a hill near the ruins of the Hariton Monastery and the Prat Stream, between Jerusalem, (Pisgat Ze'ev), and Ma'ale Adumim/Kfar Adumim. It is close to the Palestinian villages 'Anata and Hizma. Transport Almon is connected to Jerusalem and Highway 1 via Road 437.

The road links Anatot to Kfar Adumim, Nofei Prat, and Alon. According to Pinhas Wallerstein, then head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, the road was one of a number under clandestine construction in the area. Wallerstein claimed that as council head, he did not need permission to construct roads, but that he would stop construction if the Israel Defense Forces told him to. He also said \\"What are they going to do, tell us to take the road away? If the road is illegal let them take us to court.\\" Legal status The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory.The settlers' struggle BBC News. 19 December 2003 Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them.

Her work is at the forefront of particle physics today. Biography After graduating from Wellesley College as a physics major in 1971, she received a Fulbright scholarship and studied at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. She received her Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1976 and was a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University from 1976 to 1979. She then joined Rockefeller University in New York City as a Research associate, and was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1980, and Associate Professor in 1982. In 1990, Dolan joined the faculty of the University of North Carolina, Department of Physics and Astronomy, where she now holds the position of University Distinguished Professor. Contributions Dolan is responsible for several important discoveries which have furthered the study of elementary particle physics. She co-authored \\"Symmetry Behavior at Finite Temperature\\", now regularly cited, in 1974.Phys. Rev. D 9, 3320-41 (1974), Symmetry behavior at finite temperature This paper became a part of the foundation of quantitative analysis of phase transitions in the early universe in cosmological theories and is widely recognized as a seminal work. In 1981 she pioneered the uses of affine algebras in particle physics and her coruscant contributions to string theory have included symmetries in the Type II superstring and integrable structures in super conformal non-abelian gauge theories. Her work has revolutionized string theory, and she is considered to be the one of the originators of the field. She is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and has authored over eighty scientific publications. Dolan is also the principal investigator on a Department of Energy grant, which funds the string theory program at Chapel Hill. Teaching Professor Dolan regularly instructs graduate level classes related to quantum mechanics at UNC Chapel Hill. These include Quantum Mechanics I and II, Field Theory, Electromagnetism, and Group Theory.

The term acoustic grating is a more general term that includes operation at audible frequencies. An ultrasonic wave is a sound wave at a frequency greater than 20 kHz. The human ear cannot recognize ultrasonic waves, but animals such as bats and dogs can. Ultrasonic waves can be produced by the Piezo-electric effect and magnetostriction. Mechanism When ultrasonic waves are generated in a liquid in a rectangular vessel, the wave can be reflected from the walls of the vessel. These reflected waves are called echoes. The direct and reflected waves are superimposed, forming a standing wave. The density of the liquid at a node is more than the density at an antinode. Hence, the liquid acts as a diffraction grating to a parallel beam of light passed through the liquid at right angles to the wave. The diffraction grating formed in this way is analogous to a conventional diffraction grating with lines ruled on a glass plate. The less dense antinodes refract light less and are analogous to the transmitting slits of a conventional grating. The denser nodes refract light more and are analogous to the opaque part of a conventional grating. Mathematics The grating element is equal to the wavelength of the ultrasonic waves‚Äîdenoted by d. If \\\\lambda is the wavelength of the light passed through the grating that is diffracted by an angle \\\\theta, then the nth order of the maximum is given by: :d \\\\sin \\\\theta = n \\\\lambda or :d = n \\\\lambda/\\\\sin \\\\theta If v is the velocity of the ultrasonic wave in the liquid we can calculate the velocity of the wave with: :v/ u = n \\\\lambda/\\\\sin \\\\theta or, :v = u n \\\\lambda/\\\\sin \\\\theta where u is the frequency of the wave. Debye-Sears method The Debye-Sears method determines the wavelength of monochromatic light using an acoustic or ultrasonic gratings. This method utilises the concept of piezoelectricity to obtain a grating. The phenomenon of diffraction of light using an ultrasonic grating was first observed by Debye and Sears in 1932. When ultrasonic waves are propagated in a liquid, the density varies from layer to layer due to periodic variation of pressure. This grating can determine the wavelength of monochromatic light and the speed of waves. If \\\\lambda\\\\,! is the wavelength of a monochromatic light source, and \\\\lambda_c\\\\,! is the wavelength of the ultrasonic waves, then applying the principle of diffraction, we get :\\\\lambda_c\\\\sin\\\\theta = n\\\\lambda\\\\,! Where \\\\theta\\\\,! is the angle of diffraction. Thus we can calculate either \\\\lambda\\\\,! or \\\\lambda_c\\\\,! if the other is known. We need not worry about the grating element since the nodes themselves act as slits, hence the distance between two slits are equal to the ultrasonic wave wavelength. This method determines the velocity of ultrasonic waves using monochromatic sources like sodium vapour lamps. The medium is usually a piezoelectric crystal such as quartz, tourmaline, or Rochelle salt. A mechanical stress is produced along an axis of the crystal using an RF oscillator. By adjusting the frequency of the oscillator, we can determine the velocity v_c\\\\,! of the ultrasonic waves by using : v_c = \\\\eta \\\\lambda_c\\\\,! where \\\\eta\\\\,! is the frequency of the oscillator.

Through the sales of Phospho-Energon, the emerging Swedish pharmaceutical company Pharmacia (founded in 1911 out of the Elgen pharmacy in central Stockholm) was able to establish itself on the market. With the incomes generated by the Energon sales Pharmacia was able to initiate pharmaceutical research and the production of other medicines, eventually becoming a major actor in the Swedish and international pharmaceutical sectors. The main ingredients of Energon were calf's brain, sugar and milk. Initially, the drug was sold as a powder to be mixed with liquid, but later pills were produced.

Its equipment can be found on many of the world's leading sail racing yachts, including the majority of competitors for competitions such as the America's Cup and the Volvo Ocean Race.  History  The company was founded in 1956 by Major R.N. Gatehouse and Ronald Brookes who had formed a partnership the previous year to develop and manufacture a new radio direction finder (RDF) for use by private sailing boats. In 1956 the 'Homer' receiver was produced, said to be the first transistorised RDF to be made available to the world's leisure marine market. Over the course of the 1950s, B&G;, then based in Lymington on the south coast of England, extended its activities into echo sounders and in 1960 produced its first speedometer. In 1966 the ketch Gypsy Moth IV, the yacht which earned Sir Francis Chichester his single-handed circumnavigation record, was equipped with a full suite of B&G; instruments. In the 1970s and 1980s the company continued to rapidly innovate, receiving in 1981 a Design Council Award for its Hercules electronic data system, which effectively introduced computers to leisure boating, and continues to do so to this day, remaining the market leader in advanced instrumentation systems for grand prix racing yachts and sailing superyachts, as well as for club racers and blue water cruising yachts. The company has changed hands a number of times during its lifetime, and is now a brand of Navico, the Norwegian-based leader in the marine electronics sector. B&G; however remains headquartered just a few miles from its birthplace, in Hampshire, UK. As of 2013, B&G; Production has moved to Mexico and the Romsey production facility has closed.  Products  B&G; is primarily known for producing integrated sailing instrumentation systems that collect and analyse a wide range of data relating both to a yacht's performance and the external conditions in which it is sailing. This information can then be displayed to the helmsman, navigator and crew and/or analysed by integral data processing functions to produce additional information flows that enable the yacht's crew to make informed decisions with regard to performance optimisation, navigation strategy, safety and tactics. Data that is collected may include apparent wind speed, apparent wind angle, boat speed, heading, position (Latitude/Longitude) and depth. By combining and analysing these inputs a B&G; system can calculate and display in real time information such as true wind speed, true wind direction, course over ground, Velocity made good, time and distance to next waypoint, and much more. This data can additionally be fed into tactical navigation software such as B&G;'s proprietary Deckman system and analysed against tidal and current databases, electronic charting and weather prediction feeds to enable the navigator to devise the fastest and most efficient route between two or more points. This information can also be fed into autopilot systems. Alongside instrumentation, B&G; also designs and manufactures autopilots for sailing yachts. Their autopilots have been used by many short-handed racers, including Dame Ellen MacArthur (during her single-handed circumnavigation race on Kingfisher in the 2000-01 Vend√©e Globe and her outright single-handed circumnavigation record on Castorama/B&Q;), Fran√ßois Gabart (winner of the 2012 Vend√©e Globe on the IMOCA 60 Macif), Armel Le Cl√©ac'h (1st Vend√©e Globe 2016, 2nd Vend√©e Globe 2012 - IMOCA 60, Banque Populaire) and Alex Thomson (2nd Vend√©e Globe 2016, 3rd Vend√©e Globe 2012 - IMOCA 60, Hugo Boss).

The district was developed to take advantage of the Hagerstown and Frederick Railway, which paralleled what was then known as the National Pike, and is an example of a small-scale streetcar suburb. The subdivision was subdivided from the Kefauver farm and included a trolley stop in front of developer Lewis Kefauver's house. The trolley right-of-way is still visible in the deep setback between the street and the sidewalk in the front yards of houses on the north side of the street. The subdivision's location in a then-rural setting view with its expansive views made the suburb attractive for retiring farmers.

The survey is composed of physical examinations by the doctor's senses and simple medical devices, which build clinical findings. If necessary, the results are proofed by further diagnostic tests, which may include procedures using medical apparatus. As the findings relate to the intersubjective occurrences diagnosed by the doctor, they will be differentiated from the sum of subjective data in the patient's medical history. Definition Using for example the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIT), a finding is a Clinical, Laboratory or Molecular evidence (or absence of evidence) of a disease. Types of findings The documentation of medical findings can differ between: *quantitative evidence, e.g. \\"the cholesterol level is 220 mmol/L\\" *qualitative evidence, e.g. \\"the consciousness is clouded\\" Out of a combination of these extracted medical findings, a doctor can deduce their diagnosis, whereby they ascribe an affliction to the patient. Medical findings that do not match these diagnoses will be labeled auxiliary medical findings, whose symptoms can illustrate other afflictions. According to the nature of the finding they can be classified into: * Clinical: When they are related to the patient's medical signs and symptoms evolution * Physiological: When they are related to an intermediate biological biomarker * Pathological or histopathological: When they are related to the physical damage produced by the disease Psychological findings would be more a medical sign than a finding, except when they are supported by a test. Findings can appear during a targeted medical test or unexpectedly during an unrelated exploration. Findings and symptoms Although the difference is not clear in everyday parlance, medical findings and symptoms are completely delineated: during the process of confirming a medical finding the empirical character (those that can be found) of the collected medical characteristics is brought out, highlighting symptom of an affliction. Acquiring medical findings is one of the main duties of a doctor.

OECD and soft law Unlike many other inter-governmental organizations like the United Nations or the European Commission, the OECD cannot legislate or enforce laws and lacks the power to coerce a country, member or not, to alter its policy. However, it can have an influence on national policies through soft laws, by issuing \\"recommendations\\", \\"guidelines\\" and other \\"manuals\\", to which countries or companies can refer. Some of these guidelines have become de facto standards, such as the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals or the OECD Model Tax Convention. Also, negotiations and agreements between representatives of member countries can occur at the OECD and have direct consequences in national laws. OECD and taxation=Tax havens The OECD and its Financial Action Task Force regularly publish the list of uncooperative tax havens. The FATF blacklist was the common shorthand description for the Financial Action Task Force list of \\"Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories\\" (NCCTs). The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant and arguably has been more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While under international law, the FATF Blacklist carries with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often finds itself under intense financial pressure. As a result of the FATF 40+8 Recommendations (among other initiatives), most countries now require their banks to report certain suspicious financial activities to the appropriate financial regulators and law enforcement authorities. (In the United States, they are called Suspicious Activity Reports.) Most larger countries with significant financial centres consider transactions coming from or transferring to a jurisdiction on the FATF Blacklist to be a suspicious activity, which automatically triggers closer regulatory scrutiny (and considerably more paperwork on the bank's part). Thus, many major financial institutions will not conduct business with counterparts based in NCCTs. Since many of the countries that FATF originally listed as NCCTs have major financial industries (Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein), such de facto boycotts could have a significant effect on a country's economy (or at least a politically powerful sector of the economy). Pro-tax lobbying Some observers, such as the American conservative FreedomWorks foundation, argue that the OECD is lobbying for more taxes. In book series such as its Economic Survey of countries, OECD analysts advise countries on their policies including tax. Such groups also remark that the OECD is funded by tax money. Multi-lateral Agreement on Investment The Multilateral Agreement on Investment was negotiated at the OECD between 1995 and 1998. While the discussion was not secret, it had little public awareness until a draft report was leaked in 1997. That had led to massive outcry and an intensive campaign against it. Eventually, countries gave in and cancelled the agreement.

It is the archetype of the foug√®rite group in the larger hydrotalcite supergroup of naturally occurring layered double hydroxides.Mills, S.J., Christy, A.G., G√©nin J.-M.R., Kameda, T. and Colombo, F. 2012: Nomenclature of the hydrotalcite supergroup: natural layered double hydroxides, Mineralogical Magazine, 76, 1289-1336. The structure is based on brucite-like layers containing Fe2+ and Fe3+ cations, O2‚àí and OH‚àí anions, with loosely bound [CO3]2‚àí groups and H2O molecules between the layers. Foug√®rite crystallizes in trigonal system. The ideal formula for foug√®rite is [Fe2+4Fe3+2(OH)12][CO3]¬∑3H2O. Higher degrees of oxidation produce the other members of the foug√®rite group, namely tr√©beurdenite, [Fe2+2Fe3+4O2(OH)10][CO3]¬∑3H2O and m√∂ssbauerite, [Fe3+6O4(OH)8][CO3]¬∑3H2O.

In this environment, it is intimately intergrown with tr√©beurdenite, to give varying overall ratios of Fe2+:Fe3+. The existence of two intergrown fixed-composition phases has been demonstrated by M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy.

Biography His father was a maker of socks and stockings.Brief biography @ A Arte em Portugal. He was originally meant to pursue an ecclesiastical career, but when he displayed an aptitude for art, his parents changed their plans. Word of his talents reached Carnide, where some gentlemen who operated a literary academy asked to meet him. During his presentation to them, he met a girl named In√™s Helena de Lima e Melo, who would become his lifelong passion.Dicion√°rio Hist√≥rico Portugu√™s Volume VII, pgs. 459-460, published 1904-1915, ed. by Jo√£o Romano Torres. The Three Fates (late 1720s) Meanwhile, he had begun his studies, probably with Andr√© Gon√ßalves. His work came to the attention of the Marquis of Fontes, who had recently been appointed Ambassador to Rome. The Marquis offered to take Vieira with him, so he could continue his studies there, and his family accepted the offer. Once there, aged only thirteen, he was apprenticed to Benedetto Luti, who immediately set him to studying and copying the frescoes in the Farnese Gallery. Meanwhile, the Marquis directed him to paint religious ceremonies, ornaments at the Basilica of Saint Peter, fixtures at the Portuguese Embassy and even the Marquis' own carriage. When it came time for the Marquis to return home, he wanted to take Vieira with him, but relented when Vieira begged to remain. He was allowed to stay for two more years and studied with Francesco Trevisani. Saint Augustine (1770) Marriage and its aftermath Returning home after seven years, he was commissioned by King John V to paint a large \\"Blessed Sacrament\\" for the Corpus Christi procession. His relationship with In√™s was not going well, however, as her parents felt that he was of inferior social status and they would not consent to the marriage. Despite this, they arranged a marriage by proxy. When her parents found out, they took her to a convent and forced her to take vows. Vieira tried to gain her release but, failing that, decided to appeal to the Pope himself. He remained in Rome for five years, pressing his petitions and continuing to paint. Finally acknowledging defeat, he returned to Lisbon in 1728. Somehow, he arranged to have male clothing smuggled in to In√™s so, dressed as a man, she simply walked out of the convent. When it was discovered that she was missing, her relatives hired a hooligan to avenge their honor. Vieira was shot as he walked down the street and seriously injured. When he recovered, he sought justice from King John V, but his wife's family was influential and the would-be assassin was allowed to flee the country. Fearing for his safety, Vieira entered the Paulist convent then, in 1732, went to Seville, to work for King Philip V. Court Painter Upon his return to Lisbon the following year, he was named Court Painter and retained that position under King Joseph I. In 1744, he was appointed Knight of the Order of Saint James of the Sword. During his tenure with the court, he painted portraits of the royal family, and worked prolifically at numerous public buildings and churches. Many of those works were destroyed in the earthquake of 1755. In 1775, his beloved In√™s died. Stricken with grief, he gave up painting and entered the Convento do Beato, where he remained until his death. While there, he composed a long poem in lyrical cantos called O insigne pintor e leal esposo, hist√≥ria verdadeira... (Illustrious painter and loyal husband, a true story). It was printed in 1780.Publisher information and image of cover @ Archive.org That same year, he accepted a largely honorary appointment as Director of the \\"Nude Academy\\" (later, the \\"Royal Academy of Fine Arts\\").Brief biography @ Ensina.

Background CIA WFB map of Mauritania General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was one of the leading figures in the August 2005 coup that ended Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's 21 years in power. Aziz backed Abdallahi's candidacy in the subsequent March 2007 presidential election, which Abdallahi won. Abdallahi soon angered General Aziz and his supporters, however, by reaching out to Islamic hardliners, by freeing several suspected terrorists, and by using state funds to build a mosque on the grounds of the presidential palace. In May 2008, Abdallahi appointed 12 ministers who had been part of President Taya's former government, some of whom had been accused of corruption. This, together with the inclusion of members of opposition parties in the government (headed by Prime Minister Yahya Ould Ahmed El Waghef) and the government's failure to present a programme, led many members of the pro-Abdallahi National Pact for Democracy and Development (PNDD-ADIL) party in the National Assembly to file a censure motion against the government on June 30, 2008. The government resigned on July 2 before a no-confidence vote was held, and Abdallahi immediately reappointed Waghef to form a new government.\\"Mauritanian government quits before voting on censure motion\\" , AFP, July 3, 2008. The government that was announced on July 15 included no members of the opposition; it also excluded the former associates of Taya whose presence in the previous government had attracted criticism.\\"Formation d'un gouvernement sans les partis de l'opposition\\", AFP (Jeuneafrique.com), July 16, 2008 . On August 4, 2008, 25 of the 49 PNDD-ADIL deputies in the National Assembly, along with 24 of the party's 45 senators, announced that they were leaving the party, thereby depriving it of its parliamentary majority.\\"Le parti au pouvoir en Mauritanie perd sa majorit√© au parlement\\" , African Press Agency, August 4, 2008 . The immediate catalyst for the coup was Abdallahi's announcement on the morning of August 6 that he was firing several generals, including Aziz (who had been the head of the presidential guard) and army chief of staff General Mohamed Ould Sheikh Mohamed. Mauritania has experienced more than 10 coups or attempted coups since achieving its independence from France in 1960. Details of the coup President Abdallahi General Aziz Early in the morning of August 6, Abdallahi announced that he was firing several senior army officers, and at 9:20 a.m. he was seized from his home by members of the Presidential Security Battalion (BASEP for Bataillon de la s√©curit√© pr√©sidentielle) in a military coup. Presidential spokesman Abdoulaye Mamadou Ba said in a statement that President Abdallahi, Prime Minister Waghef, and Interior Minister Mohamed Ould R'zeizim had been arrested by renegade senior army officers, unknown troops, and a group of generals, and were being held under house arrest at the Presidential Palace in Nouakchott. Of the apparently successful and bloodless coup d'√©tat, Abdallahi's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi said: \\"The security agents of the BASEP came to our home and took away my father.\\" The coup plotters were recently fired senior officers in the security forces, including General Abdel Aziz, General Muhammad Ould Al- Ghazwani, General Philippe Swikri, and Brigadier General (Aqid) Ahmad Ould Bakri. State television reported that the country was now being led by a new military State Council, which would be run by Abdel Aziz. The State Council said that Abdallahi was now the \\"former president.\\" General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz issued a statement on the al-Arabiya international television station and issued what he called, \\"communiqu√© No. 1\\" which reversed the \\"former president's\\" firing of the military officers. Al-Aziz was also reportedly holding talks with the President of the Mauritanian National Assembly, Messaoud Ould Boulkheir, on the feasibility of holding potential new elections in two months. Police reportedly fired tear gas at about 50 people who had gathered near the main market of Nouakchott. Otherwise, the city remained calm. All state television and radio stations in Nouakchott reportedly ceased broadcasting as the coup began. The Nouakchott International Airport was also closed. Aftermath of the coup=August According to an official statement released on August 7, Abdallahi's powers were terminated and Mauritania would be governed on a transitional basis by an 11-member High Council of State, with Abdel Aziz as the President of the Council, until a new presidential election was held \\"in the shortest possible period\\". The Council promised that this election would be \\"free and transparent\\" and that it would consult with the national institutions, the political class, and civil society. Furthermore, the Council gave an assurance that it would \\"respect all treaties, international agreements and conventions to which Mauritania has subscribed\\". The members of the Council were listed as:\\"Le Haut Conseil d'Etat rend public un nouveau communiqu√©\\", AMI, August 7, 2008 . * General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz (President of the Council) * General Mohamed ould Cheikh Mohamed Ahmed * General Felix Negr√© * Colonel Ahmed Ould Bekrine * Colonel Mohamed ould Cheikh Ould El Hadi * Colonel Ghoulam ould Mahmoud * Colonel Mohamed Ould Meguet * Colonel Mohamed ould Mohamed Znagui * Colonel Dia Adama Oumar * Colonel Hanena Ould Sidi * Colonel Ahmedou Bemba Ould Baye A demonstration in support of the coup was held in Nouakchott on August 7. About 1,000 people participated in this demonstration, chanting Abdel Aziz's name and marching towards the presidential palace, accompanied by vehicles carrying large portraits of Abdel Aziz. At the presidential palace, Abdel Aziz spoke to the demonstrators, saying that he would \\"work to solve all the problems this country is confronted with\\". A protest against the coup was also held later on the same day in Nouakchott. According to PNDD-ADIL Secretary-General Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Dahmane, this was a peaceful protest in which 200 to 300 people participated, carrying portraits of Abdallahi, and was broken up by police with tear gas. Dahmane also called for Abdallahi's release, saying that he was the legitimate president, and said that the PNDD-ADIL had formed an alliance with three other parties in opposition to the coup:\\"Mauritania police break up anti-coup rally\\", AFP, August 7, 2008. the Popular Progressive Alliance (APP), the Union of the Forces of Progress (UFP), and an Islamic party.\\"Mauritanian parliament opens special session\\" , AFP, August 20, 2008. The High Council of State released a second statement on August 7, saying that the junta wanted to preserve the constitution and democratic institutions, interfering with the functioning of those institutions as little as possible. According to this statement, the Council would collectively exercise the powers of the presidency and a government would be appointed. The Council also said that political parties and legal organizations would be allowed to operate freely, that freedoms, including the freedom of the press, would be respected, and that municipal councils could continue to function normally.\\"Le Haut Conseil d'Etat rend public un nouveau communiqu√©\\", AMI, August 7, 2008 . Abdel Aziz also gave these assurances regarding freedoms and the continuity of democratic institutions, such as Parliament, in a meeting with Arab League Assistant Secretary-General Ahmed bin Heli. The four-party alliance opposing the coup, called the National Front for the Defence of Democracy, held a press conference on August 8, and this developed into a protest rally against the coup in the Tevragh Zeina section of Nouakchott, with several hundred people participating. This rally included calls for the soldiers to return to their barracks and for the international community to pressure the junta. APP spokesman Alkhalil Ould Teyib vowed that they would continue their struggle until Abdallahi was restored to the presidency. The National Front for the Defence of Democracy also announced plans for more demonstrations and activities opposing the coup, while also stating that they would only hold protests with the junta's permission.\\"Hundreds attend anti-coup rally in Mauritania\\" , AFP, August 8, 2008. Also on August 8, Abdallahi's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, said that she had not been informed of Abdallahi's whereabouts, and she expressed concern for Abdallahi's \\"health and safety\\". Meanwhile, Abdel Aziz said in an interview with Jeune Afrique that the military had been forced to take power by serious economic and political problems. He accused Abdallahi of attempting a \\"coup against democracy\\" through his actions; according to Abdel Aziz, Abdallahi had set members of parliament against one another and his dismissal of the senior officers immediately prior to the coup was intended to \\"divide the army\\". Abdel Aziz also said that Abdallahi was being held at the Palace of the Congress, was \\"in good conditions\\", had not complained, and would be released in a matter of days or weeks. According to Abdel Aziz, Abdallahi would probably not be required to leave Mauritania and would probably still be allowed to participate in politics.Marianne Meunier, \\"Exclusif : interview de Mohamed Ould Abdelaziz\\" , Jeuneafrique.com, August 8, 2008 (Jeune Afrique 2483‚Äì2484, August 10, 2008) . However, Abdel Aziz was quoted in an interview with Asharq al-Awsat published on August 9 as saying Abdallahi would not be released for \\"the time being\\", citing \\"security reasons\\"; he said that the junta was trying to establish an atmosphere of calm. In an interview with Agence France-Presse on August 10, Abdel Aziz said that the coup was necessary to prevent \\"a catastrophe\\"; he said that Abdallahi had \\"acted irrationally\\", and in another interview with Al Jazeera he said that he had warned Abdallahi immediately prior to the coup that his decision to dismiss the senior officers could have serious consequences.\\"Mauritanian general defends coup despite international pressure\\" , AFP, August 10, 2008. According to Abdel Aziz, Abdallahi did not heed the warning, and as a result Abdel Aziz ordered the coup. Abdel Aziz also criticized Abdallahi for releasing Islamic extremists from prison and allowing the Islamist Tawassoul party to join Waghef's government in May; he asserted that this was \\"irresponsible\\" and did not reflect Mauritania's identity as a \\"moderate Muslim country\\".\\"Mauritania coup chief won't rule out election run\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), August 10, 2008. Furthermore, he expressed his view that the international community would change its negative attitude toward the coup \\"when it has all the information\\". Also on August 10, Abdel Aziz did not exclude the possibility that he or other members of the junta could run for President, although he said that the issue had not been decided and that other things needed to be dealt with first. His acknowledgement of the possibility was in contrast to the decision of the previous junta in 2005 to exclude its members from running for office. Messoud Ould Boulkheir, the President of the National Assembly, said on August 10 that he still recognized Abdallahi as President and rejected the idea of a new election held under the junta. However, 67 of the 95 deputies in the National Assembly released a statement supporting the coup and describing it as \\"the logical and indisputable result of President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi's behaviour to stall the republic's institutions\\". Meanwhile, Abdallahi's daughter said that the military had been involving itself in politics for two and a half months, and the PNDD-ADIL announced on August 10 that the junta had allowed it to reopen its offices. Waghef and three other high-ranking officials (including the Interior Minister) were released by the military on August 11, while Abdallahi remained in custody.\\"Mauritania coup leaders free prime minister\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), August 11, 2008. A few hours later, Waghef spoke before a rally of thousands of people and expressed defiance toward the junta, saying that Mauritanians did not accept its rule and urging the people to continue struggling to restore Abdallahi to power. He said that Abdallahi thanked them for their \\"untiring fight ... to restore constitutional order\\". Arab League Assistant Secretary- General Ahmed bin Heli said on August 11, after returning from Mauritania, that he had asked to meet with Abdallahi but was not allowed to do so. In a statement on August 12, the High Council of State outlined its powers, confirming that it would have \\"the necessary powers to reorganise and manage state affairs during the period needed for the organising of presidential elections ... in the shortest possible time.\\" It also confirmed that the Council would collectively exercise presidential powers and that the Council's President would be able to appoint a Prime Minister.\\"Mauritanian junta issues decree specifying powers\\", AFP, August 12, 2008. The Rally of Democratic Forces (RFD), which was the main opposition party under Abdallahi, supported the coup; its leader, Ahmed Ould Daddah (who was defeated by Abdallahi in the 2007 presidential election), told Al Jazeera on August 12 that the coup was \\"a movement to rectify the democratic process\\". Abdel Aziz met with political parties to discuss the formation of a new government. The APP said that it would not participate in this government, but the RFD said that it intended to \\"study the offer\\".\\"Mauritania coup leader in talks to form new government\\" , AFP, August 13, 2008. 106 of the 151 members of both houses of Parliament\\"Mauritanian junta names new PM\\" , AFP, August 14, 2008.\\"106 parlementaires mauritaniens d√©clarent leur soutien au mouvement de rectification\\", AMI, August 13, 2008. (67 out of 95 deputies and 39 out of 56 senators) said in a statement on August 13 that they supported the coup. According to this statement, the coup occurred \\"in the context of an acute political and institutional crisis\\" and Abdallahi \\"only listened to sycophants\\". The statement also urged international support. Aside from the members of Parliament, 191 out of 216 mayors also supported the coup.\\"Mauritania deputies consider trial for ousted president\\" , AFP, August 15, 2008.

Laghdaf was already closely associated with Abdel Aziz, and some suggested that he might have been appointed in hopes that doing so would help international relations due to Laghdaf's diplomatic service in the European Union. Waghef said at a news conference on the same day that this appointment was \\"illegal\\" and that the government he had headed was still the legitimate government. It was reported on August 15 that 71 out of 95 deputies were in favor of holding an extraordinary session of Parliament on August 20, with the intention of appointing members to a special court; this could in turn lead to a trial of Abdallahi and some of the ministers who had served under him for alleged mishandling of state affairs. On August 16, a group of 19 members of Parliament‚Äîthree senators and 16 deputies‚Äîannounced that it was seeking the restoration of Abdallahi to the presidency. According to Mohamed Moustapha Ould Bedredine, a deputy who spoke on the group's behalf, the group had more support than their numbers suggested.\\"Lawmakers launch effort to restore ousted Mauritanian leader\\", AFP, August 16, 2008. Abdel Aziz made his first broadcast to the nation on August 17. He affirmed that a new presidential election would be held \\"as soon as possible\\", but he did not give a specific date. In this speech, Abdel Aziz promised to fight hard against terrorism and corruption; he also accused Abdallahi of failing to act against corruption and said that Abdallahi had handled the economy very poorly. On the same day, 26 members of Parliament who supported the coup announced their resignations from the PNDD-ADIL party.\\"Mauritania coup leader vows quick presidential poll\\" , AFP, August 17, 2008.

According to PRDR leader Sidi Mohamed Ould Mohamed Vall, this was \\"dictated by the necessity to preserve the stability of the country and its democratic institutions\\", and he described the coup as \\"vital for Mauritania and for the maintenance of its democracy and its pluralism\\".

The special session of Parliament included the creation of a Senate inquiry commission intended to investigate the finances of KB charitable foundation, which was headed by Abdallahi's wife, Khattou Mint Boukhary; Boukhary was a controversial figure who had been criticized by the opposition prior to the coup. On August 24, the foundation's lawyers urged the creation of international commission to investigation its finances, arguing that the Senate commission would not be fair. The lawyers said that the Senate commission's \\"subjective results will always be contested\\". Jean Ping, the Chairman of the Commission of the African Union, met with Abdel Aziz in Nouakchott on August 25. Ping said that he was in Mauritania to discuss restoring a constitutional government, not to discuss the junta's transition, and he expressed optimism after meeting Abdel Aziz.\\"Al-Qaeda denounces Mauritania's 'infidel' military junta: report\\", AFP, August 25, 2008.

The police then responded with tear gas, breaking up the protest. Subsequently the protesters attempted smaller gatherings at various places in Nouakchott, and the police worked to disperse these as well.

Whereas a loop has a distinguished point on it, called a basepoint, a free loop lacks such a distinguished point. Formally, let X be a topological space. Then a free loop in X is an equivalence class of continuous functions from the circle S^1 to X. Two loops are equivalent if they differ by a reparameterization of the circle. That is, f \\\\sim g if there exists a homeomorphism \\\\psi : S^1 \\\\rightarrow S^1 such that g = f\\\\circ\\\\psi. Thus, a free loop, as opposed to a based loop used in the definition of the fundamental group, is a map from the circle to the space without the basepoint-preserving restriction. Free homotopy classes of free loops correspond to conjugacy classes in the fundamental group. Recently, interest in the space of all free loops LX has grown with the advent of string topology, i.e. the study of new algebraic structures on the homology of the free loop space.

W.29:1 to 9-1932 Henry VIII's writing desk is a portable writing desk, made in about 1525-26 for Henry VIII. It is currently in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The desk is a product of the royal workshops and is lavishly embellished with ornamental motifs introduced to the Kingdom of England by continental artists. The gilded leather lining is painted with figures and profile heads that are close in style to contemporary portrait miniatures, while the figures of Mars in armour and Venus with cupid are taken from woodcuts by the German artist Hans Burgkmair (1473-1531), which were published in 1510. The desk also bears the coat of arms and personal badges of Henry and his first queen Catherine of Aragon. Such images conveyed powerful messages of allegiance and were used extensively in the decorative schemes of Henry VIII's royal palaces. The Latin inscription on the inner lid reads 'God of Kingdoms great Protector of the authority of the Christian Church give to your servant Henry VIII King of England a great victory over his enemies'. The exterior of the desk is covered with shagreen (possibly sharkskin) and fitted with metal-gilt angle-mounts, loop handles and ball feet, all added during the 18th century. The interior surfaces of the compartments are lined with red silk velvet, probably added during the 19th century.

In 2014, it was announced that the bus station on Endless Street, Salisbury, would close in favour of town centre stops. The station had opened in 1939 as the headquarters of Wilts & Dorset. 2012: rebranding In July 2012 it was announced that the Wilts & Dorset name would be dropped from bus services in favour of the morebus brand in Poole and Bournemouth, and Salisbury Reds in Salisbury and Amesbury.  Poole and Bournemouth operations (morebus) = morebus  Wright Eclipse bodied Volvo B7RLE in the first 'more' livery in Bournemouth in July 2009 The new order on more m1 and m2 routes Alexander Dennis Enviro200 MMC Morebus operates bus services in the Poole and Bournemouth areas formerly under the Wilts & Dorset name. The brand was launched in December 2004 as a premium service replacing routes 101 to 105 between Poole, Bournemouth, and Christchurch, and routes 155, 156, and 157 between Poole and Canford Heath. The service launched with 30 Wright Eclipse bodied Volvo B7RLE single-deck buses. The buses carried a livery of mostly dark blue with red at the back; the original 30 also carried slogans such as \\"looks like a bus, works like a dream\\". Such was the success of the 'more' services, the frequency on the m1 and m2 routes was increased and the m1 extended to the Castlepoint shopping centre on the outskirts of Bournemouth from Bournemouth railway station. With only 30 'more' branded buses in the fleet at the time, the 'more' branded routes to Canford Heath were discontinued, with the 'm' dropped from the route number and standard liveried vehicles used. For these routes to become 'more' routes again, a batch of Mercedes-Benz Citaros were ordered. The original 'more' buses were going to be Citaros, but it had been thought that Volvo would offer a quicker delivery time. Further changes to the routes occurred on 25 May 2008, with the m2 being withdrawn from Burton (transferred to Route X12 which was later withdrawn also) and Somerford to terminate at Boscombe. During 2010, the 'more' brand was refreshed with every bus being repainted in a slightly brighter, simpler version of the previous livery, each highlighting a good reason for using the 'more' buses; for example \\"morefrequent\\" was applied to Wright Volvo Eclipse 119 (now 2219) HF54 HGM. In May 2011, routes m5 and m6 were once again dropped from the 'more' brand and renumbered as routes 5 and 6. In June 2012, Wilts & Dorset announced a ¬£5.5 million investment in 36 Wright Eclipse bodied Volvo buses to be used on the m1 and m2 routes whilst the previous 38 Volvos and Citaros would be cascaded onto other services, replacing older buses. Also at this time, routes 8 and 9 became part of the 'more' brand. Nightbus On 30 May 2008, the more 'Nightbus' sub-brand launched with m1 operating every half-hour between Poole Bus Station and Charminster (Five Ways), and m2 operating every half-hour between Bournemouth Square and Iford Roundabout on Friday and Saturday nights. During June 2010, the m1 nightbus was extended beyond the Five Ways to the Broadway Tavern, a few minutes up Charminster Road. May 2011 saw the m2 nightbus route changed beyond Pokesdown to serve Southbourne (Fisherman's Walk). In June 2012, a new nightbus route, the N3, was launched connecting Bournemouth to Bournemouth University. Also, all three services started operating on Thursday nights in addition to Friday and Saturday nights. February 2013 saw the withdrawal of the Thursday nightbus services, along with the N3 route. University services East Lancs Myllennium Vyking bodied Volvo B7TL in the previous Unilinx livery in June 2005 Morebus operates four routes on behalf of Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth. During the summer of 2016, the services were rebranded as 'Unibus', with new Alexander Dennis Enviro 400 MMC's arriving in a new livery, all with different colour schemes. These buses have WiFi and USB chargers on board, which passengers can use at no extra cost. A new route 17 was also launched, which connects the university with Bournemouth and Poole via the railway stations. From 2004, when the university contract was transferred to Wilts & Dorset from Yellow Buses, until the end of 2009, services were branded as Unilinx and operated by a mixed fleet of double-deck buses (Optare Spectras and brand-new Volvo B7TL ELC Myllennium Vyking convertibles) painted in a modified version of the 'more' livery. Unilinx- branded buses were also a common sight on non-Unilinx services, especially on service 152 (later the 52) where ELC Myllennium Vyking buses ran open-top throughout the summer. In 2009, when the university contract was renewed, eight buses (of which six were Scania Enviro 400 double deckers) were used on the U1, U2 and U4 routes, with a Scania Solar single deck bus on the U3 route. These were purchased new, while an ex-London articulated Mercedes-Benz Citaro bus was introduced to route U1 on 10 January 2010, primarily running a shuttle service to boost capacity between Talbot Campus and the student residences at Lansdowne. It was believed to be the first such bus in service on the South Coast, and initially had its route number and destination blinds as part of its livery (including a misspelling of 'Cranborne' as 'Cranbourne') as this bus was used exclusively between Talbot Campus and Cranborne House. From January 2010, these routes were branded as 'The Bus for Bournemouth University' or 'The Bus for BU', with buses appearing in the institution's primary corporate colours of white and pink. For the 2012‚Äì2013 academic year, a second articulated bus was acquired. The New Forest Tour East Lancs Myllennium Vyking bodied Volvo B7TL ELC Vyking in New Forest Tour livery in Southampton in May 2009 Circular tourist routes in the New Forest using open- top buses are operated jointly by Bluestar and Wilts & Dorset. Purbeck Breezer An open-top MCV EvoSeti branded for More Bus' route 50, from Bournemouth to Swanage More operates three all-year services under the Purbeck Breezer brand, with service 40 going from Poole to Swanage via Wareham and Corfe Castle, service 50 being an open-top service that runs from Bournemouth railway station to Swanage via the Sandbanks Ferry and service 60 going from Poole to Sandbanks via Canford Cliffs and Lilliput. These services run more frequently in the summer, with summer only services, that, as of 2017, include service 30 from Swanage to Weymouth (and one trip each way to/from Dorchester) and service 70, that goes from Bournemouth to Poole via Canford Cliffs and Alum Chine.

It runs four times an hour Monday to Saturday. The service differs from the old service 132 by taking a direct route between Poole and Broadstone, using a faster route through Merley, and extending the service from Wimborne Square to the Leigh Park estate. The service, when launched, was almost exclusively operated by Mercedes-Benz Citaros in the new standard Wilts & Dorset livery, though 'more' Citaros and Wright Eclipse Urbans were also seen. Local residents criticised the change of route, specifically through Merley where the buses took a narrower but more direct road through the estate. Some criticism has also been aimed at the Citaro buses after a number of accidents, including buses demolishing walls while trying to pass each other on a narrow roadAccident fears after bus smash Bournemouth Daily Echo ‚Äì 28 September 2006 and tearing hanging baskets from walls in Wimborne Square while turning.Outcry after bus collision Bournemouth Daily Echo ‚Äì 29 June 2006 Following numerous complaints, Wilts & Dorset rerouted the service through Merley from 29 October 2006, reverting to part of the old 132 route through Merley Gardens.U-turn on bus route Bournemouth Daily Echo ‚Äì 2 October 2006 From 6 April 2008, two out of the four buses per hour started to run via Corfe Mullen rather than Merley with all services also stopping at Broadstone Broadway. Services to and from Leigh Park only run during the morning and evening peak. With the Wimborne Flyer now covering the section of route between Broadstone and Corfe Mullen, most service 4 journeys started to terminate at Broadstone. As part of the 3 June 2012 network changes, the 3 was withdrawn and was merged with Route 4, which was extended beyond Broadstone to Wimborne either via Merley or Corfe Mullen. After many complaints, Route 4X was introduced between Poole & Broadstone/Merley via the old Route 3 during the morning and evening rush- hours towards the end of June 2012. Towards the end of July 2012 however, it was announced that Route 3 would be re-instated from 17 September 2012 and that both routes 3 & 4 would join the more brand.  Salisbury and Amesbury operations (Salisbury Reds) = Salisbury Reds  Mercedes-Benz Citaro with the previous \\"Pulseline\\" branding in Salisbury in July 2009 Salisbury Reds operates bus services in the Salisbury and Amesbury areas formerly operated under the Wilts & Dorset name. PulseLine was the name of services around Salisbury to the District Hospital. In 2010 the name was replaced by Salisbury Reds, using the previous Mercedes-Benz Citaros repainted in the revised Wilts & Dorset livery with Salisbury Reds branding. In addition to the Citaros, ex Southern Vectis Dennis Dart MPDs were transferred and repainted into Wilts & Dorset livery with branding applied.

Yao was a pivotal figure in the Qing empire's annexation of Taiwan. Biography Yao was born in the Shaoxing area of the southeastern Zhejiang province during the waning years of the Ming dynasty. About 1640 at age 20, while travelling in northern China, he reputedly killed two Qing soldiers who were trying to rape a girl, and returned the girl to her family, earning him fame as a righteous figure in local lore. Due to having been wronged by some northern Chinese rich merchants, he joined the Qing army as a means to exact revenge. In 1663, Yao scored first in the local Civil Service Examinations, and became the county magistrate of Xiangshan County in Guangdong. In Xiangshan, Yao was known to have cleaned up finances of the local bureaucracy, which was mired in debt under his predecessor. However, several years later he was removed from the position, for unknown reasons, and returned to Zhejiang. In 1674, Yao, along with his son, raised a small army of several hundred men to assist Giyesu, the Prince Kang, in the fight against Geng Jingzhong, who had revolted against Manchu rule. On recommendation from Giyesu, Yao became entrusted by the Kangxi Emperor, who eventually appointed him Viceroy of Minzhe during a campaign against Ming Dynasty loyalists on Taiwan under the leadership of Zheng Jing. Yao led Qing forces to several victories on the Fujian coast, eventually forcing Zheng to retreat to the island of Taiwan proper. Yao repeatedly attempted to negotiate a peaceful surrender of Zheng Jing's forces in Taiwan. Eventually, Yao proposed to the emperor that Taiwan take on the \\"Korean model\\" of a suzerain nation, maintaining broad autonomy over its own affairs and allowing its citizens to maintain their Han Chinese hairstyle instead of growing a Manchu queue. However, the Kangxi Emperor rejected this proposal. In his later years, Yao was appointed a Shangshu (roughly, \\"Secretary\\") of the Board of War. However, he became involved in a bitter struggle for control of the imperial forces with former Ming loyalist and defector Shi Lang, who had also become a trusted military officer of the Kangxi emperor, and who steadfastly refused to submit to Yao's oversight. Shi eventually conquered Taiwan, and was given grand imperial honours by the emperor upon his victory, but Yao was apparently not credited. Deeply enraged with what he saw as a slight, Yao fell ill, and died shortly thereafter. Yao was married to a woman surnamed He, who was supposedly revered for her physical strength. They had one known son. Yao is buried in present-day town of Lizhu (), in the Keqiao District of Shaoxing. In 2015, the local government renovated the burial grounds to make the site more visible, and also erected an engraved stone tablet to describe Yao's achievements, possibly to generate tourist revenue.

Traditionally, submissions were collected offline i.e. in the form of 'hard' paper files or folders. However, with the recent penetration of Internet in almost every sphere of life, there has been a steady shift towards collecting electronic submissions as compared to hard copies of submissions. The Internet has also facilitated a change in the perception towards the deliverables or contents of a submission. As a result of this, submitting audio and video files, pictures and presentations in addition to standard text, word and pdf-like documents has become common in the last few years. Managing submissions may include evaluating submissions and providing feedback to submitters, accepting or rejecting submissions or requesting submitters to make a re-submission. In some cases, a panel of experts may also be requested to assist in the evaluation of submissions by reviewing or judging them. Common scenarios=Academics It is a common practice for teachers, professors and teaching assistants to get assignments and projects submitted by students, either electronically or otherwise. These assignments are graded and the students are given feedback on whatever they submitted and how can they improve it. In institutes where academic submissions are done electronically, there generally is a system (usually a web-based one) in place to assist in the collection and management of submissions. Call-for-paper (academic) conferences In call-for-paper or academic conferences, prospective presenters are usually asked to submit a short abstract of their presentation or research work, which is reviewed before being accepted for the conference. Some conferences require researchers to submit a full paper of about 6‚Äì15 pages, which is peer reviewed by members of the conference's program committee and/or external reviewers chosen by them. Competitions and contests Most competitions and contests held world over usually have an initial screening round in which they accept nominations or entries from prospective participants. After all the nominations and entries have been received, the organizers of the competition or contest evaluate and shortlist the required number of entries on the basis of certain parameters set by them, notify the participants whose entries have been shortlisted and invite them to participate in further rounds of the competition or contest. Those whose entries were not shortlisted may also be given feedback by the organizers with a reason for the rejection and tips for improvement. College events and fests Student bodies in colleges and universities usually organize various inter-college and intra-college events and fests on an annual and/or semester basis. These events and fests are usually made up of several big and small competitions and contests, each of which generally follow a procedure as explained in the paragraph above. Pharmaceuticals industry Regulatory submissions in the pharmaceutical‚Äìbiotechnology and medical device industry comprise documents and data that are submitted to a regulatory agency to gain approval to market new drugs, biologics and devices but also when modifications are introduced in registered data (variations). The documentation represents years of research and includes multi-disciplinary information (including preclinical and clinical data) regarding the safety and efficacy of a compound. The regulatory process varies from country to country and involves numerous interactions between the submitting company (sponsor) and the regulatory authority (agency). Many regulatory agencies accept electronic submissions in conjunction with or in lieu of submitting paper. Human resources Human resource departments collect r√©sum√©s and CVs as a part of processing job applications. Applicants submit their r√©sum√©s either via email, on the website of their prospective employer or on employment websites that help connect job seekers and employers. Contemporary art In contemporary art, curators often select and interpret works of art created by various artists. Before the popularity of the Internet, this was often done in person but these days some curators prefer artists submitting pictures of their work over email or by other electronic means for an initial screening. If the curator likes a particular work of art, he may electronically communicate his desire to work with the artist after verifying that the picture is indeed of his work. The fashion industry Models create and maintain portfolios which they use to showcase themselves during the process of getting selected for various fashion shows, advertisements and other events in the fashion industry. Those who are responsible for taking a decision on which models to choose usually ask prospective models to submit their portfolios with them. They take their decision after evaluating all the portfolios available with them. Publication and media houses Journalists and writers (full-time as well as freelancers) usually submit their articles and reports to editors of magazines, journals, newspapers and news channels who then select which ones will be published and/or telecasted and which ones won't be. At times, editors even provide feedback to the authors of reports with an intention of seeking pre-publication improvement. Government applications Most government procedures demand the filling up of a form, either electronically or on paper. Citizens submit their forms to the desired government agency by their preferred mode of communication after which the agency performs an initial verification during which they may contact the concerned person for further information, data or correction of errors. After the verification stage, the forms are marked for processing and the concerned person is intimated once the processing is over. The processing stage may involve external or sister agencies too. Challenges=Submission standards and formats As companies, agencies and institutes move towards electronic submissions, a lot of complexity has been added in the submission management domain. In the paper world, much of the effort of managing a submission involves printing and collating volumes of information but with electronic submissions, it becomes increasingly difficult to efficiently manage the tens and thousands of submissions coming from different sources, in different formats at different times. As a result, many agencies are in the process of trying to implement global standards for submission formats and standards. One example of this is the standards put forth by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) in the context of the pharmaceuticals industry. The ICH has developed the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) to promote harmonization of regulatory submissions in electronic format across various regions (United States, Europe and Japan). Inappropriate modes and lack of automated systems Email is by-far the most popular mode for collecting and managing electronic submissions and post for paper submissions. Since, both these processes are manual to quite an extent, they often lead to delays, inconsistencies and mishaps. In some setups, there are tailor-made systems that help collectors of submissions to some extent but they often fail owing to their ultra specific nature. The key to successful submission management involves tracking each submission as well as all its versions and sub-parts that may be related to it or dependent on it. In addition to planning and tracking submission content, it is also important to manage and allocate resources effectively based on workload, skill sets and availability. Submission collectors may seek the help of expert reviewers or judges in such cases. All these reasons have motivated many companies and researchers to begin looking at submission management as a formal discipline and to start analyzing metrics behind various submission processes. Submission management systems Certain software vendors have begun developing submission management systems to assist submission collectors in the automation, tracking and management of complex submission processes. Most of these systems are web based and accessible from any device with a browser and an Internet connection. However, a majority of these systems are application specific and cannot be applied to all submission management scenarios. This means that a lot of work needs to be done in this field before we have good and reliable submission management systems that are suitable and usable in every context of submission management.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1830 to 1837. His life Miller the only child of William Miller of Craigentinny, Midlothian, was born in 1789. He received a liberal education, and throughout life retained a taste for classical literature. At the 1830 general election he entered Parliament as a Whig defeating Evelyn Denison (who was later Speaker) to become one of the two Members for the borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme. He was re-elected in 1831 as a Tory, and in 1832, 1835 and 1837, each time after a contest, and on two occasions at the head of the poll. In 1841, however, he was defeated, and he was again unsuccessful as a candidate for Berwick at the general election of 1847.Craig, page 41 The Craigentinny MarblesHe died, unmarried, at Craigentinny House, near Edinburgh, on 31 October 1848, in his sixtieth year, and was by his own desire buried on his estate in a mausoleum erected after his decease, and decorated with sculptured friezes by Alfred Gatley, subsequently referred to as the Craigentinny Marbles. A portrait of William Henry Miller, by Sir Thomas Lawrence, was engraved. Britwell Court Library As a book collector, Miller was regarded as the successor of Richard Heber, and many of the rarest works from his collections of the latter passed into the library which he formed at Britwell Court, near Burnham, Buckinghamshire. He was particular in his choice of copies, and from his habit of carrying about with him a foot rule to measure the size of a 'tall' copy of a book which he wished to buy, he became known at sales and among collectors as 'Measure Miller.‚Äô The Britwell Library, formed chiefly at the time of the dispersal of the Heber and other important collections, and then added to by acquisitions from Thomas Corser, Laing, and other sales, was unrivalled among private libraries for the number, rarity, and condition of its examples of early English and Scottish literature. It contained six works from William Caxton's press, many printed by Wynkyn de Worde and Richard Pynson, and the greater part of the Heber collection of ballads and broadsides. It was especially rich in early English poetry, and possesses also the finest and most complete series in existence of Theodor de Bry's collections of voyages to the East and West Indies. Britwell Court and its libraries were bequeathed by Miller to his cousin Miss Marsh, from whom they passed to Samuel Christy- Miller, M.P. for Newcastle-under-Lyme from 1847 to 1859, and on his death, on 5 April, to Wakefield Christie-Miller (d.1898), whose sons inherited them. in the Gutenberg Project The Library had a crest showing a right hand holding an open book. The collection of rare books was housed in a library built in 1864 which, with the provision of steel doors and mains water hydrants, was intended to be fire-proof. The house and library collection stayed within the family until 1919, at which point the house and the collection were sold, and the collection split up.

Early life Joseph William Mellor was born in Lindley, Huddersfield, England, in 1869. He moved to New Zealand with his family in 1879 and settled in Kaiapoi, where he attended Kaiapoi School. During his two years in Canterbury, he worked at the Kaiapoi Woollen Company. The family moved to Dunedin in 1881 where he went to Linden School in the suburb of Kaikorai Valley. The family was too poor to send Joseph to secondary school, but he continued to study in his spare time and undertook self- initiated study at King Edward Technical College. Mellor graduated from the University of Otago in 1898. He won a scholarship to study for a research degree at the University of Manchester. Career in the UK Mellor never returned to New Zealand, although he kept in contact with relatives there and represented the country as a governor of Imperial College, London. After his three years at Manchester, he based himself in north Staffordshire where he carried out research in the local industry, ceramics. In 1910 the separate towns which make up Stoke-on-Trent federated, and a decision was made to build a technical college, which opened in 1914 with Mellor as Principal. The college specialised in ceramics and mining: it was provided with a ceramics library by the Carnegie UK Trust.The files on this and other Carnegie libraries in the UK are held in the National Archives of Scotland former technical college, Stoke, now part of Staffordshire University During the First World War Mellor's research was directed towards refractories, high- temperature ceramics relevant to the steel industry and thus the war effort. In 1927 Mellor became only the second person to be elected to the Royal Society for work related to ceramics, the first having been Josiah Wedgwood in the eighteenth century. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1938 New Year Honours. Mellor's publications include a sixteen-volume Comprehensive Treatise on inorganic chemistry.Encyclopaedia of New Zealand Although offered a peerage for his contribution towards the war effort, Mellor turned it down saying that he had freely given his scientific knowledge to help his country because ill-health prevented him joining the army and fighting in France.

It was founded by Dave Perry in 1999, in Exeter, Devon, as part of his Predator Publishing company. From August 2006 onward, it was owned by Jazz Publishing, which was based in Chester, while the magazine itself continued to be produced in Devon.  History  DVD Monthly was founded in April 1999 as the first magazine of Dave Perry's Predator Publishing in Exeter, Devon, UK. Shortly after its launch, funding for the continued running of the magazine came from Goodfellas Publishing, who later became the majority shareholders of Predator Publishing. Initially edited by Dave Perry himself, Jon Bruford subsequently took over as editor in early 2003 and from September 2004 until 2009, the title was edited by Tim Isaac. After Goodfellas decided to close most of its publishing ventures, the magazine was bought by Chester-based Jazz Publishing in August 2006, which took all advertising and sales in-house to their offices, while leaving editorial and design in Exeter. Its major competition in the UK was DVD Review magazine and HD Review magazine. The magazine closed down in 2009. There was also a DVD Monthly in the US prior to the magazine. This was an online website which served as one of the first review/magazine DVD sites on the internet. It was started in 1996, at the dawn of DVD, during beta test phases, but ceased publication in 2000.  Regular Features  Published every four weeks, the magazine presented news, reviews and features based on upcoming and classic DVDs. It also included star interviews, competitions, hardware reviews and comment. The magazine's tone was generally conversational, presenting a mix of mainstream and specialist film and DVD content.  HD Monthly  Starting in May 2008, DVD Monthly began publishing a 32-page supplement called 'HD Monthly' with each issue, which covered high definition and Blu-ray in the UK and around the world. Similar in style to its parent title, it was included as part of the magazine each month.

In the course of time, other departments were added, and the organization changed name into Sports Club Bron. With financial support of the Lucznik plant, Bron emerged as the largest sports organization in the city of Radom. By the early 1930s, Bron had such departments, as archery, tennis, boxing, volleyball, cycling and football. Construction of a new stadium and a swimming pool was initiated, and a cycling track was built. The organization continued to prosper after World War Two. In the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, Bron's own Kazimierz Pazdzior won gold medal in lightweight boxing. Bron's cyclist Andrzej Michalak qualified to the 1980 Olympic Games, also its tennis players were recognized nationwide. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Bron's football team played in the second tier of Polish football system. Among most famous players who began their careers there were Kazimierz Przybys, Tomasz Dziubinski (two caps for Poland), and Rafal Siadaczka (17 caps for Poland).

It is a W-shaped table-top optical control device with several laser beams. Users operate the device by using their hands to interrupt the beams. History The product was created by musician and record producer Jerry Riopelle, who began working on the device in 2001. Riopelle built the original prototype with PVC pipe and lasers, and later refined it with Todor Fay and Melissa Jordan Grey. to develop the software that controls the device. How it works The Beamz system connects to a computer via USB. Each laser beam corresponds to an instrument or sound that the user plays by interrupting the beam. When the player removes his or her hand the sound stops. Even though the player‚Äôs interaction with the lasers is random, the device ensures that the music will always be harmonious. Six laser triggers and two button-controlled triggers activate up to 64 independently controlled sequences of musical notes or events. When a laser beam is broken, the software program plays a musical note, event, or musical phrase that is always harmonious to the other sounds being played at that time. The Beamz product line is now in its third generation with a smaller footprint controller with four laser beams cross-platform compatible with PC, MAC and iOS devices.

Plot summary Rome has reconquered weakly-defended Italy from the Carthaginians and is resettling it to be as it was before the Carthaginians came. The legions stand poised to march down the length of the peninsula to Carthage itself. Meanwhile, the four legions cut off in Egypt and led by Titus Norbanus, decide not to trust Marcus Scipio and head east into the desert, marching the long way home along the Eastern edge of the Mediterranean to get back to Rome. Encountering the doddering remnants of the Seleucid Empire, the divided kingdoms of the Jews, the rapidly ascendant Parthians, and annihilating the pirates of Cilicia, Titus Norbanus makes a strong impression on the Eastern Mediterranean of the power of Rome. Accumulating vast amounts of wealth and prestige, the men under the command of Norbanus find their loyalties shifting from the Senate of Rome to the man who made them rich beyond measure. Arriving in Rome with untold riches, Norbanus shocks the Senate and shifts the greedy desires of the Patricians south, rather than north. Keeping a wary eye on the luck-filled fortunes of his rival Titus Norbanus, Marcus and his lover Selene prepare the Egyptian military to counterattack Carthage with heavy investments in new inventions made at the Library of Alexandria, including light clipper ships, razor-backed bronze submarines, heavy water-borne rams, trebuchets, telescopes, and wide wings allowing for a degree of human flight. To counter Rome's assault on Italy, Carthage's top general, Mastanabal, takes a multi-national army of Celtiberians, Greeks, Libyans, Gauls, and various others from Spain to Northern Italy to surprise the hopefully green Roman forces there. In a fierce and brutal exchange, Mastanabal manages to achieve a Pyrrhic victory, smashing two legions at the expense of shredding his army's effectiveness. Retreating back into Gaul, Mastanabal is followed by Titus Norbanus. Mastanabal continues retreating into Spain, and is joined by Queen Teuta, a confident and competent commander, and her cavalry. This is not enough to stop the Roman war machine, which, honed by a century of warfare with the Germans and Gauls, demolishes the Carthaginian defenses. Following the fleeing Carthaginians south, Titus Norbanus enters into a race with Marcus Scipio to see who will once and for all take Carthage.

It is a common subject in science fiction literature, film, video games, and television. Teleportation is often paired with time travel, being that the travelling between the two points takes an unknown period of time, sometimes being immediate. Teleportation has not yet been implemented in the real world. There is no known physical mechanism that would allow this. Frequently appearing scientific papers and media articles with the term teleportation typically report on so-called \\"quantum teleportation\\", a scheme for information transfer. Etymology The use of the term teleport to describe the hypothetical movement of material objects between one place and another without physically traversing the distance between them has been documented as early as 1878. American writer Charles Fort is credited with having coined the word teleportation in 1931\\"less well-known is the fact that Charles Fort coined the word in 1931\\" in Rickard, B. and Michell, J. Unexplained Phenomena: a Rough Guide special (Rough Guides, 2000 (), p.3) to describe the strange disappearances and appearances of anomalies, which he suggested may be connected. As in the earlier usage, he joined the Greek prefix tele- (meaning \\"remote\\") to the root of the Latin verb portare (meaning \\"to carry\\"). Fort's first formal use of the word occurred in the second chapter of his 1931 book Lo!: Fiction Teleportation is a common subject in science fiction literature, film, video games, and television. The use of matter transmitters in science fiction originated at least as early as the 19th century.Matter Transmission in John Clute and, Peter Nichols (ed), The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Orbit, 1999 An early example of scientific teleportation (as opposed to magical or spiritual teleportation) is found in the 1897 novel To Venus in Five Seconds by Fred T. Jane. Jane's protagonist is transported from a strange-machinery-containing gazebo on Earth to planet Venus ‚Äì hence the title. The earliest recorded story of a \\"matter transmitter\\" was Edward Page Mitchell's \\"The Man Without a Body\\" in 1877. Science An actual teleportation of matter has never been realized by modern science (which is based entirely on mechanistic methods). It is questionable if it can ever be achieved, because any transfer of matter from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them violates Newton's laws, a cornerstone of physics. Almost all physics is local, that is, any event only influences its immediate neighborhood and any consequence only propagates continuously through space, in direct contrast to what teleportation would be. The only known exception to date are correlations from quantum entanglement. It appears that those cannot be employed to transport matter, energy or information through space, but even after one hundred years of research their interpretation has remained unclear. Beaming Beaming is often used as a synonym for teleportation and refers to the hypothetical transmission of an object in the form of radiation. To this end, the object must be ‚Äúdematerialized‚Äù at the sender, i.e. broken down into its components, which are then sent as a beam and ‚Äúmaterialized‚Äù at the destination, i.e. reconverted into matter. In this way it is achieved that an object, similar to teleportation, disappears at the place of origin and reappears at the destination. However, there is a continuous transmission path along which the matter (possibly in a converted form) traverses the physical space. Therefore, strictly speaking, beaming is not teleportation. The concept mainly originates from the science fiction series Star Trek, where people and inanimate objects are transported back and forth between places using so-called transporter devices. In the real world, it has so far not been possible to beam objects. For one thing, there is no available technology that can disintegrate or reassemble arbitrary objects atom by atom, let alone within seconds. Furthermore, the required amount of information to fully represent macroscopic objects is far too large for today's available information technology.U. S. Air Force Teleportation Physics Study Another obstacle often cited in this context is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which prohibits the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum of individual particles with arbitrary precision. At room temperature and even far below, however, this poses no limitation, since position and momentum of individual particles fluctuate statistically and do not have to be determined precisely. Moreover, the science fiction concepts for beaming do not get it exactly clear what kind of radiation the matter would be converted to. There are only two types of radiation in physics that come into question: Electromagnetic radiation (radio waves, light, X-rays, gamma rays etc.) and particle radiation (alpha and beta rays, neutrons, neutrinos, atoms etc.). According to the current state of knowledge, electromagnetic radiation alone cannot transport matter, since it only transmits the energy, but not the baryons and leptons required to create atoms. If, alternatively, a beam of matter particles was sent, this would offer hardly any advantage over transporting the object as a whole. On the one hand, accelerating and decelerating the particles would require the same amount of energy as for the original object. So there would be no speed advantage. On the other hand, particle beams can hardly penetrate layers of matter along the transmission path (which is supposedly possible in the science-fiction concepts within some limits). A realistic form of beaming could be the transfer of pure information and the use of matter available at the destination to perform materialization. Then however, beaming would merely be the construction of a remote copy. Quantum teleportation Quantum teleportation is distinct from regular teleportation, as it does not transfer matter from one place to another, but rather transmits the information necessary to prepare a (microscopic) target system in the same quantum state as the source system. The scheme was named quantum ‚Äúteleportation‚Äù, because certain properties of the source system are recreated in the target system without any apparent information carrier propagating between the two. In many cases, such as normal matter at room temperature, the exact quantum state of a system is irrelevant for any practical purpose (because it fluctuates rapidly anyway, it \\"decoheres\\"), and the necessary information to recreate the system is classical. In those cases, quantum teleportation may be replaced by the simple transmission of classical information, such as radio communication. In 1993, Bennett et alC. H. Bennett, G. Brassard, C. Cr√©peau, R. Jozsa, A. Peres, W. K. Wootters (1993), Teleporting an Unknown Quantum State via Dual Classical and Einstein‚ÄìPodolsky‚ÄìRosen Channels, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 1895‚Äì1899. proposed that a quantum state of a particle could be transferred to another distant particle, without moving the two particles at all. This is called quantum state teleportation. There are many following theoretical and experimental papers published. Researchers believe that quantum teleportation is the foundation of quantum calculation and quantum communication. In 2008, M. Hotta proposed that it may be possible to teleport energy by exploiting quantum energy fluctuations of an entangled vacuum state of a quantum field. There are some papers published but no experimental verification. In 2014, researcher Ronald Hanson and colleagues from the Technical University Delft in the Netherlands, demonstrated the teleportation of information between two entangled quantumbits three metres apart.https://www.delta.tudelft.nl/article/hansonlab-demonstrates-quantum- teleportation-0 In 2016, Y. Wei showed that in a generalization of quantum mechanics, particles themselves could teleport from one place to another. This is called particle teleportation. With this concept, superconductivity can be viewed as the teleportation of some electrons in the superconductor and superfluidity as the teleportation of some of the atoms in the cellular tube. This effect is not predicted to occur in standard quantum mechanics.

It is located 2.5 km west of Budva. It consists of two parts, one 850 m long and the other, formerly a nudist beach, 450 m long. It is a pebble beach, with a campground along the greater part of the beach (capacity 2,000 lots). While it is among the longer beaches in Montenegro, and is a popular beach for sunbathing and camping, it has gained international prominence as a host of numerous concerts and happenings in recent years. The vast hinterlands of the Jaz beach are considered among the greatest potentials for tourism development on the Montenegrin coast, as there are few undeveloped areas left on the coast besides Jaz (notably Buljarica, Velika Pla≈æa and Ada Bojana). Concert location Sea Dance Festival, 2015 With the spring 2007 announcement of The Rolling Stones playing the beach in July 2007, Jaz Beach started to figure as open-air concert location for global acts. However, by summer 2009 the concerts ended. The annual summer events were seen as an attempt to boost Montenegro's international image, as well as to promote the country as a tourist destination. In largest part they've been financed by Svetozar Maroviƒá, influential Montenegrin politician, and a native of Budva. Summer 2007 and summer 2008 The Rolling Stones played a show on July 9, 2007, as a part of their A Bigger Bang Tour. For the performance, a large field in the beach hinterland was leveled, fenced, and made accessible by refurbishing and extending the road to the venue. The show was attended by approximately 40,000 people and the city of Budva holds the distinction of being the smallest town ever to host a Rolling Stones gig.Stones@Budva;9 July 2007 The next notable event on the beach was the 3-day Live Fest held in August 2008 that consisted of: Lenny Kravitz and Armand Van Helden on August 5, Dino Merlin and DJ Set Retro Groove '70 on August 6, and finally Goran Bregoviƒá together with Zdravko ƒåoliƒá on August 7. Later that summer Madonna performed one of her Sticky & Sweet Tour concerts at the venue on September 25 with 47,524 people in attendance. The pre and after parties consisted of performances by various other popular musicians, such as Van Gogh, Garik Sukachev, David Morales, Junior Jack and DJ Ura.

Raka Mariƒá has confirmed that none of those singers will attend it this year. For popular daily newspaper Vijesti, he has said: \\"Due to 2009 global financial crisis, there will be no attendance of some global superstar on this year's Live Music Festival.\\" Although Tina Turner has finished her worldwide tour that marked her 50th year in the business and is now free for new concerts, Mariƒá has said that \\"she gave up touring and will never tour again\\" which is, of course, not actually the truth. He has also said that \\"Britney Spears is finishing her European leg in July 26\\" so they couldn't \\"get her to come\\". Although it has been officially confirmed that 2009 guests will be Vlado Georgiev, Plavi Orkestar, Riblja ƒåorba and two famous DJs, second Live Music Festival has never been held. Summer Fest 2012 After a three-year absence, the musical performances returned in summer 2012 with the three-day event called Summer Fest organized from 5‚Äì8 August.

Her website describes this as the \\"break-out achievement in her career,\\" noting that after this she was opening for artists like Sarah Slean, Martin Sexton, the Waifs, Regina Spektor, the Strawbs, Dar Williams, Jonatha Brooke, and Eric Andersen. The album's title track earned Goldman an honorable mention in the Pop/Top 40 category at the 2002 International Songwriting Competition.\\"Canadian Songwriters Clean Up in ISC\\", Canadian Musician, 25:2 (March‚ÄìApril 2003) p.17International Songwriting Competition 2002 winners , official site, accessed August 8, 2007 It was also around this time that she was picked up by the New York City based management firm for Williams and Shawn Colvin. Goldman began doing shows at venues like The Bottom Line, the Bitter End, and the Living Room. In 2002 a fan of Goldman's shared two cassette tapes of her music with James Keelaghan. Keelaghan passed them on to the Winnipeg band, The Duhks. The Duhks then recorded Goldman's song, \\"Annabel\\" on their 2002 album, Your Daughters & Your Sons. Leonard Podolak says the band took quickly to the song: \\"'Annabel' we got from Kat Goldman, who's a great songwriter from Toronto. The song was written when her grandmother died.

The ivory bowl is said to have belonged to Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered in his cathedral in 1170. Such relics of England's favourite saint were treasured until the English Reformation. When the gilded silver mounts were commissioned in 1525, the engraver was instructed to incorporate the initials of TB and a mitre on the cover. These alternate with the pomegranate badge of Catherine of Aragon. The cup was said to have been bequeathed to the queen by Sir Edward Howard (d. 1513), High Admiral to Henry VIII. The vital role played by prints in the dissemination of Renaissance styles to Northern Europe is revealed in some of the ornamentation on the cup which, like Henry VIII's writing desk, derives from the work of Hans Burgkmair. The cast marks and sheaves taken from an engraving by the artist are the earliest example of Renaissance influence in English goldsmiths' work. After Catherine of Aragon's death in 1536 the cup was returned to the Howard family, who were renowned both as devout Roman Catholics and as art collectors. It descended through successive generations of the family until it was bought by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1931.

Her World War II career was short due to the war coming to an end, but, post-war, she was reactivated in 1952 and served the Navy until 1959 when she was put into reserve and eventually transferred to Haiti as Jean- Jacques Dessalines.  Construction and career  The second ship to be so named by the Navy, Tonawanda (AN-89) was laid down on 12 September 1944, at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, by the Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding Company; launched on 14 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Charles N. Barnum; and commissioned on 9 May 1945, Lt. Edward F. McLaughlin in command.  World War II related service  The net laying ship departed Sturgeon Bay on 19 May and, after a voyage across the Great Lakes and down the St. Lawrence River, arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, on 4 June. After a short availability, she moved to Melville, Rhode Island, on the 19th for shakedown training and daily net laying drills in Narragansett Bay. Tonawanda stood out of Boston harbor again on 18 July and shaped a course south to Key West, Florida, and thence to the Panama Canal. She transited the canal on 2 and 3 August and continued her voyage to San Pedro, California, where she arrived on 15 August, the day after hostilities in the Pacific Ocean ceased.  Post-war service  She reported for duty in the 11th Naval District and, for the next 10 weeks, Tonawanda operated in the 11th Naval District at San Pedro, Seal Beach, Long Beach, and Port Hueneme, disposing of nets and salvaging net buoys. On 27 November, the ship stood out of San Pedro Bay and headed back to the Panama Canal which she transited on the 8th. Continuing north, Tonawanda arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 19 November and reported for duty with the Service Force, Atlantic Fleet. On 3 January 1946, she received orders to duty in the 7th Naval District and, on 4 January, stood out of the Chesapeake Bay and turned south. She reached Miami, Florida, on 7 January and began assisting in hydrographic triangulation surveys in the Florida-Cuba-Bahamas area. That duty lasted until 7 April when the net laying ship departed Miami in company with for New Orleans, Louisiana.  Inactivation  Tonwanda remained in New Orleans from 25 April to 11 May, when she shifted to Orange, Texas, to prepare for inactivation. Tonawanda was decommissioned on 9 August 1946 and berthed at Orange.  Recommissioned in 1952  On 18 March 1952, after almost six years in reserve, Tonawanda was recommissioned at Orange, Lt. Clarence A. Tennehill in command. After trials off Sabine Pass, Texas, she departed the Texas coast on 21 March bound for New England duty in the 1st Naval District. The ship arrived in Boston on 1 April and entered the Bethlehem Simpson Shipyard to complete outfitting. On 10 June, she moved to the Net Depot at Melville, Rhode Island, where she began seven years of experimental net installation duties in the vicinity of Melville and Boston. Periodically, she departed the New England coast to conduct underway training and mine warfare tactics exercises in the Chesapeake Bay and off the Virginia Capes. On two occasions, from 28 August to 21 October 1955 and from 2 May to 30 June 1956, temporary duty with the Mine Warfare Evaluation Detachment, Key West, Florida, interrupted her routine along the New England coast. During those two periods, she assisted other ships assigned to the detachment in experiments in mine planting, testing, recovery, and in overall mine warfare tactics development. After each of these tours, she resumed normal operations out of Melville and Boston.  Final decommissioning  On 16 November 1959, Tonawanda departed Boston and headed for Bayonne, New Jersey, to prepare once more for inactivation. On 18 December 1959, Tonawanda was decommissioned at Bayonne and assigned to the New York Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She remained there until 25 May 1960 when she was leased to the government of Haiti under the terms of the Military Assistance Program. As of late 1979, she was still serving the Haitian government as Jean-Jacques Dessalines (MH-10) when she was disposed of by sale to Haiti by the United States. Her current fate is unknown.

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.

Jaba' Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 17 Some Jaba' residents have reportedly managed to return to part of their land fenced off by the settlers of Geva Binyamin.Michael Sfard,The Wall and the Gate: Israel, Palestine, and the Legal Battle for Human Rights, Henry Holt and Company 2018 p.361 The village was established in 1984 by members of the Adam gar'in (named after Yekutiel Adam, a former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defence Forces who had been killed two years earlier in Lebanon).Adam Binyamin Region Qubur Bani Isra'il is located on the outskirts of the settlement. When Migron, the largest Israeli outpost in the West Bank, was found to be illegal and furthermore, established largely on private Palestinian land, the mandatory evacuation plan foresaw, as a compromise with the affected settlers, a major expansion of Geva Binyamin in order ostensibly to house the Mignon evacuees. However, the announced expansion of Geva Binyamin spoke of the construction of 1,400 housing units, notwithstanding the fact that the Mignon settlement to be abolished had only 50 family units.Galia Golan, Gilead Sher, Spoiling and Coping with Spoilers: Israeli-Arab Negotiations, Indiana University Press, 2019 p.72. Plans have been advanced to expand Jewish settlement northwards from Neve Ya'akov towards Geva Binyamin in order to create a seamless continuity between Jewish communities in this area of the West Bank, and it is thought the main purpose is block the urban expansion of Al-Ram and Hizma, something which would leave the settlement isolated.Francesco Chiodelli , Shaping Jerusalem: Spatial planning, politics and the conflict, Taylor & Francis, 2016 p.104.

One component defines the magnetic flux of the motor, the other the torque. The control system of the drive calculates the corresponding current component references from the flux and torque references given by the drive's speed control. Typically proportional-integral (PI) controllers are used to keep the measured current components at their reference values. The pulse-width modulation of the variable-frequency drive defines the transistor switching according to the stator voltage references that are the output of the PI current controllers. FOC is used to control AC synchronous and induction motors. It was originally developed for high- performance motor applications that are required to operate smoothly over the full speed range, generate full torque at zero speed, and have high dynamic performance including fast acceleration and deceleration. However, it is becoming increasingly attractive for lower performance applications as well due to FOC's motor size, cost and power consumption reduction superiority. It is expected that with increasing computational power of the microprocessors it will eventually nearly universally displace single-variable scalar volts-per- Hertz (V/f) control. Development history Block diagram from Blaschke's 1971 US patent application Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt's K. Hasse and Siemens' F. Blaschke pioneered vector control of AC motors starting in 1968 and in the early 1970s. Hasse in terms of proposing indirect vector control, Blaschke in terms of proposing direct vector control. Technical University Braunschweig's Werner Leonhard further developed FOC techniques and was instrumental in opening up opportunities for AC drives to be a competitive alternative to DC drives. Yet it was not until after the commercialization of microprocessors, that is in the early 1980s, that general purpose AC drives became available.Bose (2006), p. 605 Barriers to use FOC for AC drive applications included higher cost and complexity and lower maintainability compared to DC drives, FOC having until then required many electronic components in terms of sensors, amplifiers and so on. The Park transformation has long been widely used in the analysis and study of synchronous and induction machines. The transformation is by far the single most important concept needed for an understanding of how FOC works, the concept having been first conceptualized in a 1929 paper authored by Robert H. Park. Park's paper was ranked second most important in terms of impact from among all power engineering related papers ever published in the twentieth century. The novelty of Park's work involves his ability to transform any related machine's linear differential equation set from one with time varying coefficients to another with time invariant coefficients. Technical overview Overview of key competing VFD control platforms: Signal Flow Graph (SFG) for Induction Motor SFG Equations (d,q) Coordinate System Superimposed on Three-Phase Induction Motor thumbright350pxSimplified Indirect FOC Block Diagram thumbright350pxSimplified Direct FOC Block Diagram thumbright350pxSensorless FOC Block Diagram While the analysis of AC drive controls can be technically quite involved (\\"See also\\" section), such analysis invariably starts with modeling of the drive-motor circuit involved along the lines of accompanying signal flow graph and equations. In vector control, an AC induction or synchronous motor is controlled under all operating conditions like a separately excited DC motor.Bose (2006), p. 429 That is, the AC motor behaves like a DC motor in which the field flux linkage and armature flux linkage created by the respective field and armature (or torque component) currents are orthogonally aligned such that, when torque is controlled, the field flux linkage is not affected, hence enabling dynamic torque response. Vector control accordingly generates a three-phase PWM motor voltage output derived from a complex voltage vector to control a complex current vector derived from motor's three-phase stator current input through projections or rotations back and forth between the three-phase speed and time dependent system and these vectors' rotating reference-frame two-coordinate time invariant system. Such complex stator current space vector can be defined in a (d,q) coordinate system with orthogonal components along d (direct) and q (quadrature) axes such that field flux linkage component of current is aligned along the d axis and torque component of current is aligned along the q axis. The induction motor's (d,q) coordinate system can be superimposed to the motor's instantaneous (a,b,c) three-phase sinusoidal system as shown in accompanying image (phases b & c not shown for clarity). Components of the (d,q) system current vector allow conventional control such as proportional and integral, or PI, control, as with a DC motor. Projections associated with the (d,q) coordinate system typically involve: * Forward projection from instantaneous currents to (a,b,c) complex stator current space vector representation of the three-phase sinusoidal system. * Forward three-to-two phase, (a,b,c)-to-(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta) projection using the Clarke transformation. Vector control implementations usually assume ungrounded motor with balanced three-phase currents such that only two motor current phases need to be sensed. Also, backward two-to-three phase, (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)-to-(a,b,c) projection uses space vector PWM modulator or inverse Clarke transformation and one of the other PWM modulators. * Forward and backward two-to-two phase,(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)-to-(d,q) and (d,q)-to-(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta) projections using the Park and inverse Park transformations, respectively. However, it is not uncommon for sources to use three-to-two, (a,b,c)-to-(d,q) and inverse projections. While (d,q) coordinate system rotation can arbitrarily be set to any speed, there are three preferred speeds or reference frames: * Stationary reference frame where (d,q) coordinate system does not rotate; * Synchronously rotating reference frame where (d,q) coordinate system rotates at synchronous speed; * Rotor reference frame where (d,q) coordinate system rotates at rotor speed. Decoupled torque and field currents can thus be derived from raw stator current inputs for control algorithm development. Whereas magnetic field and torque components in DC motors can be operated relatively simply by separately controlling the respective field and armature currents, economical control of AC motors in variable speed application has required development of microprocessor-based controls with all AC drives now using powerful DSP (digital signal processing) technology.Bose (2006), p. 474 Inverters can be implemented as either open-loop sensorless or closed-loop FOC, the key limitation of open-loop operation being minimum speed possible at 100% torque, namely, about 0.8 Hz compared to standstill for closed-loop operation. There are two vector control methods, direct or feedback vector control (DFOC) and indirect or feedforward vector control (IFOC), IFOC being more commonly used because in closed-loop mode such drives more easily operate throughout the speed range from zero speed to high-speed field-weakening.Bose (2006), pp. 419, 474 In DFOC, flux magnitude and angle feedback signals are directly calculated using so-called voltage or current models. In IFOC, flux space angle feedforward and flux magnitude signals first measure stator currents and rotor speed for then deriving flux space angle proper by summing the rotor angle corresponding to the rotor speed and the calculated reference value of slip angle corresponding to the slip frequency.Bose (2006), p. 423-425 Sensorless control (see Sensorless FOC Block Diagram) of AC drives is attractive for cost and reliability considerations. Sensorless control requires derivation of rotor speed information from measured stator voltage and currents in combination with open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers. Application  1\\\\. Stator phase currents are measured, converted to complex space vector in (a,b,c) coordinate system. 2\\\\. Current is converted to (\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) coordinate system. Transformed to a coordinate system rotating in rotor reference frame, rotor position is derived by integrating the speed by means of speed measurement sensor. 3\\\\. Rotor flux linkage vector is estimated by multiplying the stator current vector with magnetizing inductance Lm and low-pass filtering the result with the rotor no-load time constant Lr/Rr, namely, the rotor inductance to rotor resistance ratio. 4\\\\. Current vector is converted to (d,q) coordinate system. 5\\\\. d-axis component of the stator current vector is used to control the rotor flux linkage and the imaginary q-axis component is used to control the motor torque. While PI controllers can be used to control these currents, bang-bang type current control provides better dynamic performance. 6\\\\. PI controllers provide (d,q) coordinate voltage components. A decoupling term is sometimes added to the controller output to improve control performance to mitigate cross coupling or big and rapid changes in speed, current and flux linkage. PI-controller also sometimes need low-pass filtering at the input or output to prevent the current ripple due to transistor switching from being amplified excessively and destabilizing the control. However, such filtering also limits the dynamic control system performance. High switching frequency (typically more than 10 kHz) is typically required to minimize filtering requirements for high- performance drives such as servo drives. 7\\\\. Voltage components are transformed from (d,q) coordinate system to (\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) coordinate system. 8\\\\. Voltage components are transformed from (\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) coordinate system to (a,b,c) coordinate system or fed in Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) modulator, or both, for signaling to the power inverter section. Significant aspects of vector control application: * Speed or position measurement or some sort of estimation is needed. * Torque and flux can be changed reasonably fast, in less than 5-10 milliseconds, by changing the references. * The step response has some overshoot if PI control is used. * The switching frequency of the transistors is usually constant and set by the modulator. * The accuracy of the torque depends on the accuracy of the motor parameters used in the control. Thus large errors due to for example rotor temperature changes often are encountered. * Reasonable processor performance is required; typically the control algorithm is calculated every PWM cycle. Although the vector control algorithm is more complicated than the Direct Torque Control (DTC), the algorithm need not be calculated as frequently as the DTC algorithm. Also the current sensors need not be the best in the market. Thus the cost of the processor and other control hardware is lower making it suitable for applications where the ultimate performance of DTC is not required.

The group presents about 18 productions each year in London, either at their base theatre, or at other small theatres in the London area. During the summer months they also perform touring productions, with regular appearances at the open-air Th√©√¢tre de Verdure, which is in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, and at the Minack Theatre in Cornwall. The acting company was founded as the Tavistock Repertory Company in 1932, at the Tavistock Little Theatre in Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury (and so has nothing to do with the town of Tavistock in Devon). In 1952 it moved to its own premises in Islington at Canonbury Tower which included a 156-seat theatre known as the Tower Theatre. Over the years it has mounted nearly 1600 productions. The Tower Theatre's productions have always been mounted in publicly licensed theatres with tickets sold to the general public rather than simply to members. The company mounted early productions of Endgame by Samuel Beckett (1961, the first ever production to be designed by William Dudley) and The Birthday Party by Harold Pinter (May 1959). Both playwrights became major supporters of the Tower Theatre Company in later life. Actors to have worked with the company include Michael Gambon, Sian Phillips, Tom Courtenay and Alfred Molina The lease in Canonbury expired in 2003 and the company spent 15 years hiring theatre space at a number of venues, particularly the Bridewell Theatre, while searching for suitable new premises. It commissioned a new theatre at a site just off Curtain Road in Shoreditch, but due to funding difficulties it abandoned plans to proceed with that project. On 6 August 2008 archaeologists from the Museum of London excavating the site, prior to construction, announced that they had found the footings of a polygonal structure which they believe to be the remains of the north-eastern corner of the foundations of the first permanent theatre ever built in England.  Sunstone House  In 2018, the Tower Theatre Company found and purchased a building in Stoke Newington, formerly known as Sunstone House, and is now based there. The space was turned into \\"a performance space and production base for the company\\" thanks to a fundraising campaign. A former Methodist chapel built in 1875, the building was damaged during World War II. In 1953, it was repaired and renovated by the congregation Beth Hamedrash Ohel Yisroel and consecrated as the Northwold Road Synagogue on 18 December 1955. It closed again in 1989. The building was refitted in 1992 and became the Sunstone Women Only Health and Leisure Club, which closed in 2014. The fitting of a swimming pool in the basement, sauna cabins, a gym and a mezzanine level led to significant works required from the Tower Theatre Company to transform the space: the swimming pool was boarded over and is now used for storage ; the saunas removed ; and the mezzanine was removed to make space for dressing room facilities. The new Tower Theatre opened in the building in September 2018 with a production of Shakespeare's Henry V, and most Tower Theatre Company productions will be staged there.

He was rector of the University of Freiburg 1928‚Äì1929. After his retirement in 1936, he led his own research institute in Freiburg, known as the State Research Laboratory, until his death in 1957. He is famous in the annals of forensic science for developing the species precipitin test, known as the Uhlenhuth test, which could distinguish human blood from animal blood in 1901, a discovery which had tremendous importance in criminal justice in the 20th century. In 1915, he discovered the pathogen of Weil's disease. He also invented the arsenic treatment of syphilis and the antimony treatment of many tropical diseases, and was an influential promoter of cancer research. He was a recipient of numerous honours, and was a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine 40 times between 1910 and 1952, notably by Nobel laureate Karl Landsteiner. At the time of his death, he was one of the most celebrated medical researchers in Germany, and one of the rare examples of someone who was equally celebrated in the west and east during the Cold War. Career and research Starting with the a significant discovery by Emil von Behring that animals inoculated with diphtheria toxin formed defensive substances in their blood serum. These defensive substances were named precipitins. Other scientists principally Jules Bordet tried devising serums against other infectious agents; They found that the precipitins were specific to the antagonist injected. In 1900, building off Bordet's work, Uhlenhuth injected hen's blood into rabbits, then he mixed serum from the rabbit with egg white. The egg proteins separated (precipitated) from the mixture. He was able to conclude that the blood of different species of animals contained unique proteins. These discoveries extended to being able to differentiate human blood from animal blood. Fellow scientist, Otto Beumer, professor of forensic medicine at the University of Greifswald and the coroner of Greifswald, learned of Uhlenhuth's work and joined him in perfecting the detection of human blood in dried bloodstains that were months or years old.\\"Detection of Old Bloodstains May Aid Crime Fighters\\" Popular Mechanics, August 1937 -- article bottom right side of page 216 His new technique was first used in the case of four children who had been murdered and dismembered in the town of G√∂hren on the Baltic island of R√ºgen in 1898 and 1901. The suspect in both cases, Ludwig Tessnowhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Tessnow (german) claimed in 1901 that the stains on his clothing were either cattle's blood or wood stain from his occupation as a carpenter. Due to advances in forensic technology, in which one could differentiate blood from other stains such as wood dye,One Was Not Enough pp. 51-52 investigators were able to prove otherwise. Tessnow was executed for his crime in 1904.Chronicle of Murder By Brian Lane, pg 7Forensic NursingThe Devil's Dozen: How Cutting-Edge Forensics Took Down 12 Notorious Serial Killers Katherine Ramsland Publisher: Berkley Trade; 1 edition (April 7, 2009) Language: English Uhlenhuth was nominated 40 times for the Nobel Prize in Medicine between 1910 and 1952, notably by Nobel laureate Karl Landsteiner.Nomination Database: Paul Uhlenhuth, nobelprize.org In 1915 Uhlenhoth was co-discoverer of Leptospira interrogans strain RGA, a cause of Weil's disease, a severe form of leptospirosis characterized by epistaxis, jaundice, chills, fever, muscle pain, and hepatomegaly, it was one of the many ailments to afflict soldiers involved in the trench warfare of World War I.FIND THE CAUSE OF WELL'S DISEASE; Exigencies of War Lead Two German Physicians to Solve Problem of Infectious Jaundice.

Times In 1942 he was awarded the Emil von Behring prize, which is awarded every two years by the University of Marburg for outstanding achievements in immunology, serum therapy and chemotherapy. Uhlenhuth had multiple articles published in peer reviewed journals and was an active researcher in various areas of bacteriology and immunology including research into chemotherapy and syphilis. Paul Ehrlich, winner of the 1908 Nobel Prize in Medicine, was an associate of Uhlenhuth. After he retired from his chair at the University of Freiburg in 1936, he led his own research institute in Freiburg, originally known as the State Research Laboratory. The institute was established with financial support from the German Research Council and was led by Uhlenhuth until his death in 1957 at the age of nearly 88. In the early 1950s, the institute became part of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Freiburg. Uhlenhuth was a lifelong monarchist and was generally known by the title Geheimrat, which he had been awarded during the monarchy. From the 1930s he took an interest in building cooperation with Japanese medical scientists.\\"Uhlenhuth, Paul,\\" in √Ñrzte Lexikon: Von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart, p. 326, Springer-Verlag, 2007, Paul Uhlenhuth and Nazi Germany  Uhlenhuth's activities in the Third Reich cast a deep shadow on his scientific achievements. According to Ernst Klee's Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945 - one of the most respected and reliable sources on the topic of individual Nazi involvement in the Third Reich \\\\- in April 1933 Uhlenhuth actively supported the firing of his Jewish colleagues and six years later, in 1939, he joined the ranks of the NSDAP. Later, the scientist's picture gets even darker: in 1944 Paul Uhlenhuth contacted the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (High Command of the Armed Forces in Nazi Germany) to obtain their consent to carry out medical experiments on non- white prisoners of war. Those experiments involved immunisation trials and blood tests on members of other than white ethnic groups. The latest publications about Uhlenhuth's activities under the Nazi Regime in 1933-1945 led to the re-naming of streets honouring his name in both Freiburg and in his hometown of Hannover. Honours (selection) Over half a century until his death, Uhlenhuth received numerous honours for his work, including *The honorary title Geheimrat (Privy Councillor), 1906 *Fellow of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, 1932 *Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, 1936 *Emil von Behring Prize, 1942 *Honorary citizen of Freiburg, 1950 *National Prize of East Germany First Class \\"for his influential research in the fields of bacteriology and hygiene,\\" 1953 *Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, 1955 *Honorary doctorate in medicine, Ghent University *Honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine, Hanover Veterinary College *Honorary doctorate in medicine, University of Greifswald, 1955 *Honorary President of the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology, 1955 *Honorary member of the Microbiological Society of Berlin, 1955 Bibliography *Das Biologische Verfahren Zur Erkennung Und Unterscheidung Von Menschen Und Tierblut (1905) by Paul Theodor Uhlenhuth Publisher: Kessinger Pub Co (November 2009) Language: German *Uhlenhuth, P., and Mulzer, P.: Gelungene Verimpfung von Blut, Blut-serum und Sperma syphilitischer Menschen in die Hoden von Kaninchen.

It is a calcium sensitizer and a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) with positive inotropic and vasodilator effects. Pimobendan is used in the management of heart failure in dogs, most commonly caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease (also previously known as endocardiosis), or dilated cardiomyopathy. Research has shown that as a monotherapy, pimobendan increases survival time and improves quality of life in canine patients with congestive heart failure secondary to mitral valve disease when compared with benazepril, an ACE inhibitor. However, in clinical practice, it is often used in conjunction with an ACE inhibitor like enalapril or benazepril. Under the trade name Acardi, it is available for human use in Japan. Mechanism of action Pimobendan is a positive inotrope (increases myocardial contractility). It sensitizes and increases the binding efficiency of cardiac troponin in the myofibril to the calcium ions that are already present in systole. In normal hearts it increases the consumption of oxygen and energy to the same degree as dobutamine but in diseased hearts it may not.Hata K1, Goto Y, Futaki S, Ohgoshi Y, Yaku H, Kawaguchi O, Takasago T, Saeki A, Taylor TW, Nishioka T, et al. \\"Mechanoenergetic effects of pimobendan in canine left ventricles.

Pimobendan also causes peripheral vasodilation by inhibiting the function of PDE3. This results in decreased resistance to blood flow through systemic arterioles, which decreases afterload (decreases the failing heart's workload) and reduces the amount of mitral regurgitation.Verdouw PD, Hartog JM, Duncker DJ, Roth W, Saxena PR. \\"Cardiovascular profile of pimobendan, a benzimidazole-pyridazinone derivative with vasodilating and inotropic properties.\\" Eur J Pharmacol. 1986 Jul 15;126(1-2):21-30.Kanno N, Kuse H, Kawasaki M, Hara A, Kano R, Sasaki Y. \\"Effects of pimobendan for mitral valve regurgitation in dogs.\\" J Vet Med Sci. 2007 Apr;69(4):373-7. Pharmacokinetics Pimobendan is absorbed rapidly when given via the oral route and has a bioavailability of 60-65%. Bioavailability is markedly decreased when ingested with food. It is metabolized into an active metabolite (desmethylpimobendan) by the liver. The parent compound, pimobendan, is a potent calcium sensitizer while desmethylpimobendan is a more potent phosphodiesterase III inhibitor.Hanzlicek AS1, Gehring R, Kukanich B, Kukanich KS, Borgarelli M, Smee N, Olson EE, Margiocco M. \\"Pharmacokinetics of oral pimobendan in healthy cats.\\" J Vet Cardiol. 2012 Dec;14(4):489-96. The half-life of pimobendan in the blood is 0.4 hours, and the half-life of its metabolite is two hours. Elimination is by excretion in the bile and then feces. Pimobendan is 90‚Äì95% bound to plasma proteins in circulation. This may have implications in patients suffering from low blood protein levels (hypoproteinemia/hypoalbuminemia) and in patients that are on concurrent therapies that are also highly protein bound. Combinations Pimobendan is often used in combination with three other drugs to palliate dogs with heart failure (pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, ascites). These are: * Furosemide, a diuretic, to reduce edema and effusion. * Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist. This has two actions, firstly, as a potassium-sparing diuretic, although its diuretic properties are small compared with those of furosemide. Secondly, it reduces aldosterone-mediated myocardial fibrosis, possibly slowing the progression of heart disease. *An ACE inhibitor, often enalapril (trade name Enacard) or benazepril (Fortekor). These drugs inhibit the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme, producing a balanced vasodilation, along with other potentially favorable effects. Other drugs may also be used as required to manage certain arrhythmias that are often associated with heart disease.

T.228-1994 Margaret Layton's jacket is a surviving example of English Jacobean embroidery, significant because it appears in a portrait which has also survived. The jacket was originally owned and worn by Margaret Layton (1579‚Äì1641), wife of Francis Layton (1577‚Äì1661) who was one of the Yeomen of the Jewel House during the reigns of James I, Charles I and, briefly, Charles II. Embroidered linen jackets were worn as informal dress, and were particularly popular among wealthy women in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. This jacket is exquisitely decorated with flowers, birds and butterflies, embroidered in coloured silks, coiled tendrils of silver-gilt plaited braid stitch and silver-gilt sequins. The edges of the jacket are trimmed with silver and silver-gilt bobbin lace and silver-gilt spangles. This jacket appears in a portrait of Margaret Layton which probably dates from around 1620 and is painted in oils on oak boards. The painter is not known, but the style of portraiture is similar to that of Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1561?‚Äì1635) who was the most fashionable portrait painter of the period. Both the jacket and the portrait are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, who formally acquired them in 1994.

The peak is the highest point of a massif extending north-west to south-east, the summit rising by the pass of Zelatun. Neighbouring summits lined up NW to SE at the range are mount Gazume (997 m) standing west across the summit and mount Herniozabal (1,200 m) closing the range east at the rear. The villages lying at the feet of the mount are Errezil (SW), Alkiza (NE) and Asteasu (N). The summit of Hernio affords to the NW a beautiful view over Azpeitia and the stone bulk of Izarraitz towering over the town. Access points As a popular destination for hikers and locals, Hernio may be reached through various trails setting out from different points. Iturriotz Iturriotz (580 m, the spot is reached through a road up setting out at Andatzarrate -road GI-2631-) is a former country inn, where according to historic accounts Ignatius of Loyola stayed overnight on his journey home from Paris in April 1535. A trail goes up and gains height along the stream Zelatun until the pass of the same name is reached (841 m). At the pass, a cluster of huts are found, and a beaten trail up must be taken on the left that cuts across the side of Hernio. The trail heading south-east, after a long slope is overcome, a couple of zigzags on pebbled soil lead to the top of the mountain. The way up takes 1h30 and back. Alkiza Hernio far in the distance and the ridge extending north-west Starting from the road entering Alkiza (344 m high) from the south- west (GI-3630), a concrete track splits off on the left and leaves the houses behind. After a zigzag, a hiking trail heads up south-west along a fence and penetrates in a forest. The route (PR GI-78), shrouded in vegetation, is marked all along on rocks, signposts and trees, with a general direction west running along the mountain range (left). At the final stage before the pass of Zelatun, the path cuts across a clear landscape on a sloping terrain. From Zelatun, the final stretch as explained above. It takes some 2h30 to the peak and back. Errezil Crosses at the top of Hernio, with Azpeitia and Azkoitia down on the right Devotees praying to crosses on the summit (early- mid 20th century) The village lies right at the foot of the mount and therefore stands close to it. Yet this may be the hardest approach on account of its steep ascent. A dust track winds up from the road (GI-2634) to the very pass of Zelatun, so pick-ups and other SUV vehicles may be found at this spot, sometimes belonging to hunters. The ascent takes roughly 1h45 and back. Landscape and human presence Panoramic view of Hernio from Txurro Forest abounds in the massif, with various kinds of trees. In the course of the last century Monterrey pine and larch tree have gained ground at the expense of other autochthonous species. On the north face of the mountain range, beech forests cover the steep terrain. In addition, oak and chestnut tree patches may be found, with some birch trees few and far between. There are some grasslands especially at the north-west, at Zelatun and around. Actually, for centuries the pass has borne witness to seasonal migration of cattle from Aralar and even Urbasa to coastal pastures. The massif has been inhabited for millennia, as attested in the grotto of Altxerri, where in 1962 wall paintings and rock carvings depicting bison, horses, reindeer, fish and other animals were unearthed. Article in Spanish Tradition and events * Not long ago, local scholars and folk accounts held rather romantically that heroic battles took place at Zelatun in Roman times between their army and the Cantabri. On the other hand, this assumption has been disputed by modern history, pinpointing such battle farther west, somewhere in Cantabria. Site in Spanish It is no surprise that legend traces the name of the village at the foot, Errezil, to the phrase \\"errez hil\\", '(Romans) died easy', a folk etymology. * The San Joan hermitage lies beside the building of Iturriotz (see above), where a festivity in honour of the saint is held on 24 June. In local lore, the water springing out of its walls cures scabies and ringworm. * Hernio is renowned for its popular pilgrimages of September, held every Sunday of the month. The last Sunday is the most attended one, with a steady trail of people of all ages following the path to the top. The summit is covered with small crosses shrouded in beliefs, small memorials and a mountaineer postbox. Before the last attempt to the peak, metallic rings hanging from a cross may be grabbed and slid around whatever part of the body suffers a disease so as to heal it. At the fields of Zelatun a celebration steeped in music, dance and cheerful atmosphere takes place all day long. * Since the early 2000s, hundreds turn out for the collective hike looping around the whole mountain range of Hernio. The event, called Erniopeko Martxa, is held in spring, with the walk starting early in the morning (in Alkiza in 2008). The route, stretching for 48,6 km, crosses eight villages surrounding the massif. Alternatively, another route provides a shorter approach through a short-cut that splits up the route in two.

The book was the first of three Science Fiction novels written by Amery.Carl Amery - Obituaries The Independent, accessed: 6 August 2008 Background Amery's novel, set mostly in Rome and concerning the Vatican, reflects on his upbringing as a Bavarian Catholic who had studied at the Catholic University of America. Plot The Vatican gains possession of a time machine from Leonardo da Vinci after the inventor's death. Selected members of the Pope's Swiss Guard are sent back in time to alter history in favour of the Catholic Church. All this is supervised by a very small group of church officials and without the specific knowledge of the current Pope. The Vatican learns that major historical events can't be prevented, only their details can be altered. For example, the Reformation can not be undone, but the details surrounding it can be changed: Martin Luther can't be killed before publishing The Ninety-Five Theses, but the failed attempt on his life by a time-traveling agent is interpreted by Luther as a visitation by the devil. In 1688, the Progetto Reale (English: Royal Project) is undertaken by the men in charge of the department. The project's aim is to reestablish Catholicism in England through restoration of the House of Stuart. The Catholic Church perceives the Stuarts as too weak for their purposes and instead selects the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach as an alternative. For the purpose of legalising the claim to the British throne, a member of the Swiss Guard, Arnold F√º√üli, is sent out to exchange the Stone of Scone for a fake. While this mission succeeds, the stone is deposited at what later becomes a reservoir and is lost for the cause. The Church's main asset, its loyal Swiss Guard soldier Franz Defunderoll, however, chooses to desert and meet his unsuspecting self in the future. Eventually, the time machine is destroyed. In the finale of the book, the rebellious Bavarian-Scottish troops sacrifice themselves in the reservoir attempting to recover the Stone.

Life Terrasson was born at Lyon. His oratorical talents were revealed at Troyes, 1711, on delivering the funeral oration of the Dauphin, son of Louis XIV; but he did not devote himself to preaching till after the death in 1723 of his brother Andr√© Terrasson, when he fulfilled several engagements which the latter had made. For five years he preached at Paris, and finally delivered a Lenten course in the Church of Notre Dame. He appealed repeatedly against the papal bull Unigenitus; he was the anonymous author of twelve \\"Lettres sur la justice chr√©tienne\\" (Paris, 1733), in which, to support the Jansenists whom the bishops deprived of the sacraments, he endeavoured to prove the inutility of sacramental confession. This work was condemned by the faculty of theology at Paris (1 Sept., 1734), and by the Archbishops of Sens and Embrun, as containing erroneous, schismatical and heretical assertions. Terrasson had to leave the Oratory and abandon preaching. He withdrew to the Diocese of Auxerre where the bishop, Charles de Caylus, a well-known Jansenist, confided to him the care of Treigni. But he was soon arrested (Oct., 1735) by the order of the king for his Jansenistic activities, and was confined during nine years either at Vincennes or with the Minims of Argenteuil. A belated retraction, the authenticity or sincerity of which has never been well established, was attributed to him. He was living in retirement with his family when he died at Paris. Works A volume of his discourses appeared at Utrecht in 1733, but the first real edition was at Paris in 1744 (4 vols.). The sermons of the two brothers were reprinted by Migne in his \\"Collection des orateurs sacr√©s\\", XXIX (Paris, 1849).

Flint), also known as Neveh Tzuf (, lit. Oasis of Nectar), is an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, located in the southwestern Samarian hills to the north of Ramallah, 10.7 kilometers east of the Green line. The Orthodox Jewish community was established in 1977. It is organised as a community settlement and falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. In it had a population of . The settlement of Neveh Tzuf is home to the religious pre-army Mechina Elisha. The international community considers Israeli settlements illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History On 16 October 1977, two groups of settlers, one religious, calling itself ‚ÄúNeveh Tzuf‚Äù and one secular, called ‚ÄúNeveh Tzelah‚Äù with a total of 40 families moved into the abandoned former British Tegart fort building near the Palestinian village Nabi Salih. The original name of the settlement, Neveh Tzuf, was rejected by the Government Naming Committee, arguing that it might be misleading as the biblical location Eretz Tzuf was elsewhere. The naming committee gave the new settlement the official name 'Halamish' instead, derived from a biblical verse: He (God) \\"nourished him with oil from the crag of flint.\\" (Deuteronomy 32:13) Since this name was rejected by some settlers, both names are used for the settlement. The Israeli Army issued military order 28/78 in 1978 to seize privately owned Palestinian land from the villages of Deir Nidham, Nabi Salih, and Umm Safa and turned over 686 dunams to the newly established settlement. According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from several surrounding Palestinian villages in order to construct Halamish; 604 dunams from Deir Nidham,Deir Nidham village profile, ARIJ, p. 16 10 dunams from the Beitillu part of Al-Ittihad.Al-Itihad Town Profile (Beitillu, Jammala & Deir 'Ammar), ARIJ, p. 17 Peace Now reported, based on data from the Israeli Civil Administration, that 34.35% of the land Halamish is built on is privately owned Palestinian property, with 0% being Jewish owned. On 21 July 2017, three Israelis were killed and one severely wounded in a stabbing attack in Halamish.IDF raids Halamish terrorist‚Äôs home, arrests his brother Times of Israel, 22 July 2017 The residents of Halamish set up an Israeli outpost near the settlement as a response to the attack. Legal status Upon the first work preparing the land, residents of the nearby Palestinian village Deir Nidham went to the Supreme Court of Israel and claimed private ownership of land to be used for settlement. Based on aerial photos from the turn of the 20th century, showing the disputed land to be barren, and Ottoman Empire land law specifying that land not worked for over ten years becomes state land, the land was declared state land and freed for settlement constructions. The residents of the nearby Palestinian village of Nabi Salih regularly protest against what they allege is the takeover of a spring by the settlers of Halamish. However, the spring was declared an \\"antiquities site\\" by the Civil Administration, located on private land belonging to inhabitants of Nabi Salih. Residents of Nabi Salih also assert that they are being prevented from working the fields around the spring. The protests have led to violent clashes, with Palestinian youths throwing stones and Israeli forces firing on protesters with tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons. Since the end of 2009, 64 people (13% of the village's population) has been arrested by Israeli forces. Bassem al-Tamimi, one of the leaders of the protests, who was declared a human rights defender by the European Union and a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International, has been arrested twelve times to date. On 24 March 2011 he was arrested and charged with incitement, holding a march without a permit, sending youths to throw stones, and perverting the course of justice. After an 11-month military trial, he was cleared of the central charge of incitement and of perverting the course of justice by an Israeli military court, but found guilty of taking part in illegal demonstrations and of soliciting protesters to throw stones largely based on the testimony of two Palestinian youths aged 14 and 15. After being released on bail on 24 April 2012, he was given a 13-month sentence in May 2012, corresponding to the time he had served in prison while awaiting trial. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to be illegal under international law, violating the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of civilians into or out of occupied territory. Israel however disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the West Bank and disputes their illegality.

Chromosomal landing reduces the problem of analyzing large, and/or highly repetitive genomes by minimizing the need for chromosome walking. It is based on the principle that the expected average between-marker distances can be smaller than the average insert length of a clone library containing the gene of interest. From the abstract of : :The strategy of chromosome walking is based on the assumption that it is difficult and time consuming to find DNA markers that are physically close to a gene of interest. Recent technological developments invalidate this assumption for many species. As a result, the mapping paradigm has now changed such that one first isolates one or more DNA marker(s) at a physical distance from the targeted gene that is less than the average insert size of the genomic library being used for clone isolation. The DNA marker is then used to screen the library and isolate (or 'land' on) the clone containing the gene, without any need for chromosome walking and its associated problems. Chromosome landing, together with the technology that has made it possible, is likely to become the main strategy by which map-based cloning is applied to isolate both major genes and genes underlying quantitative traits in plant species.

History The Viral Factory was founded in 2001 by Ed Robinson and Matt Smith. Their first venture was a collaboration with director Adam Stewart and creatives Richard Peretti and Gary Lathwell to create Headrush, an in-house promotional viral which gained the fledgling company its first web audience. Another collaboration with Adam Stewart; Moontruth aided in establishing the viral as a tool for public and media notoriety. One of The Viral Factory's first major corporate campaigns was a series of virals for the United States brand Trojan Condoms U.K / European launch. This in turn led to an increase in global blue chip clients and further viral campaigns with brands such as Microsoft, Ford and Coca-Cola. In 2010 The Viral Factory closed its USA branch. Style and content The Viral Factory work on feeding basic human emotions with anarchic versions of reality to get their client's message across, often using a mockumentry film technique or computer generated animation to convince the viewer that the footage is real.

Chuck Carbo was born in Houma, Louisiana, then moved with his family to the Zion City neighborhood of New Orleans in the early 1930s. Chuck and brother Leonard \\"Chick\\" Carbo sang in the choir at their minister father's church. Among their influences were the Golden Gate Quartet and the King Cole Trio. The brothers served in the Coast Guard during World II. After the war the brothers became affiliated with the Zion City Harmonizers gospel quartet. Taking the name the Delta Southernaires, the off-shoot group performed on Sunday mornings on WWEZ. In 1953 they auditioned for Cosimo Matassa at J&M; Studio with the songs John The Revelator and Bye and Bye. Matassa encouraged the group to consider singing Rhythm and Blues. Local guitarist and songwriter Adolph Smith wrote two songs for the newly rechristened Spiders, cut in their initial Imperial Records session. The R&B; single was a two-sided hit with I Didn't Want To Do It reaching #3 on the R&B; charts and You're The One following at #8. ‚ÄúChuck wasn‚Äôt just an important R&B; or doo-wop artist,‚Äù says New Orleans musician Deacon John Moore. ‚ÄúHe came out of the church. He was one of the members of the Zion Harmonizers, along with Sherman Washington. When the Spiders started recording [R&B;], they brought that old-time gospel sound with them. Their first record, ‚ÄòI Didn‚Äôt Want to Do It‚Äô and ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre the One,‚Äô was a big, local jukebox hit. The jukeboxes were a barometer for local radio and they picked up on it. Then it broke nationally and the group was on its way.‚Äù At the first recording session the group had misgivings, so also recorded two gospel songs which were unreleased until 1994. Imperial Records A&R; man and bandleader Dave Bartholomew took over the production work for The Spiders' follow-up releases, which were regional and local hits but didn't make the national charts. Conflicts within the group caused Chuck to leave, with Chick taking over lead vocals. The original Spiders reunited in 1955 to record Witchcraft which went to #7 on the R&B; charts. Chick continued to front the Spiders. Chuck cut two singles under his own name for Imperial before being dropped by the label in 1957. Chuck Carbo continued to record as a solo artist, cutting discs for Rex Records, and Ace in the 1960s. Perhaps his best known song as a solo artist was his 1970 single, \\"Can I Be Your Squeeze\\" on Eddie Bo's Fire Ball Records. Carbo continued to perform intermittently for the next several decades, though he took odd jobs (including as a truck driver) whenever he could not make a living performing. In 1988 Carbo recorded his first solo album Life's Ups and Downs on 504 Records, featuring guitarist Alvin Robinson, Dr. John, and Edward Frank. Second Line On Monday was released as a single. The flip side Meet Me With Your Black Drawers On (by Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham) got attention and airplay on WWOZ in New Orleans. This led to a follow-up album Drawers Trouble on Rounder Records in 1993 featuring Dr. John and Edward Frank. A second full- length The Barber's Blues followed in 1996. Carbo and his wife Gloria were the parents of nine sons and daughters. His granddaughter, Rolexis Delaney Schinsing is an actress who has appeared on HBO show Treme, OWN's Queen Sugar, and Daytime Emmy nominated network BYUtv's show Relative Race. Carbo died in July 2008, at the age of 82.

Price of Honour: Muslim Women Lift the Veil of Silence on the Islamic World. London: Little, Brown Book Group, 1994 from the age of six, when she was betrothed to Muhammad, to his death. Although the novel was originally scheduled for release in 2008, the publication run was canceled by Random House due to concerns about possibly inflammatory content. Domestic and international publication rights were subsequently picked up by other publishing houses. Cancellation Random House signed Sherry Jones to a two-book contract in 2007, offering her an advance of one hundred thousand dollars, with The Jewel of Medina scheduled to be released on August 12, 2008. The novel was to be featured by the Book of the Month Club and the Quality Paperback Book Club. Sherry Jones in √Örhus, Denmark, 15 March 2009 Prior to publication, the Random House publicity department solicited comment from Denise Spellberg, professor of history and Middle Eastern studies at the University of Texas. She reportedly described the book as \\"incredibly offensive\\" and a \\"very ugly, stupid piece of work,\\" suggesting that its \\"explosive\\" content could inspire violence among radical Islamic groups and thereby represent a threat to national security. Random House responded by canceling the publication run.

Irshad Manji wrote in The Globe and Mail that preemptive censorship was offensive to Muslims.Pre- emptive Censorship is Offensive to Muslims by Irshad Manji, The Globe and Mail, August 22, 2008. Adam Kirsch criticized Spellberg and Random House for depriving Muslims of the freedom to reimagine their religious tradition through the eyes of a novelist.Freedom's Gift to Religion by Adam Kirsch, The New York Sun, August 26, 2008 Carlin Romano argued that Spellberg's \\"aggressive act\\" was tantamount to advocacy of censorship.'The Jewel of Medina': Anatomy of a Ruckus by Carlin Romano, The Chronicle of Higher Education, September 19, 2008. Spellberg said that she did \\"not espouse censorship of any kind\\" and that she had \\"used [her] scholarly expertise to assess the novel....\\" Salman Rushdie derided the decision as \\"censorship by fear.\\" Andrew Franklin of Profile Books labeled it \\"absolutely shocking\\" and branded Random House editors as \\"cowards.\\" Bill Poser decried what he perceived to be suppression of speech deemed potentially offensive \\"out of fear of violence by religious fanatics.\\" Geoffrey Robertson argued that the publisher should pay Jones \\"substantial compensation\\" and recommended that the book be placed on a website \\"so everyone can read it.\\" Stanley Fish disagreed with the characterization of censorship, arguing that as a nongovernmental entity, Random House had simply made \\"a minor business decision\\" and that no free-speech concerns were implicated. For her part, Jones insisted that she had approached her topic \\"respectfully,\\" envisioning the novel as \\"a bridge builder.\\" Publication The cover of the Serbian edition, the first official edition of the book. The Jewel of Medina was published in Serbia in August 2008. After strong reactions from the Serbian Muslim community, Serbian publisher Beobook withdrew it from stores but returned it to shelves shortly thereafter to forestall widespread piracy. It remained the number-one bestseller in that nation for at least two months. On September 4, 2008, British publishing house Gibson Square announced that it would publish The Jewel of Medina in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, with founder Martin Rynja calling for \\"open access to literary works, regardless of fear.\\" Alvaro Vargas Llosa praised the firm's \\"willing[ness] to run the risk of not letting the threat of violence inhibit free expression.\\" The following day, Beaufort Books announced plans to publish the novel in America, signing Jones to a contract with a smaller advance but higher royalties. On September 27, 2008, Rynja's London home was firebombed. Three men were arrested on suspicion of commissioning, preparing or instigating acts of terrorism and ultimately convicted of conspiracy to recklessly damage property and endanger life.Adam Fresco, \\"Radical Muslims guilty of firebomb plot on publisher of Prophet Mohammed book\\", The Times, 15 May 2009.

Anjem Choudary and Omar Bakri Muhammad condemned the novel as \\"blasphemous\\" and Jones as \\"an enemy of Islam,\\" denouncing the story as \\"yet another chapter in the continuing war against Islam and Muslims.\\" Jones retorted that she was offering \\"the hand of peace with a book that is respectful\\" and urged Muslims to read the book and judge it for themselves.

Personal life Wilson was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the oldest son of Rev. Franklin Wilson, a well-known Baptist minister, and Virginia Appleton Wilson. He attended private schools and Columbian College (now the George Washington University) in Washington, D.C., and later studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). After leaving M.I.T., he continued his education in the office of Baldwin & Price in Baltimore. On October 16, 1877, he married Mary Wade of Virginia. The couple resided at 1013 St. Paul Street, Baltimore, and had a summer home at Monterey in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. They had one daughter, Virginia Appleton Wilson. Wilson was an active member of historical and professional societies. He was a member and secretary of the Maryland Historical Society, vice-president of the Sons of the Revolution, and historian for the Society of the War of 1812. He held many offices of the Maryland Society of Colonial Wars including treasurer, member of the council, chair of the membership committee and deputy governor general from Maryland for the national society. Wilson also served on the Baltimore Municipal Art Commission and was an early member of the Baltimore chapter of the American Institute of Architects, joining in 1879. He was a member of the University Club and a director of the Colonial Trust Company. The Wilsons were also involved in philanthropic work, with John serving on the board of governors of the Maryland School for Boys and as a trustee of the Baltimore Orphan Asylum, and Mary as the president of the asylum from 1896 to 1918.Baltimore Orphan Asylum, Annual Report of 1896. Wilson died at his home in Baltimore on April 17, 1927 following a brief illness. His estate was valued at $110,715 and was divided between his wife and daughter, who were given joint ownership of the Wilson homes in Baltimore and Pennsylvania. Professional life Wilson and his cousin, William Thomas Wilson, formed a partnership and named their new firm J.A. & W.T. Wilson, Architects. This architectural firm designed Baltimore homes from the end of the nineteenth century until William's death in 1907. Some of the more notable estates were built for Catherine L. McKim. He designed McKim's home first and then 14 more upon her property at Belvidere Terrace, all in the Queen Anne style. Wilson worked on the restoration of Fort McHenry, restoration of the Mount Clare estate and park, and the marking of the grave of Sir Robert Eden, Maryland's last colonial governor. Additionally, he designed the monument to the 2nd Maryland Battalion of the Confederate States Army (1st Maryland C.S.A. originally), on Culp's Hill in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, as well as churches and community and industrial buildings in Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia. On February 2, 1894, the Maryland State Senate requested that Wilson team up with the well known Annapolis artist Frank Blackwell Mayer to conduct a study of the feasibility of restoring the Maryland State House old Senate Chamber. The state wanted to restore it to the condition it had been in when George Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1783. After six weeks of working without pay, Mayer and Wilson issued their report on March 19, 1894, that listed items to be repaired, replaced or reproduced and estimated the total cost to be $6,150. They concluded their report with a recommendation that the work be started immediately. However, much to their dismay, the work was not begun until Governor Edwin Warfield acted on the issue in 1904 and 1905. Wilson, commenting on his act of charity, said, \\"It was a labor of love unto the end.\\" Notable buildings *Lea Laboratory (1887-1888), original campus of Wake Forest University, now Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

Established in 1957 the charity operates 31 Nuffield Health Hospitals and 111 Nuffield Health Fitness & Wellbeing Gyms. It is independent of the National Health Service and is constituted as a registered charity. Its objectives are to 'advance, promote and maintain health and healthcare of all descriptions and to prevent, relieve and cure sickness and ill health of any kind, all for the public benefit.' As a private provider, fees are charged to patients. In 2014 Nuffield Health had an annual gross income of ¬£711 million, making it one of the five largest charities in the UK. Nuffield Health operates 300 facilities including 31 private hospitals (29 in England, one in Glasgow, Scotland and a joint venture, Cardiff & Vale, Wales), 111 Fitness and Wellbeing Gyms across the UK, and five medical centres.  History  On 14 January 1957 the British United Provident Association (BUPA) established the Nursing Homes Charitable Trust to acquire and build community facilities equipped for the demands of modern medicine. In 1957 the President of BUPA, Lord Nuffield, suggested the charity might benefit from incorporating his name so was re-registered as the Nuffield Nursing Homes Trust (NNHT). At this time the Trust purchased the Strathallan nursing home in Bournemouth for ¬£23,150. It was closed for ten months to be refurbished and reopened as the first Nuffield Hospital. In its first ten years, the Trust acquired and modernised a total of six dilapidated nursing homes and built seven new ones, together providing more than 400 beds. The earliest purpose-built hospital opened at Woking in 1962; others followed at Exeter, Shrewsbury, Hull, Birmingham and Slough. In 1966, the NNHT opened a new flagship hospital in London‚Äôs Bryanston Square, at a cost of over half a million pounds. The Trust ran all sites on a strictly self-supporting basis, though non-profit-making lines. Charges from patients were expected to cover not only operating costs but repairs and depreciation. By 1982 the Nuffield Nursing Homes Trust had grown to 31 hospitals and 1,076 beds. In 1983, the trading name was changed to Nuffield Hospitals, the ‚Äònursing homes‚Äô element no longer conveyed the focus on modern hospitals rather than nursing homes. A new direction was taken in 2005 when Tweed Park and Sona Fitness were acquired and merged to become Proactive Health, a new business arm providing clinical health services to public and corporate members. In 2007 Cannons Health & Fitness was acquired increasing services to include physiotherapy, weight management and health assessments. In July 2008 Nuffield Hospitals, Proactive Health and Cannons merged to become Nuffield Health connecting fitness, prevention and treatment under a single brand, governance and management structure. The acquisition in 2014 of a further nine health clubs from Virgin Active, LA Fitness in Chester and in 2015 a further two sites in London (CityPoint, Moorgate and Market Sports, Shoreditch) broadened the Nuffield Health national network of Fitness & Wellbeing Gyms to 77 branches. Development In 2016, Nuffield Health acquired 35 Virgin Active clubs. Unconfirmed rumours put the value of the acquisition at ¬£80 million. Nuffield Health received planning permission in 2016 to build a new hospital on a five-acre site adjacent to the Manchester Royal Infirmary. In 2016, Nuffield Health announced their acquisition of cognitive behavioural therapy services into their health and wellbeing services. They can now offer emotional wellbeing services across Britain within fitness and wellbeing gyms and hospitals. In October 2016 the company formed a partnership with Doctor Care Anywhere, an online primary care provider, which will allow their corporate clients to offer employees 20 minute virtual GP appointments, at any time between 8am and 10 pm to suit their convenience, whether they are in the UK or abroad.

Life He studied the classics and theology at Einsiedeln; made vows in the Order of St. Benedict on 8 September 1772, and was ordained in May, 1777. He was engaged as teacher at the gymnasium of Einsiedeln and later at Bellinzona. In 1787 he held the position of librarian at his abbey, and in 1789 he was made director of the college at Bellinzona. During the French Revolution Tanner fled to the Tyrol, taking with him the miraculous statue, the head of St. Meinrad, and other valuables, and remained there until he could restore the treasures to the abbey. He was appointed pastor of St. Gerold in Vorarlberg in 1802, where he remained for three years, until recalled to act as master of novices. At the death of Abbot Beat in 1808 Tanner was elected abbot. He prudently accommodated himself to the political situation, and thus secured the existence of the monastery. He encouraged the pursuit of studies, renovated the buildings, and rebuilt the Holy Chapel which had been destroyed 1798 by the French. Although the village of Einsiedeln was no longer under his jurisdiction, he retained for it a solicitude which he showed in the years of famine (1816 and 1817). It was the intention of Pope Pius VII to create the new Diocese of Waldst√§tten out of the cantons Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden, to make Tanner bishop, and to constitute the monks of Einsiedeln as cathedral chapter. The matter was proposed in 1818, but was declined by the abbot and his capitulars. Works Tanner's writings are: *\\"Betrachtungen zur sittlichen Aufkl√§rung im neunzehnten Jahrhundert\\" (5 vols., Augsburg, 1804‚Äì1808); *\\"Bildung des Geistlichen durch Geistes√ºbungen\\" (Augsburg, 1807), of which a fifth edition appeared at Einsiedeln in 1846; his pedagogical works were published by his successor, Abbot Celestine M√ºller.

He is credited as one of the main founders of the community of Jackpot, Nevada, in the 1950s. He is namesake of two Nevada casinos he owned at different points in his career, Cactus Pete's casino in Jackpot and Cactus Jack's Casino in Carson City.Casino Chip & Gaming Token Collection - Cactus Jack's Casino 2001 Commemorative Booklet Piersanti was born in Superior, Wyoming, the youngest of six children. His parents were Italian immigrants. His family later moved to Ogden, Utah. While in Ogden in 1941 Piersanti purchased a local bar and grill with a card room and a pinball machine distribution company. In 1943 Piersanti enlisted in the United States Army and served during World War II.NARA - AAD - Display Full Records - Electronic Army Serial Number Merged File, ca. 1938 - 1946 (Enlistment Records) After the war Piersanti and his family were among the original owners of the Island Park Lodge in Island Park, Idaho, which opened in 1947. The property featured several slot machines owned by Piersanti. In 1954 the State of Idaho outlawed all forms of gambling. In response Piersanti moved his slot machine operation from Island Park to a site just south of the Idaho border on U.S. Route 93 in what was then considered a part of Contact, Nevada, in Elko County. The opening of Piersanti's establishment, Cactus Pete's Motor Lodge, was instrumental in the founding of the town of Jackpot. Originally a gas station with slot machines, by 1958 Cactus Pete's was so successful a 15-room hotel and aircraft runway were built to accommodate the growing numbers of visitors, mainly from nearby Idaho. Cactus Pete's was incorporated by Piersanti and others in 1956. This corporation is considered the forerunner of Ameristar Casinos, which currently owns the Cactus Pete's property.Ameristar Casinos - About Ameristar - History Piersanti sold his interest in Cactus Pete's in 1971. After a brief stay in Las Vegas, later in 1971 he bought the Senator Club in Carson City and renamed it Cactus Jack's Senator Club. Piersanti remained active in the Carson City gaming community until his retirement in 1989. During his final years he lived in the Lake Tahoe area.

The first excerpt of the opera appeared in 1983: \\"I'll Stake My Cremona to a Jew's Trump,\\" (from Volume V, Chapter 15) which appeared in an eponymous short documentary by Sara Jolly. It was written for electric violin and viola, both players (originally Alexander Balanescu and Elisabeth Perry) also simultaneously singing.

Virgin Records. 1988 The same year, he released \\"Love Is Certainly, at Least Alphabetically Speaking,\\" for soprano and band, the text of which was derived from Volume VII, Chapter 12. The following year, Nyman premiered the choral work, \\"The Abbess of Andouillets.\\" In 1985, \\"Nose-List Song,\\" the fourth section of the opera, made its premiere on the recording The Kiss and Other Movements. It was the first of Nyman's works to appear on a recording before being performed live.Nyman, Michael. The Kiss and Other Movements. Liner notes. Editions EG, 1985. The song is based on \\"Slawkenbergius's Tale\\" from Volume IV, Chapter 1, which depicts a visitor to Strasbourg from the Promonotory of Noses. It collects together most of the statements made about the visitor by Strasbourg's residents. As recorded, it is performed as a solo by soprano Sarah Leonard. All of the statements are included in the lyrics sheet, but lines 3-8 of the final stanza are omitted on the recording. The vocal line is mostly, but not entirely, in monotone, with the majority of musical ideas carried by the instrumental music, melodies built on a harmonic pinning of the dominant sevenths A, F, B, and, D. In 2001, Nyman premiered a dance he little thinks of, also intended for the opera score, derived from Volume VI, Chapter 1, written on a commission from Yorkshire.http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&State;_3041=2&workId;_3041=13080 None of this music appeared in Michael Winterbottom's film, Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story, for which Nyman is credited among the composers. Most of Nyman's music in that film is derived from the original soundtrack recording of Nyman's oft-recorded The Draughtsman's Contract. Nyman also includes his own arrangement of the Sarabande of George Frideric Handel that was featured famously in Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. This was included as a filmic reference to an eighteenth-century period classic and has not been suggested by Nyman as something he would include were he to complete the opera.

Early life and education During Shah Jahan's era, Mu·∏•ammad HƒÅshim from the fore fathers of Nanautavi had arrived to India from Balkh and settled in Nanauta. Nanautavi was born in 1832 (either in Sha'ban or Ramadan, 1248 AH) in Nanauta, a town near Saharanpur, India.

There he studied elementary books (kitabs) of Arabic grammar and syntax under Maulvi Nawaz. At the end of 1843, Mamlook Ali escorted him to Delhi. There, he studied various Islamic books. Later he was admitted to Madrassa Gaziuddin Khan.

Prior to his enrollment at Madrassa Gaziuddin Khan, he had studied books on logic, philosophy, and scholastic theology under Mamlook Ali at his house. He joined a study circle, which possessed a central position in India with regards to the teaching of the Qur'an and hadith. He studied hadith under Abdul Ghani Mujaddidi and he became a formal follower of Imdadullah Muhajir Makki. Career= Academic career  After the completion of his education, Nanautavi became the editor of the press at Matbah-e-Ahmadi. During this period, at Ahmad Ali's insistence, he wrote a scholium on the last few portions of Sahihul Bukhari. Before the establishment of Darul Uloom Deoband, he taught Euclid for some time at the Chhatta Masjid. His lectures were delivered at the printing press. His teaching produced a group of accomplished Ulama, the example of which had not been seen since Shah Abdul Ghani's time. In 1860, he performed Hajj and, on his return, he accepted a profession of collating books at Matbah-e-Mujtaba in Meerut. Nanautavi remained attached to this press until 1868. He performed Hajj for the second time and then accepted a job at Matbah-e-Hashimi in Meerut.  Polemical debates  On 8 May 1876, a \\"Fair for God-Consciousness\\" was held at Chandapur village, near Shahjahanpur (U. P.), under the auspices of the local Zamindar, Piyare Lal Kabir-panthi and Padre Knowles, and with the support and permission of the collector of Shahjahanpur, Robert George. Christians, Hindus, and Muslims were invited through posters to attend and prove the truthfulness of their respective religions. At the suggestion of Muhammad Munir Nanautavi and Maulvi Ilahi Bakhsh Rangin Bareillwi, Nanautavi, accompanied by numerous colleagues, also participated. All of these Ulama delivered speeches at the fair. Nanautavi repudiated the Doctrine of the Trinity, speaking in support of the Islamic conception of God. One newspaper wrote: > In the gathering of 8 May of the current year (1876), Muhammad Qasim gave a > lecture and stated the merits of Islam. The Padre Sahib explained the > Trinity in a strange manner, saying that in a line are found three > attributes: length, breadth and depth, and thus Trinity is proven in every > way.

Through his efforts, Islamic schools were established at various other locations as well.Profile of Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi on haqislam.org website Retrieved 16 August 2018 His greatest achievement was the revival of an educational movement for the renaissance of religious sciences in India and the creation of guiding principles for the madaris (schools). Under his attention and supervision, madaris were established in areas such as Thanabhavan, Galautti, Kerana, Danapur, Meerut, and Muradabad. Most of them still exist, rendering educational and religious services in their vicinity. Funding of these religious schools initially was done by the rulers of the Muslim states and the rich individuals of the Muslim Indian community. Under Muhammad Qasim Nanautvi's guidance, these religious schools, at least in the beginning, remained distant from politics and devoted their services to providing only religious education to Muslim children. The curriculum at these schools was studying the Quran, Hadith, Islamic law, and logic. Jamia Qasmia Madrasa Shahi was established under his supervision. Death and legacy Qasim Nanautavi died on 15 April 1880 at the age of 47. His grave is to the north of the Darul-Uloom.

It is located at 20 Main Street, between Park and Barnard Streets. The 2-1/2 story Romanesque Revival red brick building was constructed in 1858, not long after the separation of North Andover. It was designed by Boston architect Theodore Voelkers and built by local builders Abbott & Clement. The building design echoed that of the mills that dotted the town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history Andover Town Hall is located near the central intersection of Andover's main business district, on the east side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 28) between Park and Barnard Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a front- facing gable roof and Romanesque Revival styling. Its main facade (facing west) is divided into three bays, each set in a panel with a round-arch top. The entrance is in the center bay, recessed within a round-arch opening and sheltered by a canopy with balcony. Above is a tripartite round-arch window, a style replicated on the second-level windows on the front and sides. On the ground floor the entrance is flanked by wider arches which contain three-part storefronts with doors flanked by windows. The interior of the building houses town offices; its upper levels original housed a large ballroom, which was divided horizontally and vertically to provide additional office space in the 1920s. The town hall was built in response to the separation of North Andover in 1855, resulting in the loss of Andover's original town center. Following the separation, early town meetings were held in a local furniture store. Construction of this building was proposed in 1856, and the building was completed two years later. Its design, by Theodore Voelkers, an architect known for his mill designs, echoes those structures that were the source of the area's prosperity.

The diner was built in 1950 as #824 by the Worcester Lunch Car Company, as a custom job for James and Ann Evans. They had opened their first diner in Haverhill, also called Ann's Diner, in 1948, and moved it to the present site later that year. The business was successful enough that they ordered the present diner as a replacement. It was specifically designed to accommodate a separate dining room, and was opened in April 1950. The Evanses owned the business until 1960, after which it went through a succession of owners. From 1976 to 1987 it was owned by Norman Brockelbank and known as Norm's Place. The diner was closed between 1997 and 1999. In 1999 it was acquired by Pat Archambault, who restored it and reopened it as Pat's Diner. The diner is a classic barrel-roof diner, nine window bays long and three deep. The original entrances to the diner were at its ends, but the left one has been repurposed as a site for heating and ventilation equipment. The right side door retains its original steel door with sunburst motif, and the middle bay window on the front facade has been replaced by an entrance that projects from the diner's body. The barrel roof is covered by a rubber membrane, and extends to porches that covered the entrances at the ends. Behind the diner body is a wood frame single story structure, which houses the kitchen and restrooms. Unlike many New England diners, this structure has a gable roof. The diner's interior is unusual for its custom configuration. The right six bays have a typical interior setup, with four booths and fourteen counter stools, while the left three bays have a dining room arrangement. This area is separated from the counter area by a pocket door, and has six booths, three each lining the front and back walls. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 2003.

It can be viewed from nearby Wingaersheek Beach, Gloucester. It lies on the Annisquam River and is one of the four oldest lighthouses to surround the Gloucester peninsula as well as; Eastern Point Light, Ten Pound Island Light, and Thacher Island Light.  History  The first light station, a wooden tower, was established in 1801, after Congress gathered $2000 in April for the completion. The original building was tall, made of wood with a light resting 40 feet above the water. The building fell into disrepair and, in 1851, was replaced by an octagonal wooden tower of the same height. The original lighthouse keeper's house was repaired and, with alterations, has remained to this day; its floor plan resembles those at Race Point Light and Straitsmouth Island Light. It is a two-story, gabled roofed, wood-framed building. In 1869, a covered walkway was built between the house and the tower. In 1897, the current brick lighthouse was built on the same foundation as the previous two constructions. Some time after 1900, the covered walkway, added in 1867, to the keeper's house was replaced by an uncovered wooden footbridge. The second Annisquam Harbor Light which was replaced in 1897 In 1931, a foghorn was installed, but until 1949, it was used only from October 15 to May 15 to spare summer residents the noise.,Jeremy D'Entremont: Annisquam Light. New England Lighthouses: A Virtual Guide. (retrieved 23 October 2008) but was activated in the summer of 1949 only during day hours. The lighthouse's fourth-order Fresnel lens and foghorn was automated in 1974, and became occupied by the Coast Guard. The fog signal was first removed by the Coast Guard, but after complaints by fishermen and local boaters, it was re-activated and eventually automated as well. In August 2000 Matty Nally and his crew completed the replacement of 3,000 bricks in efforts of restoration. The interior of the lighthouse is equipped with a circular cast-iron staircase that leads to the top. The lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, and is one of the oldest lighthouses in Massachusetts. The original wooden keeper's house from 1801 is still used as a housing for United States Coast Guard personnel who manage the site. In 2000, a major restoration of the tower was conducted by the Coast Guard. In 2008, the building made an appearance, supposedly as a lighthouse in Maine, in the film remake The Women (starring Meg Ryan).

History The site where Arden was built was originally occupied by the c. 1678 Josiah Barnard House, which was described in 1829 as one of the nicest houses of its time. This house was torn down in 1846 to make way for the construction of Arden. It was built for John Dove, a Scottish immigrant who, along with Peter Smith, established the first flax mill in Andover. The builder was Jacob Chickering, a leading local builder, who may have had design guidance for Theodore Voelkers. Dove's family held the property until 1891. The buyer of the house was William Wood, who went on to found the American Woolen Company, and to develop the planned community of Shawsheen Village to the north. The estate is still in the hands of Wood's descendants. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

The 2.5-story Georgian house was built in 1740 by William Allen, and remains one of Gloucester's finest houses of the period. It is a typical house of the time, with a center chimney plan and a gambrel roof. The house was bought by Joseph Low in 1779; his daughter Elizabeth married Nathaniel Babson, and their son ended up inheriting the property. It remained in the Babson family into the 20th century, eventually being inherited by Low descendant Elizabeth Alling. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. US Department of the Interior's National Register of Historic Places description excerpts (1996): Description, location and environment The mid-18th century (1740) Babson-Alling House is one of two early dwellings that remain at Gloucester‚Äôs original town center. Once known as the Green, the central position of this inland area was usurped in 1738 when the First Parish Meetinghouse was moved eastward to the Inner Harbor where it remains (see Central Gloucester Historic District, and Boundary Increase). The Green area gradually declined over the next two hundred years until the mid 20th century when the north-shore corridor of Washington Street was ‚Äúimproved‚Äù with the Grant Circle Rotary to accommodate traffic from the newly constructed dual-lane State Route 128 (east-west). At that time the 17th century White-Ellery House (NRHP: 3/9/1990) was moved from its original location, roughly centered on the rotary, to its present position immediately north of the Babson-Alling House. These two well preserved early dwellings, along with a barn, stone walls and other landscape features provide a unique and multi-faceted glimpse into the city's origins. The remnant of a ca. 1930 scallop-topped wooden fence was placed on the Babson-Alling property to indicate the early position of Washington Street, but was replaced in April 2018 with a similar fence as a result of a car crashing through in December 2017. The Babson-Alling House is sited directly on the Grant Circle Rotary at the northeast corner of State Route 128 and Washington Street where it continues to face south. It is buffered from the intrusion of constant automobile traffic by a tall wooden fence (modern) and a screen of white pines on the west. A large front yard planted with mature weeping willows enhances privacy on the south. The setting of open fields to the north and east is substantially more compatible, providing a sense of the surrounding landscape during the period of significance. To the rear (N) the property abuts the White-Ellery House and an open field that is maintained in rough turf and edged by fieldstone walls and mature oaks. A large untended field provides the eastern border. Poplar Street, which runs behind (N) the two houses is an early to mid 20th century residential neighborhood. Summary evolution of the property The handsome and coherent appearances of the Babson-Alling property today results from three major periods of construction and remodeling. The gambrel roof house with its bold modillion cornice and massive central chimney is clearly a product of mid 18th century Georgian sensibilities. The east wing is either original or an early addition to the main block. During the Federal period fashionable entries with delicate fanlights and oval windows were added to the south facade and west elevation. At the same time, it appears that the landscape was enhanced by creation of a low rise with granite retaining wall as a pedestal for the house. In the early 20th century, ca. 1930, a delicate Federal Revival portico was added to the main entry and the yard was planted with white pines (W) and weeping willows (S), presumably as screens to increased traffic and encroaching development. At about the same time, a utilitarian board fence along Washington Street was replaced with a more decorative scalloped-top fence, a secondary wall with balustrade was added in front of the foundation, and a gazebo was erected southeast of the house. These complementary building and landscape features create a rich evolutionary overlay that illustrates the continuing history of the property. Current appearance of the landscape The main approach to the Babson-Alling House is from Washington Street (W) via an unpaved drive located immediately south of the barn. Leading to the west rear of the house, that drive is lined by a lilac hedge and enclosed by a wooden gate. A longer secondary drive, also unpaved, runs south from Poplar Street behind the White-Ellery House and the barn. The barn is sited between the two houses on the Washington Street (W) side. The 20,000 sq. ft. lot encompasses several landscape features that appear to have evolved during various periods in the property's history. Like the architectural changes, they are complementary, and add substantially to the property's ability to reflect changing fashions and tastes over a two hundred-year period. They also help to create an oasis of tranquility that contributes to the overall historic integrity of the property, helping to mitigate the intrusiveness of modern traffic patterns. The house now sits on a low rise defined by a granite block retaining wall which is a typical Federal period landscape device. The wall is broken in the center to allow three granite block steps to ascend laterally from the west (reoriented ca. 1930); three additional steps lead north to the entry portico. The retaining wall extends eastward beyond the house to a small shingled shed with pyramidal roof (ca. 1930). A fieldstone wall, which may date to an earlier period, continues eastward from the shed. A split rail fence of unknown date occupies the southeast corner of the front lawn area and extends northward to the stone wall that separates the Babson-Alling property from the Poplar Street field. Directly behind the house, fieldstone is replaced by finished granite blocks which seem to be a mid to late 19th century attempt to beautify the area immediately surrounding the house. The large front lawn is planted with mature willows and pines, and overgrown ornamental shrubs. Current appearance of the house Painting of Babson-Alling House The five by two bay house rises 2 and 1/2 stories from a high foundation of irregularly sized granite ashlar blocks, to an asphalt shingle gambrel roof with massive center chimney. The main block is extended by an early three story, three bay east wing that takes the set-back half-depth form that is characteristic of the North Shore and is commonly referred to as a Beverly jog (Old-House Journal). Two small one story gable roof eels frame the rear elevation. The entire building is sheathed with clapboard which was the original exterior material although individual elements have probably been replaced over time. The main block is trimmed with narrow cornerboards and watertable, and a handsome boldly projecting modillion cornice on the front and rear elevations. Unless otherwise noted, windows are simply framed and contain 6/6 sash that date to the Federal period. The symmetrical five bay south facade is centered on a well-detailed entry that reflects three compatible periods of development. Historic photographs reveal a surround consisting of paneled pilasters carrying an entablature with fanlight below. Those extant details probably date to the Federal period occupancy of Nathaniel and Elizabeth Low Babson, and appear to be contemporary with many of the landscape refinements. The present delicate portico, with its swelled roof supported on slender paired Tuscan columns, is a well conceived Colonial Revival addition dated to the 1930s. The double-lead entry with its raised field panels may be original. Two windows frame the entry on each side while five second story windows, aligned with the first story openings, are framed into the cornice. The two bay west elevation, where the two driveways terminate, is focused on a slightly off-center secondary entry that also appears to date to the Federal period. In this case, the composition consists of an enclosed hip-roof porch detailed with paneled corner pilasters and oval windows on the side walls. The entry, with its six-panel Federal door, is approached by two granite block steps. Two windows are located on the north side of the entry and one on the south. Two windows light both the second and attic stories where their heads are aligned with the main cornice and roof break respectively. The primary outbuilding is a wood-shingled wood-frame barn sited near Washington Street between the Babson-Alling (SE) and White-Ellery (N) Houses. It rises from a fieldstone and granite block foundation to an asphalt shingle covered gable roof. Built into the side of a small hill, it is one story at the north gable end and two stories at the south. A sliding door is located on the east side, and a similar element has been removed from the south gable end. Loading bays are located in both gables. One window retains a remnant of a 2/2 sash which would indicate a construction date in the late 19th century if it is original.left Archaeological description While no prehistoric sites are currently recorded on the property, it is possible that sites are present. The physical characteristics of the property including its elevated level to moderately sloping, well drained location in close proximity to Annisquam River wetlands indicate favorable locational criteria for Native American subsistence and settlement activities. Four known prehistoric sites are also recorded in the general area (within on mile), all of which border Annisquam River wetlands. Given the above factors, historic landuse of the property and the small size (20,000 square feet) of the lot, a moderate potential exists for locating significant prehistoric survivals. There is a high potential for locating significant historic archaeological remains on the property. Structural remains and/or construction features may survive from at least three major periods of construction and remodeling at the house since its construction in ca. 1740. Structural remains from outbuildings are also likely including barns, wood houses and storehouses. One barn is still extant between the Babson-Alling and White-Ellery Houses, however, at least one other barn, destroyed by fire in 1908, was also present close to the house. Occupational related features (privies, wells) are also likely on the property. Nineteenth century deeds for the house note at least two outhouses no longer extant. Many of the resources described above and other landscape features on the parcel together constitute a mid-nineteenth century rural landscape preserved on the property. * Darvill, Timothy, Christopher Gerrard and Bill Startin ** 1993 Identifying and Protecting Historic Landscapes. Antiquity 67(256): 563-574 Statement of significance Babson-Alling & White Ellery Houses Located at Gloucester‚Äôs original town center, the Babson-Alling House is one of the city‚Äôs finest examples of mid-Georgian architecture. Historically, the property is associated with some of the city‚Äôs leading businessmen and their families, and illustrates the changes in Gloucester‚Äôs maritime industry over the last 250 years. The Babson-Alling House possesses integrity of location, design, materials, setting, and workmanship, and meets Criteria A and C for listing in the National Register. The period of significance for the property is ca. 1740-1945. The Babson-Alling House originally stood in a prestigious location on the Town Green, to the east of the original First Parish Meetinghouse. Its construction is generally attributed to either Joseph Allen or his son, William, ca. 1740. Joseph‚Äôs father, also named Joseph Allen, was a blacksmith who had come to Gloucester in 1674 and settled in the Town Green area. The second Joseph (1681-1750) was ‚Äúengaged in trade, and became a citizen of considerable distinction, taking an active part in town-affairs;‚Äù he also served as a representative to the General Court for four yearsBabson, John J. History of the Town of Gloucester, Cape Ann. Gloucester, Mass.: Peter Smith, 1972. (Babson: 56). The parcel of land on which the Babson-Alling House now stands was purchased from Stephen Robenson by the second Joseph Allen ca. 1722-35. Several known deeds documents the family's early maritime connections. One, a 1728 deed from Joseph Allen, trader, gives his son Joseph Allen one-third part ‚Äúof the Good Scooner Called the Grahoune(,) Burthen Aboute Forty tons.‚Äù The second, a deed from Joseph Allen, trader, to his son Joseph Allen, ‚Äúshoresman,‚Äù in 1731/32, gives the son use of ‚ÄúMy Wharf that I Have Lying in the Harbor Joyning to Phelemon Warners Wharf & the Dock and flats Belonging to Sd. Wharf.‚Äù A third deed (dated 1733/34) describes the senior Joseph Allen as a merchant, and his son Joseph as a trader‚Äì both terms commonly associated with maritime pursuits during this period. Little is known of Joseph's son, William Allen, although he presumably continued ‚Äúin trade‚Äù like his father. A reliable local history states that ‚ÄúWilliam, born in 1717, built the large house east of the site of the old Meeting-house in Town (First) Parish, where he had a large family of children born to him‚Ä¶ He removed to New Gloucester, Me., on the early settlement of that town,‚Äù which began in 1742 (Babson: 56). Another source goes further, stating that ‚ÄúCol. William Allen, who married the daughter of Col. Osgood (Mrs. Mary Osgood of Andover, in 1745), lived in Gloucester during his early married life in a large house up in town‚Ä¶ Here was born to him fourteen children. About the year 1769 he removed to New Gloucester,‚Äù where two more children were born. He is said to have died in 1780.Cape Ann Historical Associate.

In 1765 Col. William Allen, with his wife Mary, sold the Babson-Alling property as ‚Äúthe House I now live in with about three acres of Land adjoining to said House‚Ä¶ which Land my late Father Joseph Allen Esq. bot of Stephen Robenson,‚Äù along with a small wood house and store house between the dwelling and the meeting house, two-thirds of a tract of ‚ÄúWoods Pasture‚Äù and ‚Äúa small Piece of mowing or planting Land‚Äù adjoining the Rev.

Robert Babson Alling‚Äôs Ancestors, Descendants, and Close Relations. Chicago: Privately printed, 1930 (revised 1959). (Robert Babson Alling: 77). The ca. 1740 construction of such a substantial, high style house here is remarkable, since the Town Green was clearly losing its status as the economic, religious, and social center of Gloucester at that time. A new meeting house was built at the Harbor Village in 1738, and the old Meetinghouse Green area was relegated from First to Fourth Parish by legislative order in 1742. Partial view of the house in 2014 The Babson-Alling House was bought in 1765 by Issac Smith, Esq., of Boston, an eminent merchant in the maritime trades and uncle of Mrs. Abigail Adams (the wife of John Adams, our 2nd President). Mr. Issac Smith was one of the wealthiest men in Boston and the owner of many ships and slaves. Two slaves he received when collecting from a bankrupt merchant further up Washington Street; One of these slaves was named Scipio Dalton, and it is thought he was moved up the street to live in the attic of the Babson-Alling House. Scipio Dalton would later be known from the Indenture between Isaac Smith and Scipio Dalton, (a slave) regarding his freedom, 20 June 1779, with addendum, 20-24 December 1779 (Massachusetts Historical Society) and his life following release. Issac Smith was very highly regarded, John Hancock called him \\"the most reliable man in Boston.\\" \\"He died in Boston in 1787, aged sixty-eight; having sustained through life a high character for honesty, benevolence, and intelligence.\\" (Babson: 372) In 1779, Issac and Elizabeth Smith, said to be of Boston, sold the Babson-Alling property‚Äîincluding the house, 3 acres of land adjoining, the wood house and store house, and the mowing or planting lands‚Äîto John Low, Jr. (1754-1801) of Gloucester. A 1773 graduate of Harvard College, Low was also a merchant, carrying on a fishing business on the Annisquam River. In 1775 and 1776, John Low, Jr. is described as a lieutenant in the militia, for the defense of the sea coast. His father, John Sr. (1728-1796) was also engaged in the trade and fishing business on the Annisquam River and became ‚Äúone of the most prominent citizens of this time‚Äù (Babson: 114). Probate records describe John Low Jr. as a merchant and captain. His minor children Lucy and Eliza inherited their father's estate, with the Babson- Alling House eventually passing to Eliza Gorham Low (1786-1862). Eliza was married in 1809 to Captain Nathaniel Babson (1784-1836), who came from one of the oldest and most prominent of Gloucester‚Äôs early families. Nathaniel Babson was a noted sea captain who made voyages to Scotland, Gilbralter, the Baltic region, and Russia. Among the vessels that he commanded were the sloops Fame and Columbus (the latter of which he was also the owner) and the schooner Charming Nancy. With two of his brothers, Nathaniel also owned the schooner Marion. Several of the letters he wrote to his wife from around the world have been preserved. After Babson retired from the sea, he farmed this estate that his wife had inherited from her father. Outside of his career as a merchant, Nathaniel Babson is also notable as one of the seven founders of the Congregational Church (1829), where he served as a deacon until his death in 1836. After Eliza Low Babson‚Äôs death in 1862, the Babson-Alling House passed to their six children, the youngest of whom, Gustavus (1820-1897) bought the property from his siblings and stayed on to work the farm. Although most of his brothers were seafarers like their father, Gustavus became a successful farmer, ‚Äúblest with rare good judgement and a will to work‚Ä¶ who would have made a success of anything he undertook‚Äù (Robert Babson Alling: 56-57). At the time that Gustavus Babson bought the estate, it included the same premises purchases by his grandfather, John Low, Jr.‚Äì comprises a dwelling house and three adjoining acres of land, outhouses, barns, ‚Äúa wood house or store house,‚Äù and other buildings‚Äì along with a substantial amount of separate, agricultural land. Gustavus Babson was married in 1845 to his first cousin, Susan Stanwood Low (1820-1880). Her father, David Low, was a brother of John Low, Jr. and a shipmaster to Northern Europe. Gustavus and Susan Low Babson had seven children, and the Babson-Alling House continued to pass down through the Babson family through the mid-20th century. Its residents included three of Gustavus and Susan's daughters: (1) Susan Babson (1852-1947), a teacher, writer, and active founding members of the Mass. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and of the Cape Ann Scientific, Literary, and Historical Associate (now the Cape Ann Historical Association); (2) Ann Prentiss Babson Alling (b. 1858), who moved here after the death of her husband in 1894 and shared responsibility for maintaining the homestead with her brother Nathaniel; and (3) Elizabeth Low Babson (1859-1892), an artist and prominent member of the Cape Ann Literary and Historical Associate. Annie Babson Alling's daughter, Elizabeth L. Alling, also remained at the Babson-Alling House and was active in civic affairs.

The design is particularly notable for its Georgian modillioned cornic, Federal period entryways, and Federal Revival front portico. In 1934, the White Pine ‚ÄúPencil Point Series‚Äù‚Äì a major documentary source for Colonial architecture‚Äì wrote that the house ‚Äúcontains one of the most beautiful all-paneled rooms in the State (and one of the two still remaining upon Cape Ann) with a most interesting staircase.‚ÄùWhitehead, Russell F. editor. The Monograph Series; Records; of Early American Architecture As Source Material. Volume XX, Monographs Four and Five: ‚ÄúThe Later Dwelling Architecture of Cape Ann, Parts I and II,‚Äù August and October 1934. (Whitehead, ed.: 162) Little altered, this sophisticated Georgian building represents a carefully considered architectural evolution through the Colonial Revival period in the early 20th century. A 20th century descendant's account of the homestead speculates that the original house probably had no ells and states that, upon his marriage, Gustavus Babson, Sr. added doorways between the front and back of the east end of the house on both floors, and partitioned the large back kitchen. The fireplace in the north kitchen became a parlor, and its large fireplace was reduced in size (Robert Babson Alling: 74). Of the outbuildings associated with the property, a large barn that was located close to the house was destroyed by fire in 1908. It was occupied by 10 cows, two horses, and a flock of hens (Robert Babson Alling: 78). The setting for the Babson-Alling House has changed since its days as the town center, with a rotary for state highway Route 128 (built in the 1950s) now loosely substituting for the original town green. The acreage associated with the house has been reduced, but adjacent open fields continue to give an impression reminiscent of its original, semi-rural setting. Archaeological significance Since patterns of prehistoric occupation in Gloucester are poorly understood, any surviving sites could be significant. Prehistoric sites in this area can help document the effects of sea level rise on Native American settlement and subsistence through time and the ways in which Native peoples adapted to that change. As a result of the property's location on Cape Ann and its proximity to ocean waters, prehistoric sites in this area may contain valuable information on fishery technologies, particularly towards the exploitation of more open water pelagic species including whales. Prehistoric sites in this area may also contain date relation to prehistoric tool technologies, particularly the extant to which local and regionally important volcanic complexes including the Lynn Volcanics complex were utilized on local sites. Historical archaeological remains described above have the potential to further document Gloucester‚Äôs original town center, once known as the Green, which currently survives at this and one other location. Controlled testing and excavation can document the 18th through 20th century landuse of the property, much of which is no longer extant above ground. Construction features and stratigraphic profiles can further document the phases of construction and remodeling for the house and provide physical evidence of the town center or Green which no longer survives. Detailed analysis of occupational related features can provide important social, cultural, and economic data on inhabitants of the house including several slaves living there in the 18th century. Landscape features can also contribute important information towards the significance of the house. These features are important in interpreting the long-term development of the complex, including its current situation on a busy traffic rotary. A great deal of recent scholarship has focused on archaeological landscapes from a holistic perspective, one that takes in account diachronic landscape change as a factor in the development of layered landscapesDarvill, Timothy, Christopher Gerrard and Bill Startin, 1993 Identifying and Protecting Historic Landscapes.

After the European Championship in Athens she switched to the Europe. Witteveen won an silver medal at the 2003 European Junior Championship. At the Open Week World Championships in Spain she finished 9th and her next goal was to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics, but these came to early for Witteveen. After the 2004 Olympics the Europe was replaced by the Laser Radial Witteveen decided to make that change.

It is centered on the crossing the Shawsheen River by Andover Street, and includes buildings on High Street, Center Street, and other adjacent roads on both sides of the river. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Ballardvale was the first planned mill community in Andover. John and William Marland were the principal investors in the Ballardvale Manufacturing Company, under whose auspices the area was developed. It was named for Timothy Ballard, who had previously operated a sawmill and gristmill at the mill location set up by the Marlands. For about 100 years between 1835 and 1935 there was a remarkably self-contained community here: in addition to the mills, it included shops, churches, a school, and a railroad station. The Marlands owned about of land which was developed for the community. Much of the housing was relatively modest cottages on small lots, with popular styling details of the time. Many of them were built by locally notable builder Jacob Chickering. One typical house is at 36-40 Center Street: it is a four family 2.5 story wood frame house with minimal Italianate styling. There are four major mill structures that survive. The oldest building, dating to 1836, is a four-story brick construction with granite trim. A wooden mill building (1844) stands adjacent, and there are additional buildings in the complex that were built later in the 19th century. One other notable structure is a c. 1872 wrought iron truss bridge that crosses the river below the mill complex.

Geometriae elementa ad philosophiam comparandam accommodata, 1734 Life He was born at Brescia, and received the religious habit in 1718. A philosopher and theologian, Fortunato was also renowned for his studies in the natural sciences. He was secretary general of his order, and stood in high favour at the Bourbon court of Spain. He died in Madrid. Works He was among the first to bring together the teachings of Scholastic philosophy and the discoveries of the physical sciences. His scientific work is rendered important by his extensive use of the microscope, in which he followed the lead of Malpighi. Avoiding the then prevalent discussions on vitalism, he devoted himself to a positive study of the problems of natural science. Convinced that a knowledge of microscopic anatomy is the key to the secrets of nature, he deemed two things to be of prime importance: #an experimental study of the histological constitution of the various organs, to learn their functions; and #the separation of these organs into their elements, to determine their embryological origin. This view, clear in the works of Fortunato, has prevailed in pathology and physiology. and in this sense Fortunato was a pioneer. He confined himself to the microscopic study of the parts of the organism, and in this way succeeded in classifying tissues and organs many years before Bichat (1800). Fortunato was the first to distinguish between tissues and organs. He established the idea of tissues, or, as he wrote, \\"of those organic parts which possess a definite structure visible with the microscope and characterized by their component elements\\". With sufficient accuracy he described connective and bony tissue. The morphological complexus of the various tissues he calls the \\"system of tissues\\"; and the physiological complexus of the various organs he calls the \\"system of organs\\". From his many accurate descriptions, it is evident that his researches extended to many animals, and particularly to insects. He innovated in comparative anatomy, with ideas not found in Malpighi, Morgagni, Leeuwenhoek, or Haller, the path-finders in microscopic anatomy.

There are some features that are suggestive of a later construction date, but these may also have been the result of alterations by Blanchard or his son, who inherited the property.

Its oldest portion dates to about 1740, but has stylistically older elements. It was moved to its current location from Saugus in 1956, before which it had undergone restoration. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The John Boardman House stands in a rural residential area, on the south side of Lawrence Road, a through street connecting Boxford center to the east and North Andover to the west. It is set at a distance from the road on of land, and faces Fish Brook, a tributary of the Ipswich River. It is a 2-1/2 story timber-framed structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It has a four-bay front facade, with the entrance in the center-right bay. The roof on the rear of the house (facing the street) extends down to the first floor, giving the house a classic Colonial period saltbox profile. The oldest features of the house are visible in its right- side rooms. The ground floor parlor has exposed timber framing, with an unchamfered summer beam, and a fireplace wall with feathered panels. The chamber above that room also has exposed framing. The entry staircase is a typical late First Period winding stair with a turned newel post. The oldest portion of the house, its right side, was built sometime between 1740 and 1760, based on stylistic analysis. Originally located in Saugus it is unusual for the types of First Period details present despite its comparatively late date of construction for that period. The house bears some resemblance to the house of John Boardman's grandfather, William (now a National Historic Landmark), which still stands in Saugus. When first built, it was a double cell plan central chimney structure; the leanto section in the back is estimated to have been added c. 1800. While still located in Saugus, the building underwent a restoration by Earl Newton with the assistance of Abbott Lowell Cummings. It was moved to its present location in 1956.

Centered on the former town common at South Main and Salem Streets, the area served as Bradford's civic and commercial center from about 1750 until its annexation by Haverhill in 1897, and retains architecture from the 18th to early 20th centuries. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The town of Bradford was settled in 1649, with its original town center east of the present common. In 1749 this area, located south of the ferry connecting the town to Haverhill (then limited to the north side of the Merrimack River), was given to the town by the Kimball family as a new town center. The oldest building in the district is a former tavern owned by the Kimballs, built about 1690. The village is predominantly residential in character, with the White Church (1848) a prominent fixture in the center. Former civic buildings of Bradford, including its town hall and fire house, have been repurposed; the town hall is now a public school. The largest non-residential portion of the district is the academic campus now occupied by Northpoint Bible College; this campus was originally that of Bradford College, one of the first coeducational academies to be founded. The historic district is centered on the triangular common formed by South Main Street, Salem Street, and Church Street. South Main and Salem Streets are both early colonial routes connecting Haverhill to Boston and Rowley. The district extends north along South Main to Carleton Avenue, and south past the college campus to Kingsbury Avenue. It extends a shorter distance along Salem Street. Most of the district's buildings are wood frame houses, 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 stories in height. They are in a diversity of styles, principally those that were popular in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The school was built by the town in 1890, and is a fine period example of Queen Anne styling, with a tall hipped roof, rounded windows on the first floor, and decorative brick details. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Bradlee School building is set high on a hill on the west side of Andover Street, overlooking the village of Ballardvale. It is a2-1/2 story red brick building, with a hip roof and an asymmetrically placed projecting gabled section at the traditional east-facing front. The building's massing is characteristic of the Queen Anne Period, with generally asymmetrical styling, and large gabled dormers on the sides. Its entrances (at the front and north side) are set in large round-arch openings, and the first-floor windows also have round arched tops. Belt courses of brickwork delineate the bases of the windows and the top of the rectangular portion of the windows. Second-floor windows are rectangular, with a belt course joining the granite lintels, and a corbelled cornice between the window tops and the roof. Gable ends have half-round windows at their centers. The school was designed by Lawrence architect George G. Adams, and was completed in 1890. It was the town's first school to be supplied with water from a municipal supply. Originally called the Ballard Vale School, it was rededicated in 1894 to Joseph Bradlee, the principal proprietor of the Ballardvale Mills at the time. At the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, the building stood vacant.

Bridge Street, the spine of the district is a thoroughfare connecting Salem to the bridge leading to Beverly. The district is roughly bounded by railroad tracks to its west, the shore of the peninsula to the east, On the north it is bounded by modern (post-1952) developments, and on the south it abuts the Salem Common Historic District. In addition to properties on Bridge Street, the district includes properties on side streets between March/Osgood Streets, and Howard/Webb Streets.

Village of The Red) is a mixed religious-secular Israeli settlement in the West Bank. It is located in the Judean Desert, on the southern bank of Wadi Qelt, about 2 miles northeast of the town Ma'ale Adumim. It is at 367 meters above sea level. It is organized as a community settlement and falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. In it had a population of . The Israel Central Bureau of Statistics counts the populations of nearby settlements Alon and Nofei Prat as part of the population of Kfar Adumim. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.  Etymology  The settlement name \\"Kfar Adumim\\" is taken from and :Bitan, Hanna: 1948‚Äì1998: Fifty Years of 'Hityashvut': Atlas of Names of Settlements in Israel, Jerusalem 1999, Carta, p. 41, (Hebrew) It literally means \\"Village of The Red\\". It takes its name from the red rock lining the ascent from the Dead Sea. History According to ARIJ, Kfar Adumim is located on 820 dunams of land which Israel confiscated from the Palestinian town of 'Anata.'Anata Town Profile ARIJ, 2012, p. 19 Kfar Adumim was established in September 1979. Its first settlers were 10 families that had seceded previously from the group which founded Ma'ale Adumim and had been living in Mishor Adumim. The nearby settlements Alon (1 kilometer to the northeast of KA) and Nofei Prat (1 kilometer to the west of KA) were founded in 1990 and 1992, respectively. Statistically, the populations of Nofei Prat and of Alon are counted as part of Kfar Adumim's population, but these settlements are separate municipal entities. The tiny settlement Mitzpe Hagit was founded in 1999 on the opposite bank of Wadi Qelt by a family from Alon, and is considered to be a borough of Kfar Adumim. A road was secretly built by the local settlers in 1995. The road joins Anatot to Kfar Adumim, Nofei Prat, and Alon. According to Pinhas Wallerstein, then head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, the road was one of a number of secretly built roads under construction in the area. Wallerstein claimed that as council head, he did not need permission to construct roads, but that he would stop construction if the Israel Defense Forces told him to.  Geography and Surrounding Landscape  Kfar Adumim lies on the southern bank of Wadi Qelt, locally known as Nahal Prat (Prat Brook), about 15 kilometers to the northeast of Jerusalem. It is located in the border region of the Judaean Desert, on a low ridge ranging in height between 200‚Äì450 meters above sea level. One of the 3 large springs of Wadi Qelt, Ein Fu'ar, or Ein Ma'bu'a, in Hebrew, is located near Alon. Nahal Michmash, Wadi Qelt's largest tributary, meets with Wadi Qelt about one kilometer to the north of Kfar Adumim. The road linking Jerusalem with the Dead Sea, Highway 1 (Israel/Palestine), passes to the south of Kfar Adumim, along a route similar to that of the ancient road that used to lead from Jerusalem to Jericho. Khan al-Ahmar is located between Kfar Adumim and Ma'ale Adumim.West Bank village under threat Al Jazeera, 22 February 2010 Kfar Adumim has a small industrial zone located along the road leading from Highway 1 (Israel/Palestine) to the settlement. In it are some small businesses, garages, a metalwork shop, a couple of carpentries, a gas station and some light industry.  The Kfar Adumim Association  Kfar Adumim is a Community settlement (Israel). It holds the legal status of a cooperative association for settlement. Most of the local residents are members of the association. The association appoints its members for positions in its institutions via an election process in which all members participate. These institutions include various committees dealing with education, culture, construction etc. The topmost authority of the Kfar Adumim association is its general assembly in which all members participate, and the decisions of which are binding to all members.  A Mixed Community  The purpose of the settlement's founders was to create a mixed community where religious and secular families could coexist. Already in its early years the settlement had absorbed many Jewish repatriates from different countries, most of whom remained there as permanent residents. An absorption center for new repatriates and for regular applicants who wish to be accepted into the association still operates in Kfar Adumim. It owns 25 mobile homes (caravans) scattered around the settlement. Children of permanent residents may also apply for membership in the association.  Acceptance of New Members  In order to become members of the Kfar Adumim Association, a family needs to go through a lengthy acceptance process, at the end of which the general assembly votes on their acceptance to the association. Many singles and families rent apartments in Kfar Adumim and live there without being members . Education As stipulated by the ideology of its founders, the children of Kfar Adumim go to a common school - the Experiemental Religious State School of Kfar Adumim. Although this school belongs to the Israeli religious state school system it serves as a mixed school for religious and secular students alike, and is set to accommodate the needs of both. over 700 students attend the schools, from 1st to 12th grade. They come mostly from Kfar Adumim, Alon and Nofei Prat. Most high school students study in the local high school, while some travel to schools in Jerusalem, or in various Yeshivas around Israel. The education system of Kfar Adumim also includes a nursery, for children over 2‚Äì3 months of age, and several kindergartens. The Ein Prat pre-military mechina is situated near Kfar Adumim, a couple hundred yards down the road leading from Kfar Adumim to Alon.  Employment  The average per-capita income of the residents of Kfar Adumim is above the national average. Most residents of Kfar Adumim work in Jerusalem while some work in the settlement itself. The occupations available locally are: * Education: work at the local school and kindergarten. * Local Administration and municipal services, including the local pool, post office and the local library. * Small businesses like the local grocery store, health food store etc. * Jobs available at the local industrial zone * Agriculture: the settlement has an olive grove, a plot of Opuntia ficus-indica (its fruit is also known as Barbary Figs), a plant nursery and a horse farm.

Built in 1809-10, they form the largest surviving brick building from the Federal period in the city. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and included in the Newburyport Historic District in 1984. Description and history Brown Square is a narrow rectangular park at the northern end of a city block on the west side of Newburyport's downtown, bounded by Titcomb, Pleasant, and Green Streets on the west, north, and south, and by Brown Square on the south. The Brown Square House occupies the western end of the block facing the park to the north. It consists of a pair of similar brick rowhouses, each four stories in height. It is covered by a hip roof with a dentillated cornice. The brick is laid in Flemish bond. Each unit is four bays wide, with the entrances at ground level in the innermost bays, set in arched openings with flanking sidelights and fanlights above. Windows are set in rectangular openings with brownstone sills and splayed lintels. The two rowhouses were built in 1809 and 1810 by Moses Brown, a Newburyport landowner, shipbuilder, and shipping merchant. Brown, who had given the Brown Square park to the city, had planned to build a much longer row, but suffered financial reverses and was unable to build more than the pair. Sometime before 1849 the building was adapted for use as a boarding house. In 1922 it was turned into a hotel, named in honor of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, a statue of whom graces the square. That hotel closed in 1948, but the building has since been rehabilitated and reopened under the same name.

Built in the 1660s or 1670s, it is one of the oldest surviving houses in Essex County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Brown House is located in a rural-residential area east of Hamilton center, on the north side of Bridge Street just east of its crossing of the Miles River. It is a 2-1/2 story timber-framed structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The main block is five bays wide, with a center entrance whose features date to a 1920s restoration. Like most early colonial houses this house was built in stages. The oldest portion, the central chimney and the rooms to its right, are estimated to have been built between 1662 and 1673, based in part on the use of roof constructions methods derived from East Anglian practices that fell out of favor after that time. The left side rooms were built later in the 17th century, using different roof construction techniques, as was a leanto section extending across the width of the house. The leanto was demolished in the early 20th century, but preservationist William Sumner Appleton was able to acquire some architectural elements for the collections of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England). The house was built either by John Brown Sr., who acquired the land in 1662, or his son Nathaniel, who was the next owner. It underwent a major restoration in 1920, which included adding a staircase replicating that of the Parson Capen House.

He was a painter, an anarchist-communist activist, and a poet. Early life He was born in Seville at Triana quarter into a very poor Romani family with rural origin. Until his death he was proud of his Romani and Andalusian origin. He first became involved with the visual arts as a simple worker in many porcelain factories of Seville, where he ornamented different objects, at the same time following the School of Craft Arts and Trade of the city. During the 1920s he created his political conscience at anarchist at the revolutionary centers of Iberian Peninsula: Seville and Barcelona. Later he took part in the Avant-Garde of European capitals where he lived as a refugee, especially Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Berlin, Vienna, Moscow and Leningrad. During this time and especially since he was a member of National Confederation of Labor (a syndicate founded in Seville in 1910) he proceeded as a draftsman in press, appealing for justice and being expressed without fear against Primo De Rivera's dictatorship and later against Francisco Franco. This was the essentiality of his commitment. Draftsmen syndicate Helios Gomez was the initiator and first president of a professional draftsmen syndicate in Spain with its residency in Barcelona, which he founded in the summer of 1936, to defend the republic through politically engaged posters. At first he was appreciated for his political avant-gardist designs in black and white, but he worked, exposed and published his pieces in Madrid and Catalonia, when he was dislodged from Andalusia in 1926. From Barcelona he was deported by the political authorities. He asked for lodgment first in France and then in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, and in the Soviet Union, where he met many Rroms from his country. Political commissar He fought on the front of art as well as in military fights during the Civil War in Spain, being a political commissar in Majorca, Madrid and then in And√∫jar. He was consigned to the responsibility of culture at 26th Division, Durruti column, and according to some witnesses he got together a battalion of Rroms to fight against the Nationalist faction. In 1939 he was constrained to go to France, along with 500.000 warriors of freedom from Spain. This massive migration is known in history as \\"Retirada\\". French authorities enclosed them in some concentration-camps and then they were deported to Algeria, which at that time was part of France, at Gelpfa camp. Gomez escaped from camp tortures on May 1942 and managed to get a passage to Spain, where he again engaged in illegal activities in the fight against Franco. In 1946 he was arrested again and was thrown into Barcelona jail without a trial or conviction, where he remained for 8 years. Although the decision for his discharge was signed in 1950, he was released only in 1954. He died in 1956. Paintings in jail In 1950 he painted in jail some frescos to honor prisoners and the Virgin Mary, who is the patron saint of prisoners as well as the city of Barcelona. Best known is La Verge de la Merc√© (Virgin of mercy) that can be admired until today in a cell close to the one of the prisoners sentenced to death. This cell was transformed into a sacred place and was named Capilla gitana, because of the Rromani inspiration of all characters, described to fresco. Unfortunately this fresco was partly covered by dye on ‚Äô70-‚Äô80, under the cover of hygiene. In reality the fresco was disliked in the way of prison authorities. It could be restored, but recently the city of Barcelona decided to destroy this historic jail, although it is a symbol of opposition to Francoist Spain and it was registered in the architectural fond of the country. Its destruction will bear the downfall of it that was discovered only in 2004. Helios Gomez has created this Capilla gitana in Francoist Spain and censorship, alone in his cell, against reticence and deceit, but during that time he has written also some verses: Credo del sur ‚Äì sonetos y romances (Credo From the South ‚Äì Sonnets and Romances, 1946), Erika ‚Äì canto de amor y lucha (Erika ‚Äì Songs of Love and Combat, 1946), Poemas (Poem, 1947‚Äì1950), Poemas sueltos (Poem on the Prowl), Otros poemas (Other Poems ) etc. The Cultural Association Helios G√≥mez, with its residency in Barcelona, does everything to protect and make known widely this outstanding heritage of the Rromani artist, draftsman and poet, but there are difficulties from authorities who, under the cover of various justifications, deny the values of this activity, however admired worldwide.

Early career in Australia Warne made his first-class debut for Victoria against Tasmania at the MCG in January 1927. He scored 20 in his only innings, and picked up five wickets in the match as Victoria won the game by an innings. Although he played several minor games for Victoria Colts over the next couple of seasons -- he once took 12 wickets against South Australia Colts -- his only other first-class appearance for Victoria came against Tasmania (again) in February 1929. Warne opened the batting in the first innings, but made only 1; he was more successful with 33 not out down the order in the second innings. He never played in the Sheffield Shield. Career in England and India It was five years before Warne would taste first-class cricket again, and when the time came it was in England, for Worcestershire, taking 3-33 in the first innings against Oxford University. Late in the season, he played three County Championship games, hitting 62 against Yorkshire. That winter, he went to India and after one appearance for the Indian University Occasionals against a Viceroy's XI, he played for Retrievers in the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament. After a win by a concession in the semi-final (opponents Hyderabad Cricket Association XI were heading for an innings defeat) Retrievers won the final against Freelooters by three wickets, although Warne's contribution was minimal (one wicket, one catch and 2 in his only innings). He then played for the Europeans against the Hindus in the Bombay Quadrangular, taking four first-innings wickets and scoring 49 and 1, though the Europeans were defeated by an innings. Warne was back with Worcestershire for the 1935 English season, and had the most successful summer of his career. He hit precisely 1,000 first-class runs (the only time he ever achieved that landmark), and took 44 wickets, by some distance his highest season's tally. From then until 1938, he was largely a county player, although in both 1935-36 and 1937-38 (but not 1936-37) he went back to India in the English winters to play for a variety of teams, including three times for the semi-officialObituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1995. Australians in 1935-36 and once in each season for the Europeans. His best first-class bowling return was the 6-51 he took for Worcestershire against Northamptonshire in July 1935, while in May 1936, he made his highest first-class score when he struck 115 for Worcestershire against Lancashire. After leaving the first class game, Warne played for Rishton in 1939 and 1946, before moving north to Lancaster in the Ribblesdale League, where he enjoyed great success and by June 18 1949, in barely two and a half seasons taking 266 league wickets.Lancaster v Leyland Match Programme June 18th 1949, accessed through Friends of Lancaster CC Facebook site Later career in South Africa Warne made no first-class appearances in 1939, instead turning out (with some success) as the professional for Rishton in the Lancashire League. He then went to South Africa and played once for Transvaal in 1941-42. His career came to an end the following season, when he played two games. The first was in December 1942 for The Rest against an Air Force XI, in which he scored 108; while his last first-class game of all came in March 1943, when he appeared for The Rest against the First South African Division; he took five wickets in the match and scored 21 and 42*. Warne's father Tom Warne played 46 matches, mostly for Victoria, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
