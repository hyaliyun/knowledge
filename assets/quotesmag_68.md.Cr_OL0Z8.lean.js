Plot An orphaned 13-year-old girl named Catherine ‚ÄòCat‚Äô Royal lives in the Theatre Royal, after the owner, Mr. Sheridan, who named her after the theatre, found her as a baby. She knows well the Theatre and its surroundings, later 18th century England. One night Cat overhears Mr.Sheridan and his colleague Marchmont, discussing a valuable diamond hidden in the theatre. Cat is intrigued, but she promised to protect it for Mr. Sheridan after he tells her that nobody can know about it as it is difficult to know whom to trust with this secret. Cat befriends an African boy violinist, Pedro, who arrives to be the musician‚Äôs apprentice. Cat also meets the aristocratic Avon family, the duke and duchess of Avon, and their children, Lord Francis and Lady Elizabeth, who are not as arrogant as other wealthy people, and actually want to be Cat's friends. She also meets Johnny, the new prompt with a rather unmistakable talent for art, specifically controversial political cartoons, and a mysterious past of which he does not speak much of, other than the fact he ran away from home at a young age. She learns that Johnny is the ‚ÄúCaptain Sparkler‚Äù accused of treason for the cartoons against the King of England. Cat soon also finds out that Johnny had had a romantic past with Lady Elizabeth, and would possibly be bidding for her in the marriage market if his situation was different. Pedro is told of the diamond by Cat, which she later regrets when she finds him looking for it in Mr Sheridan's office hoping it will give him payment for a boat to his homeland in Africa, where he can escape the grasp of slave traders. This is before Cat learns that the diamond is not a real diamond, but is a metaphor used by Johnny's friends to refer to him as to avoid giving away valuable information to those who might hand him over to the court. He is of value, because of the reward for his capture. However, a street gang led by Cat‚Äôs enemy Billy ‚ÄúBoil‚Äù Shepherd (\\"Boil\\" being a reference to the boil on his nose), learns about the diamond, and assumes it is a real diamond. He breaks into the Theatre to steal it, bringing a few members of the gang with him. Cat and Pedro manage to evade him, but Cat is arrested for having money that was supposed to be for smuggling Johnny out of England where he will be safe. The money was really pawned jewels from Elizabeth, which she had given Cat permission to take to the pawn brokers, but the people who arrest her do not believe this. Billy is also arrested for stealing the money, although it was not actually him who stole it, but two members of his gang. Johnny's father Lord Fitzroy, however, knows the true reason to why Cat had the money in the first place, and arranges for her to be set free. Unfortunately, Billy is also set free later on, and the two gang members replace him in prison. Johnny eventually gets out of England, with the help of Frank (Lord Francis), Lizzie (Lady Elizabeth) and Cat. Cat is reunited with her theatre and everyone in it. In the end, Mr. Sheridan tells her that there was no real diamond, which Cat is already aware of. Cat feels ashamed for not realizing it earlier, but Mr Sheridan reminds that in actual fact Johnny never was the so-called \\"diamond\\" and that Cat is the true diamond of the Theatre Royal, and the theatre would be nothing without its \\"Cat.\\"  Sequels  There are five sequels: *Cat among the Pigeons *Den of Thieves *Cat O'Nine Tails *Black Heart of Jamaica *Cat's Cradle and \\"Middle Passage\\".

The Gauze Brook, a tributary of the Bristol Avon, passes through the village. The Fry chocolate family trace their roots to Corston.John P. Fry Pedigree of the Family of Fry 1906  History  In the Domesday survey in 1086, Corstone was recorded as part of the Brokenborough estate held by Malmesbury Abbey, and there were approximately 54 households. Corston became a tithing of Malmesbury parish, its boundaries little changed since around 1100. The abbey's lands passed to the Crown at the Dissolution and in 1573 the estate was bought by Sir Walter Hungerford. In 1685 it passed from the Hungerfords to Robert Sutton, 2nd Baron Lexinton and later to the Earls of Radnor. The 6th Earl sold off several farms in the early 20th century. Malmesbury municipal borough was created in 1886, and in 1894 the remainder of Malmesbury parish, including Corston, was renamed St Paul Malmesbury Without. The population peaked in the mid-19th century, with 322 recorded at the 1851 census; numbers increased again in the later 20th century, partly through building of married quarters for RAF Hullavington.  Church  All Saints Church The Church of England church is dedicated to All Saints and is Grade II* listed. There may have been a church on this site in the 12th century. The present building has a 15th-century bell-turret with a short spire ‚Äì described by Pevsner as \\"impressive\\" ‚Äì but the rest was rebuilt in 1881 in coursed rubble with stone dressings; the chancel is from 1911. Inside is a 15th- century rood screen and a 17th-century oak pulpit. Anciently a chapelry of St Paul's at Malmesbury, in 1881 a vicar was appointed to the district chapelry of Corston with Rodbourne, with Corston as the primary church of the district. In 1951 the benefice was held in plurality with that of Foxley with Bremilham, and in 1986 was united with Great Somerford, Little Somerford and Seagry. Today the church is part of the Malmesbury and Upper Avon group. Transport The village is served by the Coachstyle 92 bus route, which runs once an hour between Malmesbury and Chippenham.

Moffit is the Director of the Center for Health Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank based in Washington D.C. As a former senior official at the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the United States Office of Personnel Management. Moffit has specialized in Medicare reform, health insurance, and other federal health policy issues for nearly three decades.Robert Moffit, Ph.D. The Heritage Foundation, 2011. Retrieved 8 August 2011.  Career  Moffit received his bachelor's degree in political science from La Salle University in Philadelphia in 1969 and his Masters and Doctorate from the University of Arizona. He served as an Assistant Director in the United States Office of Personnel Management during the Reagan administration, with responsibilities in both federal personnel policy and Congressional relations, as well as the Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Following his federal service, Moffit was a senior associate of the Capitol Resources Group International, where he assisted clients primarily in the field of federal health care policy. After joining The Heritage Foundation in 1991, Moffit gained notoriety with his draft of Heritage's analysis of President Bill Clinton's plan to nationalize the U.S. health care system. In 1993, The Washington Post ran a feature story detailing Moffit's criticisms of the Clinton proposal. Meanwhile, he called for a consumer-driven health care policy providing tax credits to help people buy health insurance of their personal choice. Recently, Moffit's team helped develop Massachusetts' health insurance reform initiative in 2005. The Massachusetts plan developed a new system that would allow employees in small businesses to choose their health plan through a statewide \\"health insurance exchange.\\" The exchange was one of the first in the country to provide a market-based approach to health care, enabling individuals to own a private and fully portable health insurance plan and take it with them from job to job. After Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney signed this plan into law, officials in almost two dozen states have asked Moffit and his colleagues to help them develop statewide market-based solutions for their health system problems. Media appearances During his professional career, Moffit has been a regular source for the media on health care issues. He has appeared on all major cable news channels and the broadcast networks. He has received public service awards from several organizations, including The American College of Eye Surgery, the Great Lakes Association of Clinical Medicine and the National Hispanic Family Against Drug Abuse. He has appeared on ABC News, NBC News, CNN, CNBC, Fox News and The Jim Lehrer News Hour. He has also published in such professional journals as The Catholic Historical Review, Health Affairs, Health Systems Review, The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy, The Journal of Contemporary Health Law and Policy, and The Journal of The Georgia Medical Association, as well as Modern Age, The Political Science Reviewer and Postgraduate Medicine. Moffit contributes to Controversial Issues in Social Policy (Allyn and Bacon, 2002), a university text, and his articles, quotes, and op-ed essays have appeared in a variety of American newspapers including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and The Washington Times, as well as in The Irish Independent.  Views on health care  Moffit's research has also involved him in debates over Medicare reform, how to ensure access to prescription drugs, and how to improve access to private health care coverage. As a longtime advocate of a consumer-driven approach, Moffit recommends that the government adopt a new program for the baby boomers entering Medicare in 2011 similar to the consumer-driven Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP), which allows members of Congress and federal workers to select coverage from a broad range of competing private health plans. Moffit has also been an advocate of the free market principles of consumer choice and competition since the early 1990s, when he chastised Congress for keeping such a system of choice and competition \\"exclusively for itself and federal workers while considering ways to impose vastly inferior systems on almost all [other] Americans.\\" ReferencesExternal links * The Massachusetts Health Plan: An Update and Lessons for Other States * Patients' Freedom of Conscience: The Case for Values-Driven Health Plans * The President's Medicare Budget Proposal: A Step Forward on Entitlement Spending * The Schwarzenegger Health Plan: A Great Leap Forward for Bigger Government * Moffitt, Robert Category:American political writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Robert Moffit"},{"id":"10876082","text":"Craignish (Scottish Gaelic, Creiginis) is a peninsula in Argyll, on the west coast of Scotland. It lies around south of Oban, and north-west of Lochgilphead. The peninsula is around long, and is aligned along a north-east to south-west orientation, in common with much of the landform of coastal Argyll. To the south is Loch Craignish, which contains several small islands. To the north are the Slate Islands, with the island of Shuna closest. Jura is only west of Craignish Point, the southern tip of Craignish. Craiignish war memorial There are two main settlements on Craignish, Ardfern on the south coast, and the modern village of Craobh Haven, established in 1983 as a holiday resort and marina, on the north. A single-track road, the B8002, runs along the south shore of the peninsula. Historic monuments There are a number of ruined duns on Craignish, as well as cup and ring marked rocks. One such site is Dunan Aula, a cist said to commemorate a Viking prince so-named, who fell in battle against the native Scots. At Kirkton, the remains of the early 13th-century chapel of Kilmarie still stand. A chapel on this site is said to have been founded by St M√°el Ruba, from whom the modern name is derived. The chapel was repaired in the 19th century, and again in 1926, and now houses a collection of 14th- and 15th-century sculptured grave slabs. Near the chapel is Craignish Castle, originally home of the Campbells of Craignish. A castle was established here in the early 12th century, although the extant tower house dates from the late 14th century at the earliest. The castle withstood a siege by Alasdair \\"Colkitto\\" MacDonald in the 1640s. A new wing was added between 1698 and 1710, and offices and stables were added around 1770. In 1800 the estate was sold to Campbell of Jura, and in 1837 a new mansion was built on the side of the tower house, replacing the earlier extensions. Design of the new mansion has been attributed to either William Burn or Joseph Gordon Davis. In 1850 the estate was sold again to the Gascoignes of Parlington Hall, Yorkshire, who made yet more changes. Half of the 1837 mansion has since been demolished, and a stair tower added on the new gable. Close to Craobh Haven is Lunga, a 16th-century tower house originally known as Daill. This too was built by the Campbells of Craignish, before it was sold to the MacDougalls in around 1785. It has been in the MacDougall of Lunga family ever since, and is now partially run as bed and breakfast accommodation. A memorial to two of the MacDougalls of Lunga, father and son, who died in the First World War, stands at the edge of Craobh Haven. The early 19th century paddle steamer PS Comet sank off Craignish Point on December 13, 1820. In literature Naomi Mitchison wrote of a visit to Craignish with her family: \\"We are up here in an incredibly beautiful place thirty place from a station, all very Celtic, islands and sunsets and sea lochs of blue paint. The gentry are rather alarming - those narrow cruel Highland faces, mouths and eyes a little twisted and arrogant and something too delicate and inbred about their hands and skin. But the farmers are capital red heads and very jolly to talk to, rather less dour than my own coast\\".Naomi Mitchison, \\"You may well ask\\", London, 1979, Part II, Chap. 14, (quoting a letter sent from Craignish to Stella Benson in the late 1920s). .

History  The Hill of Ward is the site of an Iron Age earthen ringfort, which was in later times associated with the Kings of Mide of and of Munster. The hill featured in Irish tales of Tlachtga and her father Mug Ruith, who was said to have ridden his flying machine roth r√°mach over it. In 1168 High King Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair held a massive gathering at the site. According to Giraldus Cambrensis in 1172 Tigern√°n Ua Ruairc King of Br√©ifne was killed there at a parley with Norman invaders. The hill got its English name from a landowner, Ward, who had been evicted from his land during the invasion of Oliver Cromwell in 1649. The land was given to a Roundhead soldier. The Ward family, whose forebears were landowners of the hill and after whom the hill was named, are living in County Meath today. Recent archaeological work has been done on the site, confirming that it was used as a ritual site for many years.Mullally, Erin. 2016. \\"Samhain Revival\\".Archaeological Magazine.

Plot summary  The short story ‚ÄúNeighbors\\" by Raymond Carver has a plot that follows the exploits of Bill and Arlene Miller who are left to take care of the Stone‚Äôs apartment. The plot is chronological and despite a few memories of the characters, the action begins when the Stones leave for their trip and ends after the Millers have gone through their apartment. It is clear that there is a close friendship between the two couples and it is also apparent that Bill and Arlene find their lives less exciting than that of their neighbors. When the Stone‚Äôs leave for their vacation, Bill goes over to the apartment to water the plants and feed the cat. As time progresses in ‚ÄúNeighbors\\", Bill becomes increasingly interested in his neighbor‚Äôs possessions, almost as though he is living through them simply by eating their food, drinking their drinks, and trying on their clothes. He even takes time off of work to spend time in their apartment, almost as if it has a magical quality that makes time fly by. It is also worth mentioning in this summary that Bill‚Äôs sex drive increases as he spends more time at the neighbor‚Äôs apartment, as does Arlene.

History The Taklung Kagyu lineage was founded by Taklung Thangpa Tashi Pal in 1180 CE. Like the other Sarma schools, it is part of the second founding of Buddhism in Tibet and incorporates the teachings of the early Kadam school. The Taklung Lineage teaches Mahamudra practices in particular. The main seat of Taklung Kagyu is located in the northern part of Tibet in a place called Taklung. In the 13th century, Choejey Sangye Won, the fourth lineage holder, established Riwoche Monastery in Kham.Riwoche This tradition later came to be known as the Marthang Taklung as distinct from the Lhasa Taklung. Eventually, the Taklung Kagyu school spread throughout Tibet, parts of Mongolia, China and even India. The current lineage holders are the 26th Taklung Shabdrung Rinpoche, the 7th Taklung Ma Rinpoche and the 7th Phakchok Rinpoche.History of the His Holiness Phakchok Rinpoches and Taklung Kagyu Lineage Short History of the Taklung Kagyu Lineage Lineage Marpa Lotsawa brought the Kagyu tradition from India after accomplishing his training with his main teacher Naropa, who in turn was the disciple of Tilopa, who received the transmission from Vajradhara and Vajrayogini. Marpa's main disciple was Milarepa, who is one of the most famous yogis in Tibetan history. Milarepa transmitted this lineage to Gampopa, who was already a prominent teacher of the Kadam school. Gampopa transmitted it to Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo, who was also a Kadampa. One of his main disciples was Taklung Thangpa Tashi Pal, who founded the Taklung Lineage.

Technical data The 16mm Kinor 1M has a turret- type lens mounting and a variable shutter. The 2M and the rare 3M models are supplied with a 10-100 zoom lens, which has front- and rear-mountable filters. The usual kit consists of four magazines, three 100-foot, and one 400-foot. Synchronized sound is achieved using a sync-pulse known as a pilot tone, and the motor generates an accurate 25 frames per second to attain this. Variable frame rates require a relatively cheap modification form third-party developers, or the factory-produced variable drive unit. This is very quickly and simply replaced. It is common to see this type of modification coupled with the addition of true crystal-sync. The cameras‚Äô use in the West is gaining popularity as filmmakers grow accustomed to Russian manufacturing quality. Compared with the Krasnogorsk series of Russian cameras, the build quality is of a higher standard, although these too are well-designed units.

PopulationRefugee Camp (Bundesbetreuungsstelle f√ºr Asylwerber) Refugee camp in 2015 Camp in Traiskirchen Traiskirchen is home of the largest refugee camp in Austria and one of the largest of these camps in the EU. The refugee camp is based in the centre of Traiskirchen on the area of the former Imperial Artillery Cadet Schoolhttp://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi- content/anno?apm=0&aid;=nfp&datum;=19031014&seite;=25 which was built in 1900. The Traiskirchen Cadet School could accommodate up to 340 cadets, 160 staff and 110 horses (for riding lessons). During the time of the Allied-occupied Austria, a Soviet army barracks of (about 2,000 Soviet armored troops):de:Fl√ºchtlingslager Traiskirchen and a hospital were housed in the former buildings until the autumn of 1955. The buildings were first used by the government as a refugee camp between 1956 and 1960. The camp was first used as a shelter for Hungarian refugees, who had left their country as a result of the Hungarian Revolution in November 1956. 113,810 people came to Austria on the 5th of November, and 6,000 were taken to the camp in Traiskirchen. This was the first large use as a refugee camp, and following this it was decided to host further refugees from around the world. On 8 March 1957 the Federal Ministry of the Interior assigned 20 million Schillings (‚Ç¨1.45 million) for the renovation of the building structures. After the Prague Spring (1968) Czech and Slovak refugees were brought here. In the 1970s and 1980s more refugees ‚Äì mainly from Eastern Europe, but also from Uganda, Chile, Iran, Iraq and Vietnam ‚Äì were accommodated. Many prominent refugees were initially received here, including the later Vienna State Opera Director Ioan Holender and the journalist http://www.unhcr.at/mandat/fluechtlinge/prominente-fluechtlinge.html#c1644 Paul Lendvai. In May 1990 it was announced by the Mayor of Traiskirchen that, in line with the promise by the Minister of the Interior, the institute would be closed permanently. However this plan was rejected, because only a few refugees could be accommodated elsewhere in 1990; also it was expected that accommodation for new refugees from the Soviet Union would be needed in January 1991. In 1993 the refugee camp was renamed the Asylum Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior (\\"Bundesbetreuungsstelle f√ºr Asylwerber\\"). In 2015, as a result of the European migrant crisis, the Asylum Office had to admit an increasing number of illegal immigrants. Following strong criticism from the press and the public, Amnesty International inspected the facility on 6 August 2015. By the end of July 2015 more than 4,500 people were being accommodated. On 5 August, the day before the inspection, the authorities declared a stop to further admissions. Nevertheless at the time of the inspection around 1,500 people were unsheltered, among them more than 500 unattended children and teenagers. According to the Amnesty report the conditions at the refugee camp were inhumane and unworthy of any human being: lack of staff and translators, lack of organization, food supply problems (two hours wait), terrible sanitary conditions, no separate sections for women and men, and a point system for punishment for fighting but also for complaints, resulting in spending several nights outside the facility.https://www.amnesty.at/de/view/files/download/showDownload/?tool=12&feld;=download&sprach;_connect=332 Issues Traiskirchen refugee camp is frequently subject to political and media debate in Austria. Refugees' poor living conditions have been criticized, and the inmates have been associated with drug dealing, theft and violent crime. The police are often accused of conducting semi-legal actions in raids both inside and outside the camp. In 2003 Interior Minister Ernst Strasser outsourced the camp to the German company European Home Care. This (criticized)http://no-racism.net/print/749/ contract was cancelled by the company in 2010 because of low occupancy.

It was once the site of one of London's docks, and was later the site of the Mermaid Theatre. The dock was filled in during redevelopment in the 1960s and 1970s.  As a dock  View of docks on the north bank of River Thames, with St Paul's Cathedral behind, in the 1820s. Puddle Dock is situated at the far left. Berkeley's Inn, the town house of the Barons Berkeley of Berkeley Castle, Gloucestershire, stood nearby, at the south end of Adle Street, against 'Puddle Wharf', as reported in 1598 by John Stow in his Survey of London, at which date the house had been abandoned by the family and had been split up into multiple-occupation apartments, in a dilapidated state. Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, son-in-law of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley, lodged in this house, in the parish of St. Andrew-by-the- Wardrobe.Quoted in Thornbury, Walter, Old & New London, Vol.1, 1872, pp.302-3 In an article on Puddle Dock by Charles White in 1920A dissertation on Puddle Dock (by Charles White), Pall Mall Gazette, 29 January 1920, p2 he describes it thus : Puddle Dock is situated at the Western extremity of Upper Thames Street, near our Blackfriars station. It is a square opening in the river bank, between two blocks of warehouses, a place where the dark, drift-strewn waters of the Thames flow right up to the streets of the City. Barges still put in here to discharge their cargoes, as they have done for many centuries. It is the smallest of the draw-docks of Thames-street, the quayside of old London and the germ of what is now the greatest of the world's ports. Charles White notes that in the deed relating to the sale of the remains of nearby Baynard's Castle in 1275, the sale also includes all other things belonging to the said castle, or barony, as well in rents, his ports and putting in of ships. He suggests that this is Puddle Dock, and is the same dock referred to as wharf at Castle Baynard in Liber Albus and other city archives. He points out that the present Castle Baynard wharf in Thames Street dates back no more than 2 centuries or so, and the so-called Castle Baynard that stood there has no connection with the original Castle Baynard built by William the Conqueror. Recent studies tend to support this view with Puddle Dock found to lie \\"within the south-eastern corner of the outer defences of the Baynard's Castle\\" according to a 1989 study. There is an indirect link to Shakespeare, as he gifted in his will a house to his daughter, Susanna Hall, a house described in the conveyance as \\"abutting upon a streete leading down to Puddle Wharffe on the east part, right against the King's Majesty's Wardrobe ... now or late in the tenure of one William Ireland or of his asignee or assignees.\\"Shoreditch Observer, 30 Jan 1909, p5 Puddle Dock suffered a major fire in 1841 causing \\"utter destruction to the large bonded warehouses and stores belonging to Messrs Smith & Co, corn factors, situated near Puddle Dock\\".Great Fire in London, Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser, 14 Aug 1841, p6 The warehouse facing the Thames was 7 stories high, and \\"the principal front fell with a tremendous crash into the river, about 5 o'clock in the morning.\\" Puddle Dock appeared to be one of the outlets for the London sewers before the great Victorian reforms in that area with numerous complaints in the 1830s, and in 1849 an account stated that \\"in the course of mid-day, not only waggons arrived loaded with putrid filth, but bones in the worst state of decomposition\\".\\"Puddle Dock Nuisance\\", Morning Advertiser, 23 July 1849, p2 However Puddle Dock wasn't alone on this and in complaints in 1849 in relation to raw sewage mentions \\"Puddle Dock, Whitefriars Dock, Broken Dock and other parts of the shores on the Thames within the City, where the contents of the sewers are discharged\\".Court of Common Council, Morning Post, 27 Jul 1849, p7 In 1852 Puddle Dock was mentioned all over the country in an advertisement about the application of sewer treatment to the sewer in Puddle Dock from 1849, which it claims permitted \\" the conversion of the sewage into dry manure, postable in sacks and perfectly inodorous\\".The City of London Sewage Manure Company, Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard, Sat 30 October 1852, p1 After then the dock gets very little mention in the newspapers. In 1872 there was another major fire at the City Flour Mills built on the \\"Old Puddle Dock\\".Destruction of the City Flour Mill, Upper Thames Street, Reynold's Newspaper, 17 Nov 1872, p1 The building is described as \\"the largest flour mill in the world\\", and was 250 feet long, 60 feet wide and 8 stories high. It was owned by Messrs J & J Hadley, who had built the premises in 1852 on a vacant piece of land stretching to the riverside, and within it there were steam powered grinding mills as well as a large grain store.Burning of the City Flour Mill, Morning Post, 11 Nov 1872, p4 In 1909 it was reported that the wardsmen of Castle Baynard had been petitioning to fill the dock in.Shoreditch Obesrver, 13 January 1909, p5 The Mermaid Theatre was opened in 1959 in a bombed out warehouse alongside Puddle Dock, and the dock was still usable after this, with the Thames sailing barge Henry visible in postcards of the theatre from around 1960. The redevelopment of the area was a protracted affair, with Simon Jenkins of the Illustrated London News commenting in 1971,The blight around Blackfriars, Illustrated London News, 1 October 1971, p35 of the \\"Blight around Blackfriars\\" with the destruction of the Gothic and renaissance warehouses. He refers to the barge that was in the Puddle Dock \\"just 10 years\\" ago alongside the Mermaid Theatre, which is now \\"an underpass slip-road\\".  Later use  The area was dramatically altered by major works over a long period of time from in the 1960s and early 1970s, involving the reclaiming of foreshore of the River Thames at Puddle Dock and the rebuilding of Upper Thames Street as a major traffic thoroughfare. Today its name survives as the name of a street connecting Upper Thames Street and Queen Victoria Street. Puddle Dock formed part of the marathon course of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The nearest London Underground stations are Blackfriars (Circle and District lines) and St. Paul's (Central line).

Geography The river Triesting runs through the market town of Trumau. The town is situated between the south-west and north-east part of the Wiener Becken, on a sea level of 202 m. Trumau spreads over 18,57 km¬≤ and houses 3465 inhabitants. History The town was founded during the late Middle Ages, as a gift from the Babenberger Leopold IV to the Heiligenkreuz monastery. Town name The middle high German word ‚Äödrum‚Äô means endpiece. In the case of Trumau it could mean the end of the meadowlands. In ancient documents, Trumau appears in the following versions: between 1137-1340: Trumowe, 1139 Drumau, 1178 Drumawe, between 1233 and 1294 Drumowe, between 1303 and 1306 Drumbuowe, 1340 Drumenaw, 1380 Drumpnaw, 1388 Drumpnow, 1463 Thrumbaw. Rumor has it that it was often referred to as ‚Äö drum√∞o‚Äô among the inhabitants. PopulationCulture and Sights=Parish church For more than 840 years, there has been a connection between the parish church of Trumau and the Zisterzienser monastery. In the course of the counter-reformation, under the reign of the Habsburgs, many parishes were founded. The emperor Rudolph II as well as bishop Urban, got the approval of Abbot Udalrich Molitor to build the parish church of Trumau in 1583. They agreed on the patronage one year later. At this time the parish of Trumau was under the control of the parish Traiskirchen, which was incorporated with the monastery Melk. The abbot of Heiligenkreuz arranged the construction of the church, which was then verifiably built by the master-builder \\"Maister Andre Stuber zu Paden\\". The work of the chisellers was carried out by the Italian brothers Elias and Alexius Payos, who were masters in this kind of work, from monastery‚Äôs own delf. The church was finished under Abbot Johannes Ruoff, and it was inaugurated by bishop Hector von Passau on February, 22nd 1588. John the Baptist is its patron saint. Castle The castle of Trumau is a moated castle in Trumau in Lower Austria. From the beginning it has been in the ownership of the Zisterzienserstift Heiligenkreuz. The castle was a present from the Babenberg‚Äôs Margrave Leopold IV. in 1138. In the 12th century, a grange was built by the Zisterzienser at the place where the castle is standing nowadays. At that time there has also probably been a water ditch, an overflow spillway and a mill with a mill stream. The Zisterziensers practiced agriculture, viniculture and sheep-breeding there. Towards the end of the 1st Austrian T√ºrkenkrieg the courtyard was rebuilt from 1548 to 1558 because the estate had been totally destroyed in 1548. The building was burnt down by Hungarian rebels in 1621 during an anti-Habsburg riot. In 1650, abbot Michael Schnabel arranged the rebuilding to a castle, which was finished in 1667. Emperor Leopold I. lingered several times at Castle Trumau. Since 1959, the castle also has a sundial. During the 5th Austrian T√ºrkenkrieg the castle was heavily damaged in 1683. In course of the rebuilding, the towers were gravely changed. Further fires like in 1811 and 1880 damaged the castle again and again. The last restorations took place from 1993 until 1995. Two sundials were discovered in the inner yard. In 2009, the International Theological Institute moved into the castle Trumau. References * Hermann Watzl: Schloss Trumau. Seine Baugeschichte.

In rice  Symptoms of bacterial panicle blight include seedling blighting and sheath rot in addition to panicle blighting, which accounts for most of the damage from this disease. Affected panicles have blighted florets, which initially show white or light gray on the basal third with a dark-brown margin and eventually become straw-colored. The florets then turn dark with growth of fungi or bacteria on the surface. Extensive occurrence of upright panicles because of the failure of grain-filling and seed development is a typical phenomenon observed in a severely infested field. Prolonged high temperature during the growing season is an important environmental condition that promotes the development of bacterial panicle blight. Severe epidemics of this disease, which caused up to 40 percent yield losses in some fields, occurred during the 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000 and, most recently, 2010 growing seasons, when record- high night temperatures were experienced. Suspected global warming could make bacterial panicle blight a greater threat to rice production in the future. Indeed, occurrence of bacterial panicle blight is increasing not only in the southern United States but in other rice growing countries of Central and South America and Asia. The disease cycle of bacterial panicle blight is not fully understood in spite of the economic importance of the disease. The bacterial pathogens are considered to be seed-borne, but they also survive in the soil. After germination of the seed, the bacteria appear to survive on the leaves and sheath and spread upward as the plant grows. Their infection to rice panicles occurs at flowering, if the bacterial population reaches to a threshold level and environmental condition is favorable. They may also be disseminated from severely diseased panicles to neighboring healthy plants, according to the observed spatial distribution patterns of the disease in infested rice fields. However, it is not clear if long-distance dissemination can occur via insect transmission. Unfortunately, there are few effective control measures for this disease so far. Less nitrogen fertilization reduces disease severity but has not been successful. High temperatures at the vulnerable period can be avoided by early planting, but this cultural practice would become useless if hot weather comes early in the growing season. No pesticides are currently recommended or allowed for controlling this disease in the United States. Copper compounds are weakly effective but sometimes toxic to the plant. Oxolinic acid is useful for seed treatment, and its foliar spray is effective on infected plants, but this chemical is not commercially available in the United States. The research goal on bacterial panicle blight is to develop effective disease control methods based on better understanding of the bacterial virulence mechanism and the rice defense system. To achieve this goal, LSU AgCenter scientists are conducting several different areas of research. First, scientists are making efforts to develop new rice varieties and lines resistant to bacterial panicle blight through conventional breeding and line development processes. More than 15,000 lines are evaluated annually to select promising lines showing high levels of disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight and other good agronomic traits. The partial-resistant rice varieties and lines, such as Jupiter and LM-1, were developed from this program. Second, scientists are conducting genetic and molecular biological studies on the rice disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight. Genetic mapping to identify the rice genes associated with the disease resistance is under way. In addition, the induction of a rice defense system by pretreatment of various chemical materials, which leads to enhanced disease resistance, is being studied. Finally, scientists are studying molecular genetics and genomics of the major pathogen, B. glumae, to understand the mechanism underlying its bacterial pathogenesis in rice. Genetic elements governing the production of virulence factors are being identified and characterized.

For the outfit, Afghanistan was good place to obtain weaponry and others goods. In 1974, PFAR carried out series of bomb attacks in various cities of Pakistan. The outfit also claimed responsibility for bomb explosions at a political rally in Karachi. The political rally was to be attended by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. In the same year, Pakistani security forces launched series of counter-terrorism operation against the outfit. Iran also offered external assistance to these counter- terrorism operations. Iran supplied Pakistan with Gun-ship helicopters and pilots to assist Pakistan. As a result of the counter-terrorism operations, the outfit was considerably weakened and it lost its ability to carry out guerilla attacks against Pakistan.

Merged into Lanxess in 2017, the company focused on specialty chemicals for various industrial sectors, and these were transportation (including automotive), energy, and electronics. Chemtura operated manufacturing plants in 11 countries. Its primary markets were industrial manufacturing customers. The corporation employed approximately 2500 people for research, manufacturing, logistics, sales and administration. Operations were located in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. In addition, the company had significant joint ventures primarily in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the company's global core segment revenue was $1.61 billion. Chief executive officer was Craig A. Rogerson, who was also the president and chairman of the board of Chemtura Corporation. On April 21, 2017, Chemtura was acquired by the German chemical company Lanxess. History=Founding and early years Chemtura Corporation was the successor to Crompton & Knowles Corporation, which was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1900 and engaged in the manufacture and sale of specialty chemicals beginning in 1954. Crompton & Knowles traces its roots to Crompton Loom Works incorporated in the 1840s. A 19th century print depicting the Crompton Loom Works In the late 1800s, Worcester, Massachusetts was a leading manufacturing center that attracted inventors and manufacturers. Both William Crompton and Lucius J. Knowles made the city their home and opened their respective loom companies there. Both were the top loom manufacturers in the world. However each company based the method of weaving on a different premise. The companies later merged (in 1879), becoming one entity known as \\"Crompton & Knowles Loom Works\\". Still supplying the world market, the new company now applied both theories of weaving. Meanwhile, in 1843 Charles Goodyear formed the Goodyear Metallic Rubber Shoe Company, Connecticut. A year later he patented the vulcanization of rubber. Goodyear's company then became one of nine companies that formed the founding of the United States Rubber Company in 1892 by Charles R. Flint also in Naugatuck, Connecticut. The rubber company manufactured a large array of products through two world wars, the Cold War, and became the Uniroyal company (Uniroyal Incorporated) in 1961. In 1986, Uniroyal Chemical Company was formed as a subsidiary of Avery Inc. Then, in 1989, Uniroyal Chemical Company Investors Holding bought Uniroyal Chemical Company from Avery and became Uniroyal Chemical Corporation. In 1996, Uniroyal Chemical Corporation went public and merged with Crompton & Knowles. In 1999, Crompton & Knowles merged with Witco to form Crompton Corporation. In 2005, Crompton acquired Great Lakes Chemical Company, Inc., of West Lafayette, Indiana, to form Chemtura Corporation. Additionally, Great Lakes Chemical Corporation still existed as a subsidiary company of Chemtura. By January 2014 the company had manufactured and marketed a new brominated polymer flame retardant, replacing the traditional hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) flame retardant. Acquisitions and DIP (2007-2012) By the end of January 2007 Chemtura completed stock acquisition and ownership of Kaufman Holdings Corporation with an all-cash transaction. The corporation operated as a debtor-in-possession (DIP) under the protection of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York from 10 March 2009 through 10 November 2010. On September 26, 2012, Chemtura entered into a Business Transfer Agreement (BTA) with Solaris ChemTech Industries Limited, an Indian Company, and Avantha Holdings Limited, an Indian Company and the parent company of Solaris ChemTech. As provided in the BTA, Chemtura agreed to purchase from Solaris certain assets used in the manufacture and distribution of bromine and bromine chemicals for cash consideration of $142 million and the assumption of certain liabilities. Acquisitions and sales (2012-2013) In April 2013, Chemtura completed the sale of its Antioxidant business to SK Blue Holdings, Ltd, and Addivant USA Holdings Corp. for $97 million, $9 million in preferred stock issued by Addivant and the assumption by SK and Addivant of pension, environmental and other liabilities totaling approximately $91 million. Additionally, Chemtura paid $2 million in cash as part of a pre-closing adjustment. On May 15, 2013, Chemtura purchased the remaining 50% interest in DayStar Materials L.L.C. from its joint venture partner, UP Chemical Company. As a result, DayStar became a consolidated entity. The purchase price was $3 million in cash which approximated the fair value of the remaining share of the assets and liabilities, primarily inventory and fixed assets, as of the purchase date. In addition, Chemtura reimbursed UP Chemical for a $3 million loan they had made to DayStar. In December 2013, Chemtura completed sale of its Consumer Products business, including dedicated manufacturing plants in the United States and South Africa, to KIK Custom Products Inc. for $300 million and the assumption by KIK of pension and other liabilities totaling approximately $8 million. Recent developments (2014-2017) On April 16, 2014, Chemtura entered into a \\"Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement\\" to sell its Chemtura AgroSolutions business, led by President and GM Nelson Gibson, to Platform Specialty Products Corporation for approximately $1 billion, consisting of $950 million in cash and 2 million shares of Platform‚Äôs common stock. The sale became final on November 3, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the company's global core segment revenue was $1.61 billion. On September 25, 2016, Chemtura announced they had accepted an offer from Lanxess AG of Germany of 33.50 per share, all cash. The boards of both companies unanimously approved the deal that September, with Chemtura's enterprise value estimated at about US $2.7 billion. After US antitrust authorities approved the deal in December 2016, Chemtura shareholders approved the acquisition in February 2017. On April 21, 2017, Chemtura was officially acquired by Lanxess for $2.1 billion in cash. It was the largest acquisition in Lanxess' history, with Lanxess absorbing around 2,500 Chemtura employees at 20 sites in 11 countries. Products and distribution channels Chemtura operated in various industries including automotive, construction, electronics, lubricants, packaging, plastics for durable and non-durable goods and transportation Most products were sold to industrial manufacturing customers for use as additives, ingredients or intermediates that add value to their end products. Additionally, the company considered itself a strong competitor in the global market, based on its ranking of its products within given sectors as defined by sector industries and operating segments. Business segments The company had two reporting segments: Industrial Performance Products, including the Petroleum Additives and Urethanes businesses; Industrial Engineered Products comprised the Great Lakes Solutions and Organometallic Specialties businesses. =Industrial Performance Products= This segment markets synthetic lubricants and greases, synthetic basestocks, lubricant additives, and urethanes. =Industrial Engineered Products= This segment marketed brominated performance products, flame retardants, fumigants, and organometallics. Locations and facilities The company had plants in 11 countries, in locations such as Connecticut, New Jersey, Arkansas, Germany, Italy, China, Taiwan, Mexico, Brazil and the United Kingdom. On April 21, 2017, the company's locations were acquired by Lanxess.

The government controlled various mountainous areas along Greece's northern border, adjoining the communist states of SFR Yugoslavia and Albania, and was seen as the succession of the World War II-era \\"Mountain Government\\" of the Communist-led EAM-ELAS Resistance movement. History The Greek Civil War had broken out in spring 1946, but it was not until June 1947 that the Greek Communists announced their intention to form a separate government. This move was announced by leading Party member Miltiadis Porfyrogennis at the Congress of the French Communist Party, in a move designed to garner publicity and highlight the support of other Communist parties and governments to the Greek Communists' cause. The formation of a separate government was not only a renunciation of any chances of reconciliation with the royal government in Athens, but also implied also a move away from guerrilla warfare towards a more \\"regular\\" structure. This was in accordance with the Yugoslav-inspired \\"Lakes Plan\\", which envisaged the creation of a regular army of 50,000‚Äì60,000 men and the occupation of large parts of northern Greece, ultimately including Greece's second city, Thessaloniki, where the new government would base itself. The new government's formation was announced on 23 December 1947, with Markos Vafiadis, the leader of the Communists' Democratic Army of Greece (DSE), as its first chairman. The government was composed exclusively of Party members, with Giannis Ioannidis serving as Vice Chairman and Foreign minister, Petros Roussos as Justice Minister, Miltiadis Porfyrogennis as Health and Welfare Minister, Petros Kokkalis as Finance Minister, Vassilis Bartziotas as Agriculture Minister, Dimitris Vlantas as Minister of National Economy and Leonidas Stringos as Minister of Supply. Notably, Party General Secretary Nikolaos Zachariadis was not a member of the government. The new government actively tried to present itself as a revival of the ideology and practices World War II-era National Liberation Front, which had dominated the Greek Resistance movement. It was also notable for its active protection of the minorities living in northern Greece, especially as these tended to support the Communists against the nationalist royal government. On 25 December, the DSE attacked the town of Konitsa, intending to seize the city as the new government's headquarters. According to testimony by Vafiadis, Zachariadis had expressed the hope that if the city fell and became the Communists' capital, the PDG would be recognized by the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc states. The attack lasted until 4 January 1948, but ended in failure. In the end, the PDG was never recognized by any government, because the Soviets feared a widening of the conflict into general warfare between the West and their satellite states in the Balkans. Soviet premier Joseph Stalin told Zachariadis in February 1948 that the neighbouring governments would only recognize the PDG after other countries had first done so. As the national government pushed the DSE back in 1948, Vafiadis clashed with Zachariadis over the pursuit of the war. Finally, he was ousted from his position as PDG chairman on 7 February 1949, and Zachariadis himself assumed the position until 3 April 1949, when he was succeeded by Dimitrios Partsalidis. Following defeat by government forces in the Battle of Grammos, the Provisional Democratic Government was defeated in the Civil War and left Greece on 28 August 1949. The PDG survived in exile until they were finally dissolved in October 1950.

In addition, the company had significant joint ventures primarily in the United States. Net sales in 2014 were $2.2 billion. As of December 31, 2014, Chemtura's global total assets were $2.7 billion. Environmental impact Great Lakes is the largest U.S. methyl bromide supplier in the U.S. producing more than 40 million pounds annually at their El Dorado, Arkansas plants. Great Lakes Chemical's involvement in the bromine business has its roots in leaded gasoline. When tetraethyl lead (TEL) was invented as a gasoline additive back in the 1920s, it was found to leave a corrosive byproduct in the engine. Adding ethylene dibromide (EDB) to TEL solved the problem. As leaded gasoline began to be phased out in the U.S., Great Lakes developed international markets for its products. Globalization of leaded gasoline makes TEL responsible for nearly 90 percent of airborne lead pollution in Third World cities. Some EDB in leaded gasoline converts to methyl bromide when burned. The World Meteorological Organization has determined that the continuing exhaust from automobiles using leaded gasoline is one of the three potentially major sources of atmospheric methyl bromide.CorpWatch : Great Lakes Chemical Corporation Great Lakes was a major producer of polybrominated diphenyl ethers.

It now sees fairly regular trains across the line except for the branch, which is still technically open but is fenced off from the public and not on any timetables. History Engineered by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway's Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, the first section of the line was opened in 1847 to aid the transport of goods to and from Newhaven. The line was extended in 1864 to serve the holiday town of Seaford. There used to be extensive sidings at Newhaven Docks and even a railway swing bridge over the River Ouse to connect to the other side. These have now been removed or have become overgrown, as has the defunct station, which has been fenced off from the public. Once a thriving station serving ferries to and from France, the walk of just under 1/4 mile to station and the cessation of winter ferries forced its closure. The line was electrified (750 V DC third rail) by the Southern Railway in 1935. The line between and was reduced to single track to save costs in 1975. Route *Services, generally originating from , stop at on the East Coastway Line, the last station before the branch line splits off. *The branch line starts at Southerham Junction on the East Coastway Line. *The first station on the line is , which serves the village of Southease and also has links to the South Downs Way *The line then continues, running alongside the River Ouse to , which is the station serving the town centre of Newhaven, across a swing bridge over the nearby river. *The following station no longer serves ferries to France. **Immediately after Newhaven Harbour station, a small branch splits off to . Originally built to link with cross-channel ferries, this short branch line is now closed to passengers, but the track remains in situ. *The line then becomes a single-track and is one of a few single-track third-rail lines in the country. *It passes the closed station of , and over a foot crossing that offers access to the abandoned village of Tide Mills. *The line then straightens out and calls at two more stations. ** (serving the village of Bishopstone and the western end of Seaford) and ** (the end of the line, serving Seaford town centre) Train services Train services are operated by Southern. Class 313s and Class 377 \\"Electrostars\\" are used on the line to transport passengers to Lewes, Brighton and London. The normal off peak train service on the line is two trains per hour between Brighton and Seaford calling at London Road, Moulsecoomb, Falmer, Lewes and then all stations on the branch line. Occasional peak hour services continue towards London Victoria via Haywards Heath, Gatwick Airport and East Croydon. At off peak times, connections with services towards London can be made at Lewes. Passenger volume Comparing the number of passengers in year beginning April 2002 to the year beginning April 2010, Southease has increased by 96%, Newhaven Town by 45%, Bishopstone by 58% and Seaford by 56%.

It opened in 2002. In September 2005, the state signed a contract with the for-profit GEO Group, Inc. of Boca Raton, Florida, to run the prison. The facility is rated as minimum- to medium-security, but also has a maximum-security psychiatric unit and annex. It is currently the second-largest prison in Indiana, and can hold approximately 3,270 inmates. Riot of April 24, 2007 On Tuesday, April 24, 2007, it was about noon when a disturbance in the prison dining hall occurred. A little after 2:00 p.m., the local New Castle police department responded en masse, as did forces from the Henry County Fire Department and Sheriff's Department. Sheriff's Deputies from adjacent Delaware County, along with elements of the Indiana State Police also responded. Reportedly, it started with a cluster of Arizona prisoners transported there against their will consequent to a memorandum of understanding with the state of Arizona and GEO Group. They refused to wear state-issued smocks over T-shirts as a display of non-compliance during the midday meal. This is when Captain Deaton stepped in and tried to handcuff several offenders and was severely beaten by three inmates. These prisoners were reportedly picked for being non-violent and generally getting along with the rules; it is suggested the Arizona convicts felt they were, in effect, being punished for obeying the rules, and had they been less compliant back in Arizona, they would have remained there. An earlier deal with California fell through when that state was unable to come up with enough non-violent prisoners willing to volunteer for the transfer; the Arizona convicts were transferred on a non-voluntary basis. This was not the first time Arizona transportees had been involved in prison disturbances in other states. Two news helicopters from regional NBC and CBS affiliates provided live images carried on MSNBC's WTHR, and Fox News. Piles of burning debris and smoke plumes were evident, reportedly mattresses, combustible furniture and garbage.Riot at the Private Prions in New Castle, Indiana, WTHR, April 24, 2007. Retrieved 12 April 2016. Within two hours, full order and authority was restored, though some inmates continued to be audibly angry for some time afterwards. Shortly after 3:30 p.m., J. David Donahue, then the Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Correction, reported that conditions were returning to normal. Two correctional officers were reported to have received very slight injuries. Seven prisoners were treated for minor injuries at the prison. The state suspended the transfer of additional Arizona inmates pending an investigation. Governor Mitch Daniels said the transportees directly involved in the disturbance would be returned to Arizona. Aftermath The DOC moved 69 Arizona transportees to the Reception Diagnostic Center in Plainfield, Indiana where they were placed in segregation the night of the riot. A month after the riot, a \\"post-event analysis\\" was released by the Indiana Department of Corrections. While placing blame on the Arizona transportees, the report admits failings on the Indiana corrections side as well, mainly understaffing and poorly trained personnel, but also very vague rules about what the Arizona prisoners were expected to do.

These chemicals may react with sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the earth's atmosphere, and are implicated in the formation of aerosols, which are an important factor in controlling global climate. Criegee intermediates are also an important source of OH (hydroxyl radicals). OH radicals are the most important oxidant in the troposphere, and are important in controlling air quality and pollution. The formation of this sort of structure was first postulated in the 1950s by Rudolf Criegee, for whom it is named, but it was not until 2012 that direct detection of such chemicals was reported. Infrared spectroscopy suggests the electronic structure has a substantially zwitterionic character rather than the biradical character that had previously been proposed.  Formation  Ozone reacts with an alkene to form a carbonyl and a carbonyl oxide, known as a Criegee intermediate. Criegee intermediates are formed by the gas-phase reactions of alkenes and ozone in the earth's atmosphere. Ozone adds across the carbon‚Äìcarbon double bond of the alkene to form a primary ozonide, which then decomposes to produce a carbonyl (RR'CO) and a carbonyl oxide. The latter is known as the Criegee intermediate. The alkene ozonolysis reaction is extremely exothermic, releasing about of excess energy. Therefore, the Criegee intermediates are formed with a large amount of internal energy.  Removal  When Criegee intermediates are formed, some portion of them will undergo prompt unimolecular decay, producing OH radicals and other products. However, they may instead become stabilized by interactions with other molecules or react with other chemicals to give different products. Criegee intermediates may be collisionally stabilized via collisions with other molecules in the atmosphere. These stabilized Criegee intermediates may then undergo thermal unimolecular decay to OH radicals and other products, or may undergo bimolecular reactions with other atmospheric species. In the ozonolysis reaction sequence, the Criegee intermediate reacts with another carbonyl compound (generally the aldehyde or ketone byproduct of the Criegee-intermediate formation reaction itself) to form a molozonide.

The cells are rod-shaped and motile by means of a single polar flagellum.Garrity, George M. (2005). Bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology, Volume Two: The Proteobacteria, Part B: The Gammaproteobacteria New York: Springer Etymology ‚ÄòHydrocarbonoclastic‚Äô means ‚Äòhydrocarbon dismantling.‚Äô These bacteria were named as such because they can degrade the major components of oil. History Both the genus Marinobacter and the species Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus were first identified and described in 1992 by Gauthier et al. Using polymerase chain reaction to analyze by 16sRNA DNA, Gauthier showed that it was a member of the gamma group of the Proteobacteria, with sufficient distance to other described Proteobacteria to warrant the creation of a new genus. In 2005, Marquez and Ventosa from the Department of Microbiology and Parasitology of the University of Sevilla in Spain used ‚ÄúG+C content, fatty acid composition, and DNA-DNA hybridization‚Ä¶ to understand the taxonomic positions‚Äù of Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus and Marinobacter aquaeolei. ‚ÄúMarquez suggests that the two species be united under the same name since they are heterotypic synonyms due to phenotypic and phylogenetic traits.‚Äù In 2011, Hamdan & Fuller discovered that Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclastus, die when exposed to the chemical dispersant COREXIT EC9500A used to treat the Deepwater Horizon oilspill. Genome Structure The genome of Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus has a 52.7% guanine + cytosine content. Evolution and Phylogeny Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus are a type of eubacteria. 16sRNA DNA analysis indicates that these organisms are related to the gamma group of Proteobacteria. Initial 16sRNA phylogenetic analysis did not reveal any close relatives to Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus. Therefore, the organism was placed in a genus of its own, with scientists believing that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was its closest modern relative. In 1999, 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus to have a very close relative in Marinobacter aquaeolei. The two organisms contain 16S rDNA sequences with 99.4% similarity. The organisms from the genus Marinobacter have been found to have high diversity in terms of the environments they inhabit. Marinobacter species have been discovered in ‚Äúhypersaline bacterial mats, marine hot-water springs in Japan, [and] cold seawater as in Arctic and Antarctic regions.‚Äù Morphology and Description Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus are Gram-negative and rod shaped. Their cells are, on average, are 0.3-0.6 ¬µm in diameter and 2-3 ¬µm long. Their ability to produce flagella is largely dependent on the NaCl concentration of their environment. In solutions with NaCl concentrations of 0.6-1.5M, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus produce and move by the movement of ‚Äúa single unsheathed polar flagellum.‚Äù In solutions with NaCl concentrations <0.2 or >1.5, M. hydrocarbonoclasticus are unable to produce flagella, and are thereby unable to influence their movement through medium. Metabolism Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus cells contain no cytochrome P450, which is the key enzyme for degrading aromatic rings, a major component of petroleum hydrocarbons. These organisms are adapted to growing on long non- cyclic alkanes, which are common in petroleum hydrocarbons. Cells can grow on aromatic hydrocarbons, such as hydrocarbons containing aromatic rings. Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus are not obligate hydrocarbonoclastic organisms; they can also grow on standard medium, without hydrocarbons. Moreover, Marinobacter cells can denitrify, producing nitrogen gas. They can use either nitrate (NO3‚àí) or nitrite (NO2‚àí) as their terminal elector. Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus cells can grow in aerobic liquid medium culture and form colonies on agar, showing that they are not obligate anaerobes. Growth, Reproduction, and Behaviour Marinobacter form discrete well-rounded colonies on plates, indicating that they reproduce via binary fission. Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus can grow with or without the presence of oxygen. Their cells are tolerant of high salinities. They are capable of growing up to 3.5 Molar NaCl, but grow best at around 0.6 Molar, which is the molar of the Mediterranean seawater where they are isolated. They can grow as free plankton or as fixed elements of a biofilm. Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus cells degrade hydrocarbons and excrete osmoprotectant ectoine (Site du Genoscope). They also excrete Petrobactin, ‚Äúa bis-catechol Œ±-hydroxy acid siderophore that readily undergoes a light-mediated decarboxylation reaction when bound to Fe(III).‚Äù Significance in Technology and Industry Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclastus degrade petroleum hydrocarbons, including those found in oceanic oil spills. In 2011, it was discovered that Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclastus are inhibited when exposed to the chemical COREXIT EC9500A. This chemical is a dispersant widely used to assist in the clean up after oceanic oil spills. In their tests, Hamdan and Fuller (2011) obtained data suggesting that, ‚Äúhydrogen-degrading bacteria are inhibited by chemical dispersants, and that the use of dispersants has the potential to diminish the capacity of the environment to bioremediate spills.‚Äù Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus are able to grow in liquid culture and on agar plates, where they produced beige colonies. They are tolerant of high salinity and can grow aerobically and anaerobically. The ability to grow in heterogeneous environments could prove beneficial for scientists seeking new, bacterial based, techniques for oceanic oil spill clean up.

Historical agencies *Of note; most of these early municipal/city police departments listed below would have had anywhere from one to five constables employed depending on the size of the town's population, crime levels and civil disorder. When created, these small police forces would have taken over or complemented the already existing British Columbia Provincial Police stationed in the area. They were cities, towns and districts that would have expanded rapidly in the late 1800s early 1900s due to being ports, forestry, farming or mining centres and needed to create their own police forces to deal with crime, fines, taxes and fees within the city or town limits since the British Columbia Provincial Police would not do this for them. Some of these municipal constable appointments may have been full time or as needed on call basis. Typically each historical municipal police department would have had at a minimum a full time chief constable. *These Historical Agencies are listed chronologically based on the year they ceased to exist from earliest to latest.

By 1908, a mill town of 20 houses, a store, post office, hospital, office block, barber shop, and pool hall had grown around the mill. In April 1913 Fraser Mills appointed its first police constable. The population of Fraser Mills by January 1, 1917, was around 900. By 1948 the population was 450. The Fraser Mills police consisted of one full-time chief constable until the end of November 1969 when the town merged with the City of Coquitlam and the RCMP took over policing duties of the area. *Tadanac Police - Tadanac Municipality was incorporated on December 21, 1922. By February 2, 1923, a chief of police and one constable was appointed for Tadanac to police the municipality and the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada. Unfortunately there isn't a lot of information on the size of the police force, however in May 1943, the police chief stated that he was responsible for 200 police and guards protecting the \\"war plants\\" of the mining company. In 1951 the population of Tadanac was 481 and it appears that the police force consisted of a chief of police and deputy chief of police. By 1969 the Tadanac Police force still consisted of two members. Tadanac was amalgamated with the City of Trail on January 14, 1969, and policing would now fall under the RCMP. http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMQZBN_Tadanac_Community_Trail_BC *Mission City Police - The District of Mission was incorporated on June 2, 1892. The first constable was appointed in 1906 to police the district. This was BC Provincial Constable Arthur W.

By 1909 the Surrey police force consisted of three members (a chief of police and two constables). By 1921 the Surrey police force gained an extra constable (1 stationed at White Rock, 1 stationed at Crescent Beach and the third with the chief at Cloverdale). By 1942 the Surrey police force still had four members (a chief of police and three constables) and by 1946 the police force would consist of a chief of police, deputy chief and five constables. In February 1950 the Surrey police force was authorized to hire three additional constables, bringing its total strength to eleven members (one chief, one deputy chief and nine constables). The RCMP took over policing in Surrey on May 1, 1951, with a city police force of 18 members for a population of 35,000. http://www.surreyhistory.ca/police.html *British Columbia Provincial Police (BCPP) This was the provincial police force of BC from 1866 until 1950, when it was absorbed into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Its predecessors were the Vancouver Island Colonial Police and the BC Constabulary (Mainland) that existed from 1858 to 1866 when they merged to become the BCPP. Reference information to all municipal police forces that were taken over by the BCPP from 1925 to 1949 is located on Page B-12 of http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/pubdocs/bcdocs/192381/lawenforcementunit.pdf. Of note most of these municipal police departments would have had anywhere from 1 to 5 constables employed depending on the size of the town's population, crime levels and civil disorder. Some of these municipal constable appointments may have been full-time or as needed on call basis. Typically each historical municipal police department would have had a full-time chief constable. *Trail City Police - The City of Trail was incorporated on June 1, 1901, and the first chief of police was appointed soon after.

The Provincial Police already had a constable stationed in Merritt to police the district and added a second constable to police the city and district. *BC Electric Railway Police - 1890 - Origins - Watchmen. The British Columbia Electric Railway, which had previously been three separate streetcar companies in Victoria, Vancouver, and New Westminster, employed watchmen to protect their first depots and power plants. These watchmen would later transition to become BC Electric security. 1900s - Railway Constables. The B.C.E.R. employed special constables appointed under the BC Railway Act. These constables were employed as watchmen, for special projects & special events, or in the case of the Great War ‚Äì to protect against enemy sabotage. By 1915, as part of wartime measures, 31 special constables were assigned to key infrastructure points along transmission lines and key facilities across Vancouver, Indian Arm, and Burrard Inlet. It was on March 19, 1915, that Special Constable Charles Painter was shot and killed on duty while attempting to arrest a thief along the rail tracks adjacent to False Creek. 1940 - Special Protection Force. After the Great War, the use of constables by B.C.E.R. dwindled before returning on June 18, 1940, with the creation of the Special Protection Force ‚Äì an armed special constable team established to protect against enemy sabotage. Most of their members were ex-military and were appointed as special provincial or municipal constables, depending on their location. They were posted to transmission lines, power plants and substations, and transportation hubs, similar to the special constables of the Great War. After the 1945 victory in Japan, the force was disbanded, and the B.C.E.R. returned to having watchmen as their sole protective staff. https://transitpolice.ca/about- us/history/ *Langley Municipal Police - Langley Township was incorporated on April 26, 1873, and would have been policed by the BC Provincial Police until January 22, 1906, when the town council first met and decided to appoint two municipal constables.

The last police chief was appointed November 10, 1939. By January 11, 1940, Greenwood only had Police Commissioners until 1954 and it is unclear if there was a police chief during that time. There likely was not a police chief due to the small population of Greenwood and that the town was used as a Japanese internment camp from 1942 to 1949. The BC Provincial Police and the RCMP would have had the primary policing duties in the city during the time of internment. Then in 1949 the Japanese were allowed to return home to the coast of BC.

During railroad construction in 1885 (in Farwell BC) the North West Mounted Police provided policing and ensured no liquor was available for one mile on either side of the railway tracks. When the NWMP were dispatch to the North-West Rebellion in 1885, the Dominion Police took over these duties which then resulted in the \\"Great Liquor War\\" between the Dominion Police and the British Columbia Provincial Police in the summer of 1885. The Dominion Police also provided policing for the Esquimalt Dockyard in 1911 and during World War I (October 12, 1917), the Dominion Police were assisting the Military Police to enforce the War Measures Act in British Columbia until the end of 1918 when only two members of this force remained in British Columbia. *Slocan Police - Slocan City was incorporated on June 1, 1901, as the centre of a silver mining boom.

This is very likely the shortest term for the existence of a municipal police department in British Columbia. *Columbia City Police - Columbia City, situated a few miles west from downtown Grand Forks BC, this city was incorporated on May 1, 1899, and had a special constable appointed. In 1900 the city had a population of 400 and had one constable and one constable (a British Columbia Provincial Police constable was also stationed at Columbia City).

The Voltigeurs existed as an armed, uniformed militia that served all Vancouver Island on an \\"as and when needed\\" basis. It is thought that they were primarily of Metis background. Following the end of their service, in 1854 a single town Constable (Thomas Hall) policed the early town core. On July 8, 1858, Vancouver Island Governor James Douglas appointed Augustus Pemberton as Commissioner of Police for the then British colony. Policing in Victoria pre-dated the city's founding (1862). Pemberton's appointment was published locally on July 17, 1858. The Governor had enlisted ten Jamaican men from San Francisco to form a police force. They arrived in Fort Victoria in April 1858 aboard the steamship, Commodore. They wore simple blue wool uniforms with tall blue hats. A red sash denoted their authority. The force only lasted about two months and was disbanded because of the racial strife the men attracted. The Police Department was a shared Crown Colony, Province and City establishment until February 4, 1873 when control and oversight policing the City of Victoria and a 6-mile radius was transferred over to the city. * See also *Policing in Canada *List of law enforcement agencies in Canada *Aboriginal Police in Canada *List of emergency organizations in British Columbia *British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General *British Columbia, Police International.com References ","title":"List of law enforcement agencies in British Columbia"},{"id":"10877166","text":"Genius Products (also known as Genius Entertainment) was an entertainment company based in Santa Monica, California, United States. The Baby Genius line was one of a number of \\"smart toys\\" that came out in response to a study book about the Mozart effect. Genius also released DVDs for other companies, including Entertainment Rights, Classic Media, Sesame Workshop (from 2007 to 2009), ESPN, Discovery Communications, World Wrestling Entertainment, and PorchLight Entertainment. History Genius Products Inc. was founded in San Diego, California in 1999. created by Klaus Moeller and Larry Balaban. In 2001, the video release of Baby Genius: The Four Seasons won a Kids First! award, beating Teletubbies. By 2002, AOL Time Warner was distributing Baby Genius products. Genius Products acquired American Vantage Media (formerly Fox Lorber, Winstar TV & Video, and Wellspring Media, spun off from Winstar Communications in 2001) in early 2005. On December 5, 2005, Genius Products, Inc. announced a distribution joint venture with The Weinstein Company (TWC) called Genius Products, LLC (GPL), with Weinstein holding a 70% stake. GPL would hold the Wellspring film library, including the Fox Lorber, Winstar and American Vantage Media titles, and the bulk of GPI's assets. Weinstein Co. added distribution rights for its products combined with no cash and received a 50% cut in the distribution fee on their films. The high-profile with Weinstein helped Genius Products to open the doors to major retailers like Wal-Mart and Target. With major retailers available to Genius, other entertainment companies including ESPN and Robert Halmi Inc. had signed with them. Under Weinstein's order, the Wellspring Home Entertainment division was moved to Santa Monica, California at the end of April, dropping most of the previous staff and closing its theatrical distribution unit, while transferring theatrical distribution to TWC. TWC also arranged for direct-to- video funding from Blockbuster in exchange for exclusive rental rights. Expecting the indistinguishable dozen films to be made (possibly by a standing Romanian-based crew) under the multi-year deal would generate regular income of $1 to $2 million. In January 2006, Pacific Entertainment, formed by Moeller and Balaban, purchased Baby Genius and other lines from Genius Products, Inc. for $3 million. The other lines were preschool brands such as Wee Worship and the Little Tikes music and DVD series. Genius Products retained exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the lines. In January and February 2007, Genius Products and The Weinstein Co. signed distribution and co-production agreements with Entertainment Rights, Classic Media and Sesame Workshop after Sesame Workshop and Classic Media's deals with Sony Wonder ended. Genius would distribute Sesame Workshop and ER/Classic Media's shows, while Weinstein Co. would work with Sesame and ER/Classic Media on current properties and for future development. At this time, Steve Bannon was the chairman of the board at Genius. In 2009, investment firm Quadrant Management affiliate, GNPR Investments, acquired 60% of Genius Products, LLC, with TWC retaining 15% and Genius Products, Inc. holding 25%. Later that year, Genius' home video distribution rights were acquired by Vivendi Entertainment, while distribution rights to Sesame Workshop were sold to Warner Home Video.

Principles  Communitarianism is the belief that a perfect society relies not of the ambition of personal individualism, but rather consists of the responsibilities of cohesive communal structures. This is inherently a dualistic approach to a nationalistic society. Singaporean communitarianism sets up communities to support the greater good, much like the spokes support a wheel. Emphasis is placed not on the inherent rights a government owes to an individual, but rather the inherent responsibilities an individual owes to their community. Lee Kuan Yew was the first Singaporean leader to emphasize a nation which created a national interest amongst the splintered cultures of Singapore. This was done as a transformative approach to the national hegemony at the time which was eroding due to a lapse in time from the historical conditions that led to the original underlying Marxist ideology of the PAP, among other things.Chua, Beng-Huat (1995). Communitarian Ideology and Democracy in Singapore. Routledge, . Although it may have been the pragmatic approach to Marxism that was the catalyst of a First World Singapore, it was also Lee Kuan Yew's national interest approach which allowed the success of Singapore to grow. The weakening hold of pragmatism acted as a Petri dish allowing for new concepts such as communitarianism to implant itself in the national consciousness. Recent global political trends tend to fill pragmatic voids with liberal democracy such as after the fall of the Soviet Union and most of its satellite nations. However, due to Singapore's majority ethnic Chinese (coupled with a sense of retaliatory ethnic pride against the then recent Malaysian expulsion) and its Confucian mentality, formal democratic processes were framed within a communitarian ideology. This ideological communitarian veil over Singaporean democracy includes such actions as the PAP's attempt to redirect cultural and political development towards traditional values. This redirection was perceived as way of resisting the \\"corrupting influences of an incipient Westernisation\\", or in other words a way to Confucianise society.Said, Edward (1979). Orientalism. New York: Vintage. Singaporean communitarianism included a public housing programme by the Housing Development Board (HDB) in 1960 which currently houses approximately 80% of the Singaporean population. The legislative act that allowed the HDB to acquire vast amounts of privately owned land is in contrast to British and Singaporean common law property rights. Although the HDB gave a legal rationale for the acquisition, it was clearly done to further advance the ideological hegemony of the times.

The fire destroyed archives, including a print of the first Canterbury Cricket Week and the Bluemantle's Cricket Club's archives.

There was an angry reaction to the attack locally and nationally. The National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage held a meeting in the town with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a member of Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club, attending, where he called the suffragettes \\"female hooligans\\" and compared the attack to \\"blowing up a blind man and his dog\\".Lycett A (2007) The Man Who Created Sherlock Holmes: The Life and Times of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, p.363.

The increase in genome size correlates with the vast expansion of noncoding (i.e., intronic, intergenic, and interspersed repeat sequences) and repeat DNA (e.g., satellite, LINEs, short interspersed nuclear element (SINEs), DNA (Alu sequence), in red) sequences in more complex muiticellular organisms. This expansion is accompanied by an increase in the number of epigenetic mechanisms (particularly repressive) that regulate the genome. Expansion of the genome also correlates with an increase in size and complexity of transcription units, with the exception of plants. P = Promoter DNA element. The hereditary material i.e. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of an organism is composed of a sequence of four nucleotides in a specific pattern, which encode information as a function of their order. Genomic organization refers to the linear order of DNA elements and their division into chromosomes. \\"Genome organization\\" can also refer to the 3D structure of chromosomes and the positioning of DNA sequences within the nucleus. Description Organisms have a vast array of ways in which their respective genomes are organized. A comparison of the genomic organization of six major model organisms shows size expansion with the increase of complexity of the organism. There is a more than 300-fold difference between the genome sizes of yeast and mammals, but only a modest 4- to 5-fold increase in overall gene number (see the figure on the right). However, the ratio of coding to noncoding and repetitive sequences is indicative of the complexity of the genome: The largely \\"open\\" genomes of unicellular fungi have relatively little noncoding DNA compared with the highly heterochromatic genomes of multicellular organisms. In particular, mammals have accumulated considerable repetitive elements and noncoding regions, which account for the majority of their DNA sequences (52% non-coding and 44% repetitive DNA).Venter G, et al., The Sequence of the Human Genome Science (2001) 291. pp1304-51R. A. Harris et al., Human-Specific Changes of Genome Structure Detected by Genomic Triangulation Science (2007) 316.5822, pp. 235-7 Only 1.2% of the mammalian genome thus encodes for protein function. This massive expansion of repetitive and noncoding sequences in multicellular organisms is most likely due to the incorporation of invasive elements, such as DNA transposons, retrotransposons, and other repetitive elements.Haig H. Kazazian, Jr. Mobile Elements: Drivers of Genome Evolution Science, Mar 2004; 303: 1626-32 The expansion of repetitive elements (such as Alu sequences) has even infiltrated the transcriptional units of the mammalian genome. This results in transcription units that are frequently much larger (30‚Äì200 kb), commonly containing multiple promoters and DNA repeats within untranslated introns. The vast expansion of the genome with noncoding and repetitive DNA in higher eukaryotes implies more extensive epigenetic silencing mechanisms. Studies of the genomic organization is thought to be the future of genomic medicine, which will provide the opportunity for personalized prognoses in clinics.West M., et al., Embracing the complexity of genomic data for personalized medicine Genome Res.

Early years Marek Szwarc was born in Zgierz, Poland, on 9 May 1892, the youngest of ten sons. His eldest brother was Polish-Portuguese mining engineer and historian Samuel Schwarz. Their father Isucher Moshe Szwarc (1859‚Äì1939) was an Orthodox Jew heavily involved in Zgierz's Jewish community and the late Haskalah movement. Isucher was a fervent Zionist, participating in the First Zionist Congress and subsequent congresses. From 1910 to 1914, Marek lived and studied art at the √âcole des Beaux Arts in Paris. He boarded at la Ruche together with Soutine, Marc Chagall, Modigliani and Kremegne, and together with Tchaikov and Lichtenstein inaugurated the first Jewish art journal Makhmadim (Precious Ones). In 1913 he exhibited his first sculpture, Eve, in the Salon d'Automne. Between 1914 and 1917, Szwarc traveled through the Russian Empire, spending time in Odessa and Kiev, and working in the Jewish literary circle of Mendele Moykher-Sforim, Ahad Ha-Am, and ·∏§ayim Na·∏•man Bialik. In 1918 he founded ‚Äì together with Moyshe Broderzon and a group of visual artists centered around Yitskhok Broyner and Yankl Adler ‚Äì the Yung- yidish, the first Yiddish artistic avant-garde group in Poland. During the First World War Szwarc returned to Poland. In 1919 he met and married his wife, Guina, a writer, and together they returned to Paris after the war. Until the Second World War, Szwarc lived in Paris and his paintings and sculptures were bought by collectors in Germany, Poland, the United States, and by several museums. It was during this period between the wars that he produced some of his most outstanding and original work in hammered copper, exhibited in the Salon des Tuileries and the subject of a monograph by the celebrated art critic Louis Vauxcelles. Vauxcelles writes of Szwarc: > \\"By virtue of its poetic concepts, by its firm and generous execution, by > the sense of its cadenced dispositions, by the sharp graphics written in > view of the material and which commands this very material, it is apparent > that Marek Szwarc is in harmony with the most audacious innovators of our > times, who seek him out and see him as a ma√Ætre\\". In 1922 to 1923 Szwarc contributed to the Berlin and Warsaw based avant-garde Yiddish Journal Albatros (◊ê◊ú◊ë◊ê÷∑◊ò◊®◊ê÷∏◊°), edited by poet and publicist Uri Zvi Greenberg. Later years When Poland fell in 1939, Szwarc volunteered for the Polish army in exile and after the occupation of France he escaped with the Polish army to Scotland, while his family fled via Lisbon to England. It was during this period (1940‚Äì1943) that he drew a series of pen and ink drawings depicting the daily life of his fellow soldiers. After the war he returned to Paris with his wife and daughter, Tereska Torr√®s who had served in the Free French Forces of General Charles de Gaulle in London. She published two books dealing in large part with the life of her father. After the war Marek Szwarc devoted most of his time to sculpting in stone and wood and casting in bronze. Some of these works have been donated to the Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda√Øsme in Paris. Death Marek Szwarc died suddenly at the age of 66, in Paris. His wife, Guina died in Paris in 1973. In 2010 the French publishing house ressouvenances.fr brought out an edition of Szwarc's memoirs, which he dictated to his wife Eugenia (Guina) Markowa in 1954 titled Marek Szwarc: Memoires entre deux mondes. Works and exhibitions Szwarc's work, broadly identified in style with the √âcole de Paris, was frequently but not exclusively concerned with biblical themes from the Old and New Testament. The latter motifs coming into play after his conversion to Catholicism in 1919. His identity as a Jew, however, never wavered, as is evidenced in his article, The National Element in Jewish Art, published in a Yiddish literary journal in Warsaw in 1925. He exhibited in Sweden, Austria, France, Canada, Belgium, Poland, and several sculptures were bought by the French government.

Life to the death of Mary I Bourne was son of Philip Bourne, of Worcestershire. Entering the University of Oxford in 1524, he became a Fellow of All Souls in 1531, proceeded in Arts in 1532, and in 1543 was admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Divinity, having in 1541 been named prebendary of Worcester, on the suppression of the old monastic chapter there. Moving to London in 1545, Bourne became a prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral, and in 1549 Archdeacon of Bedford with the benefice of rector of High Ongar in Essex. At the time, the holding of such preferments involved acceptance of the Church of England as brought into being under King Henry VIII and his son Edward VI. Soon after Queen Mary's accession, while preaching at St Paul's Cross, Bourne was pulled violently from the pulpit and narrowly escaped a dagger which a fanatic hurled at him.Nichols, John Gough, editor. (1852). Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London. London: Printed for the Camden Society by J.B. Nichols and Son, printers. p. 83 and footnote 'e'. The Internet Archive website Retrieved 18 June 2019. On being appointed to the Bishopric of Bath and Wells, Bourne received absolution from Cardinal Reginald Pole, the papal legate, by letters dated 17 March 1554, from all censures incurred in the time of schism, and on 1 April was consecrated with five others by Bishop Bonner, assisted by Bishop Stephen Gardiner and Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall. Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester and an ally of Bourne. During Bourne's brief episcopate, he seems to have taken no part in the Marian Persecutions, as Francis Godwin admits, he always used kindness rather than severity. There is no record of religious executions in his diocese. Queen Mary showed her high esteem for him by naming him Lord President of the Council of Wales. Under Elizabeth At the beginning of Elizabeth's reign Bourne was kept away from London by illness and official duties, and he is only mentioned once as present in the Parliament. For this reason he was one of the last bishops to be deposed, and he was even named amongst those first commissioned to consecrate Matthew Parker, appointed primate of the queen's new hierarchy. Although Queen Elizabeth expressed herself content with his service, on his refusal to take the Oath of Supremacy, which four Somerset justices were commissioned on 18 October 1559 to administer, his deprivation of office quickly followed. Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury, removed Bourne from his office. For a few months Bourne was left in Somerset, apparently as a prisoner on parole; but on 31 May 1560 he received a summons to appear within twelve days before Parker and the Commissioners in London. He set out, as his reply to Parker shows, well knowing what to expect, and on 18 June was committed to the Tower of London as a close prisoner, joining five other bishops already confined there. He remained in the Tower for three years, for most of that time in solitary confinement, when an outbreak of the plague in September 1563 caused him and his companions to be for a time transferred into the keeping of certain of their Anglican successors in office; Bourne himself was apparently committed to that of Bishop Nicholas Bullingham of Lincoln. There began that continual \\"tossing and shifting\\" of the deposed prelates \\"from one keeper to another, from one prison to another\\", which William Allen describes as one part of their \\"martyrdom\\". The Council, in June, 1565, sent them all back to the Tower, although a little later in a letter of Parker (January 1566), Bullingham is mentioned as though again for a time Bishop Bourne's actual or intended keeper, while all the captive prelates continue during the next two years to be referred to as then in the public prisons. After nearly ten years of this, Bishop Bourne died, at Silverton in Devonshire, having been there committed (apparently not long) to the custody of George Carew, Archdeacon of Exeter and Dean of Windsor. There he was buried in the church. He is one of the \\"Eleven Bishops\\", a picture of whose prison was allowed by Pope Gregory XIII to be erected in the English College church at Rome, amongst pictures of the English Saints and Martyrs, with an inscription declaring that they \\"died for their confession of the Roman See and Catholic faith, worn out by the miseries of their long imprisonment\\".

It is the second planet discovered in the system and the third in order from the star. With a mass at least 5.5 times that of the Earth, it is classified as a super-Earth (a category of planets with masses greater than Earth's up to 10 Earth masses). Gliese 581c gained interest from astronomers because it was reported to be the first potentially Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of its star, with a temperature right for liquid water on its surface, and by extension, potentially capable of supporting extremophile forms of Earth-like life. However, further research casts doubt upon the planet's habitability. It is tidally locked (always presents the same face to its primary) so if life had a chance to emerge, the best hope of survival would be in the \\"terminator zone\\". In astronomical terms, the Gliese 581 system is relatively close to Earth, at 20.37 light-years (192 trillion km or 119 trillion miles) in the direction of the constellation of Libra. This distance, along with the declination and right ascension coordinates, give its exact location in our galaxy.  Discovery  The team released a paper of their findings dated 27 April 2007, published in the July 2007 journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. At the time of discovery, it was reported to be the first potentially Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of its star and the smallest known extrasolar planet around a main-sequence star but on 21 April 2009, another planet orbiting Gliese 581, Gliese 581e, with an approximate mass of 1.9 Earth masses, was announced. In the paper, they also announced the discovery of another planet in the system, Gliese 581d, with a minimum mass of 7.7 Earth masses and a semi-major axis of 0.25 astronomical units.  Physical characteristics = Mass  The existence of Gliese 581c and its mass have been measured by the radial velocity method of detecting extrasolar planets. The mass of a planet is calculated by the small periodic movements around a common centre of mass between the host star Gliese 581 and its planets. When all six planets are fitted with a Keplerian solution, the minimum mass of the planet is determined to be 5.5 Earth masses. The radial velocity method cannot by itself determine the true mass, but it cannot be very much larger than this or the system would be dynamically unstable. Dynamical simulations of the Gliese 581 system which assume the orbits of the planets are coplanar indicate that the planets cannot exceed approximately 1.6 to 2 times their minimum masses or the planetary system would be unstable (this is primarily due to the interaction between planets e and b). For Gliese 581c, the upper bound is 10.4 Earth masses.  Radius  Since Gliese 581c has not been detected in transit, there are no measurements of its radius. Furthermore, the radial velocity method used to detect it only puts a lower limit on the planet's mass, which means theoretical models of planetary radius and structure can only be of limited use. However, assuming a random orientation of the planet's orbit, the true mass is likely to be close to the measured minimum mass. Assuming that the true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be calculated using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity on the surface of such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth. They claim the real value of the radius may be anything between the two extremes calculated by density models outlined above. Other scientists' views differ. Sara Seager at MIT has speculated that Gliese 581c and other five-Earth-mass planets could be: * \\"rock giants\\" mostly of silicate; * \\"cannonball\\" planets of solid iron; * \\"gas dwarfs\\" mostly of helium and hydrogen; * carbon-rich \\"diamond worlds\\"; * purely hot \\"ice VII worlds\\"; * purely \\"carbon monoxide worlds\\". If the planet transits the star as seen from our direction, the radius should be measurable, albeit with some uncertainty. Unfortunately, measurements made with the Canadian-built MOST space telescope indicate that transits do not occur. The new research suggests that the rocky centres of super-Earths are unlikely to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because they appear to hold on to their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.  Orbit  The orbits of the Gliese 581 system, as per the 2009 analysis excluding planets g and f. In the picture, Gliese 581c is the third planet from the star. Gliese 581c has an orbital period (\\"year\\") of 13 Earth days and its orbital radius is only about 7% that of the Earth, about 11 million km, while the Earth is 150 million kilometres from the Sun. Since the host star is smaller and colder than the Sun‚Äîand thus less luminous‚Äîthis distance places the planet on the \\"warm\\" edge of the habitable zone around the star according to Udry's team. Note that in astrophysics, the \\"habitable zone\\" is defined as the range of distances from the star at which a planet could support liquid water on its surface: it should not be taken to mean that the planet's environment would be suitable for humans, a situation which requires a more restrictive range of parameters. A typical radius for an M0 star of Gliese 581's age and metallicity is 0.00128 AU, against the sun's 0.00465 AU. This proximity means that the primary star should appear 3.75 times wider and 14 times larger in area for an observer on the planet's surface looking at the sky than the Sun appears to be from Earth's surface.  Tidal lock  Because of its small separation from Gliese 581, the planet has been generally considered to always have one hemisphere facing the star (only day), and the other always facing away (only night), or in other words being tidally locked.Selsis 2.4.1 \\"becomes tidally locked in less than 1 Gyr. \\" The most recent orbital fit to the system, taking stellar activity into account indicates a circular orbit, but older fits use an eccentricity between 0.10 and 0.22. If the orbit of the planet were eccentric, it would undergo violent tidal flexing. Because tidal forces are stronger when the planet is close to the star, eccentric planets are expected to have a rotation period which is shorter than its orbital period, also called pseudo-synchronization. An example of this effect is seen in Mercury, which is tidally locked in a 3:2 resonance, completing three rotations every two orbits. In any case, even in the case of 1:1 tidal lock, the planet would undergo libration and the terminator would be alternatively lit and darkened during libration. Models of the evolution of the planet's orbit over time suggest that heating resulting from this tidal locking may play a major role in the planet's geology. Models proposed by scientists predict that tidal heating could yield a surface heat flux about three times greater than that of Jupiter's moon Io, which could result in major geological activity such as volcanoes and plate tectonics.  Habitability and climate  The study of Gliese 581c by the von Bloh et al. team has been quoted as concluding \\"The super-Earth Gl 581c is clearly outside the habitable zone, since it is too close to the star.\\" The study by Selsis et al. claims even \\"a planet in the habitable zone is not necessarily habitable\\" itself, and this planet \\"is outside what can be considered the conservative habitable zone\\" of the parent star, and further that if there was any water there then it was lost when the red dwarf was a strong X-ray and EUV emitter, it could have surface temperatures ranging from 700 K to 1000 K (430 to 730 ¬∞C), like Venus today. Temperature speculations by other scientists were based on the temperature of (and heat from) the parent star Gliese 581 and have been calculated without factoring in the margin of error (96 ¬∞C/K) for the star's temperature of 3432 K to 3528 K, which leads to a large irradiance range for the planet, even before eccentricity is considered.  Effective temperatures  Using the measured stellar luminosity of Gliese 581 is of 0.013 times that of our Sun, it is possible to calculate Gliese 581c's effective temperature a.k.a. black body temperature. (note: this probably differs from its surface temperature). According to Udry's team, the effective temperature for Gliese 581c, assuming an albedo (reflectivity) such as Venus' (0.64), would be , and assuming an Earth-like albedo (0.296), then it would be , a range of temperatures which overlaps with the range that water would be liquid at a pressure of 1 atmosphere. However, the effective temperature and actual surface temperature can be very different due to the greenhouse properties of the planetary atmosphere: for example, Venus has an effective temperature of , but a surface temperature of (mainly due to a 96.5% carbon dioxide atmosphere), a difference of about . Studies of the habitability (i.e. liquid water for extremophile forms of life)Selsis 5. \\"Gl 581c is very unlikely to be habitable\\" conclude that Gliese 581c is likely to suffer from a runaway greenhouse effect similar to that found on Venus, as such, is highly unlikely to be habitable. Nevertheless, this runaway greenhouse effect could be prevented by the presence of sufficient reflective cloud cover on the planet's day side.Selsis 3.1 \\"would be habitable only if clouds with the highest reflectivity covered most of the daytime hemisphere. \\" Alternatively, if the surface were covered in ice, it would have a high albedo (reflectivity), and thus could reflect enough of the incident sunlight back into space to render the planet too cold for habitability, although this situation is expected to be very unstable except for very high albedos greater than about 0.95 (i.e. ice): release of carbon dioxide by volcanic activity or of water vapor due to heating at the substellar point would trigger a runaway greenhouse effect.Selsis 3.1.2  Liquid water  Gliese 581c is likely to lie outside the habitable zone.Selsis Abstract, 3. Figure 4. No direct evidence has been found for water to be present, and it is probably not present in the liquid state. Techniques like the one used to measure the extrasolar planet HD 209458 b may in the future be used to determine the presence of water in the form of vapor in the planet's atmosphere, but only in the rare case of a planet with an orbit aligned so as to transit its star, which Gliese 581c is not known to do.  Tidally-locked models  Theoretical models predict that volatile compounds such as water and carbon dioxide, if present, might evaporate in the scorching heat of the sunward side, migrate to the cooler night side, and condense to form ice caps. Over time, the entire atmosphere might freeze into ice caps on the night side of the planet. However, it remains unknown if water and/or carbon dioxide are even present on the surface of Gliese 581c. Alternatively, an atmosphere large enough to be stable would circulate the heat more evenly, allowing for a wider habitable area on the surface. For example, although Venus has a small axial inclination, very little sunlight reaches the surface at the poles. A slow rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's produces prolonged days and nights. Despite the uneven distribution of sunlight cast on Venus at any given time, polar areas and the night side of Venus are kept almost as hot as on the day side by globally circulating winds.  A Message from Earth  A Message from Earth (AMFE) is a high-powered digital radio signal that was sent on 9 October 2008 towards Gliese 581c. The signal is a digital time capsule containing 501 messages that were selected through a competition on the social networking site Bebo. The message was sent using the RT-70 radar telescope of Ukraine's State Space Agency. The signal will reach the planet Gliese 581c in early 2029. More than half a million people including celebrities and politicians participated in the AMFE project, which was the world's first digital time capsule where the content was selected by the public. As of 22 January 2015, the message has traveled 59.48 trillion kilometers of the total 192 trillion kilometers, which is 31.0% of the distance to the Gliese 581 system. On 13 February 2015, scientists (including David Grinspoon, Seth Shostak, and David Brin) at an annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent extraterrestrials in the Cosmos was a good idea; That same week, a statement was released, signed by many in the SETI community, that a \\"worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent\\". However neither Frank Drake, nor Seth Shostak signed this appeal. On 28 March 2015, a related essay with some different point of view was written by Seth Shostak and published in The New York Times.

Microbiology In microbiology labs, E. cloacae is frequently grown at 30 ¬∞C on nutrient agar or broth or at 35 ¬∞C in tryptic soy broth. It is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacterium, is facultatively anaerobic, and bears peritrichous flagella. It is oxidase- negative and catalase-positive. Industrial use Enterobacter cloacae has been used in a bioreactor-based method for the biodegradation of explosives and in the biological control of plant diseases. Safety E. cloacae is considered a biosafety level 1 organism in the United States and level 2 in Canada. Genomics A draft genome sequence of Enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae was announced in 2012. The bacteria used in the study were isolated from giant panda feces. Clinical significance Enterobacter cloacae is a member of the normal gut flora of many humans and is not usually a primary pathogen. Some strains have been associated with urinary tract and respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised individuals. Treatment with cefepime and gentamicin has been reported. A 2012 study in which Enterobacter cloacae transplanted into previously germ-free mice resulted in increased obesity when compared with germ-free mice fed an identical diet, suggesting a link between obesity and the presence of Enterobacter gut flora. Species of the E. cloacae complex E. cloacae was described for the first time in 1890 by Jordan[201] as Bacillus cloacae, and then underwent numerous taxonomical changes, becoming 'Bacterium cloacae' in 1896 (Lehmann and Neumann), Cloaca cloacae in 1919 (Castellani and Chalmers), it was identified as 'Aerobacter cloacae' in 1923 (Bergey et al.), Aerobacter cloacae in 1958 (Hormaeche and Edwards) and E. cloacae in 1960 (Hormaeche and Edwards), by which it is still known today.[7] E. cloacae is ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic environments (water, sewage, soil and food). These strains occur as commensal microflora in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals[1] and play an important role as pathogens in plants and insects. This diversity of habitats is mirrored by the genetic variety of the nomenspecies E. cloacae.[6] E. cloacae is also an important nosocomial pathogen responsible for bacteremia and lower respiratory tract, urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections, as well as endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and skin and soft tissue infections. The skin and the GI tract are the most common sites through which E. cloacae can be contracted.[1,29] E. cloacae tends to contaminate various medical, intravenous and other hospital devices. Nosocomial outbreaks have also been associated with colonization of certain surgical equipment and operative cleaning solutions. Another potential reservoir for nosocomial bacteremia is the heparin solution used to irrigate certain intravascular devices continually. This fluid had been implicated as a reservoir for outbreaks of device-associated bacteremia in several instances.[30] In recent years, E. cloacae has emerged as one of the most commonly found nosocomial pathogen in neonatal units, with several outbreaks of infection being reported.[31] In 1998, van Nierop et al. reported an outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit with nine deaths,[32] and in 2003, Kuboyama et al. reported three outbreaks with 42 systemic infections and a mortality of 34%.[33] This microorganism may be transmitted to neonates through contaminated intravenous fluids, total parenteral nutrition solutions and medical equipment. Many single-clone outbreaks, probably caused by cross- transmission via healthcare workers, have been described, suggesting that inpatients can also act as a reservoir.[31] The type strains of the species are E. cloacae ATCC 49162 and 13047. This latter strain is the first complete genome sequence of the E. cloacae species and the type strain is E. cloacae subsp. cloacae. The complete E. cloacae subsp. cloacae ATCC 13047 genome contains a single circular chromosome of 5,314,588 bp and two circular plasmids, pECL_A and pECL_B, of 200,370 and 85,650 bp (GenBank accession numbers CP001918, CP001919 and CP001920, respectively).[34] The other genomes of E. cloacae that have been sequenced are deposited in GenBank under accession numbers CP002272, CP002886, FP929040 and AGSY00000000. E. asburiae is named after Mary Alyce Fife-Asbury, an American bacteriologist who made many important contributions to the classification of Enterobacteriaceae, particularly in describing new Klebsiella and Salmonella serotypes,[35‚Äì37] new genera and new species.[38‚Äì42] E. asburiae sp. nov. was described in 1986 based on the enteric group 17.[43] This group was defined in 1978 as a group of biochemically similar strains isolated from different human specimens[44] and sent to the CDC. Before the designation of 'enteric group 17', these strains had been reported as unidentified or atypical Citrobacter or Enterobacter strains.[44] After several studies, it was shown that these strains represent a single new species in the genus Enterobacter, which was named E. asburiae. E. asburiae strains have been isolated from the soil and implicated in the mobilization of phosphate for plant nutrition from calcium phosphate, but most E. asburiae species have been isolated from human sources. The type strain of the species E. asburiae is ATCC 35953 and was isolated from lochia exudates of a 22-year-old woman in the USA.[43] The only sequenced strain of E. asburiae is LF7a, which contains a circular DNA (4,812,833 bp) and two circular plasmids, pENTAS01 (166,725 bp) and pENTAS02 (32,574 bp), which were submitted by Lucas et al. in 2011 to the US DOE Joint Genome Institute (CA, USA; GenBank accession numbers CP003026.1, CP003027.1 and CP003028.1, respectively). E. hormaechei is named after Estenio Hormaeche, a Uruguayan microbiologist who (with PR Edwards) proposed and defined the genus Enterobacter.[7] The name E. hormaechei was formerly called enteric group 75, which contained 11 strains that were sent to the CDC for identification between 1973 and 1984. Twelve additional strains were received from 1985 to 1987, three of which were blood isolates. E. hormaechei was first described on the basis of 23 isolates sent to the CDC for identification. At that time, they could not be assigned to a species since they were negative in the D-sorbitol and melibiose tests and did not fit the biochemical profile of any established Enterobacter species. The species E. hormaechei was proposed to be lactose-, D-sorbitol-, raffinose-, melibiose- and esculin-negative and 87% dulcitol-positive. These species were originally defined by O'Hara et al. when a large hybridization group of enteric organisms was isolated and found to be associated with bloodstream infections.[10] The type strain of E. hormaechei is ATCC 49162 and was isolated from the sputum of a man in California in 1977.[10] The whole-genome shotgun sequencing project was submitted in 2011 to the Human Genome Sequencing Center (TX, USA; GenBank accession number AFHR00000000). E. hormaechei consists of three different subspecies: E. hormaechei subsp. oharae, E. hormaechei subsp. hormaechei and E. hormaechei subsp. steigerwaltii, which corresponds to genetic clusters VI, VII and VIII, respectively.[8] The differentiation of these subspecies is based on their particular properties and biochemical tests.[11] E. hormaechei is commonly isolated as a nosocomial pathogen of clinical significance;[45,46] it has been reported in several outbreaks of sepsis in neonatal intensive care units in the USA[47] and in Brazil, where the outbreak originated from contaminated parenteral nutrition.[48] E. kobei is named after Kobe City (Japan), where the type strain of this species was isolated. E. kobei was first described by Kosako et al. based on a collection of 23 strains with the general traits of E. cloacae and the common phenotypic difference of being Voges‚ÄìProskauer- negative.[49] The name E. kobei is proposed for a group of organisms referred to as NIH group 21 at the NIH, Tokyo. It was later found that NIH group 21 also resembled the CDC enteric group 69,[50] and E. kobei was compared with the latter. On the basis of DNA relatedness, both organisms could be included in a single taxon. However, the CDC enteric group 69 was described as positive in Voges‚ÄìProskauer and yellow pigmentation,[50] whereas all strains of E. kobei were Voges‚ÄìProskauer- and pigmentation-negative. These findings suggest that the relationship of both organisms is at the subspecies or biogroup level. The type strain of E. kobei is NIH 1485‚Äì1479 and was isolated by blood culture of a diabetic patient. E. ludwigii, named after Wolfgang Ludwig, a microbiologist working in bacterial systematics[51] and who developed the ARB databases as well as making them public.[52] This description is based on the phylogenetic analyses of partial hsp60 sequence data collected in a population genetic study,[6] as well as on DNA‚ÄìDNA hybridization assays and phenotypic characterizations. The type strain EN-119T was isolated from midstream urine of an 18-year-old male patient with a nosocomial urinary tract infection while he was hospitalized at the Grosshadern University-Hospital Munich, Germany. The GenBank accession number of the 16S rDNA of strain EN-119T is AJ853891.[12] E. nimipressuralis The species E. nimipressuralis was originally defined by Brenner et al. and was formerly called Erwinia nimipressuralis, which was isolated from nonclinical sources (e.g., elm trees with a disease called wet wood).[43] Erwinia nimipressuralis was inserted in the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names in 1980. This microorganism is biochemically similar to E. cloacae, but it is different for acid production from sucrose and raffinose, whereas E. cloacae is positive in these tests. The type strain of E. nimipressuralis is ATCC 9912 and isolated from the elm Ulmus spp. in the USA (GenBank accession number AJ567900). E. cloacae subsp.cloacae strain PR-4 was isolated and identified by 16S rDNA gene sequence with phylogenetic tree view from explosive laden soil by P Ravikumar (GenBank accession number KP261383).Ravikumar.

The leaders' demands included higher environmental standards, more money for area development, and independent oversight of the mine. Strikers occupied the roads to the mine over the following week, blocking all access. In response, President Ollanta Humala declared a state of emergency in the province, suspending constitutional rights, and deployed police commandos against the strikers. Two civilians were killed in the resulting clashes, and seventy police officers were injured. On 30 May, provincial mayor Oscar Mollohuanca was arrested by the national government and accused of inciting protests against an expansion of a copper mine owned by Xstrata. He was conditionally released on 13 July.  Ethnic groups  The people in the province are mainly indigenous citizens of Quechua descent.

Located about northeast of Kingcome, this sketchily known complex resides at Franklin Glacier near Mount Waddington. It is over in elevation and because of its considerable overall altitude, a large proportion of the complex is covered by glacial ice. Magmatic activity of the Franklin Glacier Complex spanned roughly four million years from the Late Miocene to the Early Pleistocene, with the most recently identified volcanic eruption having taken place around 2.2 million years ago. The existence of thermal springs near the complex implies that magmatic heat is still present. It has therefore been of interest to geothermal exploration. Geography The area lies in one of British Columbia's many territorial divisions called the Range 2 Coast Land District. Local relief exceeds with the long valley-filling Franklin Glacier originating from an icefield below the west face of Mount Waddington. It is part of the Waddington Range, a subrange of the Pacific Ranges which in turn are a subdivision of the Coast Mountains. The Franklin Glacier Complex was covered by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet until its retreat about 13,000 years ago. Franklin Glacier has since undergone glacial retreat and expansion throughout the Holocene. It appears to have retreated significantly during the early Holocene warm period, followed by advancements 6,300, 5,400, 4,600, 4,100, 3,100, 2,400, 1,500, 800 and 600 years ago. The timing of expansions corresponded with cool summer temperatures, generally moist conditions and increased precipitation. Geology Minimal geologic studies have been conducted at the Franklin Glacier Complex and its geology is therefore poorly known. It measures wide and long, covering a northwesterly elliptical area of . Volcanic rocks of the Franklin Glacier Complex consist predominantly of dacite breccia, minor dacite flows and a few hornblende andesite remnants. An absence of pumice, glassy blocks or bombs in the breccia suggests that it may be of epiclastic origin, possibly formed during collapse and infilling of a caldera. The complex has therefore been described as a caldera or a cauldron subsidence. Heavy erosion of the volcanic rocks has exposed a series of biotite-quartz-porphyry, biotite quartz-feldspar-porphyry and quartz monzonite subvolcanic plutons and dike swarms. They intrude through fractured and hydrothermally altered Mesozoic to early Tertiary granitic and metamorphic rocks of the Coast Plutonic Complex. The complex lies on the overlapping trend of the Garibaldi and Pemberton volcanic belts, which were formed as a result of subduction zone magmatism along the Cascade Volcanic Arc in the last 29 million years. Two separate stages of magmatic activity have been identified at the Franklin Glacier Complex. The first magmatic stage about 6.8 million years ago involved the central emplacement of an elongated quartz monzonite stock. At least five porphyry and transitional vein-type mineral occurrences were deposited during this period. A series of smaller intrusions were emplaced during the second magmatic stage 2.2 to 3.9 million years ago, at least some of which appear to have been feeders for the overlying volcanic pile. The Franklin Glacier Complex is substantially older than the neighbouring Silverthrone Caldera to the northwest. Immediately west of the Franklin Glacier Complex are a series of hot springs confined in valleys. At Canyon Lake, a hot spring feeds a small stream that flows into the southeastern end of that lake. A single temperature of has been obtained from this spring while the Hoodoo Creek and Pinter spring temperatures remain unknown. The existence of these hot springs has made the Franklin Glacier Complex a target for geothermal exploration but little work has been conducted due to its remote location. The only performed exploration has been moderate geologic mapping. A 50 megawatt binary plant has been proposed at Canyon Lake. History Mineral exploration at the Franklin Glacier Complex has occurred sporadically since at least the 1960s. The earliest recorded work was done by Kennco Exploration Limited with the staking of claims in a zone of copper-molybdenum mineralization associated with the quartz monzonite stock. This was followed by geological mapping, silt and soil geochemical sampling and of diamond drilling in seven short boreholes. Kennco conducted no further work which led to the eventual lapse of their mineral claims in 1976. The area was restaked later that year by United Mineral Services Limited who would conduct reconnaissance mapping and regional research. In 1987‚Äì1988, United Pacific Gold Limited performed trenching, mapping, geophysics, geochemical sampling and of diamond drilling in nine boreholes. Mineral claims were staked once again in 1996 by F. Onucki and J. R. Deighton for the purpose of locating reported high-grade silver mineralization. Franklin Glacier was skied by Canadian mountaineers Don and Phyllis Munday on July 22, 1930 while exploring and mapping glaciers of the Waddington Range. Don Munday named the glacier in 1927 for its association with the Franklin River which in turn was named after a Benjamin Franklin at Tatla Lake.

Its studios are located in Florence, and its transmitter is located west of Society Hill, South Carolina. WJMX-FM is owned by iHeartMedia. History 103.1 signed on July 17, 1979 as WPDZ in Cheraw as the area's first FM Top 40 (CHR) station, \\"Z103\\". Although the station broadcast with 3 kW of power at the time, Z103 quickly became the top station in the area, even passing heritage Top 40 outlet WJMX AM 970 in the ratings (WJMX would add an FM signal on 106.3 in 1985). Eventually, WPDZ got a construction permit to increase its power to 50 kW, with a frequency change to 103.3, but the station went into bankruptcy by 1987 before it could be acted upon. In early 1988, WJMX-FM purchased WPDZ and simulcasted with its 106.3 FM signal for most of the year, while upgrading the WPDZ signal to 50 kW (at 103.3 MHz). The move from 103.1 to 103.3 was to avoid interference with the station in Surfside Beach, SC also on 103.1, then WYAK (now WSYN), allowing both stations to increase power and coverage. In November of that year, WJMX spun off its 106.3 signal to Urban Contemporary outlet, WYNN-FM, while the 103.3 frequency became \\"103X\\", the CHR format (with more classic hits in the late 1980s). In a deal announced in February 1997, Root Communications Ltd. announced plans to buy eight radio stations owned by Florence-based Atlantic Broadcasting, including WJMX-FM.

Dante's Inferno is decorated with a purple Cerberus in each tower, a werewolf out of one window, and skeleton warriors in another, its exterior's centerpiece is a large devil holding a victim in his hand that is connecting to the tongue of an upside-down, lolling eyed creature, and a pitchfork in the other. The ride's exterior resembles a castle, and its open area is decorated in graffiti style artwork including Medusa's severed head held by a Grim Reaper, as well as a mad scientist and several dragons. The passenger rides in a bumper car-like device and is sent through a maze of dark hallways. Most of the interior imagery is behind glass cases, including a dead woman rising off a table, a shaking mummy case, two gorillas, a werewolf popping out from behind foliage, skeletons, and various other horrors, in particular, scenes of a violent and gruesome nature such as a circular saw dismemberment and a man bound on all four limbs begging for help. Suspense is built by relatively long passages of nothing but darkness, strobes that simulate lightning, and sound effects, such as screaming, though some of these are lined with small, impish wall tiles. Little direct influence of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy is to be found, though this was not always the case.Coney Island Dark Rides The ride seems to have no particular theme in its current state. Across from the first gorilla is an unlit display showing a man with a crown opening a window, which appears irrelevant to a horror-themed ride. The ride has elements similar to a roller coaster, including hard-whipping turns and, midway through the ride, coming outside and being pulled down a steep slope before being plummeted through another set of doors to more horrors. Early in the ride, one specter is lowered before the tracks, but otherwise there is glass (or in the case of the begging man, mesh) between the rider and the various scares. Unlike either the Ghost Hole or the Spook-a-Rama, the other Coney Island dark rides, nothing comes directly at the rider, or threatens to do so. The ride lasts one minute and forty-five seconds. The admission price was $5.00 at the time Astroland closed. The ride is portable,Operating Dark Rides but its fate is unclear as Astroland closed after the 2008 season. It may be among the rides Astroland's owners have managed to sell for relocation elsewhere on the boardwalk. As of April 2009, the ride had been gutted. The entire fa√ßade was removed, leaving the ramp as part of the standing structure. This was removed before the opening of the new Dreamland Park. In 2009, the site housed a giant snake freak show attraction. It was the only one of the three Coney Island dark rides to have snakes (not real) on the interior, although they were trim to the mummy display. In 2010, the area was renamed Luna Park and a small rollercoaster is in the area where Dante's Inferno was.

Between 1939 and 1945, 13,600 political prisoners between the ages of 13 and 80 were imprisoned at Hinzert. Many were in transit towards larger concentration camps where most would be killed. However, many prisoners were executed at Hinzert. The camp was administered, run, and guarded mainly by the SS, who, according to Hinzert survivors, were notorious for their brutality and viciousness. Location and layout Historical road sign at the Hinzert concentration camp. Located on the Hochwald plateau, and overlooking the Hunsr√ºck mountain range, the Hinzert concentration camp was named after the nearest village, now called Hinzert- P√∂lert. At an altitude of 550m, the plateau is exposed to much humidity, wind, strong precipitation, fog and glacial temperatures in winter. The camp was surrounded by a coniferous forest that provided lumber for the camp's construction and maintenance. An access road that first bordered the prisoners' cemetery led to a first area guarded by the SS. This area contained seven huts, a guard post, the camp's Kommandantur or command post, a garage, workshops, the officers' mess and two SS housing huts. This area was decorated with floral and garden arrangements. Prisoners were kept in another area measuring approximately 200m by 200m, bordered by a 3m high barbed wire fence with watchtowers. The prisoners' area also contained the camp commander's quarters, the clothing workshop, the carpenter's area, the quarantine area, the morgue, a disinfection area and the \\"cloakroom\\" where the prisoners' belongings were kept. Prisoners were housed in four barracks, each containing two spaces that in turn contained 26 bunk beds for the projected capacity of 208 prisoners. Later, straw mattresses were added to increase the total capacity to 560. Certain rooms were reserved for a particular category of prisoners, such as the Night and Fog prisoners. Three other buildings in the camp contained the local Gestapo offices, the administrative offices and the kitchen. Different zones were located around one central roll-call area, the size of which was later reduced as the SS created a neighbouring vegetable patch. A mast stood in the centre of the roll-call area bearing loudspeakers through which orders were delivered. Prisoners sometimes had to stand still for hours facing the mast as punishment. The roll call area was also used as a drill and exercise area, where prisoners had to jump up and down at 4.30 am to the sound of a drum. Operational history The Hinzert concentration camp was first established in 1938 to house workers who were building the West Wall. However, it burnt down on August 16, 1939, and was rebuilt in October 1939 as a police detention and re-education camp, or Polizeihaft- und Erziehungslager des Reichsarbeitsdienstes (RAD), for prisoners condemned to light sentences (under 14 days) and for those workers that had demonstrated what the Nazi regime would call antisocial behavior. These workers, many of whom had been brought in by the Bremen Gestapo worked not only on the West Wall, but also on other military infrastructure projects such as air bases in Mannheim and in Mainz. On July 1, 1940, the camp was placed under the jurisdiction of the Inspector of Concentration Camps. After the invasion of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France in 1940, Hinzert also became a prison camp for political prisoners from those countries who needed to be \\"re- germanised\\" or who were placed under \\"Schutzhaft\\". On February 7, 1942, command over the camp was transferred to the SS Central Office for Economics and Administration (WVHA). It also then became a camp for the Gestapo of the Luxembourg and Trier area. Until the first Night and Fog prisoners arrived, the camp operated following the organisational structure of other camps, and namely contained a Kommandantur, a Politische Abteilung or political section, a \\"detention and security\\" camp, a medical unit and the guard units. Following the arrival of Night and Fog prisoners, the political section and \\"detention and security\\" camp were closed down. Hinzert remained mainly autonomous until November 21, 1944, when it was administratively linked to the Buchenwald concentration camp. The camp was partially destroyed by an air raid on February 22, 1945, but remained in operation until March 3 of the same year when many of the surviving prisoners were sent on a death march to upper Hessen, others having been transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp. The camp was discovered March 17, 1945 by reconnaissance units of the 94th Infantry Division. Only a handful of prisoners were still in the camp at that time. Camp commanders On October 9, 1939, SS Standartenf√ºhrer Hermann Pister assumed command over the camp, a position he held until December 1941 when he took over the command of the Buchenwald concentration camp and was replaced by SS Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Egon Zill. Zill, who had previously served in the Dachau, Buchenwald and Ravensbr√ºck concentration camps, was transferred to the Natzweiler concentration camp in Alsace in April 1942 as the camp's Deputy Commandant. He was replaced by the third and last commander of Hinzert, SS Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Paul Sporrenberg. Camp prisoners Approximately 13,600 prisoners transited through Hinzert. The first prisoners were German workers who had worked on the Siegfried Line and had demonstrated \\"anti-social behavior\\". Shortly afterwards, the camp was used to host forced laborers from occupied countries. Beginning in 1941, large groups of prisoners were sent to Hinzert, mainly political prisoners from Luxembourg and France. Other prisoners, mainly forced laborers and POWs, were sent from Poland and the Soviet Union. Starting on December 7, 1941, when the Night and Fog directive was signed, NN prisoners transited through Hinzert on the way to larger concentration camps, such as Natzweiler, Dachau or Buchenwald where they would eventually \\"disappear\\". Hinzert commemorative plaque of the Night and Fog victims. Many Hinzert prisoners were also used as slave labourers in SS subcamps spread out in the surrounding region. Some 23 Kommandos were attached to Hinzert including: Farschweiler, Finthen, Fluwig, Gelnhausen, Gusterath, Hermeskeil, Konz, Langendiebach, Mainz, Mariahute (1 and 2), Neubrucke, Hoppstaden, Nahe, Nonnweiler, Pollert, Primstal, Rheinsfeld (1 and 2), Wachtersbach and Waechtersbach. These Kommandos performed mainly maintenance forced-labour in air bases as well as marsh drainage and forestry work. A number of internal Kommandos existed directly within the main camp: #from May to June 1942, \\"Swimming pool\\" Kommando dug a fish farming basin which was used as a fire extinguisher reserve; #in July 1942, \\"Stone\\" Kommando was created to excavate a neighbouring stone mine; #\\"Forest\\" Kommando worked in the forests surrounding the camps cutting down lumber for the camp and creating a road (due to high risk of prisoners escaping, this Kommando was disbanded in 1943); #\\"Cart\\" Kommando consisting of eighteen prisoners pulling a cart transported the unearthed roots and other material (the SS sometimes released the brakes of the cart when travelling downhill in order to kill or wound the prisoners); #\\"Coal\\" Kommando transported every day the contents of a coal rail carriage from the neighbouring railway station to the camp over a distance of 4 km. The four trips represented a total of ; #\\"Wood\\" Kommando cleaned and chopped the unearthed roots in order to provide fuel for the camp #\\"Romika\\" and \\"Black\\" Kommandos worked in the camp workshops and produced rubber items and armament equipment from 1942 onwards. Because of the secrecy concerning their condition, many Night and Fog prisoners were attached to these internal Kommandos. The camp had been built initially to house 560 prisoners but an average number of prisoners was 800. This number reached 1,600 at times. War crimes A catafalque bearing the names of those killed at KZ Hinzert has been erected on the site of the former concentration camp Prisoners of the Hinzert concentration camp were kept under very harsh conditions; beatings were delivered on a regular basis and torture and execution sessions took place in public in order to establish a climate of constant terror and fear. Although the majority of the Hinzert prisoners were transferred to other camps or were kept imprisoned until their liberation, many were tortured and murdered at Hinzert. Despite its being \\"only\\" a transit camp, 321 prisoners were killed at Hinzert. The victims were often shot, drowned or killed by lethal injection. According to trial records, SS guards also tortured prisoners, left them to die of sickness or hunger, or fed them to dogs. Murder operations In 1941, two trucks transported 70 Soviet POWs to Hinzert. The prisoners were told that they would undergo a medical examination, but were injected with potassium cyanide, a deadly poison, and died shortly thereafter. They were buried in the neighboring forest. Following the 1942 Luxembourgish general strike directed against the German occupier and a new directive that enrolled the Luxembourgish youth into the Wehrmacht, 20 strikers were arrested by the Gestapo, sentenced to death and shot between September 2 and 5, 1942. Among them was the boxer Ernest Toussaint. They were also buried nearby. The Hinzert Cross at the Notre-Dame Cemetery in Luxembourg City. The sculpture Le prisonnier politique is by Luxembourgish artist Lucien Wercollier. In the subsequent years, over 350 Luxembourg resistance fighters were arrested by the Gestapo; 50 resistants were sentenced to death. Of these 50 sentences, 25 were carried out. However, of the remaining 25, 23 were subsequently executed as a response to acts of resistance in Luxembourg. The exact number of victims murdered at Hinzert remains unknown. Between 1,600 and 1,800 Luxembourgers had been sent to Hinzert. The Luxembourg Conseil National de la Resistance has confirmed 321 deaths, including 82 Luxembourgers, but not all remains of murdered victims have been found. In 1946, following the liberation of the camp by the Allies, the remains of many of the aforementioned victims were found and transferred to their respective homelands with full national honors. Those not repatriated were buried on site in a memorial cemetery. The bodies of the Luxembourgish victims were transferred back to Luxembourg on March 9‚Äì10, 1946. All along the way, citizens lined the roads, some wearing the striped uniform of camp prisoners, to pay tribute. The bodies were first laid temporarily at the Place d'Armes, in the center of the city of Luxembourg, where dignitaries paid their respects, and were then buried in the Notre-Dame cemetery. The French Fondation pour la M√©moire de la D√©portation also estimates that approximately 1,500 Night and Fog prisoners were sent to Hinzert; 390 survived and returned to France and at least 804 died. Memorial Bronze monument by Lucien Wercollier at the Hinzert Concentration Camp. A bronze monument by the Luxembourgish sculptor Lucien Wercollier honors the prisoners and those murdered at the camp. On December 10, 2005, a memorial and documentation center was opened on the site of the former concentration camp.

It was planned to be a bigger and better version of the Brush Runabout. The Detroiter was a popular model, and many vehicles were sold. The early models were built with a 32 hp, L-head engine. A five-seater touring car was sold in 1915, and had a V-8 engine of 3.3L capacity, and sold for $1,295. The car had radiators with curved cross-sections.

History The four members of Kissaway Trail (S√∏ren, Thomas, Hasse and Rune) originally recorded together under the name 'Isles', and did a self-released album called \\"We have decided not to die\\" in 2005. Since then, an additional guitarist, Daniel, while Thomas started to sing alongside S√∏ren making the distinctive two lead-vocal sound that they have today. Various tracks from this early period of the band's history can still be downloaded from Danish music websites. The band‚Äôs musical existence very nearly ended when S√∏ren lost his love for music after his father was killed under tragic circumstances. However, he made his own decision to start performing and recording again, and Kissaway Trail started to create their debut album. Their material is released in Europe (aside from Scandinavia) and Japan by Bella Union, Etch n Sketch in Australia and New Zealand, and Playground Music in Scandinavia. On their breakthrough album local producer Niels H√∏g helped them in the studio. The title of their song 61 relates to the number of days a band member had to wait to hear if their family member had a terminal illness. The member involved is kept under wraps for very personal reasons; some fans believe it is Hasse, the drummer, because he has a tattoo of the number '61' on his chest. In the Autumn of 2007, Kissaway Trail acted as the main support for Editors on their UK and European tours, alongside Ra Ra Riot in the UK and The Boxer Rebellion in Europe. The band have cited influences to their music include The Beach Boys, Grandaddy, Daniel Johnston, Placebo and Sonic Youth, amongst others. Their sound has also been compared to that of the Polyphonic Spree and Canadian band Arcade Fire. The band have been known for their live performances, which have included songs from 'The Kissaway Trail', as well as b-sides such as 'Romeo And Romeo' and 'La Mia'. They have also performed at the Wireless, Latitude and SXSW festivals in 2007, and the Montreaux Jazz Festival in 2008, where they supported Interpol and The National, and Lollapalooza in 2010.  Current activities  In 2009 the band teamed up with Heineken Music Ireland to perform two live free gigs in Dublin and at the Cork Opera House on December 9 and December 10. The band planned to release their new album entitled Sleep Mountain in March 2010. They have a new single from the upcoming album. The single \\"SDP\\" can be downloaded for free on the band's Facebook. In March and April 2010 the band played in North America in opening support of Australian band The Temper Trap. In December 2011 Kissaway Trail announced that their former bassist Rune Pedersen and guitarist Daniel Skjoldmose will leave the band but they will continue playing as a trio. According to their Facebook they are currently in New York working on their new album, of which a first single will previously be released in January. On May 14, 2013 Yep Roc Records announced that Kissaway Trail's forthcoming album \\"Breach\\" would be released on August 20, 2013.

Ernstberger had studied at the Art Academy in Vienna, under professor Otto Wagner. After the studies he worked for architect Leopold Bauer and helped to design buildings of Austro-Hungarian National Bank in Vienna, Priesnitz spa (Sanatorium Priessnitz) in L√°znƒõ Jesen√≠k and commerce chamber house in Opava. In 1913 he became independent architect (together with Kilian K√∂hler). Their designs for the government building (Landtag) in Chernivtsi (Czernowitz) in Bukowina and for the National Library and Museum in Sofia, Bulgaria obtained awards. At the beginning World War I Ernstberger was sent to the Eastern Front and a member of a Kaiserj√§ger (mountain infantry) unit and participated in the Battle of Galicia. In 1917 he was made the leader of a group building monuments of fallen soldiers (Denkmal- Bauabteilung). He designed a monument of mountain infantry in Bolzano, their museum in Runkelstein Castle in what was Austro-Hungarian Tyrol and their monument and cemetery in Huijcze Galicia. After the war, in 1918, Ernstberger returned to Czechoslovakia and set up an office in St≈ô√≠bro, together with his brother Joseph. Among others he realized student dormitory for the monastery in Svat√° Anna, a housing settlement in Plan√° u Mari√°nsk√Ωch L√°zn√≠, shoe factory building in ƒåerno≈°√≠n and several school buildings. In 1924 Ernstberger moved to Karlovy Vary and here, as a prominent local representative of Art Nouveau and of early modernism designed or reconstructed several hotels: Loib (today Grandhotel Central ) in 1924-25, Grandhotel Bad (today Sevastopol) in 1926 and Wolker in 1929-30. He also designed several villas in Art Deco style. The most important work of this period is a church building in village Dalovice (1929) having a modern style tower. Together with Bohuslav Fuchs designed sanatorium Morava in Tatransk√° Lomnica photos. In 1933 a watchtower Bleiberg designed by him was erected in Bublava. In 1939-40 he realized several housing settlements for railway company workers. In 1945 his house and office in Karlovy Vary were destroyed by bombing and in 1946 Ernstberger with the family were expelled into Germany. He first lived in Sugenheim, then in Ansbach where he designed several buildings. At age of 65 Ernstberger retired. Later, he tried to become independent architect again in Reutlingen but the attempt failed. The second attempt, after he moved into Nuremberg, however succeeded and Ernstberger was still active in his 80s.

Playing career He played for Shamrock Rovers, Bohemians, VfB L√ºbeck, Dundalk, St Patrick's Athletic and Kilkenny City during his career. He made 180 league appearances and 15 European appearances for Bohs during his 8 seasons at Dalymount Park after signing for Bohs in 1972. He left Bohs in 1980 and had a short spell at VfB L√ºbeck in Germany before returning to Ireland the following year where he joined Dundalk. While at Oriel Park, he added a third league winners medal. Eamonn moved to St. Pats during the 1983/84 and stayed there until 1989, apart from a short spell on loan at Shamrock Rovers in 1987/88. After Pats, he wound down his playing career as player/manager at Kilkenny where he made 16 league appearances. International career He won 9 full international caps for Ireland after making his debut against Poland in 1976. All of his caps came while at Bohemians. Managerial career Gregg has managed Kilkenny City (1989‚Äì90), Bohemians (1990‚Äì1993) and Shelbourne (1994). He joined Kilkenny as player/manager in 1989 and brought renowned coach Maurice Price with him. The pair led \\"The Cats\\" to their best ever league position up to that point. This was noted by the hierarchy at Bohs and in May 1990, he was offered the managers job at Dalymount and he duly accepted. While at Bohs, he won the FAI Cup and came agonisingly close to ending the club long spell without a league title when Bohs lost the league title on a play-off in 1992/93. He never recovered from that disappointment and by December of that year, he was gone from Bohemians. Gregg's next port of call was Shelbourne in January 1994 but his time at the club was a failure and he was sacked in November 1994. Trivia The Gregg name is synonymous with Shamrock Rovers. His two great uncles, 'Jemmer' (real name Michael James) and John were original founder members of the club and his uncle Podge (real name Patrick) won the FAI Cup with Rovers in 1945. His brother Jimmy also played for Rovers in the 1970s. Podge's son in law Mick Gannon won the FAI Cup with Rovers in 1978 and his son Karl Gannon also played for the Hoops in the 1990s.

The screenplay is based on the 1996 Booker Prize-winning novel Last Orders by Graham Swift. Plot The title refers to a pub landlord's last call and the final wishes of a dying man, in this instance Jack Dodds (Michael Caine), an east London butcher who greatly influenced four men over the course of his flawed but decent life. The quartet gathers to scatter Jack's ashes in Margate, where he had hoped to retire to a small seaside cottage with his wife Amy (Helen Mirren), a dream that was never fulfilled. The four are professional horse race gambler Ray Johnson (Bob Hoskins), aka Lucky, who fought beside Jack during World War II and has been his best friend since; former boxer Lenny (David Hemmings), who is always ready to settle an argument with his fists; undertaker Vic (Tom Courtenay) who acts as a buffer of sorts and Jack's son Vince (Ray Winstone), a dealer of used luxury cars, whose relationship with his father never quite recovered when, as a young boy, he learned his real family perished in a wartime bombing and Jack and Amy took in the orphaned infant and raised him as their own. As the quartet journeys from London by car to honour Jack's request, with stops at Canterbury Cathedral, the Chatham Naval Memorial, the hop farm where Jack and Amy met and a couple of pubs, they reminisce about their friend. Amy is on a journey of her own to visit their daughter June (Laura Morelli) who has learning difficulties and was institutionalized shortly after her birth fifty years earlier. Over the years Jack barely acknowledged her existence but Amy faithfully visited her weekly, even though June had no idea of who she was or why she visited. Through frequent flashbacks that stretch across six decades, the stories of the events that brought these people to this point in their lives slowly unfold, ultimately revealing the importance of friendship and love.

The two acquired the film rights to the book, and Schepisi begin to work on his adaptation, completing the first draft of the script by February 1998. Schepisi met potential cast members and forged commitments with Michael Caine, Tom Courtenay, Bob Hoskins, and Ray Winstone. Nik Powell, head of the independent production company Scala, signed on as an executive producer and during the summer of 2000 brought in German-based Rainer Mockert and MBP to help with the financing. Principal photography began in October of that year and lasted nine weeks. Locations included Eastbourne, Peckham and Bermondsey in London, Canterbury, Chatham, Old Wives Lees, Margate, and Rochester. Interiors were shot at the Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2001 and was shown at the San Sebasti√°n Film Festival, the Warsaw Film Festival, the Reykjavik Film Festival, and the London Film Festival before opening in the US on 7 December 2001. The film went into theatrical release in the UK on 11 January 2002.

Scott of The New York Times observed, \\"For Mr. Schepisi . . . the principal challenge must have been how to translate the specific gravity of Mr. Swift's prose, with its multiple narrators and its stripped-down cockney lyricism, into the light and shadow of cinema . . . [He] has succeeded beyond all expectation . . . In the past Mr. Schepisi has used his elegant, unassuming visual sense and his instinctive feel for the idiosyncrasies of actors to open up the works of playwrights like David Hare (Plenty) and John Guare (Six Degrees of Separation). Last Orders, though quite different in theme and structure, shares with these films a quiet, amused wonder at the complexities of human character, and a reluctance to shoehorn them into narrative conventions or deduce obvious morals.\\"New York Times review Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \\"an enervated, overly muted drama that should have been a lot livelier, considering the terrific cast\\" and added, \\"The actors do their best, particularly the impeccable Mirren, but Schepisi draws a shroud of chaste dullness over their scenes and lays on an energy- sapping score . . . The action moves constantly between present and past, which isn't a bad narrative scheme, but when it's done so frequently and deliberately, we feel as if we're looking over Schepisi's shoulder as he diagrams the whole story for us.\\"San Francisco Chronicle review Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it \\"a funny and touching film\\" and \\"a bawdy delight\\" and commented, \\"The acting is of the highest order, but the magnificent Mirren . . . is the film's glory and its grieving heart.\\"Rolling Stone review Philip French of The Guardian called the film \\"a moving study of the pleasures and obligations of friendship, and of facing up to a death and going on\\" and added, \\"Schepisi always handles actors sympathetically and here he has a perfect cast, most of whom can draw on their own and their parents' experiences. Without a touch of patronisation, they sink into their characters and never attempt to steal scenes from each other.\\" The Guardian review by Philip French Peter Bradshaw, French's colleague at the same newspaper, said, \\"I sometimes felt more than a little coerced by the emotion being deployed\\" but added, \\"[C]lassy is indubitably what this film is - as well as intelligent, high-minded, and touching.\\"The Guardian review by Peter Bradshaw Neil Smith of the BBC said \\"The plot may be on the mawkish side, but that doesn't stop Fred Schepisi's adaptation . . . being a gentle, affecting mix of road movie and soap opera. It helps that the Australian director has assembled a crack cast . . . Brian Tufano's handsome widescreen photography and Paul Grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special.\\"BBC review Time Out New York described it as \\"Sober, even elegiac in tone, and elegantly shot\\" and added, \\" At the film's heart is an attempt to suggest the extraordinary nature of ordinary people, and if it fails to achieve profundity, it still makes for one of the most rewarding and authentic depictions of/tributes to the Cockney way of life in recent years.\\"Time Out New York review Awards and nominations The film won the National Board of Review Award for Best Acting by an Ensemble.

He played hurling with his local club Ballyhale Shamrocks and was a member of the Kilkenny senior inter-county team from 1981 until 1992. Biography Liam Fennelly was born in Piltown, County Kilkenny in 1958. The fifth eldest son of Kevin Fennelly and the former Teresa Hoyne, he was born into a family that had a huge interest in the game of hurling. At the age of three the entire family moved to Ballyhale where they purchased a farm. Here Fennelly was educated at the local national school where his hurling skills were first noted and honed by the local teachers, Peadar O‚ÄôNeill and Joe Dunphy. His skills were also honed on the family farm where he, along with his six brothers ‚Äì Michael, Ger, Kevin, Brendan, Se√°n and Dermot ‚Äì trained. Playing career=Club The Fennellys have a long association with their local Ballyhale Shamrocks club. It was a club which Kevin Fennelly Snr. was instrumental in helping to found in 1972.Captains of the Ash p. 58 By 1978 the new club had reached the top of the local hurling world and Fennelly played a key role as Ballyhale captured their first senior county title. This victory allowed the Shamrocks club to represent Kilkenny in the provincial club championship. The final of that competition saw Fennelly‚Äôs side take on Dublin champions Crumlin. A 1-13 to 1-6 victory gave Fennelly his first Leinster club title. The subsequent All-Ireland club final saw Ballyhale Shamrocks take on Cork‚Äôs famous Blackrock club. A ten-goal thriller saw Blackrock take the title by 5-7 to 5-5. Fennelly added two further county medals to his collection to make it three in-a-row in 1979 and 1980. This latter victory was later converted into a Leinster club title following a 3-10 to 1-8 victory over Coolderry of Offaly. Once again Ballyhale Shamrocks reached the All-Ireland final where the star-studded St. Finbarr‚Äôs club from Cork provided the opposition. On that occasion all seven Fennelly brothers lined out in an exciting contest. The sides were level on five occasions during the opening thirty minutes; however, the Shamrocks had the edge. At the full-time whistle Ballyhale were the winners by -15 to 1-11 and Fennelly collected his first All-Ireland club medal along with his six brothers.The GAA Book of Lists p. 430 Another brace of county championship victories followed for Fennelly in 1982 and 1983. Once again this latter victory was later converted into a Leinster club title following a six-point victory over Kinnitty of Offaly. Ballyhale later qualified for the All-Ireland final where Galway champions Gort were the opponents. That game ended in 1-10 apiece draw thanks to a last-minute equalizing point by Dermot Fennelly. The replay took place some time later with Ger Fennelly playing a starring role. His first- half goal was the deciding factor as Ballyhale won the day by 1-10 to 0-7. It was Fennelly‚Äôs second All-Ireland club medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 431 The rest of the 1980s saw Fennelly bring his county championship tally up to eight with further wins in 1985, 1988 and 1989. The third of these victories was subsequently converted into fourth Leinster club title following a trouncing of the Cuala club from Dublin. Ballyhale later qualified for the All-Ireland final where Limerick and Munster representatives Ballybrown were the opponents. Ballybrown stormed into a six-point lead in the middle of the first-half before Fennelly scored a goal in the twenty-fourth minute. At half- time Ballybrown still led by four points, however, a surge by Ballyhale saw the Kilkenny side claim a 1-16 to 0-16 victory. It was Fennelly‚Äôs third All- Ireland medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 432 Fennelly won his ninth and final county medal with Ballyhale in 1991. Minor & under-21 Fennelly first came to prominence on the inter-county scene in the mid-1970s as a member of the Kilkenny minor hurling team. He won a Leinster title in this grade in 1976 when Kilkenny recorded a respectable 2-14 to 1-8 victory over Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland championship decider saw Kilkenny take on Tipperary. The game was a complete disaster from a Kilkenny viewpoint as Tipp were overwhelming winners by 2-20 to 1-7. Fennelly later joined the Kilkenny under-21 panel where he won both Leinster and All-Ireland titles as a non- playing substitute. Senior Fennelly made his debut on the Kilkenny senior team in 1981; however, Offaly had emerged as the new force in Leinster. In 1982 Fennelly tasted his first major victory with the senior outfit when he captured a National Hurling League title. He later lined out in Croke Park in his very first Leinster final. Offaly, the reigning provincial and All-Ireland champions were the opponents on that occasion and an interesting game developed. After a close seventy minutes of hurling Kilkenny emerged victorious by just two points and Fennelly collected his first Leinster winners‚Äô medal. He subsequently lined out in the All-Ireland championship decider against Cork. Christy Heffernan was the hero of the day as he scored two goals in a forty-second spell just before half-time. Fennelly‚Äôs brother, Ger, captured a third goal in the second half as Kilkenny completely trounced ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô by 3-18 to 1-15.The GAA Book of Lists p. 361 This victory gave Fennelly his first All-Ireland medal. In 1983 Fennelly had the great honour of being appointed captain of the Kilkenny team. It also turned out to be one of his best seasons to date in the black and amber jersey. He began the year by capturing a second consecutive National League victory before lining out in the Leinster final against Offaly. It was their second consecutive meeting in the provincial decider, however, on this occasion the victory was more comprehensive on this occasion. A 1-17 to 0-13 win gave Fennelly his second Leinster medal. For the second year in-a-row ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô squared up to Cork in the All-Ireland final. Once again Kilkenny dominated the game, assisted by a strong wind in the first-half, and hung on in the face of a great fight-back by Cork. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny emerged victorious by 2-14 to 2-12. It was Fennelly‚Äôs second All-Ireland medal while he also had the honour of collecting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. He was later presented with his first All- Star award. Kilkenny‚Äôs fortunes took a downturn following this victory as Offaly won the next two Leinster titles. In spite of this Fennelly was Kilkenny‚Äôs best player in 1985 and he was duly presented with a second All- Star. ‚ÄòThe Cats‚Äô bounced back in 1986 with Fennelly collecting a third National League medal before playing in the provincial decider against Offaly. A comprehensive 4-10 to 1-11 victory gave Fennelly his third Leinster winners‚Äô medal. Following this win Kilkenny were firm favourites for the All-Ireland title, however, Galway got the better of them in the All-Ireland semi-final with a 4-12 to 0-13 victory. In 1987 Kilkenny qualified for the provincial decider once again with Offaly providing the opposition. The game developed into a close affair; however, victory went to ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô by 2-14 to 0-17. It was Fennelly‚Äôs fourth Leinster title. This victory allowed Kilkenny to advance directly to the All-Ireland final. Galway provided the opposition on that occasion, however, the game turned out to be a drab affair. A goal by substitute Noel Lane with seven minutes to give Galway the edge and they hung on to win by 1-12 to 0-9.The GAA Book of Lists p. 362 Fennelly was later honoured with his third All-Star award. Kilkenny went into decline following this defeat. After a defeat in the provincial decider of 1989 Fennelly won a fourth National League medal in 1990 before his side were back in the Leinster final again two years later. Dublin provided the opposition on that occasion; however, they proved to be no pushovers. With seconds left in the game ‚Äòthe Dubs‚Äô were winning by a single point, however, a last-gasp goal sealed a 1-11 to 0-13 victory for ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô. It was Fennelly‚Äôs fifth Leinster winners‚Äô medal. Another nail-biting win over Antrim in similar circumstances set up an All-Ireland final meeting with Tipperary, their first championship encounter in twenty years. The opening thirty-five minutes saw both sides trade score- for-score, however, a controversial 2-metre free, miss-hit by Michael Cleary, landed in the net and gave Tipp a lead which they never surrendered.The GAA Book of Lists p. 363 The final score of 1-16 to 0-15 resulted in a loss for Kilkenny. In 1992 Fennelly was one of the veterans of the Kilkenny team; however, he was appointed captain of the team for the third time that year. That year‚Äôs Leinster final pitted Kilkenny against Wexford. The game was an easy one for ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô as Kilkenny‚Äôs side won easily by 3-16 to 2-9. It was Fennelly‚Äôs sixth Leinster medal and his second occasion lifting the Bob O‚ÄôKeeffe Cup. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Fennelly line out against Cork for the third time in his career. Prior to the game Kilkenny won the toss, however, Fennelly chose to play against the wind. At half-time his side were only two points in arrears thanks to a D.J. Carey goal four minutes before the interval. John Power and Michael Phelan added two second-half goals to give Fennelly a 3-10 to 1-12 win. It was Fennelly‚Äôs second time lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup and his third All-Ireland title. He retired from inter- county hurling shortly afterwards. In 2010, Liam Fennelly was selected as full forward on the Kilkenny 125yrs team - organised through the 'Kilkenny People' newspaper. This honour is a reflection of the excellence that this scion of a famous clan brought to his time in the black & amber.

Bamina was Prime Minister from 26 January to 30 September 1965, and President of the Senate of Burundi in 1965. He and other leaders of the government were assassinated on 15 December 1965, by Tutsi soldiers during a reprisal effort to stop a coup by Hutu officers. Life and work Bamina was a Hutu who was trained at university at a time when the colonial powers of German and Belgium had given most opportunities to Tutsis, limiting Hutus to training for the Catholic priesthood. In 1961, Burundi held elections to determine the post colonial government with the multi-ethnic UPRONA party winning 90% of the seats which were shared between Hutus and Tutsis. In 1962, the Tutsi monarch (the Mwami) decreed that UPRONA leadership would be determined by an election from the rank and file members of the party, and Bamina was elected the party president. The vice president of the party, Paul Mirerekano, had hoped to win the position of president and he refused to participate with the other leaders of the party, instead leading a split in the party which became known as the Monrovia group and consisted of most of the Hutu members (the remaining Tutsi wing identified as Casablanca). The Monrovia faction recognized the People's Republic of China in 1964, contrary to the desires of the Mwami. In January 1965, the Mwami tapped Pierre Ngendandumwe, a Hutu, to form a new government as Prime Minister, in part because of his stance against Chinese and communist influence in the country. Ngendandumwe was assassinated by Tutsis shortly thereafter, and on 24 January, Bamina was named temporary Prime Minister and national elections were slated for the spring. As Prime Minister, Bamina cut off relations with communist China on 30 January and ordered the Chinese diplomatic staff out of the country, with government troops surrounding the Chinese embassy. The Hutus won the May elections, garnering 80% of the seats. Bamina was elected President of the Senate on 4 September. After the Mwami overruled the senate's selection of a Hutu as prime minister and instead appointed a Tutsi Hutu officers in the army staged a coup in October, but Tutsi soldiers countered and executed many of the Hutu members of the government, including Bamina on 15 December 1965. Bamina had been married to a Tutsi woman. His widow, Mary Roche Bamina, is president of the Bamina Foundation.

It was formerly called Enterobacter agglomerans, or Erwinia herbicola and is an ubiquitous bacterium commonly isolated from plant surfaces, seeds, fruit, and animal or human feces and can be found throughout a honeybee's environment.  Bacteriology  Pantoea agglomerans can serve as a plant pathogen competitor for the management of plant diseases. Fire blight, a plant disease caused by bacterium Erwinia amylovora, is commonly found in pear and apple crops. After coming in contact with Erwinia amylovora, Pantoea agglomerans produces antibiotic properties that are toxic to the fire blight-inducing bacterium. It has been identified that it is possible that habitat modification or exclusion may also play a role in the effectiveness of the antibiosis of the fire blight biological control. Environmental factors influencing the growth and spread of Pantoea agglomerans include winter chilling, good sunlight exposure and quality air circulation. Fruit-bearing trees, such as apple and pear trees are common Pantoea agglomerans hosts and during blooming season the fruit-bearing trees receive a period of chilling to revive them from their dormant state in the following Spring. In terms of sunlight exposure, fruit trees generally grow best in warm, moist and well-lit environments, thus Pantoea agglomerans must also be able to survive under these conditions if it hopes to infect healthy plant hosts. Pantoea agglomerans is an aerobic bacterium, so it requires a certain level of air circulation in order to survive. Pantoea agglomerans is found in the gut of locusts. The locusts have adapted to use the guaiacol produced by Pantoea agglomerans to initiate the synchronized swarming of locusts. It is also commonly found as a symbiont in the gut of mosquitoes. Scientists have created a genetically modified strain of Pantoea agglomerans produce antimalarial effector molecules. Inoculating mosquitoes with this strain reduced the prevalence of the Malaria causing organism (Plasmodium) by up to 98%.  Antibiotics derived from Pantoea agglomerans  More recent studies have shown that Pantoea agglomerans has a wide variety of antibiotics that can be derived from it. These antibiotics include: herbicolin, pantocins, phenazine and others. In addition, Pantoea agglomerans products may act as a preservative, have bioremediation properties, and be able to fight against harmful pathogens in plants. A Japanese researcher was able to isolate IP-PA1 in Pantoea agglomerans and found that the lipopolysaccharide has a low molecular mass giving it unique properties. This bacterium was also found to use macrophage activity to regulate homeostasis, giving Pantoea agglomerans healing properties. These properties include: \\"tumours, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, ulcer, various infectious diseases, atopic allergy and stress-induced immunosuppression\\".  Clinical isolates  Pantoea agglomerans is occasionally reported to be an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients, causing wound, blood, and urinary-tract infections. Infections are typically acquired from infected vegetation parts penetrating the skin. Contaminated intravenous fluids or blood products are only rarely the causal agent. Bloodstream infection can lead to disseminated disease and end-organ infection, mainly septic arthritis, but also endophthalmitis, periostitis, endocarditis and osteomyelitis in humans. Using the biochemical panels commonly employed in medical diagnostics it is difficult to differentiate Pantoea agglomerans from other species of the same genus or from members of related genera such as Phytobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Serratia spp. This has led to confusion surrounding its pathogenicity as molecular studies based on DNA sequencing have disproved the identity of several clinical isolates initially reported as Pantoea agglomerans. For the precise identification of Pantoea agglomerans non-culture based methods such as Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) or Whole-Cell MALDI- TOF MS are recommended.

Spook-a-Rama is a dark ride from the Pretzel Amusement Ride Company located at Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park on Coney Island and run by Million Amusement Corp. It opened in 1955. The rider is pulled around in a car resembling an old wooden barrel. These barrels look like connected cars, but separate from each other at the beginning of the ride, so the rider must go in alone, passing paintings that change imagery, and a skeleton before the car itself forces the doors open. Inside, the ride is one large, poorly lit room. The ride had a major renovation done by Scarefactory Inc. prior to the 2013 season. Some of the old views included zombies, the face of an ogre composed of light bulbs, a demon slashing an axe toward the rider, a man in a straitjacket being electrically shocked, heads popping out of barrels, and a gruesome man being killed in an electric chair. On the way out of the ride, stringy objects hang from the ceiling that provided an extra fright. These old scenes inside the ride have been replaced. New scenes include several skeletons emerging from a crypt and two giants rats. At least two air cannons have been installed in the ride. There is also a camera that takes photos of guests when they're hit with the first air cannon. Spook-a-Rama's Grim Reaper and Giant Native Skeleton were seen by non-riders and have since been replaced by a dragon. The ride would last about 45 seconds and proceed in roughly a u-shape, with small sharp curves.

Biography  Clason studied engineering and later architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, where he was a student of Albert Theodor Gellerstedt (1836-1914), and later at the architectural school of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, at the time headed by Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander (1816-1881). He received the royal medal in 1881 and studied abroad 1883-1886. He was elected member of the Academy of Arts in 1889, appointed professor of architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in 1889 and became first surveyor in the Chief Surveyor's Office in 1904. He became vice president of the Art Academy in 1902 and president in 1918. He was also elected member of the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1907. 1915  Work  His first major work was the B√ºnsow building (1886‚Äì1888) at Strandv√§gen in Stockholm, commissioned by the sawmill baron Friedrich B√ºnsow and influenced by French Renaissance architecture. It broke new ground in its use of natural material throughout (limestone and bricks) rather than the plaster that had been dominant in Swedish architecture until that point. It also broke against conventions through its avoidance of complete symmetry. During most of the 1880s, Clason ran an architectural firm in Stockholm together with architect Kasper Erik Salin (1856‚Äì1919). He designed the house at 14 √ñsterl√•nggatan (1888-1889) and Adelsv√§rd House (Adelsw√§rdska huset) at Norrstr√∂m in Stockholm (1889). They also designed √ñstermalmshallen (1889), the indoor market at √ñstermalmstorg in Stockholm. His largest commission was the Nordic Museum on Djurg√•rden, in North European Renaissance style, which he began in collaboration with architect Magnus Is√¶us (1841-1890) but continued alone after Isaeus's death in 1890. The building was partly finished for the Stockholm Exhibition in 1897, and completed a few years later. Other designs include the Hallwyl Palace, also in Stockholm, the Rosen house at Strandv√§gen, and the building for St√§ndernas allm√§nna brandf√∂rs√§kring, an insurance company, at Skeppsbron in the Old Town of Stockholm. Clason also is responsible for the fa√ßade of Norrlands nation in Uppsala.

In 1237 Alderich Prince-Bishop of Trent gave the brothers Friedrich and Beral Lords of Wangen permission to construct a castle on the rock then called Runchenstayn.  History  In 1274 it was damaged during a siege by Meinhard II of Tirol, who after winning the war against Heinrich Prince-Bishop of Trent, entrusted the castle to Gottschalk Knoger of Bozen. In 1385 the Niklaus and Franz Vintler wealthy merchant brothers from Bozen bought the castle. Niklaus was counselor and financier of the Count of Tyrol, Leopold III, Duke of Austria, which allowed them to buy the castle a type of residence unfitting in this time for people of their rank. The brothers Vintler commissioned a vast restructuring of the castle: a new defence wall, moat, a cistern and more rooms were built. In 1390 the construction of the Summer House began. The house was painted with frescos, for which the castle is most famous today, inside and outside. The frescos topics were of literary nature, depicting i.e. King Arthur and his knights, Tristan and Isolde, Dietrich von Bern. The family also commissioned the frescoes in the Western and Eastern Palace. They were created by an unknown masters and some of them depict scenes from Pleiers romance Garel.Tax, Petrus W. (1991). \\"Der Pleier\\". In Lacy, Norris J., The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, pp. 362‚Äì363. New York: Garland. . The Castle in 2009 In 1407 the monetary conflict between Frederick IV, Duke of Austria ‚Äúmit der leeren Tasche‚Äú (with empty pocket), Count of Tyrol and wealthy Tyrolean noble families resulted in open war. The Vintlers were drawn into these disputes and Runkelstein was besieged. Niklaus, who had allied with himself with the nobles in the \\"Hawk League\\" lost all his wealth and possessions. His brother Franz, who had allied with the Duke remained owner of the Castle until Sigismund, Archduke of Austria ‚Äúder M√ºnzreiche‚Äù (rich with coins) acquired it. The Habsburg family owned the castle until 1530. Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I gave order to renovate the castle. He furnished his apartment and commissioned a restoration of the frescos. He also ordered his Coat of Arms to be prominently displayed in the castle. Around 1500 Maximilian gave the castle to his vassal Georg von Frundsberg, famous ‚ÄúFather of the Landsknechte‚Äù. Frundsberg entrusted the care of the castle to a vicar. In 1520 the powder magazine on the groundfloor of the tower exploded. The explosion damaged parts of the outer wall, entrance and Eastern Palace and destroyed the tower. Afterwards the castle was neglected until King Ferdinand I bestowed it in 1530 to Sigmund von Brandis, Knight Commander of Bozen.http://www.runkelstein.info/runkelstein_en/history.asp Later the Prince- Bishop of Trent obtained the castle anew and Prince-Bishop Bernhard von Cles gave it as a feud to the Counts of Lichtenstein-Kastelkorn. In 1672 a fire destroyed the eastern palace, which was never rebuilt. In 1759 the last Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn gave back the fief to the Trentine bishops. At the time the castle was in grave decay. During the Romanticism period in the early nineteenth century romanticists rediscovered Runkelstein. Johann Joseph von G√∂rres, a German writer was the first to come and was soon followed by the many artists in the service of King Ludwig I of Bavaria. In this time the castle became a symbol for the Romantic period. In 1868, the northern wall of the Summer House collapsed, but in 1880 the castle's fortunes changed: Johann Salvator Archduke of Austria bought Runkelstein and gave it as a gift to Emperor Franz Josef in 1882. The emperor commissioned Friedrich von Schmidt to restore the Castle and after the restoration donated it to the city of Bozen in 1893. The last restoration, including a careful restoration of the frescos was carried out in the late 1990s.http://www.runkelstein.info/runkelstein_de/geschichte.asp ReferencesExternal links * Official homepage Category:Castles in South Tyrol Category:Buildings and structures in Bolzano Category:13th-century fortifications ","title":"Runkelstein Castle"},{"id":"10878013","text":"Keith James O'Halloran (born 10 November 1975) is an Irish former professional footballer.

He was a native of Tours and was King William I of England's doctor before becoming a bishop. After his consecration as bishop, he was either given or purchased Bath Abbey, a rich monastery, and then moved the headquarters of the diocese from Wells, to the abbey. He rebuilt the church at Bath, building a large cathedral that no longer survives. He gave a large library to his cathedral and received the right to hold a fair in Bath. Not noted for his scholarship, he died suddenly in 1122.

The name \\"de Villula\\" first appears in 1691, and is not a contemporary name. It resulted from a misreading of John's name in his episcopal profession. Bishop of Bath A woodcut illustration of Investiture, or the ceremonial granting of the symbols of an ecclesiastical office, by a king. From Mediaeval and Modern History by Philip Van Ness Myers, 1905. John was appointed Bishop of Wells in 1088 by King William II \\"Rufus\\", the son and successor to William I. The bishop's consecration was in July,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 227 at Canterbury by Archbishop Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He probably owed his appointment to the king's desire to honour his father's physician. Shortly after his consecration, John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king,Barlow William Rufus p. 182 as well as the city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the town or whether he was given the town as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had recently lost its abbot Alfsige, and was according to Domesday Book the owner of large estates in and near the town. It would have been the wealth of the abbey that attracted John to take over the monastery.Smith \\"John of Tours\\" Downside Review pp. 134‚Äì135 By acquiring the town of Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the town.Mason William II p. 130 In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey,Huscroft Ruling England p. 128 probably as an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues.Williams English and the Norman Conquest p. 136 William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns. When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter, turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons located at Wells that had previously served the diocese.Knowles Monastic Order p. 132 John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath, which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray's rebellions. As rebuilt, it was only surpassed in size by the cathedrals at Ely, Norwich and Winchester. The present Bath Cathedral is not the building that John built, and occupies only a fraction of the space that John's building encompassed.Smith \\"John of Tours\\" Downside Review pp. 136‚Äì137 He also reformed the administration of his diocese, setting up archdeacons and organising a court for hearing ecclesiastical cases.Smith \\"John of Tours\\" Downside Review pp. 138‚Äì139 His efforts to reform his diocese led to his cathedral chapter's complaining of their treatment, which John seems to have ignored.Brett English Church p. 8 At Wells, he was accused of destroying the community of canons there, which had been created by his predecessor. In 1092, he helped with the consecration of Old Sarum Cathedral, although its roof was almost immediately damaged by a storm and required decades of repair. In 1094, he performed the same service for Battle Abbey.Smith \\"John of Tours\\" Downside Review pp. 140‚Äì141 After the accession of King Henry I of England, John received a confirmation of the grant of the city of Bath, paying 500 pounds of silver for the verification.Page History of the County of Somerset: Volume 2: Houses of Benedictine Monks: The Cathedral Priory of Bath In 1102, John secured from King Henry the right to hold fairs at Bath on the feast day of the cathedral's patron saint, Saint Peter. He gave an extensive library to the cathedral at Bath, and eventually the monks there became reconciled to him. John, however, continued to hold most of the old abbey's manors himself, rather than using them for the support of the monks. Investiture Controversy John was one of the bishops that sided with King William against Anselm of Canterbury at the king's Whitsun council in 1097,Vaughn Anselm of Bec and Rober of Meulan p. 201 one of early councils called during the Investiture Controversy in England. During the reign of King Henry I, who succeeded his brother King William in 1100, John along with Robert Bloet, the Bishop of Lincoln, consecrated abbots who had been invested in office by the king.Vaughn Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan pp. 248‚Äì249 John attended Anselm's reforming Council of London in 1102, which debated and passed decrees to reform the clergy. Death and legacy John died in December 1122 and was buried in Bath Cathedral.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 7: Bath and Wells: Bishops He suffered a heart attack after dinner and died suddenly.Barlow English Church p. 263 Traditionally the date of his death is given as 29 December. Under John, the monks of Bath became known for their scholarship, although he was not particularly noted for learning. William of Malmsebury claimed he was generous and affable, although the chronicler acknowledged that the bishop treated the canons of Wells abominably. William also recorded that John was a heavy drinker and not given to self-restraint, but that his health was good and he lived to be old.Barlow English Church pp. 66‚Äì67 At first he treated the monks at Bath with contempt and confiscated much of the lands of the abbey for his own use, but in 1106 he restored their lands to them. John's canons of Wells disliked him because he reduced their income and destroyed some of their buildings as part of the movement of the see to Bath. A layman official of the diocese, Hildebert, was probably John's brother; and he held the offices of steward of the diocese and was also the provost of Wells, an inheritable office.Brett English Church p. 178 John gave much of the revenues of Wells to Hildebert. Another relative, a nephew also named John, was named archdeacon in the diocese.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 7: Bath and Wells: Archdeacons without Territorial Title CitationsReferences      * Category:1122 deaths Category:Bishops of Bath Category:Bishops of Wells Category:11th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"John of Tours"},{"id":"10878097","text":"Methylobacterium extorquens is a Gram-negative bacterium.Garrity, George M.; Brenner, Don J.; Krieg, Noel R.; Staley, James T.

With extended incubation, pink colonies often take on a coral hue. M. mesophilicum and M. zatmanii are the two most commonly reported species isolated in clinical samples.

(1851‚Äì56) is an unfinished painting by Ford Madox Brown which depicts a woman showing her newborn son to its father. She is offering her baby towards the viewer of the painting, who is implicitly equated with the father - seen in the mirror behind, opening his arms to receive the baby. The mirror also forms a halo behind the mother's head, and the pattern on the wallpaper suggests the starry heavens. Brown's principal influence was Jan van Eyck's painting the Arnolfini Marriage Portrait, recently acquired by the National Gallery. The mirror resembles the circular mirror in van Eyck's painting, which reflects an image of the artist looking at the couple in the image. The woman is wearing crinolines, which expand to cover the whole of the lower part of the painting. Brown has left this part incomplete, roughly squaring up and sketching the dress in outline. The title is written on the unfinished dress, underneath the child at the right. Brown's own wife was pregnant whilst he was painting this picture and she gave birth to a son which they named Arthur. Arthur then died at just ten months old and it is considered Brown was unable to complete the painting through grief for his son, so he abandoned it. Interpretations There are two principal interpretations of the picture. Most critics see it as an image of a wife offering the child to her husband, an interpretation supported by the sacred symbolism and by the fact that Brown depicted his own wife and their new son. Some commentators, however, interpret it as more confrontational image, in which an abandoned mistress presents her baby to its father.Tate Gallery Collection, Take your Son, Sir'!1851-92 The art historian Marcia Pointon has argued that the painting is deliberately paradoxical, playing on the conflict between new life and death. She suggests that the portrayal of the baby is influenced by medical images of fetuses surrounded by viscera within the body of woman, and that the woman's glazed, white and emaciated features suggest death.Pointon, Marcia, \\"Interior Portraits: Women, Physiology and the Male Artist\\", Feminist Review, No. 22 (Spring, 1986), pp. 5-22 Notes Category:1856 paintings Category:Unfinished paintings Category:Paintings by Ford Madox Brown Category:Paintings of children ","title":"Take your Son, Sir!"},{"id":"10878139","text":"Jimmy Briscoe & The Little Beavers, later known as Jimmy Briscoe & the Beavers, was a 1970s singing group.

It was funded and organized by Archibald, Earl of Eglinton, and took place at Eglinton Castle in Ayrshire. The Queen of Beauty was Georgiana, Duchess of Somerset. Many distinguished visitors took part, including Prince Louis Napoleon, the future Emperor of the French. The Tournament was a deliberate act of Romanticism, and drew 100,000 spectators. It is primarily known now for the ridicule poured on it by the Whigs. Problems were caused by rainstorms. At the time views were mixed: \\"Whatever opinion may be formed of the success of the Tournament, as an imitation of ancient manners and customs, we heard only one feeling of admiration expressed at the gorgeousness of the whole scene, considered only as a pageant. Even on Wednesday, when the procession was seen to the greatest possible disadvantage, the dullest eye glistened with delight as the lengthy and stately train swept into the marshalled lists\\".Aikman 1839. Participants had undergone regular training. The preparations, and the many works of art commissioned for or inspired by the Eglinton Tournament, had an effect on public feeling and the course of 19th-century Gothic revivalism. Its ambition carried over to events such as the lavish Tournament of Brussels in 1905, and presaged the historical reenactments of the present. Features of the tournament were actually inspired by Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe: it was attempting \\"to be a living re-enactment of the literary romances\\".Watts, 2009 In Eglinton's own words \\"I am aware of the manifold deficiencies in its exhibition ‚Äî more perhaps than those who were not so deeply interested in it; I am aware that it was a very humble imitation of the scenes which my imagination had portrayed, but I have, at least, done something towards the revival of chivalry\\".Literary Gazette, 1831:90. While others made a profit, Lord Eglinton had to absorb losses.Watts, 2009. The Earl's granddaughter, Viva Montgomerie recalled in her memoirs that \\"he had spent most of the wealth of the estate\\".Montgomerie, p. 45. Background An item of a knight's armour from the 1839 tournament The Gothic Revival and the rise of Romanticism of the late 18th and early 19th centuries were an international phenomenon. Medieval- style jousts, for example, were regularly held in Sweden between 1777 and 1800.Anstruther, pp. 246‚Äì247 Gothic novels, such as The Castle of Otranto, by Horace Walpole (1717‚Äì1797) and the many works of Sir Walter Scott popularised the idea of passionate romanticism and praise of chivalric ideals. Walpole himself was one of the first in England to renovate his mansion into a mock- Gothic castle, Strawberry Hill (1749‚Äì1777). Medieval culture was widely admired as an antidote to the modern enlightenment and industrial age.This is pretty much the entire thesis of Girouard's book. Plays and theatrical works (such as Ivanhoe, which in 1820 was playing in six different productions in London alone)Anstruther, pp. 122‚Äì123 perpetuated the romanticism of knights, castles, feasts and tournaments. Caspar David Friedrich (1774‚Äì1840) of Germany painted magnificent Gothic ruins and spiritual allegories. Jane Austen (1775‚Äì1815) wrote her novel Northanger Abbey (written 1798, published 1817) as a satire on romantic affectation. The Montgomerie family had a romantic tale of chivalry which bound them to the idea of a revival of such ideals, this being the acquisition of the pennon and spear of Harry Hotspur, aka Sir Henry Percy, at the Battle of OtterburnScott, page 209 by a Montgomerie. The price for Hotspur's release was the building of the castle of Polnoon in Eaglesham, Renfrewshire for the Montgomeries. It is said that the Duke of Northumberland, head of the Percy family, made overtures for the return of the pennon in 1839 and was given the answer, \\"There's as good lea land at Eglinton as ever there was at Chevy Chase (Otterburn); let Percy come and take them.\\"Robertson. p 115.Paterson, p 492 A lance or gonfalon tip from the Eglinton Tournament as found in the nearby Lugton Water in 2008 In 1838 Whig Prime Minister Lord Melbourne announced that the coronation of Queen Victoria would not include the traditional medieval-style banquet in Westminster Hall. Seeking to disempower the monarchy in particular and romantic ideology and politics in general was a normal activity for the Whig party, so, in the face of recession, the more obviously anachronistic parts of the coronation celebrations would be considered an extravagance. Furthermore, memories of embarrassing mishap at George IV's Westminster Hall banquet were still fresh;Anstruther, pp. 5‚Äì9 uproar having resulted when, at the end of the proceedings, people tried to obtain valuable tableware as souvenirs. King William IV had cancelled his banquet to prevent a repeat.Hankinson, Cytil F. J. (1953), The Story of the Coronation. Although there was some popular support for government refusal to hold the traditional event, there were \\"many complaints and various public struggles, as well as on the part of the antiquaries, as on that of the tradesmen of the metropolis\\".Ann. Reg., 1838, p. 96, Chron., cited in Anstruther, p. 1 Critics referred to Victoria's slimmed-down coronation scornfully as \\"The Penny Crowning\\". Despite attempts to achieve economies, contemporary accounts point out that Victoria's coronation in fact cost ¬£20,000 more than that of George IV. Nevertheless, her coronation did feature an innovation: the procession from the palace to Westminster Abbey, which was very popular.Taylor. p 328. However, it was not just the ancient Great Feast itself which had been cancelled but also other rituals which traditionally were not paid for by the state anyway such as the throwing down of the gauntlet by the Queen's Champion, and his symbolic presentation to her of two falcons. \\"Obeisance to the past was in 1839 was not just a fad; for some, it was an urgent need\\". Lord Eglinton's own stepfather, Sir Charles Lamb, as Knight Marshal of the Royal Household, would have led his horse into the Great Hall of Westminster as part of one of these colourful and widely loved rituals. On 4 August 1838, the \\"Court Journal\\" printed a rumour that the Earl of Eglinton, was going to host a great jousting tournament at his castle in Scotland.Girouard, p. 92 It has been speculated that it was Sir Charles or his sonExplanation of family reasons for the holding of the Tournament. who suggested to Lord Eglinton that he should provide the nation with its missing rites of passage by holding a great mediaeval festival himself, but whatever the details, within a few weeks Eglinton had confirmed the rumour true.Anstruther, p. 111 At first the suggestion was that mediaeval games would be held at the next private race meeting at Eglinton, including the ceremony of the challenge carried out by a knight clad in armour.Stevenson, Page 105 Preparation Archibald Montgomerie, the 13th Earl of Eglinton In autumn of 1838 one-hundred and fifty prospective knightsAnstruther, p. 133 met in the showroom of Samuel Pratt, a dealer in medieval armor at No. 47 Bond Street, London.Anstruther, p. 129 Many backed out when they realised the astronomical costs and difficulties, but \\"about forty\\" were determined to try regardless.Anstruther, p. 144 Pratt was to be in charge of all the arrangements, the pavilions and armour, banners, decor and costumes. He also would supply the stands, marquees and great tents for the feast and ball. Although all the armour supplied by Pratt was supposed to have been genuinely medieval, it is unclear how many of the suits actually were; the only armour that was kept track of, that of the 3rd Marquess of Waterford, on display in 1963 at Windsor Castle, is a pastiche.Anstruther, p. 152 The dress rehearsals were held in London at a garden behind the Eyre Arms, St John's Wood,Girouard, p. 91 a tavern close to Regent's Park,Anstruther, p. 153 the last one on Saturday 13 July 1839. Nineteen knights participated. The audience was invitation only; many of \\"the very elite of the most elite\\" (said the \\"Court Journal\\") were invited to watch, and 2,690 attended. The rehearsal went perfectly. The weather was sunny, the banners and armour and tents impressive, the jousting successful. Even critics conceded that the tournament was likely to be a fine show.Anstruther, pp. 161‚Äì163 A set of commemorative jugs. Mass-production of memorabilia copies of artworks commissions for the tournament demonstrated that it was not only upper-class Britain that took notice. Tories eyed antique armour and dreamed of courtly love, and Queen Victoria twice noted in her diary that she had discussed the tournament with Lord Melbourne and although her view was that the event would be a foolish amusement, the choice of the Duchess of Somerset as Queen of Beauty was to her liking.Swinney, Page 25 With only two months to live, Lady Flora Hastings wrote in 1839 to her mother on the subject of the upcoming Eglinton Tournament, expressing her concern that one of the knights might be killed in the violent sport.Swinney, Page 21 On the other hand, the Whigs, the social reformers, and the Utilitarians expressed outrage at such a fantasy at a time when the economy was in a shambles, when poverty was rampant and many workers were starving. Emotions ran high, with satirical cartoons, insults and passions aroused on both sides, the Whigs calling the Tories wastrels and the Tories calling the Whigs heartless. Whatever Eglinton's original intent, the tournament was symbolic of romantic defiance in the face of the spirit of revolution that was frightening so much of old guard Europe during the second quarter of the 19th century.Girouard, pp. 92‚Äì93 Visitors Lord Eglinton announced that the public would be welcome; he requested medieval fancy dress, if possible, and tickets were free but would have to be applied for. Expecting a healthy turnout ‚Äî the Eglinton race meetings generally got local audiences of up to 1500 ‚Äî he made arrangements for grandstands for the guests and comfortable seating for the expected crowd of about 4000. He notified the press (The Times, the Morning Post, the Court Gazette, and \\"the other important or popular journals\\") of the offer of free tickets to all.Anstruther, pp. 167‚Äì168 An official invitation. The response returned from across the social spectrum: readers of the Bath Figaro, the Cornish Guardian, the Sheffield Iris, the Wisbech Star in the East and many other newspapers ‚Äî readers \\"from every county in the British Isles\\" ‚Äî applied to Lord Eglinton for tickets. Through the month of August letters came by the hundreds into Castle Eglinton requesting tickets for parties of twenty, fifty, a hundred people. A scrapbook of nearly a thousand of these letters still survives, filled with pleas, anecdotes, promises of medieval dress, and assertions of Tory sympathies. Lord Eglinton accepted the challenge, issued the requested tickets and planned for a vastly larger effort.Anstruther, pp.168‚Äì176 With a turnout two orders of magnitude greater than expected (the final estimate was a crowd of one hundred thousand),Anstruther, pp. 193‚Äì194 area transportation and lodgings were overwhelmed. The nearby town of Irvine had only one hotel. Private homes were able to charge very high prices to take in the tourists.Anstruther, p. 176 On the morning of the tournament the roads to Eglinton Castle were quickly jammed. The road from Ayr to Glasgow (thirty miles long) was filled end to end, and every approach was blocked by abandoned carriages, their owners continuing on foot.Anstruther, p. 192 The new railway from Ayr to Irvine had just opened to the public on 5 August 1839, and it now charged thrice the normal fee; people fought for the tickets, as it was the only transport guaranteed to deposit them only a few miles from the castle.Anstruther, p. 193 Some poor folk without lodgings are said to have spent the first night beneath the grandstand or even in hollow tree- trunks.Swinney, p. 13 One visitor who travelled from London took steam trains from London to Liverpool, where he boarded a paddle steamer packed with people attending the tournament, its deck heavily laden with boxes, armour, lances and horses of participants. They landed at Ardrossan pier, terminus of the horse-drawn Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway: \\"Disembarking, we seized upon a sort of carriage which plied upon a coal train and carried a large assortment of passengers, all drawn by one horse, and set out for the little town of Irvine. Dismounting thence, we changed after a time into divers coaches and cars, and turning into a romantic and wooded road, passed close by the lodge of the Castle of the Lord of the Tourney.\\" After looking round the busy preparations, he returned to Irvine and found lodgings in a private house across the street from Seagate Castle, then next morning made his way to the tournament. The Tournament=28 August A map showing the layout of the various features associated with the Eglinton Tournament. Note the lakes either side of the bridge,Tait's Edinburgh Magazine. November 1839. formed around 1800.Stoddart. p 313. The tournament was held near Eglinton Castle, eight miles from the west coast of Scotland in Ayrshire, an imitation Gothic, an 18th-century Georgian mansion with battlements and turrets added.Anstruther, p. 188 The event took place on a meadow or holm at a loop in the Lugton Water. The ground chosen for the tournament was low, almost marshy, with grassy slopes rising on all sides.Anstruther, pp. 188‚Äì189 The Knights on horseback and their retinue reached the tilt yard ('C' on the map) via an enclosed ride ('G' on the map), whilst the guests and visitors made their way to the stands via the route marked 'F' on the map illustrated. Both groups crossed over the three arched Gothic Eglinton Tournament Bridge. An 1837 map of Eglinton Castle, Grounds and Tilt yard shows that the tilt yard was already in existence at this early date, but it is not recorded what its fate was after the tournament was over.Anstruther. p 111. A great parade of knights was supposed to open the tournament at noon. The knights had had little practice mounting their horses and took a long time to get prepared. Then each knight and his entourage (forty different groups) was supposed to ride to the castle, pick up a lady, officer or knight, and return to the lists. But there was only one drive to and from the castle, so that the knights had to jostle back and forth past and through each other. There had been no arrangement for parade control, and the knightly gridlock took hours longer to unfold than had been planned. By the time the parade was ready, it was a half mile long and over three hours late.Anstruther, pp. 194‚Äì195 The procession passing the Queen's Gallery. The opening parade comprised forty knights, each with his own entourage who were to ride to the castle, picked up a lady, officer or knight, and returned to the lists, the picturesque estate drive being lined with thousands of spectators. Elaborate rehearsals and training in St John's Wood had not prepared participants for the crowded and already sodden conditions on the day and the opening parade took three hours longer than planned to marshal. Although the day had dawned clear and fine, as the knights and their entourages struggled to organise the parade the sky began to darken. Just at the moment when the parade was finally arranged ‚Äî just as Lady Somerset, the Queen of Beauty, was heralded by trumpets ‚Äî there was a flash of lightning, a great crash of thunder, and the black clouds of Ayrshire let loose with a sudden and violent rainstorm.Anstruther, p. 195 Lord Eglinton immediately ordered the ladies into carriages,Anstruther, p. 196 but the knights and their entourages, soon soaked in the squall and covered in mud, marched into the lists down a parade route lined by the umbrella bearing audience.Anstruther, pp. 202-203 A view of the lists. The tiltyard was designed by Samuel Luke Pratt, with stands to hold 2,000.Mancoff. pp 34‚Äì35 Pratt's grandstand roof, was a work of art in splendid scarlet, but, after days of rain and now in a new rainstorm of freak severity, it started to leak badly. After the tournament Lord Eglinton appeared in the lists, apologised for the rain, and announced that, weather permitting, they would try to joust again the next day or the next. Then he announced to the special guests in the grandstand that the medieval banquet and ball that evening would have to be cancelled as banqueting tents had also succumbed to the weather.Anstruther, pp. 211‚Äì212 The rains had flooded the Lugton Water, which ran around the Lists on three sides. No carriages could cross it, so the entire audience, apart from Eglinton's personal guests, was stranded without transportation.Anstruther, p. 213 They had to walk miles through the rain and the mud to nearby villages, where only the first people found any food, drink, accommodation or transport.Anstruther, p. 215 29 August The next morning, Eglinton consulted with the other participants at the tournament. They agreed to hold a second joust on 30 August. The estate staff set about repairing the damage to the site, including attempting to drain the Lists and mending the grandstand.Anstruther, pp. 220-221 30 August The weather for the final day of the tournament was much better, and crowds gathered again to watch, albeit with fewer in fancy dress. The procession took place, followed by jousting, which was won by James Fairlie on points, although Eglington was nominated the symbolic victor. Edward Jerningham suffered an injury, and required medical attention. A mel√©e was held, during which Henry Waterford and John Alford had to be separated by the marshal. Although the day went well, the heavy mud in the Lists continued to cause the knights difficulties.Antrusther, pp. 220-221 The formal ball concluded the day, commencing with a medieval banquet for 400 people. The dinner was designed to follow authentic medieval recipes, and was served on gold and silver dishes specially manufactured for the occasion. The ball had 2,000 guests, most in medieval costume, who were entertained by an orchestra and the band of the 2nd Dragoon Guards. Heavy rain returned towards the end of the ball, and it was agreed to call the tournament to a close.Antrusther, pp. 223-225 Aftermath Eglinton Trophy detail of the Earl's armour. The Elington Tournament became part of English popular culture. Astley's Amphitheatre in London used it to promote their own medieval reenactment, which was a commercial success, and the tournament was parodied in a pantomime at Covent Garden.Anstruther, pp. 227-229 The Eglinton Trophy or Eglinton Testimonial is a Gothic style one metre high silver centrepiece presented to the 13th Earl of Eglinton by friends and admirers to commemorate the 'Eglinton Tournament'. Panoramas illustrated the tournament, using long strips of painted canvas wound round a tube and slowly unwound to give a view of the event. The venue was Edinburgh in 1839 or 1840.Swinney, Page 71. Heritage The tournament inspired a successor event at Earls' Court, London, in July 1912. Armour used at the tournament has been preserved in the Leeds Armoury, Kelvingrove Museum, Dean Castle and elsewhere. The family sold the Earl of Eglinton's own armour during the 1925 sale of the castle contents.Eglinton Archive. The remnants of the tournament were sold off at a public auction and the glasses and crystal used in the marquees for the medieval ball and feast were sold off soon after. A ship named the 'Eglinton' was partly constructed from the wood used for the jousting arena.Montgomerie, Page 4. The bow used at the tournament by one of the Cochran-Patrick family of Ladyland House is preserved in the Kilwinning Abbey Tower Museum. This bow was made by David Muir of Kilwinning, using Degame wood, otherwise known as lemonwood. The flag that flew over the castle bearing the earl's coat of arms was eventually donated to North Ayrshire Council and is now kept in the North Ayrshire Heritage Centre. The Gothic bridge now at the site of the tournament was not actually built at the time of the tournament and even the previous bridge, originally located 100 yards further up the river, had been in place for at least 25 years at the time of the tournament. The label Tournament Bridge has stuck, despite the inaccuracy. Contemporary engravings and paintings show that it was however heavily embellished with Gothic additions for the event and possibly an ornamental archway.The Tournament, Page 17 As 1989 was the 150th anniversary of the tournament, the staff of the newly opened Eglinton Country Park organised a re-enactment which ran over a period of three days in August of that year. In May 2011 East Ayrshire Council held an exhibition entitled 1839 a Gothic adventure at the Dick Institute, Kilmarnock and published a book with that title.Dunlop The Eglinton Trophy was loaned by the Earl of Eglinton and North Ayrshire Council for the duration.Irvine Herald, Page 3 Two medals produced to commemorate the 1839 exhibition were on display.Eglinton Medal Retrieved : 2011-06-15 ;The Tournament Image:Jane Georgina, Lady Seymour, Eglinton Tournament..jpgDuchess of Somerset, Queen of Beauty Image:Archibald William Montgomerie, Lord of the Tournament.jpgArchibald, Earl of Eglinton, Lord of the Tournament Image:The Procession to the lists.

On April 30, 2012, it was announced on-air that regular guest contributor Stephen A. Smith would be joining First Take on a permanent, five-day-per-week basis. On occasions he was reporting from elsewhere, Rob Parker was frequently featured as his replacement until December 20, 2012, when he was suspended for comments made about Robert Griffin III; he would not return, as ESPN allowed his contract to expire, rather than re-sign him. In June 2012, long-time host Crawford announced he would be leaving First Take in order to present SportsCenter. On July 23, 2012, the show debuted a new set and a new opening song Every Word Great by Wale featuring Stalley. It now featured an open slideshow showing Bayless and Smith arriving at campus (Once Kellerman joined the show in 2016, scenes showing Kellerman replaced those of Bayless). They are still in Studio E but they are in the middle of it, with a new desk. In line with these changes, First Take introduced on October 1, 2012 a new permanent moderator, Cari Champion, previously a reporter from the Tennis Channel. Previously, the show had a rotation of moderators, such as Todd Grisham, Don Bell (now Sports Director & anchor with Philadelphia's KYW-TV), Cindy Brunson (now with Fox Sports Arizona) and Jemele Hill. On January 13, 2015, the first special edition of the show aired after the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship titled First Take: College Football Championship Post Game Special. On June 19, 2015, Champion left First Take due to her promotion to SportsCenter anchor. The following month, she was replaced on an interim basis by Molly Qerim, who was promoted to permanent host on September 15. On July 25, 2016, Max Kellerman permanently replaced Skip Bayless as the First Take co-host as Bayless had left ESPN to join rival network FS1 and started another sports talk program called Skip and Shannon: Undisputed. On January 3, 2017, First Take switched channels with the two editions of SportsCenter. First Take moved to ESPN, while the 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. ET editions of SportsCenter moved to ESPN2. The show moved to ESPN‚Äôs New York studios on September 4, 2018 and received a new logo and graphics as part of the move. Controversy Through the show's success, First Take has experienced substantial controversy and faced increasing criticism, mostly concerning perceived sensationalism. Among claims have been that First Take has used hot button racial issues to create inflammatory debates and increase ratings. Most notably, during a discussion regarding Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III, frequent guest Rob Parker asked whether Griffin III was a \\"brother\\" or a \\"cornball brother.\\" When pressed by host Cari Champion as to what that meant, Parker mentioned that Griffin III had a white fianc√© and mentioned claims that Griffin III was a Republican. In response, Bayless asked whether Griffin III's braids did anything to assuage Parker's concerns. Stephen A. Smith has also been at the center of the controversy with remarks about Cleveland Cavalier J.R. Smith's dress wear during a Cavaliers game that included a \\"hoodie\\" being worn on the bench in late October 2017. This resulted in a public rant by J.R. Smith taking to Twitter to express his disapproval of Stephen A. Smith's comments, ultimately ending the rant with the accusation of Smith being an \\"Uncle Tom\\". J.R. Smith made these remarks due to a segment from Stephen A. Smith stating that \\"white folks\\" would be of disapproval in regard to what could be a \\"Trayvon Martin case being revisited\\" with a tweet questioning the work of Stephen A. Smith stating, \\"this man is always reaching. What does me wearing a hoodie on the bench have anything to do with reminding people of #TrayvonMartin\\". Stephen A. Smith not only reprimanded Smith for wearing a hoodie during the fourth quarter of a late October game, but reprimanded Nike for making a uniform that is unprofessional amongst racial remarks. The show has been criticized for what is perceived by many as its excessive coverage of the career of Tim Tebow. During his tenure with the Jets, in which he did not start in a game, and threw just eight passes the entire season. Tebow was nonetheless often a leading topic. As Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James began a series of playoff appearances with the Cavs, host Skip Bayless became well known for his belief that James had been overrated by the media and not received enough criticism for his team's playoff failures. Bayless has himself been criticized by fans as well as members of the media for exaggerating James' failures and diminishing his successes. In an exchange with Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, Cuban argued that Bayless had reduced his analysis of the 2011 and 2012 NBA Finals series to subjective and limited assessments of player psyche, and had not even considered the offensive and defensive strategies used by the teams in each series. On July 29, 2014, ESPN suspended co-host Stephen A. Smith from the show for one week over his controversial comments regarding the NFL's decision to suspend Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice for the first two games of the 2014 season as a result of his domestic violence incident with his fianc√©e in February 2014. In February 2016, Stephen A. Smith, as well as ESPN, Little League Baseball, and Chris Janes, were sued by the parents of players from the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, whose 2014 Little League World Series title was vacated after Janes found the team had used ineligible players from outside a defined regional boundary. The lawsuit contained an allegation that Smith had made a defamatory remark regarding the controversy on First Take, which \\"directly accused the JRW parents of perpetrating a fraud against the Little League\\".

Design and development The aircraft was a development of a military and civilian trainer plane LWD Junak-1, meant as a civilian aerobatics and trainer plane for the Polish Aero Club. It was designed in the Lotnicze Warsztaty Do≈õwiadczalne (LWD - Aircraft Experimental Workshops), a main designer was Tadeusz So≈Çtyk. The design was similar to Junak-1, the main difference was en engine. Unlike Junak, its fixed landing gear, in massive covers, was lacking struts. It was also fitted with split flaps and had slightly enlarged rudder (similar improvements were later adapted in Junak-2). Description Mixed construction (steel and wood) low-wing monoplane, conventional in layout. Fuselage of a steel frame, covered with canvas, in front with metal sheet. Two-spar wings of wooden construction and trapezoid shape, canvas and plywood covered, fitted with split flaps. Cockpit with two seats in tandem, under a multi-part closed canopy. Conventional fixed landing gear with a tail wheel, main gear in massive covers. Engine in front: Zuch-1: 6-cylinder inline engine Walter Minor 6-III (118 kW / 160 hp), Zuch-2: 7-cylinder radial engine Bramo Sh 14 (118 kW / 160 hp) with a ring cover with individual cowls for cylinders. Two-blade wooden propeller. The first variant Zuch-1 was powered by the Czechoslovak 160 hp Walter Minor 6-III inline engine in a long, slant nose. The prototype flew first on September 1, 1948. The design was quite successful and fit to aerobatics, but it did not enter production because of decision not to produce Walter Minor engines in Poland. The prototype served in aero clubs from 1950 until end of 1955, with markings SP-BAD. The second prototype Zuch-2 was fitted with a radial engine Bramo Sh 14. It was flown on April 1, 1949 and carried markings SP-BAG. Because of increased drag, maximum speed was lower - 222 km/h comparing to 244 km/h of Zuch-1. Because there were several Sh 14 engines available, left in the country by retreating Germans, the LWD next built a short series of 5 Zuch-2s in 1950. They carried markings SP-BAL - SP- BAP and served in aero clubs until 1955, except SP-BAM, which served until 1963.

In 2011, the federal authorities decided to gradually phase out nuclear power in Switzerland. Nuclear power in Switzerland is generated by three nuclear power plants, with a total of four operational reactors (see list below). In 2013, they produced 24.8 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, down 5.8% from 2007, when 26.4 TWh were produced. Nuclear power accounted for 36.4% of the nation's gross electricity generation of 68.3 TWh, while 57.9% was produced by hydroelectric plants and 5.7% came from conventional thermal power stations and non-hydro renewable energy sources. In addition, there were a number of research reactors in Switzerland, such as the CROCUS reactor at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne which is currently the last one left since 2013. Switzerland uses nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. Any project for the adoption of nuclear weapons was definitively dropped in 1988. Nuclear waste from power plants was processed mostly overseas until 2016. Storage is done on surface sites as plans are underway to move nuclear waste underground. In 2011, the federal authorities decided to gradually phase out nuclear power in Switzerland as a consequence of the Fukushima accident in Japan. In late 2013 the operator BKW decided to cease all electrical generation in 2019 in the M√ºhleberg plant, which has a similar design to Fukushima. Axpo is expected to come up with a similar decision for its aging Beznau Nuclear Power Plant, which houses the oldest commercial reactor of the world. As of 8 December 2014, the National Council has voted to limit the operational life-time of the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant to 60 years, forcing its two reactors to be decommissioned by 2029 and 2031, respectively. A popular initiative calling for nuclear power phase-out by 2029 was rejected by voters in 2016; however, on 1 January 2018 an amendment (article 12a) to the Swiss Nuclear Energy Act (Kernenergiegesetz) came into effect, prohibiting the issuing of new general licences for nuclear power plants. Reactors= Power reactors  The 970-megawatt (MW) G√∂sgen nuclear power plant Switzerland has three nuclear power plants with four reactors in operation as of late December, 2019: (Beznau and G√∂sgen also provide district heating in addition to power production) * Beznau 1 (1969) and Beznau 2 (1972) (PWR) ‚Äì 365 MWe each : Plant safety (each unit): Double containment, large dry; 3 lines safety injection, high and low pressure; 3 lines emergency feedwater; part of these ECCS systems in a bunkered building; ability to connect external water sources * G√∂sgen (KKG) (1979) (PWR) ‚Äì 970 MWe : Plant safety: Double containment, large dry; 4 lines for high and low pressure safety injection (50% each); 4 lines emergency feedwater (50% each); 2 additional lines emergency feedwater; part of these ECCS systems bunkered; ability to connect external water sources * Leibstadt (KKL) (1984) (BWR) ‚Äì 1,165 MWe : Safety: Double containment (with additional wetwell), pressure suppression (4000 m3 water pool); 4 lines (50% each) low pressure injection (with 2 lines RHR), 2 diverse lines high pressure injection; 1 additional line with 2 pumps emergency injection (with 1 line RHR); nearly all the ECCS systems bunkered; ability to connect external water sources. The Beznau reactors are owned by the Axpo Holding, that also control major parts of Leibstadt. Alpiq own 40% of G√∂sgen and 27.4% of Leibstadt.  Decommissioned and closed reactors  In May 2017, Switzerland voted to phase out nuclear power in the country. A timetable for the phase out of nuclear power plants has not been set. The cost of decommissioning and waste management has been estimated at USD24.7 billion. * Lucens' (1968) (GCHWR) ‚Äì 6 MWe :The Lucens experimental reactor power plant was opened in 1962. It housed an experimental power reactor, heavy-water moderated and cooled by carbon dioxide. It has been shut down since 1969 after a partial core meltdown.

The meltdown is considered the worst nuclear meltdown in Switzerland's history. * M√ºhleberg (KKM) (1972-2019) (BWR) ‚Äì 355 MWe :Closed Dec. 20, 2019 and being prepared for nuclear decommissioning. The M√ºhleberg reactor is owned by BKW (Bernische Kraftwerke AG), majority-owned by the canton of Berne. Plant safety: Double containment, pressure suppression (torus, with 2200 m3 water pool); 4 lines low pressure core spray; 4 lines RHR (torus cooling); 2 turbine-driven HP systems; part of the ECCS systems bunkered; ability to connect external water sources.  Research and teaching reactors  The CROCUS reactor of the √âcole polytechnique f√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) * SAPHIR : The reactors that became known as SAPHIR was a 10‚Äì100 kW-range swimming-pool reactor of demonstration brought to Switzerland by the U.S. delegation to the First Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy that took place in Geneva in August 1955. It has been the first reactor ever shown in operation to the public, worldwide. After the conference the reactor was purchased by the Swiss government on behalf of Reaktor AG, a consortium interested in the development of nuclear energy in Switzerland. The reactor was moved to W√ºrenlingen on the location of the future Paul Scherrer Institut and received its name, SAPHIR, on 17 May 1957. (The name of the reactor was inspired by the color of the Cherenkov radiation which was visible when the reactor was in operation.) Operable until 1994. * University of Geneva AGN-201-P reactor The University of Geneva acquired a 20 W water-moderated and graphite-reflected research reactor fueled by 20%-enriched Uranium from Aerojet General Nucleonics (AGN) in 1958. It was operated mostly as a teaching reactor until 1989, when it was shutdown and decommissioned. * University of Basel AGN-211-P reactor : The University of Basel acquired the AGN-211-P reactor presented at the 1958 World Exposition in Brussels, Belgium. It was a 2 kW water-moderated reactor fueled with high-enriched Uranium and operated from 1959 to 2013 as a teaching and experimental reactor, used amongst other things for neutron activation analysis. * DIORIT : A small heavy water-cooled and -moderated research reactor, operated 1960 to 1977 at the former Federal Institute for Reactor Research (now Paul Scherrer Institut). There was also, in the context of Cold War, the theoretical idea of producing weapons-grade Plutonium in it, besides its research purpose. It was also the first reactor to be entirely designed and built in Switzerland. * PROTEUS : PROTEUS was a zero-power research reactor operated from 1968 to 2011 at what is now the Paul Scherrer Institute, W√ºrenlingen. Its peculiarity was that its core was composed of an hollow cavity whose configuration could be changed by filling it with very diverse types of nuclear fuels, including sub-critical assemblies. It was otherwise composed of a graphite reflector and driver containing 5%-enriched Uranium dioxide fuel rods. This flexibility lead it to be used in four major experimental programs exploring varied reactor designs such as Gas-cooled fast reactors, Pebble-bed reactors, High-conversion Light Water Reactors and finally configurations employing real spent nuclear fuel from Swiss nuclear power plants. * CROCUS : It is a zero-power (licensed to 100 W max power) LWR used for teaching at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL). CROCUS is a critical assembly, built in part from the elements of a dismantled subcritical assembly: Cactus. The name of the latter originated for the numerous instrumentation bars that came out of the core. CROCUS is another name in the XXXus series for nuclear installations at EPFL, e.g. the D-T nuclear fusion facility: Lotus. (').  Seismicity  Extending across the north and south side of the Alps, Switzerland lies at the junction of the Apulian and Eurasian tectonic plates, and there are many active seismic areas under the mountains that show that stresses continue to be released along deep fault lines. The 1356 Basel earthquake is the most significant seismological event to have occurred in Central Europe in recorded history\\"The most damaging intra-plate earthquake known to have occurred in central Europe\\", according to (Risk Management Solutions) 1356 Basel Earthquake: 650-year Retrospective, 2006. and may have had a Mw magnitude as strong as 7.1. Between 2002 and 2004 a major study was conducted to assess the seismic risk to Swiss nuclear power plants. The PEGASOS study, which cost around 10 million Swiss Francs (approximately $11 million) and which was conducted by 21 European experts with American involvement, concluded that the earthquake risk in Switzerland is twice as large as had been previously thought. In 2011, following the nuclear emergencies at Japan's Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and other nuclear facilities Swiss Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard announced on 14 March a freeze in the authorisation procedures for three new nuclear power plants (see Politics), and ordered a safety review of the country's existing plants. There was also concern in Switzerland over the seismic risks of the Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant, located in France approximately from the Swiss border. Following Fukushima the Swiss cantons of Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft and Jura asked the French government to suspend the operation of Fessenheim while undertaking a safety review based on the lessons learned from Japan. On 6 April 2011, the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt went further and voted for the plant to be closed. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in November 2018 the closure of Fessenheim's reactors, scheduled for 2020.  Waste management  Radioactive waste from nuclear power plants is in the tens of thousand tonnes in Switzerland. Its management is the responsibility of the producer. Up until 2016, processing of nuclear waste was mostly done overseas. A 10-year moratorium on its export was issued in 2016. Radioactive waste from nuclear power plants in Switzerland is stored on surface sites (mostly in the ZWILAG-building). Plans are underway to move the waste to permanent sites underground.  Politics  In Switzerland there have been many referenda on the topic of nuclear energy, beginning in 1979 with a citizens' initiative for nuclear safety, which was rejected. In 1984, there was a vote on an initiative \\"for a future without further nuclear power stations\\" with the result being a 55 to 45% vote against. On 23 September 1990 Switzerland had two more referenda about nuclear power. The initiative \\"stop the construction of nuclear power stations,\\" which proposed a ten-year moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants, was passed with 54.5% to 45.5%. The initiative for a phase-out was rejected with by 53% to 47.1%. In 2000 there was a vote on a Green Tax for support of solar energy. It was rejected by 67% to 31%. On 18 May 2003, there were two referenda: \\"Electricity without Nuclear,\\" asking for a decision on a nuclear power phase-out, and \\"Moratorium Plus,\\" for an extension of the earlier decided moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants. Both were turned down. The results were: Moratorium Plus: 41.6% Yes, 58.4% No; Electricity without Nuclear: 33.7% Yes, 66.3% No. The program of the \\"Electricity without Nuclear\\" petition was to shut down all nuclear power stations by 2033, starting with Unit 1 and 2 of Beznau nuclear power stations, M√ºhleberg in 2005, G√∂sgen in 2009, and Leibstadt in 2014. \\"Moratorium Plus\\" was for an extension of the moratorium for another 10 years, and additionally a condition to stop the present reactors after 40 years of operation. In order to extend the 40 years by 10 more years another referendum would have to be held. The rejection of the Moratorium Plus had come to surprise to many, as opinion polls before the referendum have showed acceptance. Reasons for the rejections in both cases were seen in the worsened economic situation. On 10 June 2008, ATEL submitted an application to the Swiss Federal Office of Energy for the construction of a new plant in the Niederamt region (SO). A further two applications were to be presented by Axpo and BKW before the end of 2008. In May 2011, the Swiss government decided to abandon plans to build new nuclear reactors. The country's five existing reactors will be allowed to continue operating, but will not be replaced at the end of their life span. The last will go offline in 2034. In October 2016 energy companies formally withdrew their 2008 applications to build three new power plants. In November 2016, a referendum was held concerning a Green Party initiative that would have phased out all nuclear plants after a life-span of 45 years. The three oldest nuclear plants (Beznau 1 and 2, and M√ºhleberg) would have had to be shut down as early as 2017, and every remaining plant by 2029. The initiative was rejected by 54.2% of voters. On 21 May 2017, 58% of Swiss voters accepted the new Energy Act establishing the energy strategy 2050 and forbidding the construction of new nuclear power plants.

Career John Lowell Jr. was the son of John Lowell (1743‚Äì1802). He graduated from Phillips Andover and then from Harvard in 1786. After studying law, he was admitted to the bar in 1789 (like his father, before he was twenty years old). In 1797, he gave the Fourth of July Address at Faneuil Hall in Boston, in which he criticized revolutionary France. From 1798-1801, he served as a Federalist member of the Massachusetts legislature. In 1801, along with Harrison Gray Otis, he defended Jason Fairbanks against charges of murdering Elizabeth Fales in Dedham, Massachusetts. Despite a vigorous defense, Fairbanks was convicted and executed by hanging. This, followed by the death of his father in 1802, caused him to suffer a breakdown. He retired from active law practice in 1803, and traveled with his family to Europe for the next three years, touring England, France, and Italy. After his return to the United States in 1806, he took up residence at his father's old estate in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Roxbury, Massachusetts, and devoted himself to literature, writing on politics, agriculture, theology, and other topics, under various signatures, such as: \\"Citizen of Massachusetts\\", \\"Massachusetts Lawyer\\", \\"Layman\\", and \\"Yankee Farmer\\". He vigorously opposed French influence and the policies of the Democratic-Republican Party, writing many spirited pamphlets (some signed \\"The Boston Rebel\\", some \\"The Roxbury Farmer\\"), including: The Antigallican (1797), Remarks on the Hon. J. Q. Adams's Review of Mr Ames's Works (1809), New England Patriot, being a Candid Comparison of the Principles and Conduct of the Washington and Jefferson Administrations (1810), Appeals to the People on the Causes and Consequences of War with Great Britain (1811) and Mr Madison's War (1812). The pamphlets contained an extreme statement of the anti-war wing of the Federalist party and defended British impressment as a right of long standing. In his 1814 work, Thoughts in a Series of Letters, in Answer to a Question Respecting the Division of the States, Lowell advocated that all states admitted after the original thirteen be expelled from the Union. After the war Lowell abandoned politics, and won for himself the title of \\"the Columella of New England\\" by his interest in agriculture ‚Äî he was for many years president of the Massachusetts Agricultural Society. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1804. From 1810 until 1828 he was a member of the corporation of Harvard, which gave him the degree of LL.D. in 1814. In this role, he was a driving force behind the establishment of Harvard Law School, although he declined an offer to serve as the school's first professor of law. He was a benefactor of the Boston Athenaeum, serving at various times as President and Vice President, as well as the Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1839, he traveled to the Caribbean in an attempt to recover his failing health. After his return, he died suddenly on 12 March 1840, at his townhouse in Boston on Tremont Street. His funeral sermon was delivered by the Rev. Francis W. P. Greenwood. Edward Everett said of him: \\"He possessed colloquial powers of the highest order and a flow of unstudied eloquence never surpassed, and rarely, as with him, united with the command of an accurate, elegant, and logical pen\\". Works Among his political pamphlets, of which he published about twenty-five, are: * \\"Peace without Dishonor ‚Äî War without Hope, an Inquiry into the Subject of the 'Chesapeake' \\" (Boston, 1807) * \\"Candid Comparison of the Washington and Jefferson Administrations\\" (1810) * \\"Diplomatick Policy of Mr. Madison Unveiled\\" (1810) * \\"Mr. Madison's War; a Dispassionate Inquiry into the Reasons alleged by Madison for declaring an Offensive and Ruinous War against Great Britain\\" (1812) His theological writings include \\"Are you a Christian or a Calvinist?\\" (1815). Family John Lowell Jr. was one of many notable members of the Lowell family. His brother, Francis Cabot Lowell was the founder of U.S. cotton manufacturing. Lowell's other brother, Charles Lowell, was for many years the minister at the West End Church in Boston, and was the father of the famed poet and diplomat James Russell Lowell. In 1793, Lowell married Rebecca Amory, the daughter of merchant Jonathan Amory and the Boston diarist Katharine Greene Amory.Lawrence, Robert Means. The Descendants of Major Samuel Lawrence of Groton, Massachusetts: With Some Mention of Allied Families. Printed at the Riverside Press, 1904, pp. 178‚Äì79. His son John Amory Lowell (1798-1881) was one of the leading industrialists of New England in the nineteenth century, and like his father played a prominent role in the development of Harvard during forty years as a member of the corporation. Lowell's two grandsons also reached prominence. John Lowell (1824-1897) was a federal judge, and Augustus Lowell (1830-1900) followed his father into the textile industry, making a fortune. Lowell's great-grandchildren, too, were notable in numerous ways: Percival Lowell (1855-1916) was a leading astronomer; A. Lawrence Lowell (1856-1943) served as President of Harvard; James A. Lowell (1869-1933) was a federal judge; and Amy Lowell (1874-1925) was a Pulitzer Prize winning poet.

Its road access is via McKinney Road from Oliver and from BC Highway 33 north of Bridesville and BC Highway 3 west of Rock Creek, in the Boundary Country. Air access from Penticton Regional Airport (Air Canada from Vancouver, Westjet from Calgary). The summit is in the Okanagan Highland, an intermediary plateau-like area between the Monashee Mountains to the east and the Okanagan Valley immediately below to the west. In 1968, its first season, Mt. Baldy Ski Area operated as a ski cat area with McKinney T-Bar. A year later, the resort acquired a Poma T-bar that traveled up the face of Mount Baldy. The T-bar base at 5650 ft above sea level is the highest base altitude of any ski resort in Canada. The Poma T-bar was replaced with the former Blue Chair (double Mueller lift) from Mount Washington on Vancouver Island. This lift is now called the Eagle Chair. Sugarlump lift was installed in 2007. The Sugarlump lift is a Leitner Poma fixed-grip quad chair lift. Total uphill capacity is 750 persons per hour. Baldy Mountain Resort consists of 35 downhill skiing trails. In 2012 a trail was cut leading from Sugarlump to the McKinney area to access the terrain park. Nordic trails are also open December through March. The hill is unique as the associated village of 150 ski cottages are ski-in ski-out, although the strata is not associated with the ski hill.. There is a ski school, day-lodge and lounge, ski equipment rentals and snow shoe rentals are available in the Snow Sports Centre. The ski hill did not open for the 2013-14 season due to financial difficulties. In July 2014, the Supreme Court of British Columbia granted conduct of sale in a foreclosure action to a secured creditor of Mount Baldy. In the foreclosure, G-Force Real Estate Inc. of Vancouver, B.C. has been appointed as Marketing Agent to sell most of the assets of Mount Baldy Ski Corporation and related companies. Mount Baldy did operate during the 2014-15 season, opening middle of January 2015 with just the Sugarlump lift operating along with the magic carpet. Food and liquor service was offered in the lodge. New ownership took over in 2016 with rebranding the ski area to Baldy Mountain Resort in an attempt to differentiate itself from other ski areas named Mt. Baldy and opened the ski hill successfully for 16/17 season. Baldy Mountain Resort is still in operation under the new ownership with plans to update the infrastructure in the near future.

History English Electric Wren at the Shuttleworth Collection The Wren, designed by W. O. Manning, was a lightweight motor-glider. Manning was a designer of flying boats and decided to try a simpler project. The Wren was a single-engined high-wing monoplane with an empty weight of only 232 lb (105 kg). The first aircraft (Serial Number J6973) was built in 1921 for the Air Ministry. Interest in building very light aircraft was encouraged at the time by a ¬£500 prize offered by the Duke of Sutherland (who was the Under-Secretary of State for Air). The entrants had to build the most economical light single- seat aircraft. Another incentive was a ¬£1,000 prize offered by the Daily Mail for the longest flight by a motor-glider with an engine of not more than 750 cc. Two aircraft were built for the 1923 Lympne light aircraft trials in October 1923. The Wren shared the first prize with the ANEC I when it covered 87.5 miles (140.8 km) on one Imperial gallon (4.5 litres) of fuel. In 1957 the third aircraft was rebuilt using parts of the second aircraft.

A real estate development at the base of the mountain would comprise 47 single-family lots and 106 multi-family units.Prince George Citizen, 23 Mar 1983 The plan, approved 15 months later by the regional district, also included modular (construction site style) buildings for a restaurant, bar and ski services, two buildings for equipment storage, a gas station and upgrades to existing buildings.Prince George Citizen, 25 Jun 1984 The $4 million first phase was completed for the 1984/85 season. The former T-bar had featured a 360-metre vertical drop and 1,225-metre slope length. The new Doppelmayr triple chair had a vertical drop of 360 metres over 1,296 metres, while the new Doppelmayr T-bar featured a drop of 255 metres over 878 metres, all with a 1,600-skiers-per-hour carrying capacity. On reaching the top of the triple chair, skiers had the option of skiing down a moderate distance to the new T-bar that took riders to just below the tree line. Base facilities included 1,115 square metres of day lodges and a 500-car parking lot.Prince George Citizen, 11 Oct 1984 A 60-room hostel opened the following fall.Prince George Citizen, 24 Aug 1985 In 1988, one tender called for the laying of sewer pipes, site grading, an access road and parking lot. Another tender covered the construction of two three-storey clusters of six condominiums.Prince George Citizen: 21 & 24 May 1988 A proposed $3.3-million second phase expansion included a 3,450-square-metre 80-bed hotel/lodge complex with condominium units, and a residential subdivision entailing 14 single-family cabins. This accommodation was intended to replace the existing facilities nicknamed Chateau ATCO. The former Azu Village lift would augment the other lifts.Prince George Citizen, 21 Apr 1989 A month later, the regional district gave initial approval to the plan, but noted concerns over recovering the district loan for the sewer connection if the business failed.Prince George Citizen, 19 May 1989 Mitchell Syndicate In 1991, a new 669-square-metre day lodge was under construction when a group of seven investors purchased the ski village. Rob Mitchell became the general manager and chief executive officer.Prince George Citizen: 9 & 12 Sep 1991 The scope of the 1994-96 highway reconstruction included relocating the Powder King turnoff about 60 metres to the south to provide safer highway access, and constructing a snowmobile parking area.Prince George Citizen: 3 Jun 1994 & 25 Jul 1994 In arrears, the 1983 development loan was restructured in 1994, but continuing in default, the B.C. government placed the business in receivership less than a year later. Arthur Andersen advertised the sale and announced the ski village closure. Carrying about $1 million in debts, a further substantial cash injection was needed to repair and upgrade the equipment.Prince George Citizen: 27 Sep 1995; 20, 21 & 31 Oct 1995; & 16 Nov 1995 Rick Merton, with local partners Steve Johnson and Gary McIntyre, bid $967,000 for the facility.Prince George Citizen: 8 & 10 Nov 1995 Failing to arrange financing within the required five business days, North Star Powder Resorts, their partnership, forfeited its $48,000 deposit.Prince George Citizen: 15, 16 & 17 Nov 1995 Doyle partnership Richard Doyle headed the group tendering the second-place bid of $811,000.

The film premiered on 5 October 1922 at the Olympic Theater in Shanghai.Huang, Zhiwei. Old Shanghai Movies (In Chinese). Shanghai: Wen Hui Press, 1998, p.5. It is also known as Romance of a Fruit Peddler or Romance of a Fruit Pedlar (). It constitutes the earliest complete film from China's early cinematic history that survives today. The film was also one of the earliest productions of the soon-to-be prolific Mingxing Film Company and was directed and written by Mingxing co-founders Zhang Shichuan and Zheng Zhengqiu. Notably, the film has both Chinese and English intertitles, indicating that at this early point in Shanghai cinema history, films were tailored to both Chinese and Western audiences. A subtitled version of the film, which represents differences between the Chinese and English text of the intertitles, is available on YouTube. Director * Zhang Shichuan (1889-1953 or 1890-1954) * A founding father of Chinese Cinema * Directed about 150 films in his career Cast * Zheng Zhegu as the Carpenter Zheng/the fruit peddler *Zheng Zhengqiu as Doctor Zhu * Yu Ying as Miss Zhu (The daughter of Doctor Zhu) Plot As the film begins, Carpenter Zheng has just come back to Shanghai after living in Nanyang in Southeast Asia. Upon his return, he decides to change professions, becoming a fruit vendor. His business attracts a lot of attention from neighborhood children and Carpenter Zheng is kept busy by his work, in contrast to the struggling medical clinic across the street. The clinic is run by Doctor Zhu and his daughter Miss Zhu, and a romantic attraction quickly develops between the young woman and Zheng. The couple communicates with each other by connecting the fruit-stand to the medical clinic via a string, along which they transport baskets filled with objects back and forth to each other,which also known as fruit throwing connection(zhiguo yuan ChineseÔºöÊé∑ÊûúÁºòÔºâ . Later, Miss Zhu visits Zheng's fruit stand and he helps her to get rid of a gang member who has been harassing her. Eventually, Miss Zhu and Zheng fall in love, but Doctor Zhu opposes the relationship because of Zheng's lower socioeconomic status. However, in the face of his own financial hardships, Doctor Zhu agrees to let Zheng marry his daughter if the younger man can help to revive his falling medical business. Zheng is dismayed, believing this to be an impossible task, but soon he comes up with the idea to modify the staircase of a gambling club near the doctor's office. He alters the staircase so that he can transform it into a sliding ramp at will; after this, he merely has to wait for unsuspecting customers to leave the club and promptly slide to the bottom of the staircase, injuring themselves at the bottom. He repeats this numerous times, creating a huge new client base for Doctor Zhu to the point where the old man can barely keep up with the demand, requiring Zheng to step in and provide his services as well. With the medical clinic prospering once again, Doctor Zhu gladly approves the marriage between Miss Zhu and Zheng. Title As the earliest surviving film from the last century in China - \\"Romance of a Fruit Peddler\\", also known as \\"Laborer's Love\\", although it is a silent film, it would still be interesting to watch it now. In Chinese, \\"Romance of a Fruit Peddler\\" means gain a relationship by throwing fruits. One would not understand the meaning of throwing fruit until one watched the film. \\"Romance of a Fruit Peddler\\" or„ÄäÊé∑ÊûúÁºò„Äãis not the wrong name, but Carpenter Zheng, who is turning to the fruit business, falls in love with the daughter of Doctor Zhu. Carpenter Zheng uses a rope that connects with a basket to throw the fruit to Miss Zhu to express his love, which is to throw fruit. Film Background Since this film was made in 1922, it was influenced by the cinema and social movements of Modern China, including an American comedian by the name of Harold Lloyd who was well known for his silent comedy films. Doctor Zhu wears glasses in a similar style to the ones characteristically worn by Harold Lloyd, and one scene has Carpenter Zheng come into possession of the glasses and try them on in a shot that imitates the iconic image of this popular actor. This results in a blurry point-of-view shot that emphasizes the difference in perspective between the two characters, with Carpenter Zheng representing modern social views and Doctor Zhu representing traditional ones. The film's romantic narrative provides further commentary on how traditional Chinese values were changing in the shift to the modern era, from its depiction of increasing social mobility to the negotiation of marriage and family through feudal and patriarchal codes. Along with referencing Harold Lloyd, the film incorporates the surprise slide staircase, which was a gag popularized by American silent comedian Buster Keaton in his film The Haunted House. This appears in the film when Carpenter Zheng modifies the staircase to a night club into a slide that he can activate at will. In 2007, Australian ensemble Blue Grassy Knoll wrote a new score for Labourer's Love, and performed it live in Shanghai and Beijing as part of the Australian Theatre Festival.  Social Influence  *The Laborer's Love was influenced by the May Fourth Movement which began in 1919. In the film, the carpenter asks Miss Zhu \\"Will you marry me?\\". The scenes were incompatible with the traditional concept in China at that time. . In light of these social changes, filmmakers sought to pay respect to traditional Chinese moral values, especially arranged marriage, while also advocating the current ideas about free love between two young people without any consequences. *After the star film industry, the commercial pass event, the movie theatre department, the Shanghai film and television company, and Hong Kong Guangya company have modeled this kind of short comedy film and successfully released a large number of such films. In the early and middle period of the 1920s, China produced a large number of short comedy films, The Labourer's love became the representative of early Chinese films.  Culture Reference  One of the alternative titles of the film, Zhiguoyuan, meaning \\"fruit-throwing love connection\\", is a reference to an old Chinese folktale, showing how the film balances old traditions with new innovations in social norms. The film's narrative adapts this traditional motif in the lovers' use of a string to send objects back and forth to each other in a distinctly modern love story. What is unique about Laborer's Love is that it does not contain the demeanour that is common in early Chinese slapstick comedies, and even uses a connecting device between Zheng and Zhu to make men and women more equal. Compared with previous comedies in China's male-dominated society, it is rare for Chinese love stories in this period to apply this kind of \\"friendly\\" drama to the love between a man and a woman.Moreover, The friut basket which was carpentered by the vendor contains two functions: one is that it is used as a connection device for the doctor's daughter and the carpenter/vendor to communicate love with each other; the other is that the basket then serve its comedic function as a mischievous device to fool the doctor. The film contains further references to traditional Chinese culture, such as the scene where the carpenter breaks open a watermelon. This is a reference to an old Chinese idiom called Á†¥Áìú‰πãÂπ¥Ôºàp√≤ guƒÅ zhƒ´ ni√°n), meaning that the girl is at an age where she is \\"ripe\\", or mature enough to marry and bear children. This relates to the film because Miss Zhu is at an age where she is ready for marriage, implied when the carpenter is seen breaking a watermelon in two. Furthermore, the property\\"staircase\\" raises a conflicting conversation regarding to the moral principles, the carpenter's actions are considered as immoral; however,as an element of comedy, it is normal to see these actions towards those who are considered as bad in the society as a form of \\"moral justification\\". what's more, the thick pair of glasses is at once a status symbol of his professional respectability and paternal authority and a sign of his laughable pedantry and senility. it implicitly reflects that the modern cultural aims to abandon the old ‚Äúpedantry and senility‚Äùin China.  Influence From The Western Film Market  While Laborer's Love is now canonized as the earliest surviving Chinese film, short comedy films were in fact looked down upon by 1920s Chinese audiences and did not do well at the box office, meaning that the film is not an accurate representation of the film culture at this point in Chinese history. In the 1920s, 90% of the films released in China were American films, which greatly influenced both Chinese filmmakers and the Chinese film market. Many of the jokes and visual themes in the work were inspired by American silent film comedians Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, which also shows the global character of the film. But the local Chinese film is not only influenced by the Western film market. In fact, the studio that created it had its roots in part in the United States, and its English title suggests that Chinese films also exist in the culture of English-speaking audiences. It was very complicated in the early 20th century in Shanghai as the Western influence became more prevalent, and the film represents this mixing of culture as Western and Eastern skills and technologies collided. This film shows how China was becoming more open to foreign technologies that are displayed on-screen, such as the alarm clock, table lamp, Western-style furniture and the appearance of the night club. Laborer's Love came into being during the transition period from short films to long films. According to statistical information, there were nearly 30 short films made in China in the span of 1918 to 1928. The subjects of these short films were primarily marketable slapstick dramas with exaggerated actions and simple plots, while still retaining the traditional mode of civilized drama.  The Chinese and English bilingual intertitles  First of all, the Chinese film industry did not start from filming itself, but from the screening of foreign films. Hence, Chinese filmmakers were inevitably influenced by foreign films. Secondly,Laborer's Love was intended for the international market, the film is not only a national film but also an international film, it targeted both Southeast Asian market and English- speaking world.there were a large number of foreign audiences in the concession area, and English subtitles were indented to foreign audiences. As a tool to help the audience understand the film. subtitles can enable foreign audiences and Chinese audiences to obtain the same aesthetic experience and cultural identity when watching movies. For example, at the beginning of the film, it has the subtitles to explain the storyline; Á≤§‰∫∫ÈÉëÊú®Âå†ÔºåÊîπ‰∏öÊ∞¥ÊûúÔºå‰∏éÁ•ùÂåªÂ•≥ÁªìÊé∑ÊûúÁºòÔºå‰πÉÊ±ÇÂ©ö‰∫éÁ•ùÂåªÔºåÁ•ù‰∫ëÔºö‚ÄúËÉΩ‰ΩøÊàëÂåª‰∏öÂÖ¥ÈöÜËÄÖÔºåÂΩì‰ª•Â•≥Â¶ª‰πãÔºåÊú®Âå†ÊûúËÆæÂ¶ôËÆ°ÔºåÂæóÂ¶ÇÁ•ùÊÑøÔºåÊúâÊÉÖ‰∫∫ÈÅÇÊàê‰∫ÜÁú∑Â±û„ÄÇ(A doctor in needy circumstancesÔºå whose daughter is much admired by a fruit shop proprietor Ôºà formerly a carpenter Ôºâ who sticks to the tools of his trade). However, Chinese culture is profound and some vocabulary has multiple meanings. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to find a corresponding vocabulary for translation in English. Therefore, the translator of \\"Laborer's Love\\" used the method of \\"demolition\\" in the face of such vocabulary. For instance, the Chinese subtitles were \\"ËÄÅ‰ºØ‰ºØÔºÅËøôÊòØÊàëÂ≠ùÊï¨‰Ω†ÁöÑ„ÄÇ\\" but in English, it was \\"respected sirÔºå I am not asking you to buy, please accept a humble gift.\\" The point of transmission and the difficulty of translation is the word \\"Â≠ùÊï¨\\". The word \\"Â≠ùÊï¨\\" has two meanings here. One is to show the relationship of honor and the other is to give a gift. Then the English interpretation of the word should be \\"give a present use as a token of respect for one‚Äôs elders or superior\\". Obviously, the translator cannot find a word in English that can contain these two meanings. Therefore, in the English translation, the translator uses \\"respected\\" and \\"humble\\" to show a status of humility and uses \\"not asking you to buy\\" and \\"gift\\" to reflect the meaning of giving gifts. Although the translation here does not reach lexical equivalence and syntactic equivalence, it is very \\"satisfied\\". The two meanings contained in \\"Â≠ùÊï¨\\" itself are vividly displayed. The western audience can basically get the same aesthetic experience as the Chinese audience when watching movies. Due to the large cultural differences between the Western and Eastern (mostly China), the ability of subtitle translators is limited. Many lines of \\"Love of Labor\\" seem ordinary to our own audience, but they all have cultural connotations. In the process of translation, even if a variety of translation methods such as ‚Äúdemolition‚Äù are adopted, the lack of cultural information is inevitable. For example, in the Chinese language it was ‚ÄúÔºàÁóÖ‰∫∫ÔºâÔºö‰∏çÊòØÔºÅÊàëÊúâ‰∏ÄÂè™‰πæÈöÜÁ™ëÁöÑÂè§Áì∂ÔºåËØ∑ÂÖàÁîü‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ÔºàÁ•ùÂåªÔºâÔºöÊàë‰πüÊúâ‰∏ÄÂè™Â∫∑ÁÜôÁ™ëÁöÑÁ¨îÁ≠íÔºåËØ∑‰Ω†‰π∞‰∫ÜÂéªÂêßÔºÅ‚ÄùÔºåbut in English it was \\"(Patient): ‚Ä¶swelling is a nice Chien Loong vase. I will sell it cheap. (Doctor Zhu): I also have an antique ink spill for sale.\\" The importance of the translation here are the words ‰πæÈöÜÔºåÂ∫∑ÁÜôÔºåand Âè§Áì∂. \\"‰πæÈöÜ\\" and \\"Â∫∑ÁÜô\\" are both the emperor from the Qing Dynasty, and the word \\"Âè§Áì∂\\" means the old vase that the emperor own. Facing the liar holding the so-called \\"Antiquity\\" of the Chien Loong period to sell to Doctor Zhu, Doctor Zhu uses the same method of the liar to send him away - point out that he has more valuable antiquity (Kangxi's Â∫∑ÁÜô pen container) than the liar. But unfortunately, in English subtitles, this is not reflected. In English subtitles, the translator translated the \\"‰πæÈöÜÁ™ë\\" into ‚ÄúChien Loong‚Äù, which is very accurate. However, the translation of \\"Â∫∑ÁÜôÁ™ë\\" into \\"antique\\" has weakened the contrast that Chinese characters have between the generation, and weakened the comedy color of wishing Doctor Zhu to treat the liar the same way as the liar did. The word \\"Â∫∑ÁÜô\\" could be translated into \\"Kangxi,\\" but if translated into \\"Chien Loong's grandfather\\", it is more able to show the contrast of the generations. The for Western audiences, even if they don't know who are Chien Loong and Kangxi, they can still understand the meaning of comparing these two emperors. Thereby, the Western audience can reach and understand the extent to which the Chinese audience understood and appreciated the film.  The creativity standard of early Chinese films  In the shooting of \\"Laborer's Love,\\" is still limited to a limited number of scenes, limited space, but it is not simply a form of imitating stage play. Although it has limited scenes and limited space, but it is not simply a form of imitating stage play. Such as the point of view shot of Carpenter Zheng wearing a pair of glasses, the close-up of picking up the clock, and the bitterness of the special effect matte shot that appeared in the upper left corner when he was sitting on the bed and dreaming on the beloved girl; all of these techniques have a lot of the filming component. It can be seen that the early stage of Chinese film has already had a very high standard of creativity. The laborer‚Äôs Love also create a new form of a love connection between female and male which is different from traditional Chinese love stories. Moreover,the \\"friendly\\" play it used does not contain the gender discrimination and misogynistic elements lighten the gender discrimination in the movie. But they still obey the part of Chinese tradition such as asking the agreement of Miss Zhu‚Äôs father.  Production  *Black and White *Silent film *Short film *Genre: Romance film & Comedy film: Slapstick, Romantic comedy, Happy (comic) ending, Modern twist on a traditional custom  Editing  *In terms of technology, the use of various special effects in the film was gradually mature and added narrative and comedy effects to the film. Special effects: Superimposition, undercranking, out-of-focus shots Gags in Laborer's Love makes use of trick photography, such as superimposition, out-of-focus shot, and a fast-motion sequence. There are several undercranking scenes used in the film, which can enhance the rhythm of the film through fast play. In particular, the fast-motion sequence of injured bodies being treated perfunctorily at the doctor's clinic at the end created a humorous effect.

It does not have an official status and delimitation and exists rather as a notion. E≈ürefpa≈üa encompasses up to twenty officially constituted and densely populated quarters (mahalle) in the city's inner parts. It is admitted as a zone (semt) that extends along the two sides of the street of the same name, E≈ürefpa≈üa Street (E≈ürefpa≈üa Caddesi), about five kilometers long, which was opened by the marking mayor of ƒ∞zmir, E≈üref Pasha (administration between 1895-1907) in early 20th century. The street was named after him and the neighborhoods that surround the street are also still referred to by his name. The street departs at a point near the Basmane train station marked by a mosque and further a hospital that carry the same name and were built by the same pasha (E≈üref Pa≈üa Mosque and E≈ürefpa≈üa Hospital) and extends tangentially to the slopes of Kadifekale to reach where Konak proper ends at the outskirts of the plain and the neighboring district of Bornova. As soon as it was opened for residential use, the neighborhood became one of the cores of the Turkish ƒ∞zmir, along with the neighboring Hatay, another zone that unites several quarters and is named after the arterial street (Hatay Caddesi). Over the years, E≈ürefpa≈üa was a zone where successive waves of immigrants, Turks of Bulgaria and Macedonia, Crimean Tatars, Cretan Turks were first settled in ƒ∞zmir, and the trend continues to this day with a notable concentration of immigrants from Eastern Anatolia. The name of the neighborhood became synonymous across Turkey with an original urban culture of bravado as well as a peculiar set of values, a consequence of the hybrid tissues of its population. In that, E≈ürefpa≈üa is, with degrees varying, very similar to ƒ∞stanbul neighborhood of Kasƒ±mpa≈üa. E≈üref Pasha himself (full name Hacƒ± Mehmed E≈üref Pasha) was a late-19th century Ottoman administrator who had risen to the position of deputy governor for Syria and who was known for his piousness and smooth human contacts. After his retirement, he was delegated as chairman for ƒ∞zmir's municipal assembly (mayor in attorney in practical terms) in 1895 prior to the elections the year after. The governor Kƒ±brƒ±slƒ± Mehmed Kamil Pasha having put his weight after his name, he became the mayor in 1896 and worked in harmony with the provincial administration for twelve years until he quit in 1907 for reasons of health. He is still associated by many public works, initiatives and projects for the benefit of the city of ƒ∞zmir.

Founded in 1977, the Fabric Workshop and Museum has an Artist-in-Residence Program, an extensive permanent collection of new work created by artists in collaboration with the Workshop, in-house and touring exhibitions, and comprehensive educational programming including lectures, tours, in-school presentations, and student apprenticeships.  Location  :1214 Arch Street :Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA History The Fabric Workshop and Museum was founded in 1977 by Marion Boulton Stroud. Stroud's goal was to create a non-profit workshop that combined team-work and innovation. The Artists in Residency program provided space, tools and assistance for the artists to make functional objects through screen printing on fabric. When FWM saw that artists ideas, especially the installation based, were being stifled in the process of translating their ideas into a functional objects, they dropped that principle and allowed the work to be non-functional as well. The rules bent more and more as years went on, allowing artists to expand on the word \\"fabric\\". The team of FWM staff and artists have now created work using everything from wire mesh, horse hair and fiberglass. They have exhibited outside of their own space, from Eastern State Penitentiary to New York, Venice, London, Dakar and Los Angeles. The FWM strives to push artists in new directions, opening their eyes to see anything they think up can be done. The FWM has said, \\"we can do anything, and we have the talent, knowledge and resources to accomplish what we set out to do.\\"Boulton, Marion. New Material as New Media: The Fabric Workshop and Museum. Philadelphia, The Fabric Workshop and Museum, 2002. In 1996, when the collection of documentation and work created by Artists in Residence grew, it became apparent that this work was historically important and needed to be displayed to the public as well as cared for. The Fabric Workshop became \\"The Fabric Workshop and Museum\\", and now has a permanent collection of over 5,500 objects created by more than 400 artists. Due to the expansion of their neighbor, the Philadelphia Convention Center, the Fabric Workshop and Museum has changed its location three times. Its current location is 1214 Arch Street. Workshop The Fabric Workshop and Museum's Artist in Residency program consists of nationally and internationally known contemporary artists. The artists, who may be emerging or established, experiment and explore varies materials and techniques. The Artistic Director invites artists to participate in the Artist in Residence Program after consulting with the Fabric Workshop and Museum Artist Advisory Committee. The committee meets 1‚Äì2 times a year to select candidates for residency. This program brings together conceptual painters, sculptors, architects, and designers, and also includes installation art, performance and video. FWM supplies all the funding and materials to the artists. Artists work with an FWM staff of printers and technicians. If a project requires additional staff, FWM may hire desired professionals. Artists may also bring their own assistants for their projects. Artists are exposed to new techniques, materials and recourses not accessible to them previously. This creative collaboration opens possibilities for the artist's own work as well as introduces innovations to expand the limits of contemporary art. In the previous location of FWM it was possible to visit the facilities where the artists work. The new location does not continue this tradition, but there is an option to schedule a special tour. Museum The Fabric Workshop and Museums permanent collection contains work by artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Felix Gonzalex-Torres, Ann Hamilton, Reverend Howard Finster, Anish Kapoor, Robert Kushner, Glenn Ligon, Robert Morris, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, and Carrie Mae Weems. The collection includes completed works as well as preliminary sketches and other objects documenting the artists' progress throughout their stay. The Fabric Workshop and Museum has an additional gallery space that exhibits work done by the most recent artist in residence. This space may also be used to display work by artists outside of the residency program, so long as it shares in FWM's passion for new, fresh contemporary work. Education The Fabric Workshop and Museum offers art education to all ages from kindergarten to post-graduates. Even educators can benefit from the services offered by the FWM. Through the apprentice training program and the study tours and various other educational programs offered by the organization, the public is given the opportunity to learn and benefit from the organization. Apprentice Training Program Apprentice training is offered to high school students as well as college students and post- graduates. The high school program allows local students to gain knowledge and career-based training that schools cannot while the students earn minimum wage for their efforts. The College and Post-Graduate Apprentice Training Program accepts both local and international students to participate in the workings of the FWM itself and also to learn the trade of screen-printing itself. Other educational programs *Study Tours cost $3.00 per person and allow admittance into the museum as well as a behind-the-scenes look at the workshop itself. *The Onsite Studio Program is a once weekly program for grade school classes. An employee of the FWM will instruct students in creating a silkscreen fabric. *The Online Curriculum offered by the Fabric Workshop and Museum \\"utilizes the museum's collection as a vehicle for exploring interdisciplinary ideas and concepts. Designed for K-12 use, these lessons offer an array of interdisciplinary suggestions that will enliven and enrich your curriculum.\\" *Evenings for Educators gives the opportunity for teachers to learn silkscreen printing techniques and see the facility as well as \\"explore how contemporary art, and FWM programs in particular, can enliven classroom discussions and activities.\\" *The Family Program allows children and their parents to experience contemporary art and the media itself while they also have the opportunity to tour the exhibits and studios.

History The British Helicopter Advisory Board was formed in January 1969 at the instigation of some leading members of commercial helicopter companies in the UK. They realised that there was no single authoritative voice speaking for the whole helicopter industry similar to organisations which represent other major aviation interests. In November 2008, it changed its name to the British Helicopter Association. There are about 1100 helicopters on the UK civil register. Helicopters have been used more recently in the UK for emergency services. Structure The BHA is a non-profit making organisation whose main objective is to promote the use of helicopters throughout the United Kingdom and to bring to the attention of potential users the advantages of owning or chartering a helicopter. The BHA has a small permanent Secretariat which is based at Fairoaks Airport in north- west Surrey. Past Chairmen have included the 4th Baron Glenarthur, who is now President.

Speakers may vary pronunciation (accent), word choice (lexicon), or morphology and syntax (sometimes called \\"grammar\\"). But while the diversity of variation is great, there seem to be boundaries on variation ‚Äì speakers do not generally make drastic alterations in sentence word order or use novel sounds that are completely foreign to the language being spoken. Linguistic variation does not equate with language ungrammaticality, but speakers are still (often unconsciously) sensitive to what is and is not possible in their native lect. Variationists study how a language changes by observing it. This is accomplished by looking at authentic data. For example, variation is studied by looking at linguistic and social environments, then the data is analyzed as the change occurs. Variation in research programs must be malleable due to the nature of language itself. This is because language is also fluid in transition and does not shift from one state to another instantaneously. Language variation is a core concept in sociolinguistics. Sociolinguists investigate whether this linguistic variation can be attributed to differences in the social characteristics of the speakers using the language, but also investigate whether elements of the surrounding linguistic context promote or inhibit the usage of certain structures. Studies of language variation and its correlation with sociological categories, such as William Labov's 1963 paper \\"The social motivation of a sound change,\\" led to the foundation of sociolinguistics as a subfield of linguistics. Although contemporary sociolinguistics includes other topics, language variation and change remains an important issue at the heart of the field.  Sociolinguistic variables  Studies in the field of sociolinguistics typically take a sample population and interview them, assessing the realisation of certain sociolinguistic variables. Labov specifies the ideal sociolinguistic variable to * be high in frequency, * have a certain immunity from conscious suppression, * be an integral part of larger structures, and * be easily quantified on a linear scale.Labov, William. 1966 [1982]. The Social Stratification of English in New York City. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics. Second edition at . Phonetic variables tend to meet these criteria and are often used, as are morphosyntactic variables, morphophonological variables, and, more rarely, lexical variables. Examples for phonetic variables are: the frequency of the glottal stop, the height or backness of a vowel or the realisation of word-endings. An example of a morphosyntactic variable is the frequency of negative concord (known colloquially as a double negative). Two well-known and frequently studied morphophonological variables are T/D deletion, the optional deletion of the sound /t/ or /d/ at the end of a word, as in \\"I kep' walking\\" (Wolfram 1969;Wolfram, Walt. 1969. A Sociolinguistic Description of Detroit Negro Speech. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics. Labov et al. 1968Labov, William, Cohen, Paul, Robins, Clarence, & Lewis, John. 1968. A Study of the Non-standard English of Negro and Puerto Rican Speakers in New York City. Co-operative Research Report 3288, Vol. 1. Philadelphia: U.S. Regional Survey.); and the ING variable, the optional pronunciation of -ing at the end of a word as -in', as in \\"I kept walkin'\\" (e.g. Fisher 1958; Labov 1966/1982; Trudgill 1974Trudgill, Peter. 1974. The social differentiation of English in Norwich. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.).  Analysis and methodology  Analyzing sociolinguistic variation often involves the use of statistical programs to handle its multi-variable nature. One essential part of the methodology is to count up the number of tokens of a particular variant and compare it to the number of times the variant could have occurred. This is called the \\"Principle of Accountability\\" in Tagliamonte (2012). Comparing the tokens to the total number of words in a corpus or comparing one corpus to another leads to erroneous results.Tagliamonte, Sali A. (2012). Variationist Sociolinguistics: Change, observation, interpretation. UK: Wiley-Blackwell. This count of the possible occurrences can be difficult at times because some variants alternate with zero (such as relative pronouns that, who, and zero).  Association with age  There are several different types of age-based variation one may see within a population. They are: vernacular of a subgroup with membership typically characterized by a specific age range, age-graded variation, and indications of linguistic change in progress. One example of subgroup vernacular is the speech of street youth. Just as street youth dress differently from the \\"norm\\", they also often have their own \\"language\\". The reasons for this are the following: (1) To enhance their own cultural identity (2) To identify with each other, (3) To exclude others, and (4) To invoke feelings of fear or admiration from the outside world. Strictly speaking, this is not truly age-based, since it does not apply to all individuals of that age bracket within the community. Age-graded variation is a stable variation which varies within a population based on age. That is, speakers of a particular age will use a specific linguistic form in successive generations. This is relatively rare. J.K. Chambers cites an example from southern Ontario, Canada where the name of the letter 'Z' varies.Chambers, J.K. (1995). Sociolinguistic Theory, Oxford: Blackwell. Most of the English-speaking world pronounces it 'zed'; however, in the United States, it is pronounced 'zee'. A linguistic survey found that in 1979 two-thirds of the 12-year-olds in Toronto ended the recitation of the alphabet with the letter 'zee' where only 8% of the adults did so. Then in 1991, (when those 12-year-olds were in their mid-20s) a survey showed only 39% of the 20- to 25-year-olds used 'zee'. In fact, the survey showed that only 12% of those over 30 used the form 'zee'. This is hypothesized to be tied to an American children's song frequently used to teach the alphabet. In this song, the rhyme scheme matches the letter Z with V 'vee', prompting the use of the American pronunciation. As the individual grows older, this marked form 'zee' is dropped in favor of the standard form 'zed'. People tend to use linguistic forms that were prevalent when they reached adulthood. So, in the case of linguistic change in progress, one would expect to see variation over a broader range of ages. William Bright provides an example taken from American English, where in certain parts of the country there is an ongoing merger of the vowel sounds in such pairs of words as 'caught' and 'cot'.Bright, William (1997). \\"Social Factors in Language Change.\\" In Coulmas, Florian (ed) The Handbook of Sociolinguistics. Oxford: Blackwell. This merger used to be distinctive of the western United States, but since World War II, it has developed independently in two other regions: western Pennsylvania and southwestward, and the New England coast from Boston north.University of Pennsylvania. circa 2005. Phonological atlas of North America, Map 1. Examining the speech across several generations of a single family, one would find the grandparents' generation would never or rarely merge these two vowel sounds; their children's generation may on occasion, particularly in quick or informal speech; while their grandchildren's generation would merge these two vowels uniformly. This is the basis of the apparent-time hypothesis where age-based variation is taken as an indication of linguistic change in progress.  Association with geography  A commonly studied source of variation is regional dialects (regiolects). Dialectology studies variations in language based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Sociolinguists concerned with grammatical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas are often called dialectologists. In 1968, John J.Gumperz conducted a survey on the inter- influence of geographic and social factors. By the end of the 1960s, it was examined that linguistic and dialect diversity cannot be solely interpreted by geography, which social differences existed in the same geographical area. Thus, social and geographical factors were to be seen as interrelated.  Association with gender  Men and women, on average, tend to use slightly different language styles. These differences tend to be quantitative rather than qualitative. That is, to say that women use a particular speaking style more than men do is akin to saying that men are taller than women (i.e., men are on average taller than women, but some women are taller than some men). The initial identification of a women's register was by Robin Lakoff in 1975, who argued that the style of language served to maintain women's (inferior) role in society (\\"female deficit approach\\"). A later refinement of this argument was that gender differences in language reflected a power difference (\\"dominance theory\\").O‚ÄôBarr, William and Bowman Atkins. (1980) \\"'Women‚Äôs Language' or 'powerless language'?\\" In McConnell-Ginet et al. (eds) Women and languages in Literature and Society. pp. 93-110. New York: Praeger. However, both these perspectives have the language style of men as normative, implying that women's style is inferior. More recently, Deborah Tannen has compared gender differences in language as more similar to 'cultural' differences (\\"cultural difference approach\\"). Comparing conversational goals, she argued that men have a report style, aiming to communicate factual information, whereas women have a rapport style, more concerned with building and maintaining relationships. People tend to accommodate their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person . That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.  Association with race = African American English (AAE)  Communities of African Americans and Whites have been popular groups with particular attention to their linguistic variation. This variation helps inform much about the origins and evolution of other varieties, especially African American English. Understanding the sociohistorical background of the settlement of the southern colonies is a crucial step in understanding the origins of AAE. African American English and Southern White American English both had origins in the British settler dialects introduced into the South within the colonial period (1607 and 1776). With time these two varieties continued to evolve and influences one another. However, research on African American English did not become continuously and overwhelming explored until the 1960s and 1970s with many linguists including Robbins Burling, Ralph Fasold, Joey Dillard, William Labov, Williams Stewart, Geneva Smitherman, and Walt Wolfram to name a few. While African American English is still not considered an official variety by the dominant culture and educational system in the United States, it is a legitimate and verified variety by many scholars. The Ebonics Controversy help to influence the way America thinks about African American English. In December 1996 the Ebonics Controversy erupted from the Oakland School Board's resolution to identify Ebonics as the first language of African American students and take it into account in their Language Arts lessons. There have been many different perspectives to engaging with African American English as a variety. Although there is some evidence that linguistically sensitive approaches are helpful, there are gaps in and questions about these approaches which require new research. However, AAE is a rule-governed, valid language variety that adequately and uniquely expresses the collective experiences of its speakers.  Asian English  Very little attention has been paid to Asian American speech despite the rise in Asian American immigrants to the United States.Wolfram, W., & Schilling-Estes, N. (2005). American English: Dialects and Variation. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Publishers.Fought, Carmen. (2006). Language and Ethnicity. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Even though Asian Americans are perceived as a distinct racial group, their speech has not been categorized as an individualized ethnolect. Asian Americans in particular have been seen as the \\"model minority\\", Revisted in in which they are stereotyped as being comparable to whites in academic achievement and economic success. However, this assumption neglects Asian Americans who are less fortunate and may experience poverty. Furthermore, the term \\"Asian Americans\\" cover a vast diaspora of individuals from various national and ethnic origins (Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, etc.). However, this is a group in which \\"the dominant ideology treats as a single entity\\". The homogenization of Asian Americans is problematic due to their distinct cultural and national backgrounds as well as history of immigration to the U.S. Therefore, research on Asian American speech is often homogenized because of racial homogenization. Research on Asian Americans in particular have noted the variation of Asian American speech. Affluent Vietnamese Americans and middle-class Japanese Americans are shown to align to more standard English varieties, while Laotions and other Southeast Asians have more vernacular speech patterns. Ito (2010) looked at bilingual Hmong Americans in Wisconsin and found that local features like the low-back vowel merger did not seem to play a noticeable role in Hmong English. Despite the variety of ethnic background, Asian American speech shows distinctiveness in perception tests. Michael Newman and Angela Wu found that in perception tests, participants regardless of ethnic background were found to recognize Asian American, indexed by a set of distinctive features. While the amount of sound change studies are dearth, when they are addressed, it is focused mainly on \\"language maintenance issues or code switching\\", and rarely feature linguistic portraits of Asian Americans who have grown up within the diverse atlas of the United States.

It takes place in the Middle East and consists of a wide variety of characters including over 127 women. The film was shot in 1953 and planned to be released in 3D. Because of difficulties with the Motion Picture Production Code, studio head Howard Hughes shelved the film until 1955, when it was converted to the Tushinsky SuperScope process, in 2-D (flat). It is Vincent Price's fourth and final 3-D film. Dale Robertson (as Sinbad) co-stars with Sally Forrest and Price, as well as Lili St. Cyr, a well-known stripteaser of the 1950s. Plot In ancient Baghdad, poet Omar Khayy√°m wanders the streets in search of his friend, Sinbad, the son and namesake of Sinbad the Sailor, and finds him outside the Khalif's palace. Although the Khalif has offered a reward for his capture, the roguish Sinbad ignores Omar's warnings and nonchalantly sneaks into the palace. Spouting Omar's poetry, Sinbad romances Nerissa, one of the Khalif's harem girls, but is exposed by a slave. Both Sinbad and Omar are caught and brought before the Khalif for sentencing. Also on trial are Greek scholar Simon Aristides, and his daughter Kristina, Sinbad's childhood friend, who has been wrongfully accused of stealing. After the Khalif orders that Sinbad and Omar be executed, his advisor, Jiddah, persuades him to meet with Murad, the ambassador to Tamerlane, a Tartar leader whose forces are threatening to invade Baghdad. Murad boldly informs the Khalif that the Tartars will soon be storming the city and demands that he and his men be entertained in the meantime. Anxious to save Kristina, Sinbad reveals to the Khalif that Simon possesses the formula for an explosive called \\"Greek fire\\" and will share it with the Khalif in exchange for Simon's, Kristina's, Omar's and his freedom. The Khalif refuses to release Sinbad and Omar, but while they are incarcerated in the dungeon, Simon and Kristina give the ruler a private demonstration of Greek fire. As protection, Simon has entrusted the formula to Kristina, who can recite the instructions only while hypnotized. In front of the Khalif, Simon hypnotizes Kristina, who then gives her father directions for mixing the various bottled ingredients. Unknown to them, Jiddah is in cahoots with Murad, and both men are eavesdropping on the proceedings. Although Jiddah and Murad can hear Kristina telling her father how much of each item to use, they cannot ascertain the chemicals being poured by Simon. Meanwhile, the Khalif, ecstatic about the explosive, agrees to Simon's demand that Sinbad and Omar be freed in the morning. That night, Kristina confides in Ameer that she wants to marry Sinbad and asks her to tell him about his imminent release. Although jealous, Ameer delivers the message to Sinbad, but when she returns to Kristina's chambers, she finds Kristina gone and Simon murdered. Ameer sees Murad fleeing with Kristina and Simon's chemicals and sends a message via carrier pigeon before being caught by Jiddah. While torturing Ameer to reveal the bird's destination, Jiddah notices that she has a Forty Thieves tattoo on her shoulder. Although the Thieves, a band of raiders once led by Sinbad's father, are now dead, Ameer admits that their heirs have banded together, and Jiddah deduces that the message went to them. At dawn, Sinbad and Omar learn that their execution is to proceed as scheduled, but they escape the dungeon and fight their way to the Khalif's chambers. There, Sinbad offers to retrieve Kristina in exchange for his and Omar's freedom, some gold and a promise that he will be made second in command in Bagdad. The Khalif agrees and Sinbad rides off with Omar, unaware that Jiddah, having heard his exchange with the Khalif, is alerting Murad of his plan. Later, while resting in the desert, Sinbad and Omar are joined by Ameer, who reveals that Murad and his men are traveling in disguise with a caravan of merchants and that the Forty Thieves will attack them at first camp. Omar and Sinbad ride to the camp ahead of the caravan, and Sinbad has Omar bury him in the spot where he thinks Kristina's tent will be placed. Breathing through a reed, Sinbad remains buried in the Tartars' camp, far from Kristina's tent, until Murad unwittingly plucks his reed from the sand. Sinbad is forced to surface but manages to sneak into Kristina's tent and free her. As Sinbad, Omar and Kristina ride off, the Forty Thieves, who are all women, attack the camp and reclaim Simon's bottles. Omar, Sinbad and Kristina then go to the Forty Thieves's cave and, using the cry \\"open sesame,\\" signals a donkey named Sesame to open the \\"door.\\" After arranging with Ghenia, the raiders' leader, Sinbad reunites with Ameer, but when he refuses to have \\"eyes only for her,\\" Ameer rejects him. Just then, Murad's men advance on the cave, and Sinbad quickly hypnotizes Kristina, who has fallen in love with Omar, and concocts some Greek fire using Simon's chemicals. Hurling torches coated with the explosive, the Thieves, Sinbad and Omar cripple Murad and his men. Sinbad then defeats Murad in a sword fight, and victory is declared. Later, Sinbad convinces the women to go with him to Bagdad and make peace with the Khalif. At the palace, the Khalif waits for Sinbad with Jiddah, whose duplicity he has yet to realize, preparing to execute him for failing his mission. When Sinbad appears with Kristina and a bevy of beautiful raiders, however, the Khalif embraces him and orders Jiddah to be de-tongued. At Sinbad's behest, Omar is made the royal poet, the Thieves are pardoned, and Sinbad is installed as second in command. Then as a final request, Sinbad asks Ameer to be his bride.

History The origin of tu·ªìng is still unclear. It is believed that it was imported from China around the 13th century when Vietnam was warring against the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. A famous actor named L√Ω Nguy√™n C√°t (ÊùéÂÖÉÂêâ) was imprisoned by the Vietnamese. The imperial court asked him to spread his knowledge of Chinese theatre to the children of the elite, thus explaining how tu·ªìng had first had its beginnings in Vietnam in the royal court.Theater & Art - Hat boi- 100 Later on, it was adapted to travelling troupes who entertained commoners and peasants. However, the first one to lay the foundation for the art of tu·ªìng in Vietnam is Dao Duy Tu. Under the Nguyen dynasty which he served for, tu·ªìng reached its highest point and was favored by Nguyen kings. Many great playwrights including ƒê√†o T·∫•n were also in this time. Along with H√°t ch√®o, tu·ªìng was one of the highly popular art forms for commoners until 20th century. With the arrival of Cai Luong and modern theatrics, tuong gradually lost its position. Storylines Stories in the opera tend to be ostensibly historical and frequently focus on the rules of social decorum, and can include legends from either the history of China or Vietnam.  Make-up  Tu·ªìng employs the use of stock characters who are recognizable from their make-up and costumes, which are typically very elaborate and extravagant. Usually, a character's personalities can be revealed through three features: the color of the face, the eyebrows, and the beard.

The GCCUIC's office is located at The Interchurch Center in New York City. The Commission's President is Bishop Mary Ann Swenson and the General Secretary is Rev. Dr. Stephen J. Sidorak, Jr.. The Ecumenical Officer of the Council of Bishops is Bishop Sharon Zimmerman Rader and serves as the corporate ecumenical officer of The United Methodist Church, working in collaboration with GCCUIC. This organization is the United Methodist Church's face in the ecumenical community developing relationships with other church bodies and is diligently seeking relationships with other faith bodies such as Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Jewish communities to manifest the unity God has already given and for which Christ prayed (John 17:20-21). It also diligently seeks relationships with other faith bodies, heeding the prophets‚Äô and Jesus‚Äô call to live lives of compassion, peace, justice, and stewardship of our natural world. The GCCUIC‚Äôs leadership role in ecumenism extends to facilitating deeper relationships and understandings within the United Methodist connection and with other churches in the Methodist family. For example, the GCCUIC and United Methodist Communications developed a DVD/CD, Can We Talk? Christian Conversations About Homosexuality, that facilitates the building of understanding among United Methodist Church members who may disagree on the controversial issue of homosexuality. The resource does not advocate a position, but teaches methods of holy conferencing around potentially divisive issues and provides material for church groups to explore their positions within theological and biblical parameters. The Commission‚Äôs relationships with other Methodist bodies are mainly facilitated through its membership in the World Methodist Council and the Pan-Methodist Commission. The GCCUIC has engaged in bilateral dialogues to further United Methodist relationships with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the Episcopal Church, and the Roman Catholic Church. The UMC and ELCA are now in full communion. An agreement of Interim Eucharistic Sharing has also been reached between the UMC and the Episcopal Church. A statement with a study manual, Make Us One With Christ, has been distributed for joint study in local congregations. Dialogues with the Catholic Church included a visit to Vatican City in April 2006, where Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Walter Kasper of the Pontifical Council for the Promoting Christian Unity received an official United Methodist delegation and discussed aspects of dialogue and relationship and the global nature of the two communions. In addition, GCCUIC continues to initiate and pursue dialogues with other faith communities. The United Methodist Church‚Äôs relationships with other church bodies are also strengthened through the GCCUIC‚Äôs membership in the National Council of Churches of Christ in the United States of America (NCCCUSA) and the World Council of Churches (WCC). Recently, NCCCUSA initiatives have included a focus on addressing poverty and church development through the Special Commission for the Just Rebuilding of the Gulf Coast. Plus, the eradication of poverty, malaria, and HIV-AIDS has been a focus of the WCC. Interfaith relations have been addressed by affiliations with the NCCCUSA‚Äôs Interfaith Relations Commission, Religions for Peace, as well as several Muslim and Jewish organizations. The Interfaith Relations Commission has developed print and electronic educational and resource materials to be used by local congregations and regional groups for interfaith encounters. The Commission also prints resources for its congregations, including ‚ÄúBasic Facts About Islam‚Äù, ‚ÄúGuidelines for Interfaith Dialogue‚Äù, a study guide entitled The Holocaust: A Christian Reckoning of the Soul, and Yom HaShoah worship materials. The GCCUIC is committed to ecumenism, interfaith dialogue, and unity within The United Methodist Church. It is unified through the one body and one Spirit to witness to ‚Äúone Lord, one faith, one baptism‚Äù (Ephesians 4:5). Working to discover how divine grace is evident in other faith communities, the Commission helps discern how to be Christian neighbors and witnesses. As a result, the GCCUIC fully commits to representing The United Methodist Church in fulfilling Christ‚Äôs mission.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 4, 2007. In the eighteenth annual Treehouse of Horror episode, Bart harbors Kodos the alien in \\"E.T., Go Home,\\" Homer and Marge are husband and wife assassins who try to take each other out in \\"Mr. & Mrs. Simpson,\\" and Ned Flanders is given God-like powers during his demonstration on the wages of sin in \\"Heck House.\\" It was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by Chuck Sheetz.  Plot  In the opening sequence, Marge talks about Halloween being \\"last week\\" and suddenly various logos for other Fox shows pop up on the screen, including the mini logos for American Idol, Fox Sports, Prison Break, Cops, House, and 24. Marge winds up killing several miniature characters that pop up from the logos (except the Prison Break one, which has the characters running away from the scene) and bakes them into meatloaf, which she serves to her family. When she cuts it, the other characters' body parts are shown to spell out the title, \\"Treehouse of Horror XVIII\\" and the opening credits (Homer eats the piece with the \\"developed by\\" credit, says \\"Mmmmmmm, developed by\\", and drools.) E.T., Go Home In a parody of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Marge tells Bart to get butane from their \\"butane storage shed\\" in the back yard. As he does so, he finds Kodos there. Kodos states his desire is to return home and that he had come to Earth in peace, though he hints that he was really sent there to destroy mankind. Bart, however, is oblivious to this, and decides to help him return home. Lisa arrives and is happy with the alien in their home and decides to help Bart and Kodos obtain a list of devices (including two tickets to see Avenue Q, Uranium, and \\"7 billion body bags\\") that he can use to contact his home planet, though this appears to be part of his diabolical plan. Homer discovers Kodos when the two accidentally share a shower, but he and Marge decide to let the kids help Kodos anyway, after Kodos hints it would be racist to turn him away (He said that they did not want him in the house because he was Jewish). When NASA agents arrive at the Simpsons home, Homer distracts them by dressing as Abraham Lincoln while Bart sneaks Kodos out. However, when Kodos kills several agents along the way, Bart begins to think Kodos's intentions are not as friendly as he was led to believe. Finally, Kodos reveals that the devices he had the Simpsons collect were for a portal- generating device so that others of his planet can come to Earth and wipe out the human race and eat their heads. When the aliens (including Kang) invade, the rest of the Simpson family shows up, along with the military. A brief war is waged, and Earth ultimately overpowers the aliens (the massive heads of Kodos' species make them easy targets for attack helicopters). When Bart is given the option to board a helicopter and shoot Kodos, Bart, seeing Kodos' smile, decides to spare him. However, Homer shoots Kodos several times. In the end, Earth emerges victorious and the world is saved. The Simpsons are invited to see Kodos's dissection, where they reflect that since Kodos was an evil- looking alien who turned out to be bad, it must be good to judge a book by its cover. It is revealed that Kodos is still very much alive, as he points what is happening is actually vivisection, only to be suffocated with a pillow by Homer. Mr. & Mrs. Simpson In a parody of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Homer and Marge are at a marriage counseling session, recounting a brief moment of tension between them. In the flashback, when arriving home, Homer locks himself in the bathroom and communicates on a hidden flat screen television, where it is revealed Homer is an assassin assigned to eliminate news reporter, Kent Brockman, by order of Homer's boss, Mr. Burns. Although the bathroom is locked, Bart somehow got in and is sitting on a Mortar, which was the toilet. Before he leaves, he tells Marge he will be coming home late from \\"Midnight Monkey Madness.\\" Marge also states that she is busy turning over wheelbarrows. When Homer prepares to shoot Brockman at his rooftop party from a faraway platform, a woman with large blonde hair (whom Homer dubs \\"the Mystery Skank\\") stabs Brockman in the chest. After Homer attempts to repeatedly shoot the woman (ending up with several civilian deaths), he manages to shoot the wig off her head, revealing the \\"mystery skank\\" to be Marge. Arriving home, the two avoid each other's eyes, and Marge makes an excuse for the blonde wig. Unfortunately at dinner, Homer (thinking that he is talking in his head) exclaims \\"I'll kill her [Marge] after dessert!\\" which leads the two attempting to kill one another with various weapons such as grenades, rifles, and a minigun, all the while arguing why the other was an assassin, end up destroying most of their house, and killing Grampa Simpson. After killing Chief Wiggum with a crossbow, the two realize they are more attracted with one another when they kill someone together. For this, they soon begin making love over Chief Wiggum's body and, back to where the episode started, they both realized that they did not need any marriage counseling, but to kill people together. In the end, it turns out that the two were called into Principal Skinner's office to discuss Bart's misbehavior on the bus, with Skinner wondering why the two thought they were in a marriage counselor's office. The two promptly shoot Principal Skinner in the head as the scene cuts to black and the segment ends with Skinner's dying words, \\"think of me on pizza Fridays!\\" to which Homer responds \\"No.\\" Heck House Bart (dressed as Frankenstein's monster), Lisa (dressed as a witch), Milhouse (dressed as an astronaut) and Nelson (dressed as a hobo) become frustrated when Agnes Skinner refuses to give them candy on Halloween night and instead spits into Milhouse's plastic pumpkin full of candy. Deciding that pranks are more fun than candy, they begin to focus on the 'trick' part of \\"trick-or-treat,\\" and begin to play tricks on some of the town's population. Soon, however, their pranks shift into vandalism and their victims gather at the Simpson house to complain. Homer tried to calm the crowd by characterizing the pranks as childish mischief until he is himself \\"pranked\\" by the kids on the roof above him, who drop a live pig which lands on his head. Sideshow Mel exclaims that \\"those monsters must be stopped\\", prompting Ned Flanders to offer his help. He decorates the local church to look like a haunted house called Heck House, which lures the children in. It is revealed the haunted house is actually a morality play in disguise (a \\"Hell house\\"). Ned Flanders tries to scare the children into righteousness through the use of crude theatre performed by Principal Skinner, Reverend Lovejoy, and Ned's two kids Rod and Tod. However, the pranksters scoff at his attempt, causing Ned to angrily turn to the heavens and ask for the power to \\"psychologically torture\\" the kids into loving God. Lightning flashes and Ned is transformed into the Devil (reprising his role from \\"Treehouse of Horror IV\\" though lacking goat legs), and then sends the kids to Hell. There he produces an enormous crystal ball which reveals Springfield to be full of sin, specifically the Seven Deadly Sins. The crystal ball shows: *Gluttony: Homer slurps his spaghetti too fast, and ends up being turned into spaghetti himself. *Wrath (called Anger here): Groundskeeper Willie kicks his tractor in frustration and ends up decapitated by it after it transforms into a robot. *Pride: Doctor Hibbert gets crushed by a truck (driven by Hans Moleman) after putting a \\"My Child Is An Honor Student\\" bumper sticker on his car and taking pride in it. *Sloth: Homer is killed again (despite pointing out that he already died from eating the \\"magic spaghetti\\") when he slides through the mesh of a hammock and gets cubed to pieces *Lust, Greed, and Envy: Moe drools over a stripper dancing for him, steals her money, and envies \\"the crotchless\\" after getting kicked in the groin. A wider view of Hell is then shown, with various citizens of Springfield being punished for their sins on Earth, in a reference to the Inferno section of Dante's Divine Comedy. The children are terrified and promise never to sin again and to only \\"pray and fight in wars\\"; they are then sent back to Earth while Ned transforms back to his standard human form. The episode ends with Ned telling the viewers that they will go to Hell for watching Fox, as well as FX, Fox Sports and \\"our newest devil's portal\\", The Wall Street Journal, which he welcomes to the \\"club\\". Production On July 27, 2007, creator Matt Groening and the producers attended a panel which encompassed the topics of both The Simpsons Movie, and the nineteenth season. The panel revealed that Peter Griffin from Family Guy is one of the miniature characters featured in the opening sequence, although he appears as a cameo from the scene. Cultural references The segment \\"E.T., Go Home\\" parodies the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and it puns E.T.'s most famous quote, \\"E.T., phone home!\\", with Bart in the role of Eliott and Kodos as E.T. When Marge calls Bart he is watching Samba with the Stars, a parody of Dancing with the Stars. Lisa says \\"I can't believe that an alien who looked so evil turned out to be bad\\", a reference to Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End. The \\"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson\\" segment is a parody of the 2005 film Mr. and Mrs. Smith. In the final segment, Heck House, Groundskeeper Willie's tractor transforms into a robot and kills him, parodying Transformers. Hell, as depicted in \\"Heck House\\" is inspired by The Garden of Earthly Delights painted by Dutch Renaissance painter Hieronymus Bosch. The frame story of \\"Heck House\\" is inspired by the horrorfim classic Seven Footprints to Satan. Like in the film, has the Heck House the function to teach about morality.Harzheim, Harald: Hexen/ Sieben Schritte zu Satan [H√§xan/ Seven Footprints to Satan]. In: Filmgenres Horrorfilm, Ursula Vossen (Edit.), Stuttgart 2004. Pp. 36-40. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast, the episode averaged 11.7 million viewers and a 5.7 overnight Nielsen rating and a 13 percent audience share, making it the highest rated episode of the season. Combined with a new episode of Family Guy, it tied for first in the 8:00 PM hour with the NFL Pregame show on NBC. Despite this, the Fox Network finished the night fourth overall in ratings. Critical reception Robert Canning of IGN called the opening segment, E.T., Go Home, \\"the weakest segment because it just wasn't really all that funny\\", and thought the end of the segment was the weakest part of the episode, writing \\"watching the military decimate the aliens and then seeing Homer use a pillow to suffocate Kodos at the end was really off-putting. The deaths weren't funny, just uncomfortable.\\" Canning, however, described the final two segments, as well as the opening as being solid segments. He gave the overall episode a rating of 7.4/10.

Early life O'Mahony was born in 1815 in Kilbeheny, County Limerick or Cork or Tipperary, Ireland, into a family of minor Roman Catholic landed gentry. His father and uncle had been members of the United Irishmen and had taken part in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. He was educated at Midleton College by Dr Hamblin.R. V. Comerford, [https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/20751 \\"O'Mahony, John (1815‚Äì1877)\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) online, accessed 22 April 2019, On the death of an elder brother, O'Mahony inherited a property which yielded ¬£300 per annum. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he studied Sanskrit, Hebrew and Irish. He became an accomplished Gaelic scholar, and later taught Greek and Latin, and contributed articles to Irish and French journals. He left Trinity without getting a degree. Irish Politics In 1843, he joined Daniel O'Connell's movement for the Repeal of the Union Act of 1800, but quickly became dissatisfied with the lack of progress and joined Young Irelander movement which Smith O'Brien led and took part in the failed Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. Emigration His participation in the rebellion obligated him to leave Ireland, and he settled for a time in Paris, where he lived in great poverty. In 1854, he joined John Mitchel in New York City, and took part in the Emigrant Aid Association, the Emmet Monument Association, and other Irish organisations. History of Ireland In 1857, he published History of Ireland, by Geoffrey Keating, D. D., translated from the Original Gaelic, and Copiously Annotated (New York, 1857). Dr. Todd, in his preface to the Wars of the Gaedhill with the Gaell, says, \\"His translation of Keating is a great improvement upon the ignorant and dishonest one published by Mr. Dermod O'Connor more than a century ago, but has been taken from a very imperfect text, and has evidently been executed, as he himself confesses, in great haste.\\" O'Mahony's notes are copied from O'Donovan's Four Masters, and it was on this ground that Hodges & Smith procured an injunction against the sale of the book in the United Kingdom. The mental strain to which O'Mahony was subjected in the preparation of this work, which brought him no pecuniary gain, affected his reason, and he was removed by his friends for a short time to a lunatic asylum. Fenian Brotherhood In 1858, O'Mahony organised the Fenian Brotherhood in the U.S.A., closely associated with the Irish Republican Brotherhood in Ireland. The object of the association was to secure the separation of Ireland. The name was probably derived from O'Mahony's Gaelic studies, the Fenians having been a military body in pagan Ireland, celebrated in the songs of Ossian. The early portion of Keating's History is occupied with the exploits of the ancient Fenians. The organisation of the new society was completed at conventions that were held in Chicago in 1864, and in Cincinnati in January 1865. Civil War At the time of the Cincinnati convention, O'Mahony held the rank of colonel of the 69th Regiment of New York State Militia, recruited mainly from the ranks of the Brotherhood, which had also furnished a large proportion of Meagher's Irish Brigade, the Corcoran Legion, and Irish regiments engaged in the US Civil War. The rapid growth in membership of the Fenian Brotherhood rendered it impossible for O'Mahony to retain the colonelcy of the 69th regiment, which he had held for some time, and resigning he gave all his attention to the spread of Fenianism. Fenian growth The close of the civil war in the spring of 1865 gave a great impetus to the Fenians, owing to the number of Irish-American soldiers that were disbanded and anxious to see service elsewhere. Money poured into the Fenian exchequer; probably $500,000 was subscribed between 1860 and 1867. Many differences occurred between O'Mahony and James Stephens and the Central Council relative to the policy to be pursued for the attainment of their object, but O'Mahony remained president of the organisation for several years. He did not take any part personally in the attempted insurrection in Ireland or in the raids on Canada, although his advice counted for much in these enterprises. In New York, O'Mahony and his paper the Irish People was challenged by the IRB exile David Bell and his paper the Irish Republic. Bell, a committed supporter of the Radical Republican agenda of black franchise and Reconstruction, repeatedly criticized O'Mahony's branch of the Fenian Brotherhood, dubbing it the \\"bloated carcass of gaseous Manhattanism.\\" He argued that O'Mahony was indifferent to the need to \\"cleanse\\" the spirits of the Irish in America: \\"Let our people fling off the scales of bigotry and declare that all men are entitled to 'life, liberty, and happiness.'\\" Later years Grave of John O'Mahony in the Fenian Plot, Glasnevin, Dublin He devoted the last years of his life to literary pursuits, but suffered from ill health, and he had a hard struggle to secure the bare means for subsistence. However visionary may have been his objectives, he was honest, and although thousands had passed through his hands, he was often at a loss for a dollar.

A native of Rennes in Brittany, France, Petit was trained as a lawyer at the University of Rennes, but left the profession after three years to enter the Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris to study for the priesthood. In 1836 he decided to move to the United States to become a missionary among the Native Americans. He traveled to New York with a group led by Bishop Simon Brut√©, the first bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Vincennes. Petit was sent to Vincennes, Indiana, where Bishop Brut√© ordained him as a Roman Catholic priest on October 14, 1837. Within a month the bishop sent the newly ordained priest to work among the Potawatomi in northern Indiana. Father Petit was known for his compassion toward his Potawatomi parishioners. He also joined them on their forced march to new reservation lands along the Osage River, at the present-day site of Osawatomie, Kansas, in 1838. The journey covered about over 61 days and became known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death. During his return trip to Indiana in 1839, Father Petit became too ill to continue and died at the Jesuit seminary in St. Louis (present-day Saint Louis University) at the age of 27 years, 10 months. His remains are buried under the Log Chapel at the University of Notre Dame. A Potawatomi Trail of Death marker in honor of Father Petit at St. Philippine Duchesne Park in Linn County, Kansas, was dedicated on September 28, 2003. His experiences and observations of his missionary work among the Potawatomi and their march to Kansas survive in the numerous letters he wrote to family, friends, and colleagues. Early life and education Benjamin Marie Petit, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Chauvin Petit, was born on April 8, 1811, at Rennes, in Brittany, France. Petit graduated from the University of Rennes in 1829, and from its law school in 1832. After practicing law for three years, he left the profession to enter the Seminary of Saint Sulpice in Paris, France, to begin studies for the priesthood. By April 1836 Petit had decided to pursue missionary work in the United States. Bishop Simon Brut√©, the first bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana, who was visiting France around the same time, may have encouraged Petit to become a missionary among the Native Americans in Indiana. Petit sailed for New York City in June 1836 as part of a group traveling with Bishop Brut√©, and arrived on July 21, 1836. Petit was sent to Vincennes, where he received his minor orders on December 16, 1836, and was made a deacon of the Catholic Church on September 23, 1837.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 27-28. Bishop Brut√© ordained Petit as a Roman Catholic priest on October 14, 1837, at Vincennes.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 30. Missionary work=Twin Lakes mission In October 1837 Bishop Brut√© sent the newly ordained priest to the Catholic mission at Twin Lakes, Indiana, as a replacement for Father Louis Deseille, who died on September 26, 1837, while serving as a missionary among the Potawatomi in northern Indiana.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit\\", p. 25. Father Petit arrived at the mission on November 3, 1837.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit\\", p. 33. He became known among the Potawatomi as \\"Chichipe Outipe\\", meaning \\"Little Duck\\".Father Petit also referred to the mission at Twin Lakes as \\"Chichipe Outipe\\". See Dunn, p. 239. Within a few months of his arrival, Father Petit had resigned himself to the Potawatomi's impending removal to reservation lands set aside for them west of the Mississippi River. In July 1838 he reported to Bishop Brut√© that the Potawatomi's efforts to resist removal from Indiana had failed, and declared \\"the land is lost, and without recourse, I believe.\\"McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 81. Father Petit was known for his compassion and enthusiasm toward his Potawatomi parishioners. He sincerely lamented the Potawatomi's removal from Indiana and the closure of the Catholic mission at Twin Lakes. As he explained in a letter dated September 14, 1838, to his family, \\"It is sad, I assure you, for a missionary to see a young and vigorous work expire in his arms.\\"McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 90. He also described his anguish during the mission's final hours: \\"At the moment of my departure I assembled all my children to speak to them for the last time. I wept and my auditors sobbed aloud; it was indeed a heartrending sight, and over our dying mission we prayed for the success of those they would establish in their new hunting grounds.\\" Potawatomi removal from Indiana On August 29, 1838, General John Tipton and a local militia made a surprise visit to the Potawatomi village at Twin Lakes, near Plymouth, Indiana, and in the ensuing days completed preparations for the Potawatomi's forced removal to reservation lands on the banks of the Osage River, at the present-day site of Osawatomie, Kansas. On September 4, General Tipton gave the order to begin the two-month march, which later became known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death.Dunn, p. 244. Father Petit was willing to join his Potawatomi parishioners on their journey, \\"at least until I can place them in the hands of another pastor,\\"McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 83. but Bishop Brut√© initially declined his permission. The Potawatomi began their march to the Kansas territory without Father Petit; however, the bishop soon changed his mind. On September 7, three days after the Potawatomi's departure from Twin Lakes, Father Petit formally accepted General Tipton's invitation to join the caravan.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 95. Father Petit caught up with the caravan at Danville, Illinois, on September 16, 1838, and accompanied the Potawatomi on the remainder of their journey.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 97-98.Robert Gorman, former archivist of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, Unpublished History of the Diocese of Indianapolis, undated. [Original located in the Archives of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis] Father Petit described his arrival at the encampment on Sunday, September 16: \\"I came in sight of my Christians, under a burning noonday sun, amidst clouds of dust, marching in a line, surrounded by soldiers who were hurrying their steps.... Nearly all the children, weakened by the heat, had fallen into a state of complete languor and depression. I baptized several who were newly born - happy Christians, who with their first step passed from earthly exile to the heavenly sojourn.\\"Funk, p. 47. Tipton commented in a letter dated September 18, 1838, that Father Petit \\"has, both by example and precept, produced a very favorable change in the morals and industry of the Indians; that his untiring zeal in the cause of civilization has been, and will continue to be, eventually beneficial to those unfortunate Pottawatomies when they reach their new abode.\\"McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" p. 37. Of the 859 Potawatomi who began the journey, 756 survived, 42 died, and others escaped. The caravan included 286 horses, 26 wagons, and an armed escort of one hundred soldiers. The journey west covered about over 61 days, often under hot, dry, and dusty conditions. During the journey Father Petit conducted mass, blessed the graves of the dead, and baptized the dying children, including newborns. He also ministered to the sick and assisted the attending physicians as an interpreter.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 96-98. Father Petit became severely ill with high fever, and suffered from exhaustion and weakness, as did many of the Potawatomi. They also suffered from eye inflammation due to the sun, dust, and windy conditions on the trail.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\"p. 109. He later reported that the conditions began to improve when the caravan arrived in Missouri, especially after the Potawatomi were allowed to hunt for wild game to supplement their diet.McKee, \\"The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit,\\" p. 104-5. Upon arrival at their reservation lands along the Osage River on November 4, 1838, the Potawatomi were placed under the supervision of the local Indian agent, and Father Petit completed arrangements to transfer his charge to Christian Hoecken, a Jesuit missionary who had worked on the Kickapoo mission. Father Petit, who was severely weakened from the journey, continued to suffer from a serious illness, including fever and exhaustion, and stayed in the area for six weeks to recuperate. On December 23, 1838, Father Petit received a letter from Bishop Brut√© that recalled him to Vincennes.McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" p. 39.Dunn, p. 250. Death Father Petit and Abraham Burnett (Nan-wesh-mah), a Potawatomi friend, began the return to Indiana on January 2, 1839. After 150 miles of travel on horseback, Father Petit became too ill to continue the ride, and took a stage to Jefferson City, Missouri. Still too weak to ride a horse, Father Petit traveled east in an open wagon in the rain and over bad roads to reach the Jesuit seminary, which became Saint Louis University, at St. Louis, Missouri, on January 15, 1839. He arrived exhausted from his strenuous journey and weakened by successive attacks of fever, with many running sores on his body.McKee, The Trail of Death, Letters of Benjamin Marie Petit, p. 111. Father Petit hoped to recover at St. Louis and return to Indiana, but his condition worsened on February 6. He died at the Jesuit seminary at 9th and Washington Streets in St. Louis on February 10, 1839, at the age of 27 years, 10 months. A mass was held for him in the seminary's chapel on February 12. Upon receipt of the news of Father Petit's death, Bishop Brut√© celebrated a solemn requiem in the St. Francis Xavier Cathedral at Vincennes on February 18, 1839, and delivered a touching eulogy on his favorite missionary, who was known as the \\"Seraphic Benjamin Petit\\". Father Petit was initially buried in the old cemetery at 7th Street and St. Charles Avenue in St. Louis. In 1857 Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C. brought Father Petit's remains to St. Mary's Lake in Indiana, where he was reinterred in Father Stephen Badin's log chapel, the site of the present-day University of Notre Dame. and Legacy and honors Father Petit's remains rest in a place of honor under the Log Chapel at the University of Notre Dame.After his body was brought to Indiana in 1857 and buried in the log chapel at St. Mary's Lake, Father Petit's remains, along with those of Father Louis Deseille and Father Francois Cointet, were later moved to the crypt of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at Notre Dame. The remains were exhumed in 1987 and reburied under a replica of Father Badin's chapel, where Badin and others are interred. See Because of his devoted service to the Potawatomi, Father Petit is remembered by the Catholic Church as a martyr of charity. A Potawatomi Trail of Death marker in honor of Father Petit was placed at St. Philippine Duchesne Park, the former site of the Potawatomi's Sugar Creek Mission in Linn County, Kansas. The marker includes boulders from Kansas and Missouri and a Trail of Death route map. The memorial was dedicated on Sunday, September 28, 2003.Greg Branson, \\"Potawatomie Losses Remembered,\\" Osawatomie (KS) Graphic, September 24, 2003, in and Matt Moline, \\"Boulders Mark Trail,\\" The Capitol Journal, October 20, 2003, in Trail of Death Commemorative Caravan, 2003, p. 141. Father Petit's chalice, which accompanied him on the Trail of Death from Twin Lakes to Kansas, was returned to Bishop Brut√© after Father Petit's death. The chalice is displayed at the St. Francis Xavier Cathedral in Vincennes, Indiana.Trail of Death Commemorative Caravan, 2003, pp. 180-81.

Sir Phillip is the first of Australia's only dynasty to hold the same vice-regal office for three consecutive generations. He was the first wholly Australian-trained lawyer to be appointed as Chief Justice of Australia's first Supreme Court. His son Sir Kenneth's accession to the Supreme Court of New South Wales while he was Chief Justice made the only Australian case of a father and son presiding over the same Supreme Court. Early years Street was born in Sydney on 9 August 1863, the second son of John Rendell Street and Susanna Caroline (n√©e Lawson). His father was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly between 1887 and 1891 and his mother was the daughter of William Lawson, one of the three explorers who made the first settler crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813. Street attended Sydney Grammar School and Sydney Law School. He obtained a bachelor's degree in 1883 and was admitted to the New South Wales Bar Association on 25 August 1886. He married Belinda Maud Poolman at St John's Anglican Church in Toorak, Melbourne on 1 February 1888. On 24 July 1906, he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Juridicial career He was appointed a full judge of the Supreme Court on 11 February 1907 following the resignation of Mr Justice W. G. Walker in February of that year. Street principally presided in bankruptcy, divorce and probate cases. He was also deputy president of the now abolished Court of Arbitration which dealt with industrial disputes between employer and employee, as well as setting minimum wage standards in the State. Street also sat in the now abolished Vice- Admiralty Court, first established in New South Wales during the time of Governor Arthur Phillip to deal with maritime disputes. In 1915, one of his sons, Lieutenant Lawrence Whistler Street, for whom Sir Laurence Whistler Street was named, was killed in action in Gallipoli serving the Allied forces in World War I. Lawrence volunteered for national service in August 1914, making him one of the earliest of his generation to do so. P49 In 1918, Street was appointed the Chief Judge in Equity. The appointment of Street as Chief Justice marked a new beginning for the Australian legal system in the appointment of the senior judge of the court and a wholly Australian-trained lawyer as Chief Justice of Australia's first Supreme Court. Street was also appointed a Royal Commissioner on many occasions. The most significant of these were concerning the administration of the Returned Soldiers' Settlement Branch of the Department of Lands in 1921 and the case against the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1918. In the latter commission, IWW was an organisation that promoted the concept of one big union. In Australia, they were active in campaigning against World War I. One campaign led to a police officer being shot and killed for which two members were found guilty and hanged. At the time of the Royal Commission, twelve members were still in jail for offences such as sedition. Street's commission concluded that some men were guilty and some were not. Most were subsequently released. Street's elder son, Kenneth Whistler Street, became a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales while he was himself. According to biographer Percival Serle, this is possibly the first time that a father and son sat have together on the same Supreme Court bench. Street was acting Chief Justice in 1924 as he was the senior judge of the court at that time. He became Chief Justice on 28 January 1925, succeeding Sir William Cullen. Sir Philip occupied that office until his seventieth birthday in 1933. According to the Supreme Court, he resigned his commission although Serle notes that he actually retired. Whatever is correct, he was the second longest serving judge in New South Wales. He was appointed Lieutenant-Governor in 1930, and administered the government in the absence of the Governor from May to October 1934, January to February 1935, and January to August 1936. Further details Street family grave. Street was chairman of Sydney Grammar School from 1912 to 1929. In 1928, Street was made a . He was a member of the Senate of the University of Sydney from 1915 to 1934, and was its deputy Chancellor in 1926. Street was also a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales from 1923 and was its Chairman from 1934 to 1938. He was also a trustee of the Australian Museum. Sir Philip was president of the New South Wales division of the Boy Scouts Association, of the Boys' Brigade, the New South Wales Home for Incurables, the St John Ambulance Association, and of the Institute of Public Administration Australia. He was patron in New South Wales of the Victoria League, English-Speaking Union, Japan-Australia Society and the Royal Zoological Society. He was in 1934 appointed American non-national member of the international commission provided for by the treaty between the United States of America and Greece. He died peacefully on 11 September 1938, and was buried with a state funeral at St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney. Family Members of the Street family have been prominent in law, politics, civil service, and the military, especially in Australia and in the state of New South Wales, since the 19th Century. The Street family is the only dynasty in Australian history with three consecutive vice-regal appointments to their name; men of the 2nd through 4th Australian generations of the family having become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales. The patriarch of the Street family juridical tradition is Sir Thomas Street , who was made Chief Justice for Brecknock, Glamorgan and Radnor in 1677, and Baron of the Exchequer in April 1681. Sir Thomas had his children by Lady Penelope Berkeley, of the Berkeley family.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/street- thomas-1625-96 References Category:Chief Justices of New South Wales Category:Lieutenant-Governors of New South Wales Category:Judges of the Supreme Court of New South Wales Category:Industrial Workers of the World in Australia Category:People educated at Sydney Grammar School Category:1863 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Australian Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Philip ","title":"Philip Whistler Street"},{"id":"10879325","text":"Joseph Kerr (1765‚Äì1837) was a United States senator from Ohio.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Adam√≥w. It lies in northeastern corner of historic Lesser Poland, approximately south- west of ≈Åuk√≥w and north of the regional capital Lublin. In 2005 the village had a population of 2,100. It is divided into two so≈Çectwos: Adam√≥w I and Adam√≥w II.List of so≈Çectwos of Gmina Adam√≥w Formerly, between 1539 and 1870, Adam√≥w had the status of a town. Next to the village flows the Motwica river. Adam√≥w is the seat of a Roman Catholic parish of Holy Cross. History The history of Adam√≥w dates back to the year 1539, when King Sigismund I the Old issued a charter to a town called Jadaromin, whose name was later changed to Adam√≥w. At that time, it belonged to the brothers Adam and Hieronim Rusiecki, who in 1545 founded here a parish church. In 1569, during the Polish Golden Age, Adam√≥w had the population of 415, and by 1576, the population grew to app. 700. Until the Partitions of Poland, Adam√≥w was part of the Land of Stezyca, Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1795‚Äì1807 it was part of the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815‚Äì1915, it belonged to the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Following the January Uprising, Adam√≥w was stripped of town charter (1869). At that time, its population was app. 1,000, with 90 houses. The village remained in private hands, and in 1869, its gmina was moved to nearby Gulow, to return to Adam√≥w in 1880. In early October 1939, during the German Invasion of Poland, the area of Adamow saw fighting between the Polish Army and the Wehrmacht, in the Battle of Kock. In 1943, most of the village burned in a fire. Jewish history Jews lived in Adam√≥w since the 19th century. In the turn of the 20th century they consisted about 30% of the total population and maintained their own synagogue, cemetery, school and branches of different Jewish-political movements. During the holocaust a ghetto was formed, inhabiting the town Jews, with other Jews from nearby villages, along one street in the town. The first execution was held by the Nazi's in November 1940, outside the local cemetery. By 1943, around 1700 Jews lived in the ghetto. They were deported to Treblinka extermination camp in October 1942. The local synagogue was burnt and it is not evident ever since. The Jewish cemetery, though, was renovated in 2001 and can still be visited.

It is a public archive of architectural and archaeological records and holds over 12 million historic photographs, plans, drawings, reports, records and publications covering England's archaeology, architecture, social and local history. It is a dynamic collection, with records being added to this day. The PastScape website allows searching of over 420,000 records (as of 2016). History The roots of the archive go back to 1908 and the foundation of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (RCHME) which was set up to compile and publish an inventory of all ancient and historical monuments up to the year 1700 by county and by parish. Its more immediate forerunner, however, was the National Buildings Record (NBR), an independent body set up in 1940 under the inspiration of Walter Godfrey, its first Director, \\"to meet the dangers of war then threatening many buildings of national importance\\".The National Monuments Record (England) (HMSO 1973). Between the declaration of war in 1939 and the first London air-raids in 1940 many moveable works of art, archives and antiquities were evacuated to the relative safety of the countryside. For example, the contents of the National Gallery were taken to country houses, slate mines and quarries in Wales However, buildings could not be protected in this way, so steps were taken to collect architectural plans, drawings, photographs and other records. The RCHME worked closely with the NBR to carry out the extensive photographic recording of the towns in the eastern and southern counties at risk from enemy action. Although there were other voluntary and academic bodies at the time that collected some architectural records (including the RCHME, the Royal Institute of British Architects and the London Survey Committee), they were apparently deemed to be too small or narrowly focused for the sort of comprehensive venture that seemed necessary in the chaos of wartime Britain. The initial core of the collection was formed by the Conway Library of architectural photographs held by the Courtauld Institute of Art; the negatives of the Victorian photographer Henry Taunt of Oxford; items from the University of London and by quickly setting photographers to work recording buildings in London and other vulnerable areas. Over the next few years the NBR attracted donations from amateur photographers, people who possessed drawings and owners of collections of negatives. By the end of the war the collection had grown to such size and importance that it was continued and was funded by the Treasury. The 1944 and 1947 Town and Country Planning Acts were important for the NBR as they meant that lists of buildings of architectural and historic importance were started, and the NBR had to be informed before an historic building was demolished. The recession of the late 1940s and early 1950s presented a different challenge from bombing, but no less severe. This time the destruction of significant buildings was due to deliberate demolition because the owners (through new inheritance taxation and shortage of building materials) could no longer afford to maintain them. In 1946 the RCHME work was extended to include the recording of 18th and 19th century architecture.'RCHM England Annual Report 1998/9 A history and final report'; RCHME Crown copyright; ISSN 1350-407X In the 1950s the NBR archive acquisitions included the collections of Sydney Pitcher (medieval architecture and vernacular buildings); Helmut Gernsheim (photographs of tombs in St Pauls Cathedral and Westminster Abbey) as well as continued recording of architectural details such as glass, fixtures and fittings, woodwork and sculpture. The 1950s also saw the start of aerial photography to discover and record ancient sites, as more intensive agriculture, forestry and gravel extraction threatened historic remains on \\"marginal land\\".* The NBR was merged with the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (RCHME) in 1963. The name was then changed to the National Monuments Record (NMR) to denote the inclusion of archaeological and photographic records. During the 1960s, the importance of photographic records grew, and the archive acquired the surviving negatives of architectural photographer Harry Bedford Lemere (1864‚Äì1944) of houses, public buildings and interior decoration. (The National Maritime Museum holds another large section of his work.) The demolition of the Euston Arch and City of London Coal Exchange demonstrated the lack of regard there was at the time for (then) unfashionable Victorian architecture and the importance of keeping records of their existence. During the 1970s and 1980s the NMR increased its recording of industrial and commercial building records as well as country houses. The expanding breadth of the archive is shown by the acquisition of Rev Denys Rokeby's collection of railway photographs, and H. E. S. Simmons' negatives of water and wind-mills, and John Maltby's collection of photographs of Odeon cinemas. In 1983 the Ordnance Survey Archaeology Division was transferred to the NBR/RCHME which greatly expanded the records available. These are now digitised and available through the PastScape website. In 1984 the NMR took over the responsibility for the National Library of Aerial Photographs from the Department of the Environment, together with two million RAF and Ordnance Survey oblique and vertical aerial photographs. A further acquisition was the Industrial Monuments Survey, transferred from the Department of the Environment (DoE) in 1981. This was followed by the RCHME taking on responsibility for the Survey of London following the abolition of the Greater London Council. In 1992 the Commission's terms of reference was extended to include responsibility for creating a central national record of historic wrecks and other archaeological sites within the 12-mile coastal limit. The RCHME, including the NMR, merged with English Heritage in April 1999. In April 2012 the NMR was renamed the English Heritage Archive. In 2015 English Heritage was divided into two parts: those departments carrying out statutory and advisory functions became Historic England, and the archive, as part of the new body, was renamed the Historic England Archive. Contents Its collections arose from a number of sources, including the work of national institutions concerned with the buildings and archaeology of England, and from collections acquired from others. The collections are not only used by historians, architects and designers seeking inspiration but also by family history researchers looking for photographs of where their ancestors lived and worked.'English Heritage Archives', Your Family History magazine, Christmas 2010, Wharncliffe Publishing Limited The scope and content of the material is wide-ranging ‚Äì modern and historic photography, including coverage of the whole of England in aerial photographs; information on most known archaeological sites and listed buildings; complete sets of Country Life magazine; Victoria County Histories; the Council of British Archaeology's Industrial Archaeology index; Professor Goodhart-Rendel‚Äôs personal index of late 19th century churches; the typescript report, photographs and drawings of Lt Col G W Meates's Lullingstone Roman villa excavation; and much more. There is also a specialist reference library. Although photographs form the largest proportion of the Historic England Archive's holdings, collections also include plans of historic houses, reports, correspondence and digital files. All of this material is available for public viewing and a substantial number of images from the Historic England Archive are now available online and free to access. Buildings, drawings and surveys The Historic England Archive holds information on over 70,000 individual buildings, as photographs, drawings, notes, reports from the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments for England (RCHME) and from English Heritage fieldwork. In addition, it holds over 56,000 architectural drawings, including plans, elevations, sketches and watercolours from the RCHME and other sources as well as many plans of English Heritage's properties. The original research material (notes, sketches and photographs) for RCHME inventory volumes are also in the archives. There is a selection of brochures advertising the sales of estate and properties across England from the late 19th and 20th centuries. Historic photographs The Historic England Archive contains photographic collections dating from the 1850s. These include country house albums by anonymous amateurs; famous photographers such as Roger Fenton and Bill Brandt; architectural photographers such as Bedford Lemere & Co; commercial photographers like Miller and Harris, John Gay, Helmut Gernsheim and Eric de Mare; and the Thames Valley views of Henry Taunt. The earliest image in the archive taken by a woman (1864) is held amongst those by the many males, and joined in the collection by works of Alice Marcon, Margaret Harker, Eileen 'Dusty' Deste, Margaret Tomlinson, Ethel Booty, Ursula Clark, Marjory L Wight, Katherine J Macfee, Mary Theodora Pollit, and Patricia Payne.Women Photographers in the Historic England Archive There are also more esoteric collections acquired from, or donated by, individuals who were particularly interested in specialist topics such as medieval stained glass, public parks or windmills. = Aerial photographs = The Historic England Archive holds the largest public archive of aerial photographs in England, organised as two distinct collections ‚Äì oblique and vertical ‚Äì each acquired from different sources. More than 680,000 oblique (taken at an angle to the ground) aerial photographs of locations throughout England are available on open access in the Historic England Archive search rooms. The archive also holds more than two million vertical (bird's-eye view) aerial photographs, covering the whole of England, including near-complete coverage taken by the RAF in 1946‚Äì48. These are available via a search request from the Archive Services Team. The 'Britain from Above' project, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, completed digitisation and cataloguing of 95,000 of the Aerofilms aerial image negatives from 1919‚Äì1953 and put them online. =Survey photographs= The photographs taken by the RCHME and English Heritage survey teams, which range from workers' cottages to power stations, are also available.

It stars Francis Lacombrade as Georges, Didier Haudepin as Alexandre and Michel Bouquet as P√®re de Trennes. It was released in English as This Special Friendship. The film was produced by Christine Gouze-R√©nal, whose sister Danielle was the wife of future French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand. The filming location for the movie was the 13th-century Royaumont Abbey, some 50 km north of Paris. The movie is mostly true to the novel, changing only relatively minor plot points such as Alexandre's suicide from poisoning to death by throwing himself from a train. Also, Alexandre in the movie is brown- haired, not blond, which also removes some of the inside jokes between Alexandre and Georges which are present in the book. On the set of the film, Peyrefitte, who was 57-years-old at the time, met the 12-year-old aristocrat Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de Vill√®le who had been cast as a choir boy and was a big fan of the book. Not only did Peyrefitte sign Alain-Philippe's copy of the book but the two also fell in love, pursuing a stormy relationship that Peyrefitte chronicled in some of his later novels such as Notre amour (1967) and L'enfant de c≈ìur (1978). Alain-Philippe Malagnac was later married to the French entertainer Amanda Lear and died in a house fire in 2000 at the age of forty-nine, shortly after Peyrefitte's death. It is unknown whether this was a suicide, even though Peyrefitte in his novels describes a \\"suicide pact\\" between the two, i.e. their intention to commit suicide if the other one dies.

The local militia held the fort for a short period of time until it was ordered to abandon Fort Antes during the Big Runaway by Colonel Samuel Hunter.

They banded together to form the Fair Play Men. Antes, as a Justice of the Peace for what was then Northumberland County, worked closely with the Fair Play Men. He conducted their weddings and his stockade provided some protection against raids conducted by local Native Americans, who began fighting back against the encroachment of the Europeans. Antes built a gristmill along Antes Creek in 1773. It was the most advanced construction of any kind in frontier north- central Pennsylvania. John Henry Antes served as a Justice of the Peace from July 29, 1775 until January 24, 1776 when he was appointed captain of 58 militiamen under Colonel James Potter. After participating in a raid conducted by Colonel William Plunket against settlers from Connecticut in the Wyoming Valley near Wilkes-Barre, Antes returned to his gristmill, home and future fort in mid-1777. He also was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel that same year. Frontier Outpost The Lenape allies of the British began conducting raids on the Pennsylvania frontier soon after the outset of the American Revolution. An attack at the mouth of Pine Creek in December 1777 and another attack further upstream, near modern Lock Haven, prompted action by Pennsylvania's militia to try to protect the frontiersmen on the West Branch Susquehanna River. Colonel Samuel Hunter ordered Colonel Antes to gather a force of men from the West Branch Valley to gather at Antes' property. The men of the militia built a stockade that was at least 12 feet (4 m) high around the Antes home. The stockade enclosed approximately three quarters of an acre (3,000 m¬≤). Colonel Antes was forced to defend an extensive frontier that was under steady attack from Native American and Tory forces that were dispatched to Pennsylvania from Fort Niagara on Lake Ontario in New York. This historical marker for Fort Antes is in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania across the West Branch Susquehanna River from Nippenose Township. Two settlers who were staying near Fort Antes were killed in June 1777. A party of four men and two women had left the safety of the fort and crossed the West Branch of the Susquehanna River to milk some cows that had been left there to pasture. Zephaniah Miller, Abel Cady, and James Armstrong left the riverbank and meadow to gather a cow who had wandered into the surrounding woods. These three men came under attack by a group of warriors who had been hiding in the woods. Sounds of fighting stirred the men at the fort. They crossed the river despite the objections of Colonel Antes who thought that the Native Americans might have set a trap. Upon reaching the other side of the river, the militiamen found Miller dead and Cady and Armstrong mortally wounded. Only Bouser and the women, one of them Cady's wife, survived the attack. This was just one of many attacks in the West Branch Valley that continued to make life more dangerous for the settlers, who were encroaching on tribal land. All of these attacks and the lack of military help from the Pennsylvania government disheartened the settlers along the West Branch of the Susquehanna. News of impending attacks caused much worry among the settlers and the leaders of the militia. This news was provided by a friendly Native American named Job Chilloway at Fort Reed (modern Lock Haven), who had been converted to Christianity by Moravian missionaries. The Wyoming Valley battle and massacre occurred on July 3, 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre). A mass attack there first overwhelmed small settler forts, followed by a massacre of many of the women and children who had taken refuge there. This news caused the local authorities to order the evacuation of the whole West Branch valley. Although Colonel Antes and his men were successful in building Fort Antes, they were forced to abandon their efforts in July 1778 during the Big Runaway. The raiding parties of Indians and Tories were too numerous for the militia and farmers to defend their lives and property. The Big Runaway Robert Covenhoven, who had served under George Washington in the Continental Army, rode west along the ridge of Bald Eagle Mountain to warn settlers and the militia at Fort Antes. Covenhoven followed the ridge for two reasons: first, experience told him that the Native Americans would not be on the level summit of the ridge, thus making him safe from personal attack, and second, he would be able to scout the situation in the valley from atop the ridge. Covenhoven, who was joined by an unnamed employee of Culbertson's Mill in modern Duboistown, was able to see Fort Antes from the ridge. As he slowly approached the stockade, Covenhoven heard the report of a rifle shot and made a run for the fort thinking that he was under fire. This proved to be false - although there were Native Americans in the area and one did fire his weapon, the fire was not aimed at Robert Covenhoven. Instead, a young woman outside the stockade milking a cow was the target, as evidenced by the bullet hole that pierced the folds of her dress. After giving the orders that prompted the Big Runaway, Covenhoven returned to Fort Augusta. Covenhoven is listed as a Fair Play Man and one of the signers of the Tiadaghton Declaration of Independence. Following the war, he continued to serve as a scout on the frontier before retiring to Piatt Township on the north side of the West Branch Susquehanna River. Map of fortifications and streams in north-central Pennsylvania during the Big Runaway. Fort Antes is in western Lycoming County on the south side of the West Branch Susquehanna River. Most settlers had already gathered at Fort Antes, prior to Covenhoven's arrival, but now the fort and the settlers' homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to what is now Muncy, then further south to Fort Augusta at what is now Sunbury. Women and children rode on the rafts, while the men walked on the river bank to protect them and to drive along the livestock they had been able to save. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers reported fleeing at night, with the glow of their burning settlements lighting the sky behind them. Fort Horn and the other Fair Play Men settlements were all destroyed. Only Fort Antes (made of hard-to-burn peeled oak logs) and the fortified Wallis House (made of stone) in Muncy Township survived the flames. The property losses were estimated at ¬£40,000, and there were deaths among the settlers. Colonel Hunter, the commander of Fort Augusta who had ordered the mass evacuation, was criticized roundly. Many at the time felt that military assistance would have allowed the settlers to withstand the attackers. Post war years Colonel Henry Antes was one of the first settlers to return to the West Branch Valley following the Big Runaway. He found that his mill had been destroyed, but that his home within the fort had not. Antes soon built a larger home on Antes Creek and the fort was abandoned. It gradually decayed before being dismantled. The ground was leveled and then farmed, and today there are no remnants of Fort Antes to be seen above the ground. Colonel Antes was elected the sheriff of Northumberland County in 1782, thirteen years before Lycoming County was established. John Henry Antes died on May 18, 1820 when he was 83 years old.

She was known as the 'Angel of the Rockies' and made her mark as Colorado's first black settler and a prosperous entrepreneur. Brown was born in Virginia in 1800. She married another enslaved person when she was eighteen and together they had four children. In 1835, Brown's family was broken apart when they were all sold to different slave owners; Clara was sold to a plantation owner in Kentucky. When Brown was 56 years-of-age, she received her freedom and required by law to leave the state. She worked her way west as a cook and laundress to Denver, Colorado. Brown settled in the mining town now called Central City, Colorado where she worked as a laundress, cook, and midwife. With the money she made, she invested in properties and mines in nearby towns. Known as \\"Aunt Clara\\" for her emotional and financial support, Brown was a founding member of a Sunday school, made her home available for prayer services and generously supported the community. At the end of the Civil War, Brown could freely travel and liquidated all of her investments to travel to Kentucky to find her daughter. Although she was unsuccessful, she paid the way for 16 or more relatives and others who were former slaves to move to Colorado. Finally, in 1882 she reunited with Eliza Jane and Eliza Jane's daughter. In 1885, the last year of her life, Clara Brown was voted into the Society of Colorado Pioneers for her role in Colorado's early history.  Early life  Clara Brown was born into slavery near Independence, Missouri on January 1, 1800.Varnell, 1. At a young age Clara and her mother were sold to Adam Smith, a Virginian tobacco farmer, and worked in the fields. She was then moved with the Smith family to Kentucky.Clara Brown Biography, A&E; Network. Clara married a slave named Richard at 18 years of age. Together they had four children: Richard, Margaret, Paulina Ann, and Eliza Jane. Sadly at 8 years of age Paulina, the twin sister to Eliza Jane drowned. In 1835 their owner, Ambrose Smith, died. To settle the estate Brown's family was brought to a slave auction, sold separately and sent to different, distant locations. A plantation owner from Kentucky, George Brown, sensed her intelligence and strength and placed high bids to attain her.Varnell, 1.  Freedom  A wagon trainDenver, Colorado in 1859.

She left the state upon receiving her freedom according to a Kentucky law.Katz, PT52. Kentucky to Colorado :Brown was hired as a maid and cook by a family heading to the westward departure point of Leavenworth Kansas Territory.Varnell, 1. From there Brown was hired by Colonel Benjamin Wadsworth in April 1859 to work on the wagon train as a cook for 26 men. It was a hot, difficult eight-week journey to Denver, Colorado, made more uncomfortable by the complaints of a southern man about a black woman traveling with them.Varnell, 2. Brown is believed to be Colorado‚Äôs gold rush first African American woman. Denver and Central City : In the Denver area, Brown settled in nearby Auraria where she worked at the City Bakery. She was one of the founding members of the nondenominational Union Sunday school through her affiliation with two Methodist missionary ministers. Following the tide of miners heading into the mountains, Brown set up the first laundry in Gilpin County in Gregory Gulch, now called Central City, Colorado. She also worked as a midwife, cook and nursemaid. Brown's income grew substantially when she expanded her laundry business after taking a partner. She invested her earnings in mine claims and land and within several years had accumulated $10,000 in savingsVarnell, 2. and reportedly owned 16 lots in Denver, 7 houses in Central City, and property and mines in Boulder, Georgetown, and Idaho Springs.Varnell, 3. : Brown gave generously of herself to those in the community. She hosted the first Methodist church services at her house and helped those in need any way she could, whether newly settled Euro-Americans or Native Americans. Lovingly called \\"Aunt Clara,\\" her home was, \\"a hospital, a home, a general refuge for those who were sick or in poverty.\\" She was quoted as saying, \\"I always go where Jesus calls me.\\" The Catholic Church and the first Protestant church in the Rocky Mountains were built partly through Brown's donations toward their construction. : Frank C. Young, who some called the Washington Irving of the RockiesHill, 360. said of Brown: > In our little community everyone knew everyone else, whatever might be the > positive differences in social position.

Attempts to find her family and aid to former slaves : Letters were sent to locate her family with the aid of friends who could write. Brown heard that her husband Richard and daughter Margaret had both died and her son Richard was lost, but she vowed to find her daughter Eliza Jane. At the end of the Civil War, she liquidated her holdings to travel back to Gallatin, Kentucky. She didn't find Eliza Jane, but she helped 16Reiter, 131. (or 26) relatives and others who were former slaves travel to Colorado by train and wagon train and helped them find work once they were settled. Brown also went to Kansas in 1879 to help former slaves \\"build a community and farm the land.\\" At eighty years of age, Brown's funds were depleted through charitable contributions, her efforts to find her family, and having been cheated by real estate agents. : Brown moved to Denver when she could no longer sustain the higher altitude and lived in the home of a friend. After years of writing letters, Brown heard that her daughter lived in Council Bluffs, Iowa and traveled there at 82 years of age to meet her. The Council Bluffs Nonpareil reported on March 4, 1882, that Brown was \\"still strong, vigorous, tall, her hair thickly streaked with gray, her face kind.\\" Brown returned to Denver with her granddaughter after a lengthy visit and was later visited by her daughter, Eliza Jane, until Brown's death. In remembrance of her pioneering role in Colorado history, she was voted into the Society of Colorado Pioneers and interviewed by the Denver Tribune-Republican on June 26, 1885.Varnell, 3-4. Death and memorials :Clara Brown died in Denver on October 23, 1885 and was buried in Denver's Riverside Cemetery. Colorado state dignitaries were in attendance at her funeral, including Denver mayor John Long Routt and governor James Benton Grant.Wishart, 12.

Background to the work Qazwini's Aja'ib al-Makhluqat is criticized for being less than original. Substantial parts of his work are derivative of Yaqut's Mu'jam al-Buldan. Qazwini mentions fifty names as his sources, the most important of whom are old geographers and historians such as al-Istakhri, Ibn Fadlan, al-Mas‚Äòudi, Ibn Hawqal, al-Biruni, Ibn al-Athir, al-Maqdisi, and al-Razi. Notwithstanding the fact that Qazwini's work is a compilation of known and unknown sources, it influenced later works of Islamic cosmology and Islamic geography through its style and language. Qazwini's cosmography is not pure science but it also was intended to entertain its readers by enriching scientific explanations with stories and poetry. Framework A manuscript of the treatise copied in the 14th century. Qazwini's cosmography consists of two parts, the first part is celestial, dealing with the spheres of the heaven with its inhabitants (the angels) and chronology. Astronomical knowledge of that time is compiled together with astrological ideas. The second part discusses the terrestrial: the four elements, the seven climes, seas and rivers, a sort of bestiary on the animal kingdom (including mankind and the jinns), the plants, and minerals. He discusses her man and the faculties of his soul, his character, weaknesses and illnesses. Also, the cosmography of Ahmad al-Tusi (A·∏•mad al-·π¨≈´sƒ´) is very similar and bears the same title; though the latter characterized by the concept of the unity of God and the unity of creation.. Celestial cosmography Qazwini tells that the earth was swinging in all directions, until God created an angel to bear it on his shoulders and steady it with his hands. A green Jacinth slab was placed underneath the angel, the slab borne by a gigantic bull Kuy≈´thƒÅ, which in turn rested on the great swimming fish Baham≈´t. Qazwini's cosmography above have been compared to a similar entry in Yaqut's Mu'jam al-Buldan and Ibn al-Wardƒ´'s Kharƒ´dat al-'AjƒÅ'ib, with small differences noted. Time When discussing time, Qazwini makes parallel comparison of the Islamic, Roman and Iranian calendars. Thus he links the days of the week to the sacred history of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, e.g. the holy days Friday (Islamic day of congregational prayer/salah), Saturday (Jewish sabbath) and Sunday (Christian day of rest) and how they came to be regarded as holy. The days are also linked to lawful and unlawful things and acts. Angelology Israfel. God created many things that are unknown to the people (Quran 16:8), and a fundamental part of this, with central importance, is God's Throne, His footstool are the angels and the jinn (demons, evil/good spirits). The celestial spheres are inhabited by the angels. The angels are good perfect beings without negative feelings or passion, they are obedient and most importantly, they keep the order of the creation and govern everything on earth; the jinn and devils are bad and imperfect creatures who possess passion and wrath and are disobedient. Qazwini's work contains moreover angelology that has roots partly in the Quran and hadith. There are two types of angels in the Quran, the one being the guards of hell (96:18) and angels that nearest to God (4:170, 83:21). Qazwini also mentions the angels who carry the Throne of God (the idea goes back to the Jahiliyya): they are four in number in the form of a man, bull, eagle and lion. On the Day of Resurrection the Throne will be carried by ‚Äúeight‚Äù (Quran 69:17), and this traditionally refers to eight angels. Next to these is the angel ar-Ruh or the Spirit, who is actually first in order and the greatest. His breath quickens the creatures and he knows the order of the spheres, planets, elements, minerals etc. He is the one who decides the movement and stillness of things by the will of God. This angel is followed by Israfil; he transmits the orders of God and blows the horn. He is not mentioned in the Quran but in hadith and linked to the Day of Resurrection. Israfil carries the ‚Äútablet‚Äù (lawh) and the ‚Äúpen‚Äù (qalam). Whether the abovementioned angels or Gabriel, Michael or others all of them have a role in keeping the order of the creation. It is also believed that angels have about seventy wings each. Then God sent angels who inhabited the earth. One sent in exile was young Azazil whom the angels educated. He acquired their knowledge and became like them and even their leader. But he fell into disgrace because he disobeyed God to prostrate himself before Adam as the vicegerent of God on earth. Azazil goes back to Judaism and is mentioned in the Quran (2:32 etc.) as Iblis, the fallen angel. In Volksislam it is believed that Iblis is present in baths, bazaars, crossroads, intoxicating drinks, and is associated with flutes, poetry, tattoos, lies and illnesses. God also persecuted and imprisoned many of the jinn and exiled them. Jin and ghuls are then considered terrestrial beings, occupying and a place between animals and mankind, and discussed in the second part of Al-qazwini's work. Terrestrial cosmography The earth, being part of the lower spheres, brings forth minerals, plants and living creatures such as animals and man. In Qazwini's classification there are seven types of living creatures ‚Äì man, jinn, animals used for riding, animals that graze, beasts, birds and insects ‚Äì and creatures that look strange or are hybrids. Man Man has the highest rank in the order of God's creation (macrocosm): he is its quintessence (microcosm) and can be both the embodiment of the angels and Satan. Man with his rational soul has the capacity to think and talk and the choice to ascend to the highest or lowest stations in life. Man's soul is immortal and he is created for immortality; he changes his place of living from the womb to the earth, and from there to paradise or hellfire (Quran 20:57). Next to man are the jinn who were created from smokeless fire and can be in different forms. It is also believed that the jinn represent the rebellious among men or that angels were created from the light of the fire and the devils or jinn from its smoke. According to a legend the jinn were created before Adam and lived on the land, sea, plains and mountains and that God's mercy for them was boundless. They had a government, prophets, religion and laws but they became disobedient and stubborn and broke the rules of the prophets which culminated in chaos on earth. Solomon became their lord whom they obeyed. Bestiary Anqa God created the birds because He knew that many people would deny the existence of flying creatures, especially the angels. Furthermore, Qazwini adds as proofs that God created birds with three wings, as He did the unicorn, the Indian ass with a horn or the bat without wings; why not angels? Among the birds Qazwini classifies the Anqa or Simurgh (Phoenix) as the most known bird and the kin of birds that lived alone on Mount Qaf. This idea goes as back as to the time of Zoroaster. In more recent traditions the Anqa is a wise bird with experience gained throughout many ages and gives admonitions and moral advice. Long before Adam was created, this bird lived without procreation; he was single and the first and most powerful bird. The ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù of the Simurgh was the time of Solomon in which not only ministers were near his throne but also animals and birds with whom Solomon could speak; the Anqa also talked to him and was the most respected. The second bird that is also recurring in classical Persian literature and mentioned by Qazwini is the Homa (paradise bird). When it lands on someone's head, that person becomes the king of his land. Being also a bird used in Iranian mystical symbolism is the salamander or ‚Äúfire bird‚Äù, which was not seen since the time of Muhammad. Qazwini talks about the hoopoe (hudhud) that has a central role in Iranian mysticism too, only in passing; here it is described as being able to see water from afar but not the mesh that in front of its eyes. So the hoopoe symbolizes fate: when it comes, the eyes of man are blinded, i.e. man is not able to predict his fate. Another exceptional bird in Qazwini's list is the eagle because lions feared it and from his wings fire appears. Birds that were conceived as strange hybrids by Qazwini are the vulture, having the claws of the rooster, or the ostrich with the feet of a camel and the body of a bird; this bird eats stones and flames and can live in fire for ten years. He is also able to digest legs of a horse and birds but not date pits. The ostrich fears his own shadow and always walks against the sun. There are also other rare and strange birds, for example a big bird in Khuzistan that attacks camels and elephants and has eggs similar to crystal; the ‚Äúpurple bird‚Äù, a white bird that sits on a rock in the Chinese Sea and the person that looks at that rock must laugh to death, except that this bird lands on the rock; or a bird in Tabaristan which is seen in spring and carries one hundred sparrows on its tail and eats one each day. Lapidary Some stones are associated to jinn or are a remedy against ailments: the smaragd (zabarjad or zumrud) cures illnesses and repels devils; a stone called talk is used for talismans and magic drinks; the amberstone was first discovered by Satan; Alexander used the faylaq stone to protect his men from devils, or the man√¢tas, according to Aristotle from whose ‚ÄúBook of Stones‚Äù Qazwini often quotes, nullifies the influence of magicians and devils and protects from jinn. One stone (bahtah) is described as being found at the edge of the utmost darkness where the sun has no effect, near the world ocean. Analysis Called the ‚Äúmost precious cosmography of the Islamic culture‚Äù by Carl Brockelmann, Qazwini's cosmography was one of the most read works in the Islamic world since numerous manuscripts and translations from Arabic into Islamic languages have survived. Scholars presented excerpts of it to Western readers. In Qazwini's conception, the Universe is the manifestation of the absolute Truth or God. God's command \\"Be!\\" caused all things in the universe to have a place and a reciprocal relationship between themselves. Man in the Islamic tradition has the task to understand the wisdom of God's creation as much as possible. God is the ultimate goal of that cosmic structure. Traditional Islamic sciences are connected with cosmology that has an essential role within the metaphysical system. Whereas cosmology deals with the spiritual side of the universe, cosmography concerns itself with the physical aspect and its processes. Qazwini states that it is important that man should exert himself to investigate the wondrous and wisely conceived creation of God, to reflect on it in astonishment and understand it as much as is possible to him. In this way, man will gain the delights in both this world and the hereafter. Next to this Qazwini explains important terminology in his book: 1) marvels are a phenomenon that confuses man because he is not able to grasp its cause and effects; 2) creation is everything except God, it is either essential (body, spiritual substance) or accidental (other); 3) the strange is something which is rare and differs from the known and familiar things and causes astonishment; 4) Creation is divided into several things: it has an unknown cause, man cannot grasp it and it is known in its entirety but not in its details (e.g. the celestial spheres). Moreover, Qazwini informs us in the introduction of his book that he left his home and family to study books because he believed that a man's best companion on earth are books. He marvelled at the wondrous and strange things in God's creation and how perfect a creation it is, as stated in the Quran (50:6). In his explanation of created things in the powerful and vast universe (51:47), he describes the orbit of the sun based on statements of scientists but also quotes a tradition in which the angel Gabriel tells Muhammad that the sun moves forward 500 years or farsakhs (1 farsakh = c. 6 km) from the time Muhammad says ‚ÄúNo‚Äù until the time he says ‚ÄúYes‚Äù one after another. In Qazwini's view wondrous things are in the heavens and the earth, as the Quran informs (10:101), and in the seas and at their shores since it was their beginning and end where not clarified; it was part of the unknown world, inhabited with wondrous and strange creatures. Following the Judeo-Islamic tradition, Qazwini confirms that in the beginning God created one substance, then He melted it and from the smoke became the heaven and the sediments were formed to earth; heaven and earth were first together and God divided them (Quran 21:31) and He completed his creation in six days. Altogether God made seven heavens and seven earths (Quran 65:12). Whether known or unknown, every created thing has a sign of divine wisdom within itself and represents the unity of God. Based on Ptolemy's design of the universe, Qazwini talks about 9 spheres in the heaven: the earth, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the Sphere of spheres, which embraces all other spheres and causes day and night; they all have their own orbit. Whereas on the one hand to these and other stars Qazwini refers to the spheres or plants in scientific terms, on the other hand he supports the effects of the Moon, the North Pole and South Pole on man and animal, such as having the power to cure illnesses, with sayings among people. Man's purpose on earth is to achieve perfection and eschew bad habits and acts. The good character outweighs in this life and the next; bad character is a sin that can not be forgiven and through it man descends to the lowest of the low in hell. A man with a good character is thus angel-like and bad character is the feature of the despised Satan. Qazwini's concern here, so to speak, anthropology. Later influence Ahmed Bican reworked Qazwini's cosmology in the year 1453, providing his Turkish readership with a much abridged version (reduced to ca. one fifth of the original) in plain Turkish prose, with some new materials added.Laban Kaptein, Eindtijd en Antichrist, p. 30. Leiden 1997. Bican's rendering was later included by Donado in his Della Letteratura de Turchi, Venice (1688), in a shortlist of Turkish works he felt merited translation into Italian.Laban Kaptein (ed.), Ahmed Bican Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu, D√ºrr-i Mekn√ªn.

In the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, the school is located behind Mercyhurst University on East Grandview Boulevard. It is a member of the International Baccalaureate program. Mercyhurst Preparatory School is accredited by the Middle States Association under the Accreditation for Growth protocol. In 2010 Mercyhurst Prep was reaccredited until November 2017. The U.S. Department of Education awarded MPS the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award in 1993 and again in 1998. History Mercyhurst Seminary/Preparatory School traces its heritage to the foundress of the Sister of Mercy, Catherine McAuley. Catherine was born in 1778 into a financially secure family. Her father James, a devout Catholic, taught the fundamentals of faith by his good example of reaching out to the poor. Catherine‚Äôs comfortable life changed drastically after the death of her parents. She was sent to live with a Protestant family where she experienced poverty firsthand. She was able to retain her Catholic beliefs through her own strong will and the role modeling of her father. Catherine accepted a position to serve as nurse companion to Mrs. Catherine Callaghan. The Callaghans were Quakers and encouraged service to the poor. Catherine was free to practice her faith, thus fertilizing the seeds planted by her father. The Callaghans adopted Catherine as their daughter and eventually converted to Catholicism. Upon their death, she inherited the equivalent of $1,000,000 in today‚Äôs dollars. Catherine continued her service to the needy while studying educational methods. She opened the House of Mercy on Baggot Street in Dublin, Ireland in 1831 with the goals of spiritual advancement, and service to the poor, sick and uneducated. Two hundred girls were enrolled in the school its first year with 12 women living and working in the building. The women began to call each other \\"sister\\" and were encouraged to begin a religious order. Catherine began her novitiate at the age of 52. In 1831, three novices professed their vows, giving birth to the Sisters of Mercy. Within the 10 years of beginning her order and her death, Catherine McAuley established a total of nine convents in Ireland and England. She died in 1841 and was laid to rest in the ground with the poor. Sisters of Mercy came to the United States in 1842 at the request of Bishop Michael O‚ÄôConnor of Pittsburgh. While the sisters were en route from Ireland to the United States, they met Tobias Mullen, a seminarian. This chance meeting affected the education of young women years later. Tobias Mullen was later named Bishop and invited the Sisters of Mercy to the Erie Diocese in 1870 since he saw a need for Catholic education. In 1871, they opened Saint Joseph Academy, a private school for girls in Titusville, Pennsylvania. By the 1920s, the order and the school were growing rapidly, so the sisters set their sights on opening a school in Erie. Bishop John Mark Gannon suggested to Mother M. Borgia Egan, the Superior of the Sisters of Mercy in Titusville, that she raise $150,000 and come to Erie to found a school in 1921. Mother Borgia purchased 75 acres of farmland in remote southeast Erie. Mercyhurst Seminary, an educational institution for college, high school, and grade school women opened in 1926. Hurst is old English for wooded hilltop, and seminary in Latin means a place where seeds are planted to grow. The Seminary was located on the first floor of Egan Hall, giving some 50 students total access to the facility. One lower grade was dropped each year until all students were graduated from eighth grade, leaving the seminary a high school and college institution. When the Seminary was only three years old, the Great Depression hit the country. The school needed a fundraising project. According to Margaret McMahon, a 1933 Mercyhurst Seminary graduate, \\"The nuns produced and directed three musical comedies with college girls taking the main speaking and singing parts and the rest of the girls dancing and singing. The plays were three nights each year at a different theatre. I believe the Erie people were tired of all the sadness and enjoyed the live theatre.\\" Although Mercyhurst Seminary and Mercyhurst College originally shared the same facilities, plans for a separate building were set in motion in 1952. The Sisters, acting on a Middle States Association recommendation, broke ground on East Grandview Boulevard. The new building, now called Mercyhurst Preparatory School, opened its doors in 1963 to 170 women. In 1974 Mercyhurst became coed, providing a private school alternative that had not been previously available to young people in Erie. In 1993 a building expansion program was begun, resulting in the addition of a new wing, including athletic facilities, offices, and a new auditorium. As the building expanded, so did Mercyhurst‚Äôs eye toward innovation with several new programs. The U.S. Department of Education awarded MPS the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award in 1993 and again in 1998.

Family name and origins The Duke of Terceira was the head of the Manoel de Vilhena family. Heads of the Portuguese branch of that family have been ennobled since the marriage of Constance Manoel with King Pedro I of Portugal. Her brother, Henrique Manoel, was brought into her entourage, and he was made Count of Seia, in Portugal, by his brother-in-law, the king. This family is also represented in Spain, where the family head is the Duke of Ar√©valo d'El Rey, Count of Via Manoel, Marquis of Puebla de la Rocamora, etc. The family dates back to the first count of Vila Flor D. Sancho Manoel de Vilhena, descent in male line from Juan Manuel de Villena, the second son of the 3rd Lord of Cheles, knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece and Mayordomo-Mor of the Emperor Charles V, who descended from the Infante Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, the grandson of King Fernando III of Castile.

He was also appointed Viceroy of Brazil. Hero of the Liberal Wars, the 7th Count of Vila-Flor received the highest aristocratic title, duke, as well as the profound honor of being named Marshal of the army, honors he received because of the resistance he led on Terceira against the Miguelist forces. After conquering Porto, he led the liberal forces into Lisbon, on 24 July 1833. He won the Battle of Asseiceira, which put an end to the civil war, and he signed the peace treaty (Concession of Evoramonte) on behalf of King Pedro IV of Portugal. After the war he was four times, briefly, Prime Minister of Portugal, namely: *from April to September, 1836; *In April and May, 1851; and *from March 1859 until his death, on 26 April 1860.

Cosmodome is the home to both Space Camp Canada and the Space Science Center (a museum). Space Camp Canada welcomed its first campers in July 1994 while the Space Science Center opened its doors to the public in December 1994.  The Space Science Center  The Space Science Center is the only museum in Canada dedicated solely to the space sciences and houses one of two lunar rocks on display in Canada. The one featured was retrieved by astronaut James Irwin on the Apollo 15 mission.  Space Camp Canada  Space Camp Canada features 6 space simulators, described below. Each is designed to help the space camp trainee understand the difficulties of working in space.  1/6th Chair  The 1/6th chair simulates lunar gravity by suspending the user in a chair connected to a series of springs on a rail which allows for movement in an allotted area. A trainee's challenge on the 1/6 chair is to pick up objects from the ground while bouncing.  Zero G Wall  The Wall of Weightlessness, also known as the Zero G Wall, uses a counterbalance to suspend the trainee in mid air. By filling the counterbalance with water until its weight is approximately that of the trainee, the trainee is free to move in the 3 translational directions. Missions are usually given to trainees to heighten the experience and generally consist of interacting, in one way or another, with a mock-satellite suspended in proximity to the wall.  Space Station Mobility Trainer (SSMT)  The SSMT was a device conceived with exercise while on-orbit in mind. It consists of a circular jogging pad in which a special chair and harness has been fitted. Once seated, the trainee may run freely forwards and backwards, rotating along the axis of the pad.  Manned Maneuvering Unit  The Manned Maneuvering Unit simulates the NASA vehicle of the same name. By forcing compressed air out of rubber pads, the Space Camp MMU functions as a hovercraft, and is hence able to move with little resistance. A series of motors controlled via user input allow for horizontal translations and rotations, and a large gear and hydraulic pump allow for 360 degree roll and 30 degree pitch respectively.  5 Degrees of Freedom  Multi-Axis Chair  A trainee is strapped to the multi-axis chair which spins on three axes, disorientating its occupant.

Gifted with good technique, throughout his footballing career he played as a midfielder, as either a central or attacking midfielder, for several Italian clubs, and is best known for his four-year spell with Bari. Playing career After spending his youth career with Lucera, Maiellaro was promoted to the first team during the 1980‚Äì81 season and later played for various teams, such as Benevento and Avellino, as well as Palermo and Taranto, before moving to Bari in 1987. He is best known for his four-year stay at Bari, scoring 26 goals (13 in Serie B and 13 in Serie A) with the biancorossi. One of his most memorable strikes was a 50-yard looping shot from inside the centre circle which sneaked in just under the bar, much to the horror of Bologna goalkeeper Gianluigi Valleriani, on 24 March 1991. Maiellaro earned a reputation as an enormously talented playmaker, displaying exceptional ball skills and scoring outstanding goals. He later moved to A.C. Fiorentina, where he was given the number 10 shirt, although he was not able to repeat his early successes, and faced competition from several other players in his role. Afterwards, he played for Varese, Palermo and Cosenza. He also played with UANL Tigres before retiring and dedicating himself to coaching. Coaching career Maiellaro began his coaching career as head coach of his hometown club Lucera, and then for Noicattaro. He trained Barletta, a leading Serie D team with the goal of earning promotion to the professional Serie C2 league, until 9 January 2007, when he was fired.

Hand cannon from the Chinese Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). Black powder (or gun powder) was invented by Chinese during the 9th century; these inventions were later transmitted to the Middle East and Europe. The direct ancestor of the firearm is the fire lance. The prototype of the fire lance was invented in China during the 10th century and is the predecessor of all firearms. China In China, the earliest firearm was the fire lance, a black-powder‚Äìfilled tube attached to the end of a spear and used as a flamethrower (not to be confused with the Byzantine flamethrower); shrapnel was sometimes placed in the barrel so that it would fly out together with the flames. The earliest known depiction of a gunpowder weapon is the illustration of a fire-lance on a mid-10th century silk banner from Dunhuang. The De'an Shoucheng Lu, an account of the siege of De'an in 1132 during the Jin‚ÄìSong Wars, records that Song forces used fire-lances against the Jurchen. The proportion of saltpeter in the propellant was increased to maximize its explosive power. To better withstand that explosive power, the paper and bamboo of which fire-lance barrels were originally made came to be replaced with metal. And to take full advantage of that power, the shrapnel came to be replaced by projectiles whose size and shape filled the barrel more closely. With this, the three basic features of the gun emerged: a barrel made of metal, high-nitrate gunpowder, and a projectile which totally occludes the muzzle so that the powder charge exerts its full potential in propellant effect. The earliest depiction of a gun is a sculpture from a cave in Sichuan dating to the 12th century of a Chinese figure carrying a vase-shaped bombard with flames and a cannonball coming out of it. The oldest surviving firearm is the Heilongjiang hand cannon dated to 1288, which was discovered at a site in modern-day Acheng District where the History of Yuan records that battles were fought at that time; Li Ting, a military commander of Jurchen descent, led footsoldiers armed with guns in battle to suppress the rebellion of the Christian Mongol Prince Nayan. Middle East Guns - 227x227px Firearms appeared in the Middle East between the late 13th century and early 14th century. \\"The Europeans certainly had firearms by the first half of the 14th century. The Arabs obtained firearms in the 14th century too, and the Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got them no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Koreans adopted firearms from the Chinese in the 14th century, but the Japanese did not acquire them until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.\\" Ahmad Y. al-Hassan claims that the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 saw the Mamluks use against the Mongols \\"the first cannon in history\\" with gunpowder formula which are almost identical with the ideal composition for explosive gunpowder.Ahmad Y Hassan, Gunpowder Composition for Rockets and Cannon in Arabic Military Treatises In Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries , History of Science and Technology in Islam.Ahmad Y Hassan, Technology Transfer in the Chemical Industries , History of Science and Technology in Islam. However, Iqtidar Alam Khan argues that it was invading Mongols who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world. and cites Mamluk antagonism towards early riflemen in their infantry as an example of how gunpowder weapons were not always met with open acceptance in the Middle East.. The first references to the use of what may have been arquebuses (t√ºfek) by the Janissary corps of the Ottoman army date them from 1394 to 1465. However it's unclear whether these were arquebuses or small cannons as late as 1444, but the fact that they were listed separate from cannons in mid-15th century inventories suggest they were handheld firearms. The musket first appeared in the Ottoman Empire by 1465. In 1598, Chinese writer Zhao Shizhen described Turkish muskets as being superior to European muskets. The Chinese military book Wu Pei Chih (1621) later described Turkish muskets that used a rack-and-pinion mechanism, which was not known to have been used in European or Chinese firearms at the time.  Southeast Asia  Istinggar, a result of Indo-Portuguese gunmaking traditions. Even though the knowledge of making gunpowder-based weapon in Nusantara archipelago has been known after the failed Mongol invasion of Java (1293), and the predecessor of firearms, the pole gun (bedil tombak), was recorded as being used by Java in 1413,Mayers (1876). \\"Chinese explorations of the Indian Ocean during the fifteenth century\\". The China Review. IV: p. 178. the knowledge of making \\"true\\" firearms came much later, after the middle of 15th century. It was brought by the Islamic nations of West Asia, most probably the Arabs. The precise year of introduction is unknown, but it may be safely concluded to be no earlier than 1460. Before the arrival of the Portuguese in Southeast Asia, the natives already possessed primitive firearms, the Java arquebus. The technology of firearm in Southeast Asia further improved after the Portuguese capture of Malacca (1511).Andaya, L. Y. 1999. Interaction with the outside world and adaptation in Southeast Asian society 1500‚Äì1800. In The Cambridge history of southeast Asia. ed. Nicholas Tarling. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 345‚Äì401. Starting in the 1513, the tradition of German-Bohemian gun making were merged with Turkish gun making traditions.The bewitched gun : the introduction of the firearm in the Far East by the Portuguese, by Rainer Daehnhardt 1994. This resulted in Indo-Portuguese tradition of matchlocks. Indian craftsmen modified the design by introducing a very short, almost pistol-like buttstock held against the cheek, not the shoulder, when aiming. They also reduced the caliber and made the gun lighter and more balanced. The Portuguese, who did a lot of fighting aboard ships and river craft, valued a more compact gun, and thus this type of matchlock guns were very popular. The Malay gunfounders, compared as being in the same level with those of Germany, quickly adapted these new firearms, and thus a new type of arquebus, the istinggar, appeared. Europe One theory of how gunpowder came to Europe is that it made its way along the Silk Road through the Middle East; another is that it was brought to Europe during the Mongol invasion in the first half of the 13th century. English Privy Wardrobe accounts list \\"ribaldis,\\" a type of cannon, in the 1340s, and siege guns were used by the English at the Siege of Calais (1346‚Äì47).David Nicolle, Cr√©cy 1346: Triumph of the longbow, Osprey Publishing; June 25, 2000; . The first mention of firearms in Russia is found in the Sofiiskii vremennik chronicle, where it is stated that during the 1382 defense of Moscow from Tokhtamysh's Golden Horde, Muscovites used firearms called tyufyaki (), which were of Eastern origin; this word derives from Turkic t√ºf√§k \\"gun\\".Firearms in Russia First Gun Volleys Around the late 14th century in Italy, smaller and portable hand-cannons or schioppi were developed, creating in effect the first smoothbore personal firearm. In the late 15th century, the Ottoman Empire used firearms as part of its regular infantry. The earliest surviving firearm in Europe was found in Otep√§√§, Estonia and it dates to at least as early as 1396. Early modern age Page showing a musketeer (Plate 4) from Jacob de Gheyn's Wapenhandelinghe van Roers, Musquetten ende Spiessen (1608) During the early modern age, these hand-held cannons evolved into the match lock, wheel lock, dog lock, and flintlock rifle, respectively, then the breech loader and finally the automatic weapon. As ignition devices, matchlocks, wheellocks, snaplock, flintlocks and percussion caps were used in turn. The paper cartridge was introduced sometime before 1586, and the bayonet came to use in 16th century France. Hand grenades, thrown by grenadiers, appeared around the same time. Early cartridge firearms had to be cocked and caught by the \\"sear\\", which holds the hammer back, before each shot. Pulling the trigger allows the hammer or striker to fly forward, striking the \\"firing pin,\\" which then strikes the \\"primer,\\" igniting an impact-sensitive chemical compound (historically, first fulminate of mercury, then potassium chlorate, now lead styphnate) which shoots a flame through the \\"flash hole\\" into the cartridge's propellant chamber, igniting the propellant. The Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts became important to the history of firearms during the 1850s, when it debuted the Springfield rifle. Springfield rifles were among the very first breech-loading rifles, starting production in 1865. By that time, metallurgy had developed sufficiently so that brass could be worked into fixed ammunition. Previously, each round was custom made as needed: the shooter poured loose powder down the barrel, used leather or cloth for wadding if time allowed, selected a suitable projectile (lead ball, rocks, arrow, or nail), then seated the projectile on top of the powder charge by means of a ramrod. Performance was erratic. Fixed ammunition combined a primer, the pre- measured charge, and the projectile in a water-resistant brass cartridge case. Most importantly, the soft brass expanded under pressure of the gas to seal the rear end of the barrel, which prevented the shooter from being maimed by escaping high-pressure gas when they pulled the trigger. Repeating and automatic firearms A repeating firearm or \\"repeater\\" is a firearm that holds more than one cartridge and can be fired more than once between chargings. One example of a repeater is the American Springfield Model 1892‚Äì99‚Äîalso made at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts‚Äîwhich were used during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Some repeating firearms require manipulation of a bolt (as in bolt action), lever, or slide to eject the fired cartridge case, draw a fresh cartridge from the magazine, and insert it into the firing chamber, and \\"cock\\" (draw to the rear and place under spring tension) the hammer or striker, so that pulling the trigger will fire the weapon. Others use either the firearm's recoil or a small portion of the propellant gas drawn from the barrel, to operate the firearm's mechanism and ready it for the next shot. Such firearms are sometimes called \\"self- loading,\\" but are more commonly known as semi-automatic, if they fire one shot for every pull of the trigger, or automatic or \\"full-auto\\" if they continue to fire until the trigger is released or the magazine is empty. A revolver is a unique type of firearm in which a rotating cylinder holds a number of cartridges; the cylinder \\"revolves\\" to align each \\"chamber\\" or \\"charge hole\\" with the rear of the barrel, hold the cartridge and contain the pressure (up to 65,000 pounds PSI or 450 MPa) produced when the cartridge is fired. Thus the cylinder serves as both magazine and firing chambers. There are also \\"single- shot\\" and multiple barrel firearms, which hold only one cartridge per barrel and must be reloaded manually between shots. The earliest repeating firearms were revolvers (revolving rifles were sometimes called \\"turret guns\\") and were \\"single action\\" in that they could only be fired one way: by manually cocking the mechanism (drawing the hammer to the rear with the thumb) before each shot. This design dates from 1836, with the introduction of the Colt Paterson, or even earlier. Though they are slower to reload and fire than some other types of firearms, single-action revolvers are of a simple, strong design, and are still made, though they are nowadays used more often for hunting than for self-defense. The double-action revolver is a design almost as old as the single action. Some double-action revolvers, called double- action only or D.A.O. revolvers can only be fired using the trigger (e.g., revolvers with bobbed or hidden hammers). Most double-action revolvers can be fired in either of the two ways. One can cock the hammer (the action of which moves levers to rotate the cylinder and align a fresh cartridge with the rear of the barrel), then pull the trigger for each shot (\\"single-action mode\\") or one may simply pull the trigger, through a longer, heavier stroke. This causes levers and springs to both rotate the cylinder and draw the hammer to the rear, then release it, firing the cartridge. Firing a double-action revolver in single-action mode tends to be more accurate, because the trigger pull is much shorter and lighter; usually three or four pounds-force (18‚àí22 newtons) of pull is sufficient, instead of the twelve to twenty pounds (50‚àí90 N) required for double-action mode, so the firearm's aim and mobility is less likely to be disturbed by the force of pulling the trigger. The first successful rapid-fire firearm is the Gatling gun, invented by Richard Jordan Gatling and fielded by the Union forces during the American Civil War in the 1860s. It is operated by a hand crank and rotates multiple barrels. The Gatling gun needs a four-man crew to function, has had many upgrades since its introduction, and has seen use in many conflicts. Self-loaders are firearms that use some of the discharge energy to reload the firearm. These are also called semi or full-automatics. These are typically fed from a tube or detachable magazine, sometimes referred to as a \\"clip\\" (which denotes a magazine reloading device used in certain rifles, or a retainer for flangeless bullets used in certain revolvers). The world's first self-loading firearm is the Maxim gun, developed by British inventor Sir Hiram Maxim in 1884, capable of firing 600 rounds per minute but requires a team of men to maintain and is not portable by one man. The Maxim gun has been used in a vast number of conflicts. The world's first successful self-loading rifle is the Mondrag√≥n rifle, designed by Mexican general Manuel Mondrag√≥n and was the first self- loading firearm able to be operated by a single rifleman, since its debut in 1908 it received few modifications (bipod, 30-round drum magazine) and has been used during the Mexican Revolution (Mexican Army) and World War I (Imperial German Flying Corps). The world's first submachine gun (a fully automatic firearm which fires pistol cartridges) able to be maneuvered by a single soldier is the MP18.1, invented by Theodor Bergmann. It was introduced into service in 1918 by the German Army during World War I as the primary weapon of the Stosstruppen (assault groups specialized in trench combat). Submachine guns came to prominence during World War II, with millions manufactured. During the war, manufacturers moved away from finely crafted but expensive submachine guns such as the Thompson, in favor of cheaper models that were quicker to manufacture, such as the M3. The first successful assault rifle was introduced during World War II by the Germans, known as the StG 44, it was the first-ever firearm which bridges the gap between long range rifles, machine guns, and short range submachine guns. The assault rifle was a more powerful and had longer ranges than the submachine gun, yet can be used comfortably in close, urban environments and on fully automatic from the shoulder unlike heavier machine guns and long semi-auto rifles, thanks to its intermediate round and select-fire option (switch from fully automatic to semi-automatic). After World War II ended, the assault rifle concept was adopted by every world power and is still being used to this day. The battle rifle was a post-World War II development pushed primarily by the United States that desired a select-fire rifle that retained the long range of the M1 Garand (the US service rifle during World War II and the Korean War). Influenced by the US, NATO members adopted battle rifles of their own. In practice, the powerful cartridge of the battle rifle proved to be difficult to control during fully automatic fire and the concept was not further developed. During World War II, the term assault rifle was coined. However, during the Vietnam era, the M16 was developed. The AK-47 or \\"Kalashnikov\\" became the most widely developed rifle for countries on a global scale.

After his discharge from the U.S. Marines in 1957 he entered the Society of Arts and Crafts/Center for Creative Studies, Detroit, Michigan where he studied painting. In 1958-59 he began drawing common objects, including 'Stop' signs. His work first appeared in an Art in America article on the \\"Young Artists Group\\" in Detroit. In 1960 he moved to San Francisco and began work on his first images of postage stamps. In 1961 he moved to Los Angeles and began work on his currency paintings. By 1962 he was getting attention for his ground breaking paintings of common objects. Around the country several other artists were experimenting with this new concept and in 1962 he was invited to show his work at the Pasadena Art Museum. Birth of Pop Art In 1962 Dowd's work was included, along with Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jim Dine, Phillip Hefferton, Joe Goode, Edward Ruscha, and Wayne Thiebaud, in the historically important and ground-breaking New Painting of Common Objects, curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum. This exhibition is historically considered the first \\"Pop Art\\" Exhibition in America. These painters started a movement, in a time of social unrest, which shocked America and the Art world and changed Art forever, \\"Pop Art\\". 1960s The 1960s were a time of social unrest. Hoover's FBI and the government thought anybody who was anti-establishment should be investigated and persecuted despite the right of freedom of expression. Unfortunately for Dowd his fascination with painting currency caught the attention of the Secret Service. Painting currency in those days was considered counterfeiting even if intended as a spoof. Dowd explains what happened in an interview with Lynn Pyne: > \\"One morning in 1963, two agents from the Secret Service knocked on the door > of Dowd's studio. They took him down to the Federal building in downtown LA, > where they sternly read to him a litany of counterfeiting laws. Evidently it > didn't matter that he was a former U.S. Marine. \\"They were attempting to > intimidate me with all these threats\\" he says. \\"It was really a matter of > them attempting to tell me that if I continued to paint money, that I would > be arrested for counterfeiting, that I was breaking the law\\". \\"They did have > some work of mine that they had confiscated as contraband. They told me they > were going to museums and collectors and confiscate all the paintings out of > the collections. \\"My situation as a young artist, struggling at that point, > was that I certainly didn't need any major problems added onto my life at > the moment, in terms of survival and trying to do my work\\". Certainly this hurt his career so he switched back for a while to painting postage stamps but continued to paint currency in private. In November 1963 he began a red and white colored JFK Inauguration Stamp and had just finished it on November 22, 1963 the day JFK was assassinated. Dowd destroyed the painting as he spent the day listening to the events of November 22, 1963. The pencil on paper drawing of the painting dated 11/22/63 survives. On one occasion he found a year's work of paintings of his, which he had in storage for an up- coming exhibition, destroyed and ripped to shreds, so consequently he canceled the exhibition. Sometimes paintings in storage and in his studio would just disappear. He often wondered if the FBI had them in their own collection. Dowd continued to paint and exhibit in L.A. throughout the 1960s. In addition to his currency and stamp paintings Dowd painted 20+ paintings in his Circus series, he painted from photographs (Hefferton Poloroid, 1962), painted candy apples, oreos and chocolate chip cookies, fingerprints, Ohio cookies, appetite eraser, oranges and many, other common objects. He made candy apples in multiples as art, made miniature oreo and chocolate chip cookies with magnets on the back which led to the refrigerator magnet craze. In 1968 Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, as was Robert F. Kennedy. In L.A. several months later, there were Viet Nam protests against the war. In 1969 Charles Manson and the Tate‚ÄìLaBianca murders took place in L.A. and Dowd's artist friend John Altoon died of a sudden heart attack at age 44. In late 1969 Dowd began a new series of paintings Through the Object Barrier and in 1970 he moved to SoHo, New York. 1970s & 1980s In 1970 Dowd worked on his Through the Object Barrier series. In 1971 he was commissioned by Cornell University to execute for campus, Unexpected Universe. In 1972 he had a solo exhibition at the White Museum, Cornell University, New York. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Dowd continued to paint and exhibit in the New York area. He did commission work in New York City, painting Windows with a View on walls in windowless offices. He painted murals in lobbies for large banks and corporations. In 1982 he did the artwork and lay-out for a short-lived national newspaper, Reward News, which offered rewards for information on missing children and adults. Etan Patz and Adam Walsh were featured stories. He also did commissioned portrait paintings. In 1985 Dowd returned to Los Angeles. Personal life In 1962 Dowd married artist and painter Mara Devereux whom he met in artist circles after his move to Los Angeles. After moving Dowd and fellow artist John Altoon opened an art supply store and studio at 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., lA. This became a gathering place for LA artists. In the 1960s Devereux was well known for her 5-sided box paintings which were covered with plexiglass and were used as lazy-susans. Devereux is a well known and established artist in her own right and continues to paint and exhibit in LA. Her work can be seen at Gallery ASTO. She remains active in the LA art community and lives in LA. They had no children together but Devereux has a son from a previous marriage, she has not remarried after Dowd's death. Dowd was also survived by a brother, Michael, of Detroit, Michigan. Final years The late 1980s and early 1990s brought about a re-examination of Pop Art and a renewed interest in Dowd's contributions to Pop Art. In 1989 Dowd was included in LA Pop of the Sixties, a nine-person exhibition curated by Ann Ayres at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. In 1991 the Smithsonian included Dowd's paintings in the traveling exhibition \\"The Realm of the Coin: Money in Contemporary Art\\" curated by Barbara Coller. Dowd's famous 1965 painting \\"Van Gogh Dollar\\" (owned by Joni Gordon of L.A.) was featured. In 1994 the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was going to re-design U.S. currency and produce \\"New Money\\". Dowd's enthusiasm was re-kindled. Now living in Abiquiu, New Mexico he planned to re- visit his work of the 1960s with a new series of paintings, New Money, his vision of what new money could or would like. He started with the $100.00 Bill and with the financial help of a close friend he produced a \\"Limited Edition\\" of 200 lithographs of the $100.00 Bill. While planning out his other painting in the series Dowd became ill. Known only to his closest friends and relatives, Dowd was told by his doctors that he had a tumor in one of his kidneys. He needed an operation to remove his kidneys and he would require dialysis afterwards to prolong his life. A kidney transplant was required if he were to get a new lease on life. Dowd like so many artists did not have health insurance. With his valuable paintings sold long ago, time ran out for him to reap the financial rewards of his new series of paintings. Unable to afford the costs of medical care, and perhaps to proud to ask for financial help that would have prolonged or saved his life, Dowd's condition worsened, and he quietly moved back to Los Angeles. He was quietly admitted to a Hospice Home where he died of complications of end-stage renal failure. Dowd never wavered in his love for his country, his devotion to his Art and his loyalty to his friends and relatives. The ex-Marine turned \\"Pop Artist\\" lived up to the Marine Motto, \\"Semper fidelis\\" which means, \\"Always Faithful\\".

It originally appeared in issue #7 (November 1991) of Clowes' comic book Eightball and was later reprinted in the book collections Orgy Bound and Twentieth Century Eightball. It inspired the 2006 film of the same name. A color version of the comic was included in the published version of Clowes' original screenplay for the film. The comic is a satire of American art schools, presented in the manner of a sensationalistic expos√© and ostensibly based on Clowes' own experiences at the Pratt Institute. (The story is signed \\"By D. Clowes, B.F.A.\\" and a Pratt Institute diploma appears on a wall in one panel.) According to Clowes in a 2006 interview, \\"Art School Confidential\\" was > literally something where I had four pages left (in Eightball 7) and I had > to turn the issue in. I said, \\"Well, I'll do something about art school that > will amuse my 10 friends who went.\\" I really thought nobody else would > comment on it or even notice.

Based on the animated television series The Simpsons, the ride was announced in 2007 as a replacement for Back to the Future: The Ride at both parks. It first opened at Universal Studios Florida on May 15, 2008, and then several days later at Universal Studios Hollywood on May 19, 2008. The producers of The Simpsons contributed to the design of the ride, which uses CGI animation provided by Blur Studio and Reel FX. Film Roman, along with AKOM and Rough Draft Studios, also worked on the ride's 2D animation. At the time of its opening, the ride featured state-of-the-art projection and hydraulic technology. In 2013, the ride became the centerpiece of a themed Simpsons area at both parks, based on the fictional town of Springfield depicted in the animated series. The attraction is more than four minutes long and features two pre-show line queues that guests experience before boarding the ride. Its theme focuses on Krustyland, a theme park built by and named after Krusty the Clown, in which his evil genius sidekick Sideshow Bob attempts to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. Many characters from the animated series make an appearance, all voiced by their original actors. Production=History Planning for The Simpsons Ride started two years prior to its opening. The Simpsons creators James L. Brooks and Matt Groening, as well as executive producer Al Jean, collaborated with the Universal Studios creative team, Universal Creative, to help develop the ride. Music for the ride was composed by Jim Dooley, who worked with composer Hans Zimmer on the feature film The Simpsons Movie. The ride is located at both Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in the former Back to the Future: The Ride buildings at both locations. The Back to the Future opened in Florida in 1991 and closed March 30, 2007, while the Hollywood version opened in 1993 and closed on September 3, 2007. Construction at the Florida location. The construction began at Universal Studios Florida in May 2007, and the original concrete on the ground from Back to the Future: The Ride was dismantled and replaced by a red and blue ground holding trees and benches. The building was given a complete overhaul; the cars were changed and the original Intamin mechanics system was updated by Oceaneering International. The construction began at Universal Studios Hollywood in mid-September 2007, with the disposal of the building's Back to the Future insignia. Outdoor painting on the building began in January 2008. Early rumors allegedly had the ride's theme involving Mr. Burns' Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, with the ride's name being \\"Project FISH\\", after the three-eyed fish Blinky. However, when Harry Shearer refused to participate in the ride, this proposed plot was dropped and opted to set the ride on Krustyland. Ride mechanics The four-minute ride uses 85-foot IMAX Dome screens and Sony Projectors. There are 24 ride cars, each seating eight people, and approximately 2000 people can ride it per hour. The projection system uses four overlapping Sony SXRD 4K resolution projectors on each dome, using custom-made semi-circular fisheye lenses to project undistorted images at a rate of 60 frames per second (in comparison, most feature films project at 24 frames per second). The video is projected onto two dome screens which are made of 416 panels (each 4 feet by two feet) and are approximately 80 feet tall and 85 feet wide. The animation in the ride uses computer generated 3D animation rendered by Blur Studio and Reel FX, rather than the traditional 2-D animation seen on The Simpsons and the queue and pre-show of the ride. The animation reference was provided by Film Roman, the animation studio that animates the series. Each car contains 12 speakers and a Dolby 6.1 surround sound, while the domes contain an additional 90 speakers. The ride vehicles are themed to look like cars from a classic dark ride, and like the previous Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger ride vehicles arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle is mounted on a motion platform atop a scissor lift, which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based ride vehicles, riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. The Simpsons Ride uses new technology that cuts down on its energy consumption. According to Universal Studios, the ride is able to save over 55,000 watts on average and 662,000 watt-hours per day. The ride includes over 2,500 LEDs, the largest number in theme park history, which allows the ride to cut down on lighting energy by almost one quarter when compared to incandescent lighting. Ride experience=Queue Guests walk through a head of Krusty the Clown as they enter the ride's line queue, which leads them into a pavilion under various circus tents themed to carnival stalls. A variety of posters are on display advertising attractions at Krustyland, while television monitors stationed around the queue play video clips from the Krusty the Clown television show along with animated footage from Krustyland. Guests eventually leave the queue and enter \\"Krusty's Carnival Midway\\", the first of two pre-shows. Pre-show 1 Entrance to the Simpsons ride at Universal Studios Hollywood. Themed to a fair's midway, riders are lined up into rows waiting for confirmation from Krusty to proceed. TV screens line the walls to both the left and right, displaying the residents of Springfield running through midway booths at the park. Krusty eventually appears on another screen located directly in front, seemingly to pick the first family to ride the most extreme ride at his park called \\"Thrilltacular: Upsy-Downsy Spins-Aroundsy Teen-Operated Thrillride\\". Sideshow Bob sneakily appears in a Scratchy costume when Krusty isn't looking and steps on Homer Simpson's foot, causing him to yell \\"D'oh!\\", which results in the Simpson family getting picked by Krusty. The Simpsons are then asked to pick another group, and Bart chooses all the guests waiting in the pre-show room. As guests are led into the next waiting room, Sideshow Bob bursts out into an evil laughter. Pre-show 2 The next pre-show is themed to a funhouse room, where Krusty leads the group into a backstage area. Grampa and Maggie Simpson are told not to ride due to safety restrictions that serves a reminder to guests about the ride's height requirements and thrill intensity that can aggravate certain heart conditions. Grampa suddenly falls asleep while Maggie crawls into a nearby nuclear reactor room, causing her to grow larger. Meanwhile on screen, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a ride room where he tells them to enjoy the ride, but Sideshow Bob appears and knocks out Krusty. After telling the Simpson family to enter the ride vehicle, Homer hastily boards followed by the rest of the family. Sideshow Bob then forces everyone to watch a safety video from Itchy and Scratchy, which depicts a recap of safety reminders. Scratchy can be seen trying to follow safety rules, but each attempt is sabotaged by Itchy. Guests are then ushered into the main ride room and board the vehicle. Ride After entering the Krusty-themed ride vehicle, Homer orders everyone to sit down, stating that \\"all seats are the same with the exception of the better ones\\", and threatens to make an annoying noise until everyone has taken a seat. Despite riders' actions, he makes the annoying noise anyway. The Squeaky-Voiced Teen character from The Simpsons then appears on a TV screen in the ride cabin and assures guests that their comfort and safety are in the hands of highly-qualified teens like himself. He tells riders to enjoy themselves but asks to keep the screaming down so he can study for a math test. He can then be seen reading his textbook, which is upside down, while quiet elevator music reminiscent of \\"The Simpsons Theme\\" begins playing in the background. Sideshow Bob (top) prepares to kill the Simpson family (center) in a scene from the ride Approximately a minute later, Sideshow Bob suddenly cuts off the teen's signal and takes control of the screen, telling riders that he is now in control of Krustyland. After threatening guests by saying no area in the park is safe from him, he starts the ride by flipping a switch from \\"thrilling\\" to \\"killing\\", which activates the vehicle causing it to virtually rise out of the room. The ride simulator combines physical movement of the vehicle with on-screen motion. The experience continues with riders ramming into the Simpsons' vehicle, which can be seen taking a plunge. The rider's vehicle plunges soon after, revealing they are on a roller coaster involving a variety of drops and turns. Homer, who wasn't sitting down, gets hit by a wrecking ball controlled by Sideshow Bob before it smashes into the track. With a portion of the track now missing, the vehicles fly into a different part of the coaster's layout before the \\"steel\\" wrecking ball breaks free from its cable and rolls along the track chasing the vehicles. During the pursuit, the wrecking ball eventually runs over Homer. The vehicles are then knocked off the roller coaster by the wrecking ball as it explodes and sends the Simpsons flying. Riders end up on the park's \\"Happy Little Elves in Panda Land\\" attraction with Bart and Lisa, where Bob appears in control of an evil robotic panda that smashes some nearby singing elves out of annoyance. He then forces the ride vehicles in reverse, sending them crashing through the attraction, causing riders to catapult to another attraction called \\"Captain Dinosaur's Pirate Rip-Off\\". Homer and Marge are seen riding a boat, which plunges down a waterfall. As they approach a second waterfall, Sideshow Bob appears in a projection telling Homer to resist temptations inside, parodying the Pirates of the Caribbean and Jurassic Park: The Ride attractions. As riders pass through the waterfall, they get sprayed with water effects. Homer grabs a barrel of beer while Marge attempts to warn Homer that it's a temptation. His actions trigger a trap that destroys their surroundings, transporting them to \\"Krusty's Wet and Smoky Stunt Show\\". The panda robot can be seen still under Bob's control. Homer and Marge escape with Bart, as Lisa appears riding a killer whale. She lassos the vehicle to follow her family. Upon reaching the attraction's exit, it suddenly explodes, sending them racing in circles while dragging Homer and riders behind them. After a series of jumping ramps, the vehicles fly through a tipping metal water tower, where they crash at the edge of the attraction and encounter Bob again, who cuts a large hole into hell with a buzz saw. Maggie, now giant-sized from the effects of the reactor room depicted earlier, reappears and grabs Bob, causing his robotic panda to fall into the hole. She slams him into the vehicle, which almost plummets into the hole before it is saved by Professor Frink flying a hi-tech helicopter. Bob steals Maggie's pacifier and tells her that if she wants it back, she must destroy Springfield. Riders then fly through Springfield attached to the helicopter, with references to the original opening sequence being made along the way. An army converges around Maggie while the Simpsons drive across town in a stolen Krustyland tour tram. The riders then encounter Maggie again, who mistakes their car for a new pacifier, sucking on it repeatedly and separating riders from Frink in the process. Water effects gets riders wet a second time as Maggie spits them out onto power lines, which catapults them into the Simpsons' house by crashing through the front door. Now sitting on their couch, the family is relieved to be back home. Suddenly Kang and Kodos turn the house into Krusty's \\"Death Drop\\" ride. Riders are then dropped with the Simpsons from the sky, encountering various Simpsons characters along the way. Riders crash back at the entrance to Krustyland, where Bob prepares to kill them with a buzz saw. However, the couch the Simpsons are sitting on crushes and presumably kills him. Maggie appears and ends the ride by pushing down a large Krusty head sign directly over the Simpsons. The vehicle calmly lowers back down while mist, fire, and smoke effects spray. Homer enthusiastically yells that he wants to ride again. Krusty then appears on the TV screen in the loading room and remarks, \\"Well, that's our ride. Hey, what does this do?\\" For the Orlando attraction, Krusty is sitting in a control room and pushes an emergency button on a control panel, causing the vehicle to vibrate and ending the ride. In the Hollywood version, Krusty also takes a picture of the guests. After the gullwing doors on the car lift up, guests can exit the ride. Voice cast The ride features more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features the voices of the regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer, however, decided not to participate in the ride supposedly due to scheduling and availability conflicts, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many of them do not appear in the ride at all. In homage to the Back to the Future ride that it has replaced, The Simpsons Ride's queue video features a brief animated cameo from Doc Brown who is voiced by Christopher Lloyd. *Dan Castellaneta - Homer Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Grampa Simpson, Groundskeeper Willie, Squeaky Voiced Teen, Hans Moleman, Barney Gumble, Kodos, Repo man, and Mr. Freidman *Julie Kavner - Marge Simpson, Patty Bouvier and Selma Bouvier *Nancy Cartwright - Bart Simpson, Maggie Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum, and The Happy Little Elves *Yeardley Smith - Lisa Simpson *Hank Azaria - Chief Wiggum, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Moe Szyslak, Professor Frink, Cletus Spuckler, Officer Lou, Comic Book Guy, Snake Jailbird and Pants-Off Johnson *Kelsey Grammer - Sideshow Bob *Pamela Hayden - Milhouse Van Houten *Russi Taylor - Martin Prince *Christopher Lloyd - Doc Brown  Episodes Featured  In the queue video, several clips from episodes of the show are featured.

The stores sell Simpsons-related merchandise. Carts were opened near the stores which sell Squishees, (which are The Simpsons' parody of 7-Eleven's Slurpees.) At Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood, the park converted much of the World Expo and some of the Upper Lot in Universal Studios Hollywood into one based on Springfield. The new area includes some iconic landmarks from The Simpsons such as Krusty Burger, Frying Dutchman, Luigi's Pizza, Lard Lad Donuts, Bumblebee Man's Taco Truck, Moe's Tavern, The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop and a Duff Brewery. The park also added one amusement ride named \\"Kang & Kodos' Twirl 'n' Hurl\\", a Dumbo-esque spinning ride where patrons drive flying saucers around Kodos' head and attack Springfield residents. Reception The Simpsons Ride was well received by fans after it opened. Seth Kubersky of Orlando Weekly described the ride as \\"a more than worthy successor\\" to Back to the Future: The Ride. Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times described the ride as \\"visually stunning\\" and said it \\"truly delivers ‚Äî with loads of in-jokes and satire for serious fanatics and tons of thrills and fun for casual fans.\\" Elise Thompson of the LAist said \\"the ride is a total blast, with plenty of laughs as well as thrills.\\" Jay Cridlin of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that \\"the ride is packed with more original, funny material than you'd expect to see in a sitcom, much less a theme park.\\" However, he admitted that the ride was \\"a little discombobulating\\". The Universal Studios Florida version of the ride hosted its one millionth rider on 14 July 2008, reaching the milestone faster than any other attraction in the resort. The ride was named the best new attraction of 2008 by the website Themeparkinsider.com.

A Paramount Pictures production, the film was directed by Irving Cummings, with Robert Emmett Dolan serving as musical director as he had done for the play. The film satirises the US Democratic Party and political corruption. The film was Bob Hope's first feature film in Technicolor. The title refers to the State of Louisiana offering to drop the deceased leader Huey Long's controversial Share Our Wealth program, and fully support President Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal. In return, FDR promised federal dollars for public works in Louisiana, a deal cynically referred to by many as the second Louisiana Purchase.https://64parishes.org/entry/new-deal- in-louisiana Starring Paramount's house comedian Bob Hope in the role William Gaxton played on stage, the film featured Vera Zorina, Victor Moore and Ir√®ne Bordoni reprising their stage roles. Raoul Pene Du Bois did the production and costume design and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction- Interior Decoration, Color along with Stephen Seymour. The cinematography was by Harry Hallenberger and Ray Rennahan who also received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. Plot The film begins with a Hollywood legal adviser giving dictation to his secretary that the stage show property Louisiana Purchase is unfilmable, unless strong disclaimers are made that it is a total work of fiction. The next scene features a musical number declaring that information. Louisiana State Representative Jim Taylor is told by his fellow partners of the Louisiana Purchase Company who have engaged in misusing Federal government funds for their own avarice that a Republican Federal Senator Oliver P. Loganberry is arriving in the State during Mardi Gras in New Orleans. The Senator will conduct hearings to establish evidence of their corrupt conduct with Taylor's cronies deciding Taylor he will be the fall guy. Taylor has one chance to avoid imprisonment; lure the Republican Senator into a honey trap. Searching for a woman, Taylor's friend Madame Yvonne Bordelaise recommends the visiting European woman Marina Von Minden who is desperately seeking money to obtain a visa for her mother to leave Europe. Marina initially goes along with the scheme and poses for incriminating photo when the Senator is tricked into getting drunk. She has a change of heart and decides to explain the photographs by saying the Senator Loganberry has proposed to her. Taylor has fallen in love with Marina and avoids the Senator making his charges in the Legislature by doing a filibuster for three days, with Taylor explaining that he has the express permission of James Stewart.

The harbour opens to the south to the Arabian Sea. The port is administered by the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT, formerly the Bombay Port Trust (BPT)), an autonomous corporation wholly owned by the Government of India. The port is primarily used for bulk cargo, while most container traffic is directed to Nhava Sheva port across the harbour. History A 1999 stamp dedicated to the 125th anniversary of Mumbai Port Trust The Prince's Dock of Bombay Harbour, c. 1906 Mumbai Harbour has been used by ships and boats for centuries. It was used by the Maratha Navy, as well as the British and Portuguese colonial navies. In 1652, the Surat Council of the East India Company, realising the geographical advantage of the Port, urged its purchase from the Portuguese. Their wish was gratified nine years later when, under the Marriage Treaty between Charles II of Great Britain and the Infant Catherine of Portugal, the ‚ÄòPort and Island of Mumbai‚Äô were transferred to the king of Great Britain The first of the present-day docks of the Mumbai Port were built in the 1870s.

From its establishment, the port has been the gateway to India, and was a primary factor in the emergence of Mumbai as the commercial capital of India. The port and the corporation took their present names in the 1990s. Over the decades, the port underwent tremendous expansion, with the addition of berths and cargo handling capacities. However, Mumbai's expanding growth and population pressure constrained the growth of the port by the 1970s. This led to the establishment of the Nhava Sheva port across Mumbai Harbour in Navi Mumbai on the Konkan mainland.

The 1775 Humiliation Sermon & Other Notable Sermons Bishop Robert Smith was known for his sermons relating to topics surrounding the Colonies and the American Revolution. On February 17, 1775, it is noted in the official sermon brief that Smith \\"Preached Before the Commons House of Assembly, and the Members of the Provincial Congress- at the request of the House, & Members of said Congress on February 17th 1775- Observed as a day of fasting & humiliation, on account of the unhappy differences between Great Britain & her Colonies.\\"Smith, Robert, and C. P. Seabrook Wilkinson. \\"A Declaration of Dependence: Robert Smith's 1775 Humiliation Sermon.\\" The South Carolina Historical Magazine 100, no. 3 (1999): 221-40. The importance of this sermon stems from Smith's vocabulary. Smith did not refer to any \\"colonies\\" or any possible threat of a \\"civil war,\\" but rather referred to the ability of self governing colonies not as a right of man, but as a \\"right of man's duty to God.\\"Ibid.leftRobert Smith's Humiliation Sermon of 1775 in its simplicity, allowed for an audience to be motivated in a religious sense. Smith insinuated that what the colonists were doing was in their divine right. There is no evidence of Smith's St. Philips congregation disapproving of this sermon. In other sermons, Smith was noted to become an apologist for his involvement within African enslavement. He was a wealthy member of the planter elite in South Carolina. Because of his status, this allowed Smith to be equivalate to other distinguished South Carolina families, such as the Draytons', Middletons' or Pickneys'. Bishop Robert Smith's sermon style was to keep his audience eagerly waiting. He would take brief pauses in between paragraphs, building suspense, allowing for the audience to be at the edge of their seats. Smith purposely aimed his sermons at the individual level, that whatever an individual does, God should be at the center of their intentions.Ibid. College of Charleston Bishop Robert Smith, amongst several revolutionary leaders of South Carolina, signed the charter of the College of Charleston in 1785.Easterby, J.H. \\"A History of the College of Charleston, Founded 1770.\\" Charleston, S.C. 1935.

This family was established at the manor of Stevenstone in Devon in the 16th century. In the 17th century they acquired additional estates in Devon including Bicton when Sir Henry Rolle (d.1617) married Anne Denys, a co-heiress of Bicton and Holcombe Burnell. On 8 January 1747/8 Henry Rolle, previously Member of Parliament for Devon and Barnstaple, was made Lord Rolle, Baron of Stevenstone, in the County of Devon. The title became extinct on his early death in 1750. His nephew John Rolle inherited the family estates in 1779 and on 20 June 1796 was made Baron Rolle, of Stevenstone in the County of Devon. The title became extinct on his death in 1842. He bequeathed his estates, then some , to Hon. Mark Trefusis (d.1907), second son of the 19th Baron Clinton, the nephew of his second wife and widow, who was required by the will to adopt the surname and arms of Rolle, which he did by royal licence in 1852. In 1907 he too died without male progeny when, in accordance with the entail created by the will of Lord Rolle, the Rolle estates descended to his nephew Charles Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton (1863‚Äì1957) of Heanton Satchville, Huish. The Trefusis family had in 1791 inherited the great estates of the Rolle family of Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe, a junior branch of the Rolles of Stevenstone.

This phenomenon is seen in some early hominid ancestors such as Paranthropus aethiopicus.  Archaeological Evidence  The evidence for post-canine megadontia comes from measuring post-canine tooth surface area of hominid specimens and comparing these measurements to other hominid species. Australopithecus, dated to have lived 2 to 3 million years ago, is the earliest hominid genus to demonstrate post-canine enlargement, with average post-canine tooth area ranging from approximately 460mm2 and going all the way up to the largest tooth area, 756mm2, which is seen in Paranthropus boisei . After Australopithecus, a trend of steady decline in post-canine size is observed, starting in the genus Homo and culminating with Homo sapiens which has an average post-canine tooth area of only 334mm2. Studies of premolar size in hominid species that predate Australopithecus afarensis show long, uni-cuspid teeth at the P3 location, while species dated after A. afarensis have been shown to have wider, bicuspid teeth at the same location, which is hypothesized to show the beginnings of canine to premolar evolution in hominids. Homo floresiensis, a hominid species from the late Pleistocene found in cave deposits in Liang Bua, Indonesia, shows a smaller molar size that is closer to the hominid lineage. However, the remaining teeth of H. floresiensis show similarities to the bigger tooth sizes of the earlier genera Australopithecus and Homo.  Timeline and Map  A timeline depicting observed evidence of post-canine megadontia The shift towards post-canine megadontia dates back to about 4-5 million years ago with the discovery of Ardipithecus ramidus in the Middle Awash region of Ethiopia. Distinctive features in A. ramidus such as dentition with reduced canines, the skull, hindlimb and forelimb suggest it to be near the split between the chimpanzee and hominin lineages. It was the origin of Australopithecus africanus, found in several regions of South Africa (Taung, Sterkfontein, Makapansgat) 2-3 million years ago that first demonstrated the enlargement of the pre-molars and molars. In terms of morphology, A. africanus shares many similar characteristics with A. afarensis as well as other genera in Paranthropus. The first specimen of Paranthropus aethiopicus was discovered in Lake Turkana, Kenya and its successor, Paranthropus robustus, was found in the northern parts of South Africa (Swartkrans, Kromdraai and Drimolen). Paranthropus boisei, the last species included in the genus Paranthropus, was first found in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania and around Ethiopia and Kenya. P. boisei was known for massive facial and dental bones and structure, primarily larger mandibles, molars, and premolars, which was an adaptation allowing them to consume hard plant foods with the ability of high force chewing. A map depicting the locations of species with post-canine megadontia in Africa The first species in the genus Homo, Homo habilis, has been found in Tanzania and Kenya at sites dating between 2.1 and 1.5 million years ago. Species within the genus Homo showed no difference within molar size up until Homo floresiensis, where smaller molars were beginning to be expressed. Species after H. floresiensis such as H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens began to show instead wider frontal teeth and a decrease in size of the molars compared to earlier species. H. sapiens shows significantly smaller molars, mandible, and a prominence of the chin. Evolutionary Implications Postcanine megadontia is commonly associated with the repeated consumption of tough plant-like material, which can be referred to as \\"low-quality food stuffs\\". The substances were integral to the diet of extinct hominids, and their molars were subject to the constant occlusal attrition from the stress of vigorous mastication. The development and evolution of this trait was characterized by a thick coating of enamel surrounding the molars and premolars, mitigating the detrimental effects of the tough diet. As such, this postcanine dentition is capable of ‚Äúcrushing and grinding‚Äù the tough shoots and leaves common to the diet of an early hominid. Australopithecus Paranthropus, for example, was perhaps the most noteworthy hominid to display this trait, an adaptation perhaps due to its varied and encompassing diet . Note, postcanine megadontia is hypothesized to have no correlation to durophagy, but is rather a crucial development in hominids that allowed for preservation of occlusal quality. Increased postcanine size can be correlated with the evolution of other physiological traits Inverse trends of brain mass and molar size point to diet and food processing as a linking factor; encephalization is a crucial consideration in the development of tool usage and extraoral food processing that was observed in Homo species, but not in Australopithecines. Post canine enlargement has also been significantly positively correlated with basal metabolic rate, independently of body size. Larger primates tend to need larger teeth to process more food to meet the energy requirements of a larger body, but the evolution of postcanine megadontia is more likely due to the quality of the diet. The tough, ‚Äúlow- quality food stuffs\\" consumed by robust Australopithecines, coupled with their lack of food processing technology, lead to an enlargement of the occlusal surface of the molars. A study that analyzed the development of molars in hominids and Miocene apes found that a larger ‚Äúratio of the areas of [molar 1] and [molar 3]‚Äù could correlate to an increase in fruits found in the diet of these species. An increased ratio of the areas of molars was found to have a negative correlation with the amount of ‚Äúleaves, flowers, and shoots‚Äù in the diet, suggesting that species like Ardipithecus, which had a greater ratio of areas of molars, had gradually transitioned to including more fruit in their diet as the size of their molars increased. Many modern primates who lack such dietary features have been shown to occasionally rely on \\"fall-back foods\\" of these sorts, implying robust Australopithecines developed post-canine megadontia as they had to more heavily rely on such foods.  Form and Function = Form  While Post canine megadontia denotes the enlargement of the premolars and molars found in early hominid ancestors, it did not affect the structural organization of the cusps that make up those teeth, and thus, were used similarly to the premolars and molars that modern humans possess today. The premolars and molars of modern hominids and those affected by postcanine megadontia both have two and between four and five cusps respectively.Weiss, M.L., & Mann, A.E (1985), Human Biology and Behaviour: An anthropological perspective (4th ed.), Boston: Little Brown, pp. 132‚Äì135, 198‚Äì199, yers, P.; Espinosa, R.; Parr, C. S.; Jones, T.; Hammond, G. S.; Dewey, T. A. (2013a). \\"The Basic Structure of Cheek Teeth\\". Animal Diversity Web, University of Michigan. Retrieved May 2013. The enlargement of the teeth affected by post-canine megadontia, without a difference in the arrangement or number of cusps that compose them, imparted an increased ability for grinding and crushing matter compared to modern day humans. While the form of the teeth themselves is not affected by post-canine megadontia, the ratio of molar teeth volume to total teeth volume is dramatically larger in specimens with post- canine megadontia compared to their modern human counterparts, an adaptation that shows signs of evolutionary convergence when compared to the form and function of the teeth found in many modern herbivores.Reece, J; Meyers, N; Urry, L; Cain, M; Wasserman, S; Minorsky, P; Jackson, R; Cooke, B. Cambell Biology, 9th Edition. Pearson. p. 472. . Location and form of modern human teeth. Functionality Post-canine megadontia is associated with specific food material properties. This allows for great insight into the diets of early hominins that exhibited the trait. Post-canine megadontia is most commonly linked to diets rich in foods that are ‚Äúsmall, chemically sealed, and resistant to bolus formation.‚Äù Having these larger teeth in comparison to the oral cavity size breaks down food particles more, which will increase the effectiveness of the natural processes of food processing that occur within the mouth. For example, the large transverse dimensions of corpses of Homo floresiensis from the Liang Bua cave on Flores Island in Indonesia suggest that these early hominids had postcanine megadontia and a diet with great masticatory stress. However, as Homo evolved, the amount of masticatory stress involved in eating decreased as ‚Äúbehavioral adaptations for extraoral food processing‚Äù were further developed. Thus, tool making Liang Bua corpses would have a comparatively smaller transverse dimensions of the skull, meaning their ‚Äúmascilatory functional morphology‚Äù deviates greatly from the Pleistocene Homo.' Skull of a Homo floresiensis next to a modern human skull Biomechanics Megadontia works by increasing the ratio of minimum to maximum second moments of area or the efficiency of a shape to resist bending or malformation. This resistance is tied to whichever specific axis about which the bending is being applied. Also called mandible robusticity, this characteristic allows for much stronger mastication of food. However, calculations made using biomechanical models does not necessarily perfectly predict the efficiency of different mandibular compositions in resistance to bending forces. Shearing is also an important factor in mastication effectiveness, and resistance to shear is proportional to the cross sectional area of the teeth. In postcanine Megadontia specimens, the cross sectional area is on average much larger than modern hominids which implies greater shear stress resistance. Genetics Some important genes involved in the development and regulation of tooth formation include BMP4, FGF8, and homeobox genes such as MSX1, PAX9, PITX2, SHOX2, Barx1, and Shh to name a few. Research suggests that homeobox genes are mainly responsible for much of the variance in tooth morphogenesis observed in fossilized hominids. It is theorized that tooth enlargement is due to several different gene mechanisms, none of them fully understood, and that selection acts on molars and pre-molars as a singular unit rather than on individual teeth. There are a few theories concerning the selection mechanisms. One theory is that selection acts on the variation in the molars and pre-molars presented by the homeobox genes in hominid species. Another theory suggests that post-canine megadontia resulted from the spatial reassignment by homeobox genes that increased post-canine tooth size while simultaneously decreasing the size of the canines. For the transition from megadontia to normal-sized post canine teeth and its inverse relationship to brain size, one hypothesis proposes that an inactivation of the MYH16 gene, which resulted in an increase in brain size, decreased temporal muscle mass. The decrease in muscle allowed for the brain to grow, which might have allowed early hominids to develop tools. A second hypothesis suggests that the SRGAP2 gene is responsible instead. The inhibition of this gene allows for an increase in brain development.  Comparative Biology =Compared with Modern Human Dental Morphology Compared to present day humans, early hominids such as Paranthropus aethiopicus and Australopithecus garhi had significantly larger dental morphology in their molars and premolars and smaller incisors. The hominids possessing post-canine megadontia had thick molar enamel, premolars with molarized roots, and lower molars that had additional capsules. Rather than inheriting their early hominid ancestors‚Äô large sized molars, human molars evolved significantly, reducing instead to a size more similar to their front teeth. Contrary to megadont hominins‚Äô dominant second molars, modern humans‚Äô first molar is the largest, and their mandibles can rarely fit a third molar.Emes, Y., Aybar, B., Yalcin, S. (2011). On the Evolution of Human Jaws and Teeth: A Review. Bull Int Assoc Paleodont. 5(1): 37-47. Compared to Primates and Other Species The morphology of teeth among species offers insight into their diet and phylogeny. The constant chewing in primate‚Äôs diets created a selection in primate molar shape, notably possessing cusp tips to ingest seeds. In order to achieve maximum chewing efficiency as the food toughness increases, folivorous primates tend to have larger post-canines than frugivorous primates. In primates, positive allometry exists between the size of post canine teeth in primates and cranial length. This relationship has also been suggested in other groups of mammals, but the differences in postcanine size in primates are less variant compared to other mammals. Other species with herbivorous diets have adaptations in their post canines in order to eat plant material, but the term postcanine megadontia typically refers to the dental adaptation in the hominid group.

It is owned and operated by Three Rivers Park District. It is one of the three ski areas in the Twin Cities metropolitan area; the others are Afton Alps, and Buck Hill. As a popular destination located near the Mall of America, Hyland receives 160,000 visitors per year. While Minnesota's winters are cold, the average snowfall is low for a ski area (less than 60 in.), due to this, there is often use of Artificial snow to help maintain the viability of the slopes. In 2016 the chalet underwent a $13.3 million renovation that more than doubled the size of the previous. The new chalet is 36,000 square-feet and includes a gear shop, rentals, and a restaurant. The chalet is also open to host private events. History In the 1950s, the Hyland Hills Ski Area was known as Mt. Normandale, with an annual attendance of around 48,000 skiers. After a snow-drought of 6 years, the number of skiers dropped significantly. This caused Normandale to purchase a snowmaker and a sitzlift in an attempt to bring more skiers into the area. The owners, Gordy Bowen and Oscar Strand, found that this did little to help their business as the man-made snow settled into a hard mass and they did not have the grooming tools necessary to maintain the artificial snow. Soon after Bowen and Strand's efforts, the Hennepin County Park Reserve District bought the area, and renamed it to Hyland Hills Ski Area. With the addition of sophisticated grooming equipment, a new set of buildings, and proper chairlifts, the Hyland Hills Ski Area regained its former popularity. Ski Clubs Hyland is home to many different ski and snowboard clubs for a variety of ages and skill level. Among these is Three Rivers Racing, an Alpine Skiing club for youth aged 6‚Äì21 that provides premier coaching for aspiring skiers and has trained racers who end up competing in national, World Cup, and Olympic level races. Hyland also hosts both USSA freestyle skiing and racing teams and the G Team, one of the leading snowboard clubs in the midwest. The Minneapolis Ski Club also offers Nordic Ski Jumping training at the ski jump at Hyland.

Common items made via RIM include automotive bumpers, air spoilers, and fenders. Process The two parts of the polymer are mixed together, usually by injecting them under high pressure into an impinging mixer. Then the mixture is injected under lower pressure into a mold. The mixture is allowed to sit in the mold long enough for it to expand and cure. If reinforcing agents are added to the mixture then the process is known as reinforced reaction injection molding (RRIM). Common reinforcing agents include glass fibers and mica. This process is usually used to produce rigid foam automotive panels. A subset of RIM is structural reaction injection molding (SRIM), which uses fiber meshes for the reinforcing agent. The fiber mesh is first arranged in the mold and then the polymer mixture is injection molded over it. The most common RIM processable material is polyurethane (known generally as PU-RIM),. but others include polyureas, polyisocyanurates, polyesters, polyphenols, polyepoxides, and nylon 6. For polyurethane one component of the mixture is polyisocyanate and the other component is a blend of polyol, surfactant, catalyst, and blowing agent. Advantages and disadvantages Reaction injection molding can produce strong, flexible, lightweight parts which can easily be painted. It also has the advantage of quick cycle times compared to typical vacuum cast materials. The bi-component mixture injected into the mold has a much lower viscosity than molten thermoplastic polymers, therefore large, light-weight, and thin-walled items can be successfully RIM processed. This thinner mixture also requires less clamping forces, which leads to smaller equipment and ultimately lower capital expenditures. Another advantage of RIM processed foam is that a high-density skin is formed with a low-density core. The disadvantages are slow cycle times, compared to injection molding, and expensive raw materials. Tooling Machined steel or aluminum; cast aluminum; silicone rubber; epoxy resin; nickel. The machines can be large or small depending on the size of part required.

In the case of art created on the device, the art can be further embellished online and printed with a printer accessible by the user's computer. Both the Leapster and Leapster L-MAX were retired in 2014 and the Leapster2 was retired in 2019.  History  Released in October 2003, the Leapster has since undergone several revisions and remakes. The Leapster L-MAX, which is a version that has one extra feature (an A/V TV output, which allows the user to view and hear gameplay on their television) was released in 2004. The L-MAX the console's size has decreased and pen is now a wire instead of a thread. The Leapster TV, a screenless version with the same basic control layout in a console form, was released in 2005 and retired in 2007. The Leapster was the best-selling educational handheld in America and has sold about 4 million units and 12 million software cartridges since its inception, as of May 2007. It is regularly sold in nine countries directly, and in another 7 for teaching English as a second language in schools.

Domville was involved in a great number of business interests. He imported tea and other goods from the British West Indies. He was invested in iron works, rolling mills, and nail factories. Domville was also a member of the board of Globe Mutual Life Assurance and of Stadacona Fire and Life Insurance, and director and president of Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada. He was a member of the council of the Dominion Artillery Association, a fellow of the Royal Colonial Institute, London, was president of the Kings County Board of Trade, and was chairman of the delegation from Saint John, at the Dominion Board of Trade, Ottawa, in 1871. Domville represented King's in the House of Commons of Canada from 1872 to 1882 as a Conservative. Domville came to disagree with his party's protectionist policies ‚Äì a matter which led to a physical confrontation with caucus-mate Arthur Hill Gillmor. These policies were unpopular enough with his constituents that he lost his seat in 1882, leading to his split with the Conservative Party of Sir John A. Macdonald. He would run several times unsuccessfully as an independent candidate, but when he returned to parliament from 1896 to 1900 it was as a Liberal. Domville was also a Saint John city alderman for a time, during which he was instrumental in the establishment of the city's public library. In 1903 he was appointed to the Senate by Wilfrid Laurier, where he served until his death. NotesReferences * * Peter J.

Luthe was a pioneer of aerodynamics and digital design within the automotive field. On his death in 2008, The Guardian called Luthe \\"one of the most important figures in postwar European car styling.\\" Career Luthe was born in 1932 in Wuppertal, the second-oldest of five children in a deeply Catholic family. His father died on the Eastern Front when he was just 12 years old. Luthe originally wanted to follow his elder brother into a career in architecture, but took an apprenticeship from 1948 to 1954 as a coachbuilding student at Karosseriebauer Voll in W√ºrzburg, where he worked on proposals for buses. After completing his apprenticeship, he joined Deutsche Fiat AG, where he was, among other activities, responsible for the frontal styling of the original 500. NSU alt= He soon, however, joined NSU, where he was instrumental in developing the company‚Äôs design department. Luthe‚Äôs first designs at NSU were the second-generation NSU Prinz 4 and the NSU Wankel Spider. The Prinz had a distinct resemblance to its contemporary Chevrolet Corvair; the original design had already been finalized when BMW launched its new 700 model in 1959, with a very similar design. NSU management decided that changes were needed, and an NSU board member who had just returned from the United States described the Corvair design to Luthe, who incorporated some of the elements into the Prinz's bathtub design. \\"Gespr√§che mit Claus Luthe\\", Uit Wankel Journal, December 1996. Accessed April 20, 2008. With the growth of the German economy, NSU was interested in offering larger cars to the growing middle class, and in 1962 NSU president Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf authorized the development of a mid-sized front-wheel drive sedan, using the company's revolutionary new Wankel engine technology. Chief engineer Ewald Praxl was given the assignment to develop the car, originally envisaged at 800 kg and 80 hp, starting from a clean sheet. Luthe was given responsibility for the design, working with the engineering team of Walter Froede and Georg Jungbluth, \\"1967-1977 NSU Ro 80\\" Auto Editors of Consumer Guide, October 29, 2007. Accessed April 20, 2008. to utilize the compact Wankel engine, itself created by Felix Wankel. Luthe created a clean wedge shape with a large glasshouse, while the engineering team added innovations such as four-wheel independent suspension, semi- automatic transmission and inboard disc brakes to reduce unsprung mass. The Ro 80 still stands today as a milestone in automotive design. It had an initial drag coefficient of only 0.35, remarkably low for its time, even though it was not tested in a wind tunnel until the design was largely finalized.\\"Claus Luthe: Designer of the Daring Ro80\\" , Dexigner, April 3, 2008. Accessed April 14, 2008. The final production models dropped the drag coefficient to 0.34. In late 1967, when the remarkable new Ro 80 was introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show, it did not initially gain universal acceptance for its unconventional wedge-like design. However, sales proved to be strong, and by the spring of 1969, there were still waiting lists for the car.Kirchberg et al.: A History of Progress, p.200. Audi AG, 1996. Unfortunately the early engines suffered from heavy wear of the rotor tip seals in the innovative Wankel engine, causing severe financial losses for NSU. 37,204 Ro 80s were built by the time production finally ceased in 1977, but by that time the company had long been part of Audi, a Volkswagen subsidiary. alt= The K70 was originally created by Luthe as the NSU K70, to fill the gap between the Prinz and the Ro 80, but came to the market in 1971 as a Volkswagen K70, after considerable delays, partly due to the Volkswagen acquisition of NSU, and with modifications to Luthe's original design. Audi alt= Following the takeover of NSU by Volkswagen, Luthe continued to work for Audi from 1971 to 1976. His first project at Audi was the Audi 50, on which the original Volkswagen Polo was based. Luthe completed the styling of the tidy three-door hatchback design, as well as guiding the interior design; the concept of the dashboard design is remarkably similar to that proposed by Luthe (but rejected by the NSU management) in the original Ro 80 prototypes. While the Bertone design house was consulted on the near-final design, only modifying a few small details, such as the upsweep of the chrome trim on the side. The 50 was introduced in August 1974, just three months after the debut of the Volkswagen Golf. He subsequently designed the interior of the second-generation Audi 100 C2, and produced the initial proposals for the Audi 80 B2, although the design was modified substantially, and finalized by Giorgetto Giugiaro, after Luthe left Audi. BMW BMW E30 3-series BMW E31 8-Series BMW E36 3-Series In 1976 Luthe succeeded Paul Bracq as chief designer with BMW, and began to move the Bavarian manufacturer's designs in a more creative, stylish direction. At the time, the company offered a full line of products, from the E21 3 Series to the E23 7 Series, all with relatively conservative designs developed under Bracq's direction. Luthe, then, was tasked with developing a facelift for the aging E12 5 Series within a budget of USD 100 million.\\"Hommage an Claus Luthe\\" Initiative Kulturgut Mobilit√§t, Ralf Ziegler. Accessed April 25, 2008. Luthe solved the cost restraint problem by reusing the passenger compartment structure of the E12, but with new front and rear clips and a new interior. Significant technical developments, such as new front and rear axles as well as climate control, were also added, and eventually the project cost for the new model, the E28 reached USD 400 million. However, the BMW management was satisfied that the improvements in the E28 were well worth the costs. The next priority was the development of a successor for the E21 3 Series. In order to broaden the appeal of the model, a four-door version was to be added. Luthe maintained a low front profile and the familiar dual round headlights in the E30 successor model, distinguishing the model from the larger 5 Series, while creating a smoother profile, as with the E28. After the launch of the E30, BMW chairman Herbert Quandt set a challenge for the design team to better the Mercedes-Benz W126, the benchmark in European luxury vehicles at the time. The W126 was a highly conservative design, penned by Bruno Sacco, but Luthe took a far more radical approach. A sleek, streamlined, wedge-shaped body, in some ways reminiscent of the trend-setting Ro 80, and unconventional L-shaped taillights, the new E32 was very much the antithesis of the W126. In spite of Luthe's concerns, the BMW board approved the design with enthusiasm. He then supervised the design of the E36 3 Series, and by 1990 he was named the head of BMW‚Äôs design department, supervising the creation of the 1989 E31 8 Series coupe, and the third-generation E34 5 Series. Personal life Luthe was married with four children. He left his post at BMW after being accused of fatally stabbing his 33-year-old, chronically drug-dependent oldest son, Ulrich after an argument on Good Friday in 1990. He was eventually convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 33 months in prison, but was released before having to serve the complete sentence. \\"Former BMW chief designer, Luthe, dies\\" UPI, April 10, 2008, Accessed April 14, 2008.

He is currently the VP of Hockey Operations with the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL). He previously served as an assistant coach with the Bears and the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). A veteran of over 1,000 AHL and IHL games, Helmer previously served as captain for the Hershey Bears in the American Hockey League (AHL). He has also played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Phoenix Coyotes, St. Louis Blues, Vancouver Canucks and the Washington Capitals. Playing career Helmer went undrafted but was signed as a free agent by the New Jersey Devils in 1994. He never played a game with the Devils, instead playing with their minor league affiliate Albany River Rats for 5 years. His most successful season with the River Rats was during the 1997‚Äì98 season when he scored 63 points in 80 games along with 101 PIM and an appearance in the AHL All-Star Game. Following the 1997‚Äì98 season Helmer signed with the Phoenix Coyotes. He made his NHL debut with the Coyotes, appearing in 11 games. He was then released and later claimed on waivers by the St. Louis Blues. He appeared in another 29 games with the Blues, notching four assists. The 1999‚Äì2000 season saw Helmer play the majority of the year with the Worcester IceCats while also appearing in 15 games with the Blues. On February 12, 2000, Helmer scored his first career NHL goal against Guy Hebert and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in a 6-3 Blues victory After the 1999‚Äì2000 season, Helmer signed with the Vancouver Canucks. He spent the next three years bouncing between the Canucks and the minors. The 2001‚Äì02 season saw Helmer achieve NHL career highs with ten points and 53 PIM. In addition, Helmer played six games in the playoffs that year, the only time he has played in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. On July 25, 2003, Helmer was traded by the Canucks back to the Phoenix Coyotes for Martin Grenier. He missed the majority of the 2003‚Äì04 season due to a shoulder injury but managed to appear in 17 games with the Coyotes. Prior to the 2008‚Äì09 season, this had been the last time Helmer played in the NHL. He signed with the Detroit Red Wings in 2004 but played two years in the AHL with the Grand Rapids Griffins. He was re- signed by the Coyotes in 2006 and had been playing with the San Antonio Rampage. Helmer signed with the Hershey Bears on July 24, 2008, and served as captain of the team. On November 28, 2008, the Washington Capitals signed and recalled Helmer from Hershey due to several key injuries among the Capitals' defensemen. Helmer led the Bears to Calder Cups in 2009 and 2010. While with the Oklahoma City Barons, Helmer became the AHL all-time leading scorer among defencemen in 2011, passing John Slaney. Helmer has 562 points in 1093 AHL games. After captaining the Barons in his second season with the club, Helmer was left unsigned through the beginning of the 2012‚Äì13 season, due to the NHL lockout. After an agreement was reached, Helmer was signed by the Springfield Falcons on January 9, 2013. In 2017, he was inducted into the AHL Hall of Fame.

The strikes opposed a directive that conscripted young Luxembourgers into the Wehrmacht. A nationwide general strike, originating in Wiltz, paralysed the country and led to the occupying German authorities responding violently by sentencing 21 strikers to death. Origins Following the German invasion of Luxembourg on May 10, 1940, Luxembourg was briefly placed under military occupation. On August 2, 1940, the military government was dissolved and replaced by a civilian government under the leadership of the German civilian administrator of the adjoining German district.Rich, Norman. Hitler's War Aims: The Establishment of the New Order. W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1974, p. 163. The Luxembourg population was declared to be German and was to use German as its only language; the German authorities, under the orders of the Gauleiter Gustav Simon, developed a robust policy of germanization. Furthermore, on August 30, 1942, Gustav Simon announced that all Luxembourger males born between 1920 and 1927 were to be conscripted into the Wehrmacht to fight against the Allies. The strike and its consequences Reaction to the policies was swift among the Luxembourg population, especially against the forced conscription policy. Within hours, a number of Luxembourgers discussed possibilities and decided to organize a general strike. Leaflets calling for the strike were printed, and distributed clandestinely throughout the country by resistants. On August 31, 1942, the strike officially began in the northern Ardennes town of Wiltz with a gathering of local Luxembourg town officials, led by local town officials Michel Worr√© and Nicolas M√ºller, refusing to go to work. These were gradually joined by other local workers, among them the employees of IDEAL Lederwerke Wiltz, a large industrial tannery belonging to the Adler & Oppenheimer group before \\"aryanisation\\". News on the strike spread rapidly. Soon thereafter, workers from the southwestern industrial towns of Schifflange and Differdange were alerted, and also refused to go to work. In Schifflange, Hans Adam, a worker of German origins sounded the alarm across the valley to alert all workers. In Differdange, news of the strike spread throughout the workforce by word of mouth, and increased in intensity on September 1. On September 2, 156 mill workers refused to take their shift, and many of those who were already working stopped. The German directors of the mill warned the millworkers that they could be killed for their actions. A few workers got back to work, but approximately 50 still refused, and declared they were on strike. At 10 a.m., German authorities reacted and designated who they held as responsible for the situation: Jean-Paul Schneider, Nicolas Betz, Alphonse Weets, Robert Mischo, Ren√© Angelsberg, and Ernest Toussaint. The six men were arrested, tried by a special tribunal, sentenced to death, and deported to the Hinzert concentration camp where they were shot. Their families were sent to prison and work camps in Germany. The strike spread also to Esch-sur-Alzette, the capital of the Luxembourg mining area, all aspects of the administration were paralysed, including administration, agriculture, industry and education structures. The central post office in Luxembourg received rumours of the strike in the morning, and received formal confirmation of the strike by early afternoon, which disrupted the distribution of mail that evening and the following day. Throughout the country, schoolchildren were kept away from school, teachers refused to teach, laborers refused to work, there was no or little production of steel, milk, and other products. Although the exact number of strikers is unknown, the movement did have a strong effect on the country and the occupying forces, and revitalized resistance movements. The strike was also widely publicized internationally by the allied press. German reaction to the Strike Fearing a further escalation of protests, German authorities decided to react in the harshest way to the strike. Within hours, the strike leaders were rounded up and interrogated by the Gestapo. They were formally arrested soon thereafter, on September 1, and interned in local prisons. Twenty strike leaders were summarily tried by a special tribunal (Standgericht) and sentenced to death and transferred to the Hinzert concentration camp where they were shot and buried in an unmarked grave. Hans Adam, who had rung the alarm in Schifflange and had German origins, was considered to be a traitor and was thus decapitated. Two thousand Luxembourgers were arrested, 83 were tried by the special tribunal and transferred to the Gestapo. 290 high school children, boys and girls, were arrested and sent to re-education camps in Germany, as were 40 ARBED trainees and 7 young postmen. The first two strikers to be shot, on September 2, 1942, at 6.30 p.m., were Michel Worr√© and Nicolas M√ºller, from Wiltz. Their last words, according to an SS who witnessed the execution, were \\"Vive L√´tzebuerg\\" (Long live Luxembourg!). A series of black on red posters were then posted throughout Luxembourg announcing the death of the strikers as a consequence of the strike, bearing the names, occupation, and residency of each victim. Their families, including their children, were subsequently transferred to work camps, many in Silesia, under very harsh conditions.

Commemoration of the Strike The 1942 Luxembourg general strike strongly marked Luxembourg's resistance to the German occupier, and represents one of the proudest moments of the history of the Grand-Duchy. Each year, the Strike is commemorated on August 31 by the head of state and government officials. In 1965, a lighthouse-shaped \\"National Monument to the Strike\\" was opened in Wiltz. Luxembourg's most famous 20th-century sculptor Lucien Wercollier created the two reliefs on the lighthouse displayed there. Wercollier was himself imprisoned at the Hinzert concentration camp.

It is now in the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt.  Description  The painting shows a world landscape, with the foreground a woodland clearing containing three peasants dancing to a bagpipes, next to a gallows upon which a magpie is perched. The gallows stands in the centre of the picture, dividing the painting in two, a Mannerist composition with the right side more \\"open\\" and left more \\"closed\\",Early Netherlandish painting, Volume 4 of Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Cambridge University Press, 1986, , p.32 with the magpie close to the exact centre of the painting. The gallows appears to form an \\"impossible object\\", similar to a Penrose triangle, with the bases of the posts seemingly planted side by side, but with the right side of the cross-member receding into the distance, and contradictory lighting. Another magpie sits on a rock at the base of the gallows, near the skull of an animal. The only people occupy the left foreground: a man defecates in the shadows to the left, while others watch the three dancers. To the right stands a cross with a watermill behind. The background opens on to a view of a river valley, with a town to the left and castle on a rocky crag above, and a tower on a rock outcrop to the right, and distant hills and the sky beyond. Behind the dancers rise two intertwined trees, a motif used by Bruegel in an earlier drawing of bears playing in a forest. An impression of depth is given by the progression from dense brown tones dominating of the foreground, through green midtones in the middle distance, to light blues and greys for the background.  Analysis  Bruegel's painting was created the year after Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, arrived in the Netherlands, sent by the Spanish king, Philip II to suppress the Dutch Revolt. The gallows may represent the threat of execution of those preaching the new Protestant doctrine, and the painting may allude to several Netherlandish proverbs. There is a direct allusion to the Netherlandish proverbs of dancing on the gallows or shitting on the gallows, meaning a mocking of the state. It also alludes to the belief that magpies are gossips, and that gossip leads to hangings.Painting life: the art of Pieter Bruegel, the Elder, Robert L. Bonn, 2006, , p.106 And that the way to the gallows leads through pleasant meadows.The Last Flowering of the Middle Ages, Baron Joseph Van Der Elst, Kessinger Publishing, 2005, , p.114 It is not known why or for whom the picture was painted. Its date of 1568 makes this painting one of Bruegel's last works before his death in 1569; indeed, perhaps his final work. Bruegel asked his wife to burn some of his pictures on his death, but told her to keep the Magpie on the Gallows for herself.

He spent five years in Berlin, studying composition under Otis Bardwell Boise and piano under Heinrich Barth. Afterwards he returned to the U.S. and worked as a piano teacher and composer at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, along with the Institute of Musical Art (now the Juilliard School) and the Mannes College of Music, both in New York. Collaborating with the classically- trained singer Loraine Wyman, he carried out a six-week fieldwork journey in the Appalachian Mountains in Kentucky to collect traditional folk songs from the people living there. Brockway recorded the tunes (and later wrote piano accompaniments), while Wyman recorded the words. They published their work in two volumes, which appeared in 1916 and 1920. Brockway‚Äôs own compositions include a symphony, a suite, a symphonic ballad, a piano concerto, chamber- music works, choirs, and songs. He died on February 20, 1951 in New York. From around 1911 to 1920, Brockway worked for the American Piano Corporation (Ampico) as a recording artist and piano roll editor. He recorded at least 155 works for the classical catalogue, and also numerous accompaniment and popular items. He was Ampico's most prolific artist.

Dance is thought to have been an integral part of Vietnamese culture since ancient times, as depicted by engravings found on Dong Son drums. Vietnam is a diverse country with 54 different ethnic groups, with the ethnic Vietnamese (known as Kinh) making up the majority of the population. This article mainly focuses on the traditional dances of the ethnic Vietnamese, although each of the many ethnic minorities of Vietnam have their own rich culture and dance styles. Dancing in Vietnamese theatres Much of Vietnamese theatre and Vietnamese music are intertwined with each other, as well as with Vietnamese dance. Popular theatre forms such as H√°t tu·ªìng, H√°t ch√®o, and C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng all often feature dance, however these dances are performed in a liberal manner without set rules, unlike other more specific dance styles. Dances performed at festivals and important occasions The lion dance was imported from China into Vietnamese culture where it developed its own distinct style. It is performed primarily at traditional festivals such as T·∫øt (Lunar new year) and T·∫øt trung thu (Mid- Autumn Festival), but also during other occasions such as the opening of a new business. The lion dance is highly symbolic, supposedly used to ward off evil spirits. There are an abundance of styles and the lion dances are typically accompanied by martial artists and acrobatics. Imperial court dances Accompanied with Nh√£ nh·∫°c (court music of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty to the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty) were the intricate dances of the Vietnamese Imperial court. Nh√£ Nh·∫°c means \\"elegant music\\" when translated. While assuredly court dances existed before nh√£ nh·∫°c in particular emerged, it is the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty form that is still highly preserved today, and has been declared along with the whole of nh√£ nh·∫°c as an Intangible cultural heritage. These dances require great skill and the dancers are often dressed in extravagant costumes. Currently, they are performed at festivals in Hu·∫ø (m√∫a cung ƒë√¨nh Hu·∫ø - court dance) or other special (often televised) occasions, in order to promote the traditional arts. Some of the most popular dances include (among others): *Fan dance - v≈© phi·∫øn *Lantern dance - l·ª•c c√∫ng hoa ƒëƒÉng *Lotus dance - m√∫a sen, m√∫a b√†i b√¥ng *Flag dance *Platter dance - m√∫a m√¢m *Candle dance *Incense dance *Hat dance - m√∫a n√≥n *Scarf dance *Lion dance -m√∫a l√¢n *Ribbon dance The meaning of \\"m√∫a\\" extends to M√∫a r·ªëi n∆∞·ªõc - water puppetry See also *Culture of Vietnam *History of Vietnam External links Category:Dance in Vietnam ","title":"Traditional Vietnamese dance"},{"id":"10881036","text":"SMU Kristen 1 Bandung (also known as SMUK 1 or SMAK 1) is a Protestant high school located in Bandung, Indonesia.

The team currently plays out of the Hvidovre Sk√∏jtehal arena. History The team, formerly known as Hvidovre Wolves, first joined the league in the 2007‚Äì08 season. The name Totempo HvIK is the result of a sponsorship deal. On 29 January 2009, the club withdrew from the Danish Elitserien and filed for bankruptcy on Monday after their two main sponsors pulled out on them. One, car service company Totempo, filed for bankruptcy and the second, office machine company NRG Scandinavia, disputed their sponsorship agreement, saying it was entered into by a sales and marketing manager at NRG who didn't have the authority and was since fired. As a result, the club was short 2 million Danish crowns (about $428,000 Canadian) in revenue. After withdrawing from the top Danish hockey league, Hvidovre played one year in the 1.division as Hvidovre IK. In 2014 they changed their name to Hvidovre Fighters, signaling a new beginning and vision for Hvidovre IK. Part of this vision was to change the organisation and rebuild the club, to one day return to the highest league level. in their second season as Hvidovre Fighters the team accomplished their goal of a being a top 4 team, by advancing all the way to the finals, settling for a silver medal, after losing to Vojens IK. With the future goal of returning to the highest league, the Hvidovre Fighters decided to stay another year in the 1.division, continuing to build up their team and organisation. In 2017 Hvidore Fighters achieved their dream by winning the 1.division and returning to the top league in Danish hockey.

It is the third planet claimed in the system and (assuming a five-planet model) the fifth in order from the star. Though not confirmed to be a terrestrial planet and significantly more massive than Earth (at 6.98 Earth masses), the Super-Earth is the first exoplanet of terrestrial mass proposed to orbit within the habitable zone of its parent star. Assuming its existence, computer climate simulations have confirmed the possibility of the existence of surface water and these factors combine to a relatively high measure of planetary habitability.  Discovery  A team of astronomers led by St√©phane Udry of the Geneva Observatory used the HARPS instrument on the European Southern Observatory 3.6 meter telescope in La Silla, Chile, to discover the planet in 2007. Udry's team employed the radial velocity technique, in which the mass of a planet is determined based on the small perturbations it induces in its parent star's orbit via gravity.\\"The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets\\" , S.

Accessed June 10, 2011  Disputed existence  In September 2012, Roman Baluev filtered out the \\"red noise\\" from the Keck data and concluded that this planet's existence is probable only to 2.2 standard deviations. That same year, however, a team from the USNO confirmed the existence of the planet with a much higher probability. A study in 2014 concluded that Gliese 581d is \\"an artifact of stellar activity which, when incompletely corrected, causes the false detection of planet g.\\" In 2015, a study by Guillem Anglada-Escud√© and Mikko Tuomi discounted the 2014 analysis and concluded that the planet could exist and confirmed the planet.https://www.inquisitr.com/1906009/gliese-581d-new-study-confirms- existence-of-one-of-most-earth-like-extrasolar-planets-known/ If finally verified, Gliese 581d would constitute the first planet identified to be located in a stellar habitable zone outside of the Solar System, based on studies of 2007.  Orbital characteristics  Gliese 581d orbits Gliese 581 at 0.21847 AU, approximately a fifth of the distance that the Earth orbits the Sun, though its orbital eccentricity has not been confirmed. There are currently two models for its orbit, a circular one like Earth's, and an eccentric one like Mercury's. These are based on the four planet and six planet model for the Gliese 581 system, respectively. Under the four planet model Gliese 581d would most probably be in a spin-orbit resonance of 2:1, rotating twice for each orbit of its parent star. Therefore, the day on Gliese 581d should approximately be 67 Earth days long. The orbital distance places it at the outer limits of the habitable zone, the distance at which it is believed possible for water to exist on the surface of a planetary body. At the time of its discovery, the planet's orbit was originally thought to be farther out. However, in late April 2009 the original discovery team revised its original estimate of the planet's orbital parameters, finding that it orbits closer to its star than originally determined with an orbital period of 66.87 days. They concluded that the planet is within the habitable zone where liquid water could exist, thus confirming previous studies. Moreover, the dataR.

Physical characteristics  The motion of the parent star indicates a minimum mass for Gliese 581d of 5.6 Earth masses (earlier analyses gave higher values). Dynamical simulations of the Gliese 581 system assuming that the orbits of the three planets are coplanar show that the system becomes unstable if the masses of the planets exceed 1.6‚Äì2 times the minimum values. Using earlier minimum mass values for Gliese 581d, this implies an upper mass limit for Gliese 581d of 13.8 Earth masses. The composition of the planet, however, is not known.  Climate and habitability  The habitable zone of Gliese 581 compared with our Solar System's habitable zone, showing Gliese 581d near the outer edge As the planet is not known to transit from Earth and atmospheric conditions are not observable with current technology, no atmosphere for the planet has been confirmed to date. As such, all climate predictions for the planet are based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric conditions. Because Gliese 581d was believed to orbit outside the habitable zone of its star it was originally thought to be too cold for liquid water to be present. With the 2009 revised orbit, climate simulations conducted by researchers in France in 2011 indicated possible temperatures suitable for surface water at sufficient atmospheric pressure According to St√©phane Udry, \\"It could be covered by a 'large and deep ocean'; it is the first serious ocean planet candidate.\\"\\"Lightest exoplanet yet discovered\\", European Southern Observatory. April 21, 2009. Accessed June 10, 2011 On average, the light that Gliese 581d receives from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might seem to suggest that Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about ‚àí18 ¬∞C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100 ¬∞C on the day side to ‚àí150 ¬∞C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected. Gliese 581d is probably too massive to be made only of rocky material. It may have originally formed on a more distant orbit as an icy planet that then migrated closer to its star. Its equilibrium temperature is 181 Kelvin. A major detrimental factor which may prevent life from forming and it being an inhabitable planet is the fact that Gliese 581 is a variable star.  Hello from Earth  As part of the 2009 National Science Week celebrations in Australia, Cosmos magazine launched a website called \\"Hello from Earth\\" to collect messages for transmission to Gliese 581d. The maximum length of the messages was 160 characters, and they were restricted to the English language. In total, 25,880 messages were collected from 195 countries around the world. The messages were transmitted from the DSS-43 70 m radio telescope at the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex at Tidbinbilla, Australia, on 28 August 2009.  In popular culture  Gliese 581d is the setting for the Doctor Who episode \\"Smile\\". It is also shown in Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking's Episode 3: The Story of Everything.

He was the grandson of Karl Baedeker, the founder of the eponymous travel guide publishing house, and the son of Fritz Baedeker (1844 - 1925), who ran the same company from 1869 until his death in 1925. One of his scientific discoveries was that the resistivity of cuprous iodide (CuI) depended on its stoichiometry. Thin films of the material became much more conductive when exposed to iodine vapor; the effect was reversible. This was the first example of doping a semiconductor to change its propertiesJed Z. Buchwald, Andrew Warwick (ed) Histories of the Electron: The Birth of Microphysics MIT Press, 2004 pp.274-276 and also the discovery of transparent conductive materials. He also observed a Hall effect in transparent copper iodide thin films that had the reverse sign to that in copper, an observation of what was later to be known as conduction by electron holes in semiconductors. This observation was critical in developing the theory of electron conduction in solids. Along with his graduate student Karl Steinberg, Baedeker studied the effect of varying concentration of iodine on the electrical properties of copper iodide. He also is credited with making the first transparent conducting oxide (TCO) thin film, cadmium oxide (CdO), in 1907.K. Baedeker, Annalen der Physik (Leipzig) 327 (1907) 749.

Though they scored some successes, notably a tactical win at Perryville, they soon retreated, leaving Kentucky primarily under Union control for the rest of the war. Background=Military situation Western campaigns by Union forces earlier in 1862 had reaped much progress. The Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers had been opened to the U.S. Navy after successes at the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson. The railroad hub at Corinth had been evacuated by the Confederates, causing most of West Tennessee to fall into Union control. New Orleans, the Confederacy's largest city at that time, had been captured by Admiral David Farragut. The city of Vicksburg, Mississippi, was now an important strategic aim for the Union commanders, as the western Confederates were \\"narrowed down all to the single line of [rail]road running east from Vicksburg.\\"Foote, 1958, p. 25. Consequentially, protecting the Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River became a top priority for the Confederacy. Confederate General Braxton Bragg decided to divert Union attention away from Vicksburg and from Chattanooga, Tennessee, which was being threatened by a large Union force under Don Carlos Buell, by invading the border state of Kentucky. Kentucky, the most southern of the border states, produced cotton (in west Kentucky) and tobacco, and was the primary supplier of hemp for rope used in the cotton industry. The state was also a major slave trade center. Kentucky, being a border state, was among the chief places where the \\"Brother against brother\\" scenario was prevalent. Southern sympathizers in Kentucky had already seceded and joined the Confederacy, but had been unable to enforce their rule over the state's territory. Kentucky officially declared its neutrality at the beginning of the war, but after Confederate General Leonidas Polk unwisely decided to occupy Columbus in 1861, the legislature petitioned the Union Army for assistance. After early 1862 Kentucky came largely under Union control. But Kentucky also had a star on the Confederate flag, and seats in the Confederate Congress. In addition, many Confederate leaders, including John C. Breckinridge, were from Kentucky. (Jefferson Davis was born in Kentucky and grew up in Mississippi.) Abraham Lincoln was also born in Kentucky, living there until age 7. Most of Mary Todd Lincoln's relatives from the Lexington, Kentucky area were Confederate officers, and about 35,000 Kentuckians served as Confederate soldiers. But an estimated 125,000 Kentuckians served as Union soldiers.Quisenberry, A. C. \\"KENTUCKY UNION TROOPS IN THE CIVIL WAR.\\" Register of the Kentucky State Historical Society, vol. 18, no. 54, 1920, pp. 13‚Äì18. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23369562. Nearly 60 infantry regiments served in the Union armies, versus just 9 in the Confederate. However, a rather large number of cavalry outfits joined the latter. Campaign Gen. Braxton Bragg, commanding general of the Army of Mississippi In August, Confederate General Braxton Bragg invaded Kentucky, hoping that he could arouse supporters of the Confederate cause in the border state and draw Union forces under Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell back beyond the Ohio River. Bragg transported all of his infantry by railroads from Tupelo, Mississippi, to Chattanooga, Tennessee, while his cavalry and artillery moved by road. By moving his army to Chattanooga, he was able to challenge Buell's advance on the city. The Battle of Perryville as depicted in Harper's Weekly Once his forces had assembled in Chattanooga, Bragg then planned to move north into Kentucky in cooperation with Lt. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, who was commanding a separate force operating out of Knoxville, Tennessee. He captured over 4,000 Union soldiers at Munfordville, and then moved his army to Bardstown. On October 4, he participated in the inauguration of Richard Hawes as the provisional Confederate governor of Kentucky. The wing of Bragg's army under Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk met Buell's army at Perryville on October 8 and won a tactical victory against him. Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, commanding general of the Union's Army of the Ohio Kirby Smith pleaded with Bragg to follow up on his success: \\"For God's sake, General, let us fight Buell here.\\" Bragg replied, \\"I will do it, sir,\\" but then displaying what one observer called \\"a perplexity and vacillation which had now become simply appalling to Smith, to Hardee, and to Polk,\\"Foote, 1958, p. 740. he ordered his army to retreat through the Cumberland Gap to Knoxville. Bragg referred to his retreat as a withdrawal, the successful culmination of a giant raid. He had multiple reasons for withdrawing. Disheartening news had arrived from North Mississippi that Earl Van Dorn and Sterling Price had failed at Corinth, just as Robert E. Lee had failed in his Maryland Campaign. He saw that his army had not much to gain from a further, isolated victory, whereas a defeat might cost not only the bountiful food and supplies yet collected, but also his army. He wrote to his wife, \\"With the whole southwest thus in the enemy's possession, my crime would have been unpardonable had I kept my noble little army to be ice-bound in the northern clime, without tents or shoes, and obliged to forage daily for bread, etc.\\"Foote, 1958, p. 739. Aftermath The invasion of Kentucky was a strategic failure, although it had forced the Union forces out of Northern Alabama and most of Middle Tennessee; it would take the Union forces a year to regain the lost ground. A writer for the Cincinnati Commercial wrote \\"It was intended by Jeff Davis as a demonstration to keep the men of the West from being employed beyond the Alleghenies to aid McClellan, while the best of the Southern troops invaded Maryland and flanked Washington. Thousands of Union troops at Louisville, Cincinnati, Cumberland Gap and elsewhere ‚Äòhave been held at bay by no more than 40,000 rebels scattered throughout Kentucky.\\" Confederate General Joseph Wheeler claimed it was a success, stating ‚ÄòWe recovered Cumberland Gap and redeemed Middle Tennessee and North Alabama. Two months of marches and battles by the armies of Bragg and Kirby-Smith had cost the Federals a loss in killed, wounded and prisoners of 26,530. We had captured 35 cannons, 16,000 stand of arms, millions of rounds of ammunition, 1,700 mules, 300 wagons loaded with military stores, and 2,000 horses.‚Äô Confederate war clerk J.B. Jones recorded that Bragg \\"succeeded in getting away with the largest amount of provisions, clothing, etc., ever obtained by an army, including 8,000 beef cattle, 50,000 barrels of pork, and a million yards of Kentucky cloth.\\" Bragg was criticized by some newspapers and two of his own generals, Polk and William J. Hardee, but there was plenty of blame to spread among the Confederate high command for the failure of the invasion of Kentucky. The armies of Bragg and Kirby Smith suffered from a lack of unified command. Bragg can be faulted for moving his army away from Munfordville, out of Buell's path, a prime location for a battle to Confederate advantage. Polk can also be blamed for not following Bragg's instructions on the day before and the day of the battle. Confederate President Jefferson Davis kept Bragg in command of the Army of Tennessee. President Abraham Lincoln removed Buell from command of the Army of the Ohio for being too cautious in pursuit of Bragg, replacing him with Major General William Rosecrans. Buell would never get another command for the remainder of the war before mustering out of service in 1864. Bragg himself blamed the failure in large part on the Kentuckians themselves, whom he had expected to flock to his banner in droves as he marched through the state. He had even brought along a wagon train of 20,000 additional rifles to arm the new recruits he expected to receive. In a letter to his wife, he said \\"Why should we be expected to conquer the whole Northwest with 35,000 men? Our only hope was in Kentucky. We were assured she would be with us to a man, yet in seven weeks occupation, with twenty thousand guns and ammunition burdening our train, we only succeeded in getting about two thousand men to join us and at least half of them have now deserted.\\" NotesReferences * Foote, Shelby, The Civil War, A Narrative: Fort Sumter to Perryville, Random House, 1958, . * Foote, Shelby, The Civil War, A Narrative: Second Manassas to Pocotaligo, Random House, 1958, .

This phase also used genetic investigation techniques based on DNA testing. The EAAF was a pioneer in developing these techniques. In the words of Clyde Snow: :\\"For the first time in the history of human rights investigations we began to use a scientific method to investigate violations. Although we started out small, it led to a genuine revolution in how human rights violations are investigated. The idea of using science in the human rights area began here, in Argentina, and it is now used throughout the world. The Team took the idea to other parts of the world and helped set up teams in other countries, such as Guatemala, Chile, and Peru. European countries now have their forensic anthropology teams. But Argentina was the first.\\" By 2000 the EAAF had succeeded in identifying sixty sets of remains, while a further 300 cases were still under investigation. The EAAF co-operates with and assists other NGOs and investigations - for example, as of 2017, it is assisting the Expert Technical Group investigating the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, Ireland, following the discovery of the bodies of up to 800 children buried in a mass grave, under the auspices of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation.

The transmitter is on Venning Road in Mount Pleasant.Radio-Locator.com/WSCC-FM WSCC-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format. Its HD2 digital subchannel carries iHeartRadio's smooth jazz music service. History=Early Years On May 19, 1983, the station signed on as WBJX.Broadcasting Yearbook 1984 page B-228 It was owned by Sunrise Broadcasting and aired an adult contemporary music format. At first, it was powered at only 3,000 watts. The following year, WBJX was bought by O'Grady Communications, which switched the call sign to WLNB.Broadcasting Yearbook 1985 page B-240 The station featured an early form of Urban Adult Contemporary called \\"Heart & Soul, the new FM 94 WLNB.\\" The station aimed its programming at African American adults. In 1987, WLNB was sold to Jones Eastern Broadcasting of Charleston, which changed the station to a rhythmic contemporary format or \\"CHUrban\\" as \\"The All New Hot 94\\" under the call letters WWHT, with the HT standing for Hot. The Hot 94 disc jockeys or \\"Hot Jocks\\" as they were known, included Madeline (formerly of crosstown Album Rock WAVF) for the morning, Mick Barker (from rival Top 40 outlet WSSX) for middays, with Chris Kelly (from WMMC/Columbia, South Carolina) for the afternoon, and Rocky Love (from WXTU/Philadelphia) for evenings. The station was programmed by Bob Casey, formerly VP-Programming of crosstown WXTC.Kim Freeman \\"Vox Jox\\" column, \\"Billboard\\" Magazine August 1st, 1987 Switch to Oldies Hot 94 failed to make headway due to strong competition from Top 40 stations WKQB (Q-107) and WSSX (95SSX). Hot 94 had a 3,000 watt signal while WKQB and WSSX were powered at 100,000 watts. So in mid 1989, Hot 94 dumped the CHUrban format as well as much of the staff. It flipped to Oldies as \\"The All New Hot Gold 94 WWHT\\". Again. ratings failed to materialize. In early 1990, WWHT switched to an Urban Contemporary format as WUJM, as \\"The New 94 Jams!\\". But once again, the station faced strong competition from established Urban stations WWWZ and WPAL-FM. It switched to easy listening and soft adult contemporary by late 1991 as \\"Easy 94.3\\". Fly 94 and The Beat In the Fall of 1992, WUJM entered into a LMA with WSSX, which resulted in the station's format changed to Contemporary hit radio (CHR) as \\"Fly 94.\\" The WSSP call sign was added that October. Although the station became Charleston's only CHR when WSSX moved to a Hot Adult Contemporary sound, the ratings for WSSP were still dismal. In September 1993, the LMA was broken off and WSSP flipped to satellite fed adult standards as \\"Stardust 94.3.\\" In 1999, Clear Channel Broadcasting, the forerunner to current owner iHeartMedia, bought both AM 730 WSCC and FM 94.3 WSSP. WSSP dropped adult standards for a return to Rhythmic Contemporary under the \\"94.3 The Beat\\" name. In the Spring 1999 ratings, The Beat finished second to WWWZ among 18-34 listeners and doubled its numbers with that audience. By 2002, WSSP flipped to Urban Contemporary as \\"Power 94.3.\\" Clear Channel also boosted WSSP's power to 25,000 watts, allowing it to be heard around Charleston and most of its suburbs. Debut of Talk Format WSCC's signal on AM 730 was limited to only 1,000 watts by day and 100 watts at night. Clear Channel wanted to make its talk radio format more widely available. So in early 2004, 94.3 WSSP dropped its Urban sound and began simulcasting WSCC's talk format.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2005 page D-460 FM 94.3 became WSCC-FM. After two weeks, the simulcast ended. The talk radio format stayed on WSCC-FM. The AM station's call sign became WLTQ and it began airing an adult standards format. Clear Channel sold WLTQ in 2008.

Until 1934, he worked in the theatre. That year, he appeared in his first film role and later television, as a character actor. His career lasted seven decades and included many films and TV series; his last screen credit was in 1990. Early years Born in Canton, Illinois, Wolfe studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.  Career  Wolfe's stage debut came in The Claw (1919). His Broadway credits include The Deputy (1964), Winesburg, Ohio (1958), Lone Valley (1933), Devil in the Mind (1931), The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1931), Lysistrata (1930), The Seagull (1930), At the Bottom (1930), Skyrocket (1929), Gods of the Lightning (1928), and The Claw (1921). Wolfe made his film debut in The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1934). He appeared in many notable films, including Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur (1942), Julius Caesar (1953), James Dean's Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and George Lucas's THX 1138 (1971). Although he was American by birth, his experience in the theatre gave him precise diction, and he was often cast as Englishmen on screen, including a fictional commissioner of Scotland Yard in the final film in the 1939-1946 Sherlock Holmes film series, Dressed to Kill (1946). He also appeared as an American antiques dealer in another film in the series, Sherlock Holmes in Washington (1943), and Carter, Sir Wilfrid Robarts's clerk and office manager in Witness for the Prosecution (1957). Wolfe played a crooked small town doctor in \\"Six Gun's Legacy\\", an episode from the first (1949) season of The Lone Ranger. Wolfe appeared in the 1966 Perry Mason episode \\"The Case of the Midnight Howler\\" as Abel Jackson. In 1966, he portrayed the new Rev. Leighton on The Andy Griffith Show (\\"Aunt Bee's Crowning Glory\\", broadcast October 10, 1966). He also appeared in two episodes of the original Star Trek television series: \\"Bread and Circuses\\" (1968) as Septimus, and \\"All Our Yesterdays\\" (1969) as Mr. Atoz, guest-starred in a 1977 episode of the ABC crime drama The Feather and Father Gang, and portrayed the wizard Tranquil in the series Wizards and Warriors (1983). In 1982, Wolfe had a small recurring role on the TV series WKRP in Cincinnati as Hirsch, the sarcastic, irreverent butler to WKRP owner Lillian Carlson. Central to Wolfe's appeal as a character actor was that, until he reached actual old age, he always looked considerably older than he actually was. In the film Mad Love (1935), he played Colin Clive's stepfather, yet he was only four years older than Clive. In the film Houdini (1953), he warned the magician to avoid occult matters, telling him to \\"take the advice of an old man\\". He appeared in movies for another 37 years; his last film credit was for Dick Tracy (1990).  Personal life  Wolfe was a veteran of World War I, serving as a volunteer medical specialist. He was married to Elizabeth Schroder for 68 years, from 1924 until his death; the couple had two daughters. Wolfe wrote and self- published two books of poetry, Forty-Four Scribbles and a Prayer: Lyrics and Ballads and Sixty Ballads and Lyrics In Search of Music. Wolfe continued acting until the last few years of his life and died of natural causes at the age of 95 on January 23, 1992.

Arden Pope III (born c. 1954) is an American professor of economics at Brigham Young University and one of the world's foremost experts in environmental science. He received his B.S. from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1978 and his Ph.D. in Economics and statistics from Iowa State University in 1981. Although his research includes many papers on topics in the fields in which he was trained‚Äîenvironmental economics, resource economics, and agricultural economics‚Äîhe is better known for his cross- disciplinary work in environmental epidemiology and public health. He is world-renowned for his seminal work on the effects of particulate air pollution on mortality and health. His articles have helped establish the connection between air pollution and health problems, including cancer, cardiovascular, and pulmonary disease. These research findings have influenced environmental policy in the United States and Europe, contributing to the establishment of emission standards for particulate matter pollution. Air pollution research Early in Pope's career he published a paper that made him an academic cornerstone of environmental science and policy called \\"Respiratory hospital admissions associated with PM10 pollution in Utah, Salt Lake, and Cache Valleys\\". In Utah Valley the Geneva Steel Mill generated large quantities of particulate matter which is a byproduct of fossil fuel consumption. The mill was shut down temporarily. Pope compiled hospital admissions data for the time before, during, and after the temporary closing of the mill and was the first to convincingly show the immediate health harms associated with atmospheric particulate matter.C.A. Pope, 1989. Respiratory Disease Associated with Community Air Pollution and a Steel Mill, Utah Valley. AJPH May 1989, Vol. 79, No. 5, 623-628 Asthma, mortality, and respiratory admissions generally were twice as high while the plant was operating than the year in which it was closed. Utah made a particularly suitable natural experiment as the various valleys included in the study trap pollution in the winter months when temperature inversions stifle the escape of pollution. His abstract states: Pope came under hostile political pressure and his findings became a firestorm of controversy. Intense scrutiny revealed that his results were accurate. In 2004 Pope was awarded the Utah Governor's Medal in Science and Technology. In 2006 Dr. Pope was recognized as BYU's distinguished faculty through reception of the Karl G. Maeser award.

This north-south running range extends over from the Columbia River in the north on the border of Oregon and Washington, south to the middle fork of the Coquille River. It is wide and averages around in elevation above sea level. The coast range has three main sections, a Northern, Central, and Southern. The oldest portions of the range are over 60 million years old, with volcanics and a forearc basin as the primary mountain building processes responsible for the range. It is part of the larger grouping known as the Pacific Coast Ranges that extends over much of the western edge of North America from California to Alaska. The range creates a rain shadow effect for the Willamette Valley that lies to the east of the mountains, creating a more stable climate and significantly less rain than the coastal region of the state. To the west where the range over-shadows the Oregon Coast, the range causes more precipitation to fall on that side of the mountains, contributing to the numerous rivers that flow to the Pacific Ocean. Marys Peak in the Central Coast Range is the highest peak at 4,097 feet (1,248 m). Logging is a major industry in the range in both private and government owned forests. Both the state and federal government manage forests in the Oregon Coast Range. The mountains are home to a variety of wildlife including black bear, elk, deer, beaver, many species of birds, and bats among others. Fish, including salmon and trout, and other aquatic life inhabit the streams and rivers flowing through the range. Geology Exposed pillow lava in the Northern range Volcanic activity approximately 66 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period created offshore islands beginning in the southern portion of the current range.Orr, Elizabeth and William Orr, and Ewart Baldwin. Geology of Oregon. Kendall/Hunt Publishing, 1992, 4th edition. These Roseburg volcanics were followed by the Siletz River Volcanics in the northern portions of the range, and lastly a series of basalt flows from the Columbia River basalts also added to these formations with some smaller flows in-between. Much of the formations are the result of pillow basalt formations created when a hot basalt flow rapidly cooled upon meeting the salt water of the ocean. These deposits offshore were then pushed into the continental plate as a forearc basin rotating slowly over millions of years. This tectonic collision forced the basalt formations (and newer sedimentary rock formations that include marine terrace deposits) upward and created the coastal range. Additional basalt flows originated from Eastern Oregon and added to the layers that were uplifted, as the newer Cascade Mountains had not yet been formed. By the Early Oligocene period c. 30 million years ago the current coastline was in place and erosion has continued to shape the range. primarily through rivers cutting deep valleys through the igneous and sedimentary rocks. The geologic boundaries of the coast range formation extend from southwest Washington state in the north to around the Coquille River in the south where the older and taller Klamath Mountains begin. In the east the mountains begin as foothills forming the western edge of the Willamette Valley and continue west to the coastline and beyond where the basalt formation tapers off into the continental shelf and ends at the continental slope with several banks and basins off shore. Physiographically, they are a section of the larger Pacific Border province, which in turn are part of the larger Pacific Mountain System physiographic division. Climate Snow on South Saddle Mountain A mild maritime climate prevails throughout the range with temperature and precipitation varying due to elevation and distance from the coastline. Characteristic of the climate include cool dry summers followed by mild and wet winters. The majority of precipitation accumulates in the form of rain, with snow during the winter months at the higher elevations, but no permanent snow pack. Annual precipitation differs from in some parts to up to , with the higher amounts coming in the higher elevations. The average high temperature in January is , and the average high in July is with temperatures also varying by elevation. The further inland and the more southerly portions have a more Mediterranean climate that is more similar to the climate of the Willamette Valley. The Coast Range creates a rain shadow effect by forcing moisture laden clouds to rise by expelling moisture.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: orographic precipitation This shields the Willamette Valley and causes a less maritime climate with hotter summers and less precipitation than the Oregon Coast.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Oregon climate Sections Road through the Northern section showing the mix of deciduous and coniferous trees The Oregon Coast Range is divided into three separate sections: North, Central, and South. In the south is the oldest portion of the range with formation beginning in the Paleocene era with the Roseburg volcanics, while the newest section is the northernmost portion formed first with the Siletz River Volcanics. The Central and Northern sections contain more sedimentary rocks from the mud, silt, sand, and other volcanic debris than the lower Southern section. Also, the Oregon Coast Range is home to over 50 mammal species, over 100 species of birds, and nearly 30 reptile or amphibian species that spent significant portions of their life cycle in the mountains.Northwest Forest Plan: Wildlife Habitat Relationships for the Coast Guide.

He also did New England Patriots preseason games, the Boston Marathon and New England Teamen soccer games. Twibell also hosted a weekly in- season Patriots show. In his three years at WBZ-TV, Twibell was voted the best play-by-play announcer in New England by the Associated Press, won a New England Emmy for play-by-play and received Syracuse University‚Äôs Phillips Award as the best nightly sportscaster. He also worked as the host of The Morning Drive with Roger Twibell with Jeff McCarragher and as host of the 610 Morning Rush with Josh Klingler on KCSP 610 Kansas City from January 4, 2008 till January 1, 2010. He was replaced by \\"Bulldog\\" Bob Fescoe, who had been on KFNS, WHB and KMBZ. Twibell attended the University of Arizona to play football and baseball, but after suffering career-ending knee injuries, he transferred to the University of Kansas where he graduated in 1972. Twibell was dressed-down by Hall of Famer George Brett in May 2009 for his lack of insight into the game of baseball despite Roger's career as a sports analyst. Brett observed that Twibell had never been approached to manage a baseball team and the reason behind this was his lack of knowledge of the game of baseball. Brett, a guest every Tuesday on Twibell's show, told Twibell he mentioned his name because he didn't want the Kansas City media to think he was singling out the rival radio network (810 sports). Brett issued an apology and later said his comments were directed towards the media on the rival sports radio station. Brett mentioned Jack Harry, Kevin Kietzman and Dave Stewart who appear on 810am, and then mentioned Twibell after a short pause. A native of Shawnee Mission, Kansas, Twibell lives with his three children Taylor, Conor, and Morgan.

Background When a domain is first registered, the customer is usually given the option of registering the domain for one year or longer, with automatic renewal as a possible option. Although some domain registrars often make multiple attempts to notify a registrant of a domain name's impending expiration, a failure on the part of the original registrant to provide the registrar with accurate contact information makes an unintended registration lapse possible. Practices also vary, and registrars are not required to notify customers of impending expiration. Unless the original registrant holds a trademark or other legal entitlement to the name, they are often left without any form of recourse in getting their domain name back. It is incumbent on registrants to be proactive in managing their name registrations and to be good stewards of their domain names. By law there are no perpetual rights to domain names after payment of registration fees lapses, aside from trademark rights granted by common law or statute. Redemption Grace Period (RGP) The Redemption Grace Period is an addition to ICANN's Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA) which allows a registrant to reclaim their domain name for a number of days after it has expired.\\"Restoring a Deleted Domain Name from the Redemption Grace Period\\" This length of time varies by TLD, and is usually around 30 to 90 days. Prior to the implementation of the RGP by ICANN, individuals could easily engage in domain sniping to extort money from the original registrant to buy their domain name back. After the period between the domain's expiry date and the beginning of the RGP, the domain's status changes to \\"redemption period\\" during which an owner may be required to pay a fee (typically around US$100) to re-activate and re-register the domain. ICANN's RAA requires registrars to delete domain registrations once a second notice has been given and the RGP has elapsed. At the end of the \\"pending delete\\" phase of 5 days, the domain will be dropped from the ICANN database. Drop Catch Services For particularly popular domain names, there are often multiple parties anticipating the expiration. Competition for expiring domain names has since become a purview of drop catching services. These services offer to dedicate their servers to securing a domain name upon its availability, usually at an auction price. Individuals with their limited resources find it difficult to compete with these drop catching firms for highly desirable domain names. Retail registrars such as GoDaddy or eNom retain names for auction through services such as TDNAM or Snapnames through a practice known as domain warehousing. Drop catch services are performed by both ICANN-accredited registrars and non-accredited registrars. Domain Futures / Options or Back-Orders Some registry operators (for example dot-–†–§, dot-PL, dot-RU, dot-ST, dot-TM, dot-NO) offer a service by which a back-order (also sometimes known as a \\"domain future\\" or \\"domain option\\") can be placed on a domain name. If a domain name is due to return to the open market, then the owner of the back-order will be given the first opportunity to acquire the domain name before the name is deleted and is open to a free-for-all. In this way back-orders will usually take precedence over drop-catch. There may be a fee for the back-order itself, often only one back-order can be placed per domain name and a further purchase or renewal fee may be applicable if the back-order succeeds. Back-Orders typically expire in the same way domain names do, so are purchased for a specific number of years. Different operators have different rules. In some cases back-orders can only be placed at certain times, for example after the domain name has expired, but before it has returned to the open market (see Redemption Grace Period). In the Commodity market sense, a back-order is often more like an \\"option\\" than a \\"future\\" as there is often no obligation for the new registrant to take the name, even after it has been handed to the owner of the back-order. For example, some registries give the new registrant 30 days to purchase a renewal on the name before it is once again returned to the open market (or any new back-order registrant).

He was an all-rounder who played for Worcestershire between 1900 and 1926. He also appeared three times for Auckland in the 1910‚Äì11 season, and was twice selected to represent the Players against the Gentlemen, in 1911 at Scarborough and in 1924 at The Oval. He scored 18,495 of his runs for Worcestershire, placing him (as of 2007) ninth on the county's all-time list, while his 815 wickets for the county are 12th on that ranking. Born in Brixton, London, Pearson made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against London County in May 1900. He opened the batting, though making little impression as he was dismissed for 7 and 2, and claimed the single wicket of Lionel Wells. He did not have much more success in three further first-class games that season, but caught the eye with match figures of 10‚Äì98 in a minor game against a touring West Indian side. Obituary, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1964. 1901 saw him make his maiden century, 108 against Leicestershire, and he finished the year with 945 first-class runs at 21.97, while with the ball he claimed 51 wickets at 31.37 including four occasions on which he took five or more wickets in an innings. Several lean years followed (indeed, in 1903 he bowled only 24 balls in total) but from 1904 until first-class cricket was interrupted by the First World War Pearson was consistent with the bat, his season's aggregates being within 200 runs either side of a thousand in each English season. His bowling was at first less productive, though he did take 8‚Äì42 against Surrey in 1907. In 1910‚Äì11, Pearson served a season as coach of the Auckland Cricket Association, and played three games for Auckland, twice taking six wickets in an innings: this included a haul of 6‚Äì10 against a Hawke's Bay side whose total of 28 included no score higher than 4 except for Extras (13). After his return to England, his domestic bowling improved: from 1911 to 1914 he took over 40 wickets each season, his tally of 51 in 1913 including a career-best 9‚Äì41, although this was in a 12-a-side match (nevertheless considered first-class) for HK Foster's XI against Cambridge University rather than being for his county. After the war, Pearson appeared only once in 1919, but played in 14 of Worcestershire's 18 County Championship matches the following summer and remained a regular part of the side from then until the end of his first-class career. In 1921 he enjoyed an excellent season with the bat, his 1,498 runs at 36.53 being much his highest aggregate and topping his county's averages. His bowling, however, was perhaps the more important factor to Worcestershire, as a weak side depended heavily on him to supplement Fred Root in the attack. From 1921 to 1925 Pearson always passed 50 wickets, and in 1923 he did the \\"double\\" by scoring 1,051 runs and taking a career-best 111 wickets, this latter achievement including ten five-wicket hauls. His final first-class match was for Worcestershire against Middlesex at Lord's in early September 1926. Only 109 overs were possible, and Worcestershire did not get to bat. However, Pearson did take 3‚Äì56. He died at the age of 83 in Droitwich, Worcestershire.

In 1988 he formed the Church of Agape located at 126 Logan Avenue South in Renton, Washington.  Background  Don Barnett was born in Clarkston, WA in 1930, but moved with his family to Tacoma, Washington, as a young boy. His father was an accountant and part-time Pentecostal minister. His mother was a teacher. After high school, Barnett attended a Bible college in Boise, Idaho, where he met his future wife, Barbara, and was also greatly influenced by the Latter Rain Movement within Pentecostalism, which was at its peak at that time. When he married and was faced with the increasing expenses of family life, he left Bible college, without graduating or being ordained, to take a job at a sawmill in Tacoma, moving his young family there with him. Later they moved to Seattle when he took a job at Boeing as a draftsman. In Seattle, he taught Bible classes at home, at work, and at three Pentecostal churches. According to Tim Brown, director of the Colossian Fellowship (an evangelical Christian group concerned with biblical orthodoxy), Barnett was dismissed from these three churches for not teaching the trinity. In the mid-1960s he began meeting with a group of families south of Seattle that became the nucleus of Community Chapel, which was formally established in 1967. It grew rapidly and by the early 1980s had over 3000 members at the main site near Burien, as well as several hundred more among 22 satellite churches across the nation.  Indecent exposure charge  In 1975, Barnett pleaded guilty to exposing himself to maids in a hallway of the Circus Circus Las Vegas. According to police reports in Clark County, Nevada, dated November 23, 1975, Barnett masturbated in front of four maids in the hallway of the Circus Circus Hotel. The initial charge of indecent exposure, a misdemeanor, was plea bargained down to \\"open and gross lewdness,\\" a charge Barnett pleaded guilty to, paying a fine of $100. The case was closed on April 30, 1976. The charge was revealed during a 1988 lawsuit when his claim that he had never pled guilty or been convicted of a crime under oath was investigated.  \\"Spiritual connections\\" controversy  In 1985, Barnett began to advocate the practice of \\"spiritual connections\\" to the members of his church. The practice involved seeking intense emotional experiences, of love, with another person, usually not one's spouse, while dancing together in worship. Following the introduction of this practice, turmoil increased in Barnett's church and many members began leaving. These troubles reached their culmination in 1988 with several lawsuits brought against Barnett and others in the church's leadership alleging sexual improprieties related to the practice of \\"connections,\\" including church policy condoning French kissing of children.Mary Rothchild, Seattle Post-Intelligencer 3/23/88 At that time, Barnett was ousted from his church by its remaining elders, leading to further protracted legal proceedings.

The side has continued to appear in minor cricket and now competes in the Hawke Cup competition. First-class history In their first match at first-class level, against Wellington at the Basin Reserve in February 1884, Hawke's Bay were dismissed for just 32 in their second innings thanks to Joseph Firth's remarkable return of 8 for 13 from 13 four-ball overs. In their next match, in 1884‚Äì85, they beat Wellington at Napier Recreation Ground by eight wickets. They lost their next three matches, all against Wellington, before trouncing Taranaki in two matches in 1891‚Äì92. In the first of these matches they dismissed Taranaki for 70 and 39 and the game was over in one day. In the second match Hawke's Bay made 128 then dismissed Taranaki for 35 and 29. Hawke's Bay's matches remained low-scoring affairs. They did not reach a total of 200 until their 17th match in 1895‚Äì96, when they made 207 against Wellington in a drawn match. Their first individual century came in 1897‚Äì98, when Hugh Lusk made 119 against Canterbury. However, low scores were the norm in New Zealand at the time: in the eight first-class matches in 1897‚Äì98, only two centuries were scored, Lusk's and one by another Hawke's Bay batsman, Jack Wolstenholme. Hawke's Bay played 53 first-class matches, for 11 wins, 35 losses and seven draws. Twenty-four of those matches were against their neighbours, Wellington; Hawke's Bay won six of these and lost 14. They lost both their Plunket Shield matches (against Canterbury in 1914‚Äì15 and Auckland in 1920‚Äì21) by an innings. Leading players Hugh Lusk made three of Hawke's Bay's five centuries. He was by far Hawke's Bay's outstanding batsman: in 28 matches he scored 1395 runs at an average of 28.46, and also took 40 wickets at 22.85, as well as captaining the side in most of his matches and representing New Zealand. The highest score for Hawke's Bay was 134 against Wellington in 1914‚Äì15 by Jack Board, the English Test player who coached in Hawke's Bay for several seasons before World War I. The best innings bowling figures were 9 for 47 by Tom Dent against Wellington in 1900‚Äì01, and the best match figures were 13 for 33 (7 for 20 and 6 for 13) by Charles Smith in the second match against Taranaki in 1891‚Äì92. Since 1920‚Äì21 Hawke's Bay has won the Hawke Cup several times. Their first victory was in 1946‚Äì47, and their most recent in 2018‚Äì19. In the 1920s Hawke's Bay played many high-profile overseas teams in non-first-class matches, including Australia, the MCC, New South Wales, Queensland and the Melbourne Cricket Club, all at Nelson Park. In 1950‚Äì51 the Central Districts cricket team began competing at first-class level in the Plunket Shield. The Hawke's Bay Cricket Association is one of Central Districts' constituent associations. Grounds Hawke's Bay played first-class matches on the following four grounds: * Recreation Ground, Napier * Farndon Park, Clive * Nelson Cricket Ground, Hastings * Nelson Park, Napier As well as Nelson Cricket Ground and Nelson Park, Hawke's Bay has also used the following grounds for Hawke Cup matches: * McLean Park, Napier * Cornwall Park, Hastings * Anderson Park, Havelock North * Forest Gate Domain, Ongaonga McLean Park has also been a regular home ground for Central Districts since 1951‚Äì52, and has been used as a Test ground since 1978‚Äì79.

Since 1973, when Fukuda-Parr worked in the Young Professionals Programme at World Bank, she has played a large role on the world stage of globalization, poverty, and economics, with interests in technology, human rights, gender, capacity development, and aid architecture. Despite the tremendous imbalance of international resource and wealth distribution, Fukuda-Parr maintains hope for positive human development. She is joint winner of the 2019 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas for Improving World Order. Education Fukuda-Parr pursued her interests in culture, international affairs, and human development at the universities of Cambridge (receiving a bachelor's degree in the social and political sciences), Sussex (receiving a master‚Äôs in economics), and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (receiving a master‚Äôs in law and diplomacy (MALD)). Career After working as a loan officer with the World Bank from 1974 to 1979, Fukuda-Parr served as a technical adviser in agricultural economics at the United Nations Development Programme from 1979 to 1985. Then, as Deputy Resident Adviser in Burundi (1985-1987), Principle Economist and Deputy Director at the Regional Bureau for Africa (1986-1991), and Chief of the West Africa Division (1992-1994), Fukuda-Parr garnered both the information and the experience to become Director of the Human Development Report Office (1995-2006). From a loan officer at World Bank to a director at the UNDP, Fukuda-Parr has been positioned throughout the world (Burundi, Morocco, and Turkey, for instance). Particularly as a director, she gained insight into the process of human development, with an emphasis on ‚Äúdemocracy, cultural diversity, and human rights.‚Äù To promote awareness of the vast inequalities separating gender, race, and class, Fukuda-Parr aided in the publication of research-based proposals and policy work on technical cooperation effectiveness and capacity building. Since leaving the UNDP, Fukuda-Parr has worked as a professor at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and The Graduate Program in International Affairs at The New School. In November 2016, Fukuda-Parr was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines, co-chaired by Ruth Dreifuss, former President of Switzerland, and Festus Mogae, former President of Botswana.Secretary-General Appoints Two Former Presidents, 14 Others as Members of High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines United Nations, press release of 19 November 2015. She also serves on the advisory board for Academics Stand Against Poverty (ASAP) and on the University of Oslo/The Lancet Independent Panel on Global Governance for Health.Members of the Panel University of Oslo/ The Lancet Independent Panel on Global Governance for Health. Writer and editor To supplement her teaching and professional experience, Fukuda-Parr has acted as both writer and editor on works pertaining to human development, poverty, and economics. In addition to her contributions to the Annual Human Development Reports, she has written and edited several works, including Rethinking Technical Cooperation: Reforms for Capacity Building in Africa, Capacity for Development: New Solutions to Old Problems and The Gene Revolution: GM Crops and Unequal Development. She also has participated in several journal projects and written book chapters concerning capacity development and human rights. As an editor, she founded the Journal of Human Development (2000, annually), co-edited Readings in Human Development: Concepts, Measures and Policies for a Development Paradigm, and has held a position on the Feminist Economics editorial board. In her writings, such as those for the Belfer Center, she highlights a lack of social parity on an international scale. Inequalities, according to Fukuda-Parr, exist in education, resource distribution, gender rights, and income. Despite such inequalities, however, Fukuda-Parr remains positive about social and economic change. Her role in the Millennium Development Goals, among other initiatives, is making a difference in the wars on poverty and inequality. Toward this end, she will continue to fight for an outcome that embodies true human rights on every level. In The Adventure of Peace, Fukuda-Parr‚Äôs chapter, \\"Poverty and Inequality ‚Äì Challenges in the Era of Globalisation,\\" describes the central challenge intrinsically dividing society: the direction of globalization. As a synopsis of her works and her beliefs, Fukuda-Parr urges nations to redirect globalization so that it benefits all countries and all peoples, to promote democratization as a force for greater social justice and to address poverty as part of the agenda for collective security. Critical issues (such as HIV/AIDS, migration, links between development and conflict, cultural diversity, and global governance) can be more appropriately tackled with global solidarity and an ‚Äúinclusive form‚Äù of globalization. Personal life Fukuda-Parr was born in Tokyo, Japan. She gained a global perspective by moving from Tokyo to London to Washington, D.C. and, finally, to Manila because of her father‚Äôs position with the Japanese Treasury. She is married to Francis Parr and is the mother of two children, Nicholas and Henry. She currently resides in the upper west side of Manhattan.

In a remarkable final, he wrestled for nine hours against the other finalist, the Swedish wrestler Anders Ahlgren, before it was declared a draw.

He is regarded by many as the architect of the modern church. Early life Peter was born in the city of Mosul in 1798 into a well known Christian family and spent his childhood at the Monastery of Mor Hananyo, where he would later become a monk and also be ordained as a priest. In 1846, Peter was ordained metropolitan bishop of Damascus by the Patriarch Ignatius Elias II and adopted the name Julius. Metropolitan Bishop As metropolitan, Peter engaged and succeeded in a dispute with the Syriac Catholic Church over ownership of various ancient churches and monasteries within his diocese and as a result recovered many for the Syriac Orthodox Church. At the time of Ignatius Jacob II's death, in 1871, Peter was staying in Constantinople and could not travel to Mardin for the patriarchal election. However, the synod unanimously elected him as patriarch. At first he declined the position, but under continuous persuasion Peter was consecrated Patriarch on 16 June 1872 at the Monastery of Mor Hananyo, upon which he assumed the Patriarchal name Ignatius. Patriarch of Antioch Soon after he became patriarch, Peter renovated the Monastery of Mor Hananyo and ordained Rabban Abded Sattuf as Metropolitan of Jerusalem under the name Gregorius. In 1873, he moved to Constantinople where he was recognised by the Ottoman government as the official Syriac Orthodox Patriarch and received the appropriate rights. Church in India Whilst staying at Constantinople, the Patriarch received a letter from Pulikottil Mor Dionysius and Edavazikkal Philipose Corepiscopos seeking help resolving problems caused by the Metropolitan Athanasius, who had already been suspended by both Ignatius Elias II and Ignatius Jacob II for carrying out an Anglican reformation of the Malankara Syrian Church. After consulting with various metropolitans, the Patriarch and metropolitan Mor Gregorius Abded Sattuf of Jerusalem left Constantinople on 24 August 1874 for Britain to discuss the issue with the British government. Arriving in September, they met with the British government officials and appealed to the Marquess of Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India at the time. Peter was at first received with hostility from Archibald Campbell Tait, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had received word from Protestant bishops in India that Athanasius deserved the support of the Church of England. However, the Patriarch impressed the British public with his knowledge of the Bible and as a result held audience with Queen Victoria and the British Government asked the governor of Madras Presidency to consider his cause. Also, whilst staying in Britain, Peter arranged for a printing press to be sent to the Monastery of Mor Hananyo. In April 1875, the Patriarch and the metropolitan sailed to India via Egypt and reached Bombay in May. They met Pulikottil Mor Dionysius in June at the city of Pune and travelled from there to Madras to meet the governor to convince him of their cause. After meeting with the governor, he agreed to help him and the Patriarch soon left for Malabar again. In March 1876, the Kingdom of Travancore revoked state sponsorship of the CMS and a decree was issued disavowing the state's right to interfere in the affairs of the church. In July, the Patriarch convened the first Mulanthuruthy Synod which made many organisational and administrative decisions. The major arrangements were: * Formation of 'Malankara Syrian Christian Association Committee' a representative body for the Malankara Syrian Church and consisting of 24 elected members thus introducing a democratic set up of administration. * Division of Malankara Church into six archdioceses and ordination of a metropolitan for each archdiocese. Return to Syria In May 1877, the Patriarch left India and visited the churches of Egypt before arriving in Jerusalem and travelled to Constantinople where he established a new church in the name of the Virgin Mary. He later returned to the Monastery of Mor Hananyo where he would reside for his remaining years. The Patriarch died on 8 October 1894 whilst at Mardin and was buried at Beth Qadishe.

Family history in professional wrestling The Rougeau family first got involved in professional wrestling when Eddie Auger began wrestling around 1946. Auger worked under a number of different names: Ed Auger, Eddie Auger, Henri LaSalle and Pierre LaSalle. Together with Jack O'Brien he held the Georgia version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship and alongside Maurice Vachon he held the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship, both in the 1950s. Auger's nephew through marriage, Jean Rougeau, became a professional wrestler under the ring name \\"Johnny Rougeau\\" in 1951. Johnny Rougeau wrestled primarily in Canada. Jean Rougeau was soon joined by his brother Jacques Rougeau who turned pro in 1956. Jacques' three sons followed in his footsteps, Raymond Rougeau in 1971, Jacques Rougeau Jr. in 1977 and Armand Rougeau in 1982. Armand retired in 1987 due to injuries. Jacques Jr. and Raymond competed as a tag team in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1986 until 1990 as the Fabulous Rougeau Brothers. Raymond Rougeau retired in 1990 and became a host for French-produced WWF programming. Ray Rougeau would also be often used as interviewer for the WWF wrestlers through the mid-90s. Jacques was planning retiring as well during the mid-1990s, as his partner from The Quebecers tag- team Pierre turned on him at a house show held on the Montreal Forum. During this house show as well, Ray Rougeau would leave the broadcasting team and run to the ring to save his brother. This angle led to Rougeau's first retirement match, which, over the next few months, was heavily promoted on WWF TV shows broadcast in the Montreal area, as well as in the local media. The match, which was held on October 21, 1994, drew a sell-out crowd of 16,843 to the Montreal Forum, and resulted in a victory for Rougeau, when he pinned Ouellet following a seated tombstone piledriver. Rougeau, who was accompanied by Raymond, used Queen's song \\"We Are the Champions\\" as his theme music for the night. Ray Rougeau came out of retirement in August 8, 1996, to face Owen Hart in a boxing match at the Montreal Molson Centre during a WWF house show despite not being active as a competitor for years, but a successful wrestler on the Montreal area. Jacques' daughter Joanne promoted wrestling shows in Canada and is a bodybuilder. She was once a marketing specialist for the World Wrestling Federation. She was married to wrestler Denis Gauthier, Sr. They have a son, Denis Jr., who plays for the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League. Remarried in 1989 has three more children, a son Shane and twin daughters who became Canadian Blackbelts in TKD in 2005. There is also a second daughter, Diane, who lives in Florida. In 2018, Jacques Rougeau, Jr. announced that he would retire for a third time, and that he had closed his wrestling school. On August 18, 2018, Rougeau teamed with his sons for the first and only time, mirroring his father's retirement match. As Rougeau's sons have no interest in pursuing professional wrestling, this is likely the final chapter in the history of the Rougeau wrestling family.

The list does not include creatures; for these, see List of Philippine mythological creatures.  Overview  The mythological figures, including deities (anitos and diwatas), heroes, and other important figures, in Anitism vary among the many ethnic groups in the Philippines. Each ethnic group has their own distinct pantheon of deities. Some deities of ethnic groups have similar names or associations, but remain distinct from one another.Jocano, F. L. (1969). Philippine Mythology. Quezon City: Capitol Publishing House Inc. The diversity in these important figures is exhibited in many cases, of which a prime example is the Ifugao pantheon, where in a single pantheon, deities alone are calculated to number at least 1,500. There are over a hundred distinct pantheons in the Philippines.Barton, R. F. (1946). The Religion of the Ifugaos, Volumes 65‚Äì68. American Anthropological Assn. Some ethnic groups have pantheons ruled by a supreme deity (or deities), while others revere ancestor spirits and/or the spirits of the natural world, where there is a chief deity but consider no deity supreme among their divinities.Zaide, S. M. (1999). The Philippines: A Unique Nation. All-Nations Publishing. Each ethnic group has their own general term used to refer to all deities or a sub-set of deities, of which the most widespread term among the ethnic groups in the country is anito.Guillermo, A. R. (2012). Historical Dictionary of the Philippines. Scarecrow Press. The term itself can be further divided into ninuno (ancestral spirits) and diwata (gods, goddesses, and deities), although in many cases, the meaning of the terms differ depending on their ethnic association.Scott, W. H. (1994). Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.Hislop, S. K. (1971).

The following figures continue to exist and prevail among the collective memory and culture of Filipinos today, especially among adherents to the native and sacred Filipino religions, despite centuries of persecution beginning with the introduction of non-native and colonial Abrahamic religions which sought to abolish all native faiths in the archipelago beginning in the late 14th century, and intensified during the middle of the 16th century to the late 20th century. This contact between native and foreign faiths later accumulated more stories, which also became part of both faiths, with some alterations. Deity, spirit, and hero figures continue to be viewed as important and existing among native faiths and the general Filipino culture. These perceptions of existence towards gods, goddesses, deities, and spirits in the sacred native Filipino religions, is the same way how Christians perceive the existence of their god they refer as God and the same way Muslims perceive the existence of their god they refer as Allah.Demetrio, F.

Instead, he focuses on examples of comic book scenes that can be used to understand the diverse laws of physics from an unusual angle, such as Gwen Stacy's death and Ant-Man's ability to punch his way out of a paper bag.

In addition to these minor difference in size, the species displays marked sexual dimorphism with males displaying larger ventral fins marked with egg spots, light-blue edging to the dorsal and ventral fins, along with metallic blue colouration of the head, and yellow to red flanks. In contrast, females are silver-to-brown and display three black spots along their sides. Juveniles are monomorphic and are coloured like the adult females. Some intraspecific variation has been recorded with regard to colouration, these differently coloured forms are geographically restricted to certain localities in Lake Malawi. Distribution and habitat C. borleyi is widespread in Lake Malawi, occurring along the coasts of Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. The species is limited to littoral zones with large rocks and boulders. The water in which species is found is warm (24 ‚Äì 29 ¬∞C,75 ‚Äì 84 ¬∞F), hard and alkaline; typical of the water chemistry of Lake Malawi. Diet The species feeds primarily on zooplankton, by means of specialized, suction feeding action and highly protrudable mouth.Fryer, G, Iles TD (1972) The cichlid fishes of the Great Lakes of Africa. Oliver & Boyd, Edinburgh; TFH Publications, New Jersey Taxonomy The species was described in 1960 by Thomas Derrick Iles as Haplochromis borleyi, and was later moved to Copadichromis by David Eccles and Ethylwynn Trewavas.Eccles DH, Trewavas E (1989) Malawian cichlid fishes.

They have one EP and one full-length, and have appeared on multiple compilations. Their lyrics and musicianship display a depth much like that found in math rock. Band history Colossal was formed in Elgin, Illinois, in late 2001 by friends Jeff Feucht (bass), Jason Flaks (trumpet, guitar, vocals), Rob Kellenberger (drums, backup vocals), and Pat Ford (vocals, guitar). They began playing shows in spring of 2002 in and around Chicago, Illinois. Asian Man Records released their debut, a self-titled, six- song EP (also known as \\"Brave the Elements\\"), in January 2003. The band‚Äôs genre-crossing ways were already evident on the EP, as the songs fuse elements of punk, jazz, and jangly pop with a focused singularity. The sound is intricate and dense but still accessible and unified. The EP received universal critical acclaim and attendance at shows steadily increased. The band's first tour, of eastern Canada and the East Coast, was that summer. The following months were spent writing what would become their first full-length. In early 2004, Feucht left the band to dedicate more time to his teaching career. He was replaced by Eli Caterer (of Smoking Popes), who finished writing and recording the new album. Welcome the Problems, the debut full- length, was released on Asian Man in September 2004 on the heels of a western U.S. tour. Musically, the full-length is the logical next step from the EP; the songs are more concise in their arrangements and the sounds are more developed and cohesive. Critical reaction to the album was overwhelmingly complimentary, and the band‚Äôs following continued to expand at a rapid pace. After the album‚Äôs release, Neil Hennessy (of The Lawrence Arms), who‚Äôd been sitting in as a second drummer since the first Colossal tour, joined the band, as did Chris Perrin, who replaced Caterer on bass. A brief east coast tour with the new lineup followed the release of Problems. The vinyl version of the album was released by Grey Flight Records in January 2005. Also in January, Jason, Pat, and Rob assisted Asian Man Records/Plea for Peace Foundation founder Mike Park in the writing and recording of his second album, North Hangook Falling, which was co-released by Sub City Records & Asian Man Records in July 2005. In 2005, the band did a western and Midwestern tour with Mike Park, an eastern jaunt with Alkaline Trio, and a small tours of the Midwest and eastern Canada. Flaks left the band in fall 2005 and was replaced on guitar by the returning Eli Caterer. In December 2006, Caterer's band, Smoking Popes, announced their reunion, with Colossal drummer Kellenberger taking over on drums. Kellenberger left the Popes, and Caterer again left Colossal, this time to concentrate on the Popes. The band went on hiatus in 2007. Flaks, Ford, Hennessy, and Kellenberger reunited to play a single show for Asian Man Records' 20th Anniversary in San Francisco in July 2016. A split 7\\" with Owen was released by Asian Man in September 2016 featuring the first new Colossal material in 11 years. A remastered Colossal EP was issued on vinyl by Count Your Lucky Stars Records and Topshelf Records in 2017. Welcome the Problems was remastered and reissued on vinyl by Asian Man in 2018.

Kress of the National Audubon Society to learn how to restore puffins to historic nesting islands in the Gulf of Maine. It was started in 1973 when puffins were nesting in only two locations in Maine ‚Äî Matinicus Rock and Machias Seal Island. The project began with an attempt to restore puffins to Eastern Egg Rock Island in Muscongus Bay, about away from Pemaquid Point. The restoration efforts are based on the fact that young puffins usually return to breed on the same island where they hatched. Young puffins from Great Island were transplanted to Eastern Egg Rock when they were about 10-14 days old. The young puffins were then nested in artificial sod burrows for about one month. Audubon biologists placed handfuls of vitamin- fortified fish in their burrows each day. As the young puffins reached fledging age, they received identification tags so they could be recognized in the future. After spending their first 2-3 years at sea, it was hoped they would return to establish a new colony at Eastern Egg Rock rather than Great Island. Between 1973 and 1986, 954 young puffins were transplanted from Great Island to Eastern Egg Rock and 914 of these successfully fledged. Transplanted puffins began returning to Eastern Egg Rock in June 1977. To lure them ashore and encourage the birds to explore their home, wooden puffin decoys were positioned atop large boulders. The number of young puffins has gradually increased. In 1981, four pairs nested beneath boulders at the edge of the island and the colony had increased to 37 pairs in 2001. The total population reached 188 pairs in 2019. Project Puffin Visitor Center In 2006 the National Audubon Society opened the Project Puffin Visitor Center in Rockland, Maine. The Center features a live video display of puffins and other seabirds from Seal Island National Wildlife Refuge. Exhibits also include natural history displays, the seabird conservation work done by the Audubon Society and its partners, and a film about Project Puffin. There is also an art gallery and a gift shop.

It was founded in 1850, and is named after Ignace Bourget, bishop of Montreal from 1840 until 1876. Despite its former religious involvements, the students are no longer obliged to practice Catholicism or any other religions, although it appears that a good amount of the school members are catholic. Bourget has about 1100 day students, and some 250 boarders, including a few foreign students such as South Africans, South and Central Americans, notably Mexicans. The principal is Philippe Bertrand. The sports elites of Bourget are named The Voltigeurs. The students that attend this school also are required to wear uniforms that include pants, a skirt, 2 blouses and 2 polos. They have now recently added ipads to their system. Transportation Perhaps more than 90% of Bourget's students come from outside the small town of Rigaud. Therefore, more than 20 school buses travel on the road across nearby areas in order to bring students into school every morning and back home in the afternoon. On Friday afternoons, a few extra bus drivers have to go across Southern Quebec and South-Eastern Ontario to bring boarding students home, and pick them up once again on Sunday nights/Monday mornings and bring them back in school. School grounds The Main Building: This is the largest building of the school, and the most important since it contains most of the major offices. It shares with other buildings the infirmary and the cafeteria. This is also where classes and most activities for primary and secondary 1, 2 and 3 students are held. Secondary 1 and 2 boarding girls once resided in a large dormitory on the 4th floor of this building, which has since been relocated to the Querbes building and the 4th floor converted to classroom space. The Querbes Building: This is the building dedicated to the classrooms of secondary 4 and 5 students‚Äîthe seniors. The building additionally houses boarding students on its upper floors. The Sports Building: College Bourget is known for its sports activities. It has three gymnasia, an ice-skating arena, a fully equipped physical training room,a climbing wall and a semi-Olympic-size pool. The campus also features the following outdoor facilities: baseball fields, recreation yards, a football field, two soccer field and two tennis courts.

Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981), was a United States Supreme Court case that upheld the right of the executive branch to revoke a citizen's passport for reasons of national security and the foreign policy interests of the U.S. under the Passport Act of 1926. The case involved Congressional delegation of authority over control of passports and the right to international travel. Philip Agee was an ex-Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer living overseas who in 1974 declared a \\"campaign to fight the U.S. CIA wherever it is operating\\" and revealed the identities of several CIA officers resulting in violence against them. The Secretary of State revoked Agee's passport in 1979. Agee sued, alleging the secretary had no such authority, had denied him procedural due process rights, his substantive due process \\"liberty\\" right to travel under the Fifth Amendment, and had violated his First Amendment right to criticize government policies. The district court found the Secretary lacked the power to revoke the passport and the court of appeals affirmed that decision. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, holding that the broad discretion accorded the executive branch in matters of national security and foreign policy requires that the Passport Act of 1926 (currently codified at et seq.) should be interpreted as granting the power to revoke a passport when necessary for national security. Facts of the case Philip Agee, an American citizen, was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency from 1957 to 1968, holding key positions in the division of the Agency responsible for covert intelligence gathering in foreign countries. In 1974, Agee announced in London that he was launching a \\"campaign to fight the United States CIA wherever it is operating\\" and intended \\"to expose CIA officers and agents and to take the measures necessary to drive them out of the countries where they are operating.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/us/excerpts-from-court- opinions-on-revocation-of-passport-on-security-grounds.html Agee and his collaborators repeatedly and publicly identified individuals and organizations in foreign countries as undercover CIA agents, employees, or sources. They divulged classified information, violated Agee's express contract not to make any public statements about Agency matters without prior clearance by the Agency, and prejudiced the ability of the United States to obtain intelligence. They were followed by episodes of violence against the persons and organizations identified.https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/us/excerpts- from-court-opinions-on-revocation-of-passport-on-security-grounds.html In December 1979, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance revoked Agee's passport and delivered an explanatory notice to Agee in West Germany, where he was living. It advised Agee that his activities abroad were causing or were likely to cause serious damage to the national security or the foreign policy of the United States and that he had a right to an administrative hearing. It offered to hold such a hearing in West Germany on 5 days' notice. Agee at once filed suit against the Secretary. He alleged that the regulation invoked by the Secretary, 22 CFR 51.70 (b)(4)(1980), was not authorized by Congress and was invalid; that the regulation was impermissibly overbroad; that revocation prior to a hearing violated his Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process; and that the revocation violated a Fifth Amendment liberty interest in a right to travel and a First Amendment right to criticize Government policies. He sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and he moved for summary judgment on the question of the authority to promulgate the regulation and on the constitutional claims. For purposes of that motion, Agee conceded that his activities were causing or were likely to cause serious damage to the national security or foreign policy of the United States. The District Court held that the regulation exceeded the statutory powers of the Secretary under the Passport Act of 1926, 22 U.S.C. 211a, granted summary judgment for Agee, and ordered the Secretary to restore his passport.Agee v. Vance, 483 F. Supp. 729 (DC 1980). A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court.Agee v. Muskie, 203 U.S. App. D.C. 46, 629 F.2d 80 (1980). It held that the Secretary was required to show that Congress had authorized the regulation either by an express delegation or by implied approval of a \\"substantial and consistent\\" administrative practice, citing Zemel v. Rusk (1965). The court found no express statutory authority for the revocation. The Court of Appeals took note of the Secretary's reliance on \\"a series of statutes, regulations, proclamations, orders and advisory opinions dating back to 1856,\\" but declined to consider those authorities, reasoning that \\"the criterion for establishing congressional assent by inaction is the actual imposition of sanctions and not the mere assertion of power.\\" The Court of Appeals held that it was not sufficient that \\"Agee's conduct may be considered by some to border on treason,\\" since \\"[w]e are bound by the law as we find it.\\" The court also regarded it as material that most of the Secretary's authorities dealt with powers of the Executive Branch \\"during time of war or national emergency\\" or with respect to persons \\"engaged in criminal conduct.\\" The Court granted certiorari in the case, then called Muskie v. Agee, and stayed the judgment of the Court of Appeals until its disposition of the case. Majority opinion The Court began by examining the language of the statute, concluding that although the Passport Act did not in so many words confer upon the Secretary a power to revoke or to deny passport applications, it was beyond dispute that the Secretary had the power to deny a passport for reasons not specified in the statutes. A consistent administrative construction of the 1926 Act must be followed by the courts \\"\`unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong.'\\" Matters intimately related to foreign policy and national security were rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention particularly in light of the \\"broad rule-making authority granted in the 1926 Act,\\" citing Zemel. It then surveyed passport law and administrative policy and practice from 1835 to 1966, concluding that the history of passport controls since the earliest days of the Republic showed congressional recognition of Executive authority to withhold passports on the basis of substantial reasons of national security and foreign policy. It compared Congressional action and inaction concerning the broad rule-making authority granted in earlier Acts, concluding that there was \\"weighty\\" evidence of congressional approval of the Secretary's interpretation that it had been delegated the power to restrict passports on the basis of national security. The Court rejected Agee's argument that the only way the Executive could establish implicit congressional approval is by proof of longstanding and consistent enforcement of the claimed power. It distinguished Kent noting that although there had been few situations involving substantial likelihood of serious damage to the national security or foreign policy of the United States as a result of a passport holder's activities abroad, that in the cases which had arisen, the Secretary had consistently exercised his power to withhold passports. And it rejected Agee's contention that the statements of Executive policy are entitled to diminished weight because many of them concern the powers of the Executive in wartime. It held incorrect the notion that \\"illegal conduct\\" and problems of allegiance were, \\"so far as relevant here, ... the only [grounds] which it could fairly be argued were adopted by Congress in light of prior administrative practice,\\" Kent at 127-128, was not correct because Kent also recognized that the legitimacy of the objective of safeguarding our national security was \\"obvious and unarguable.\\" id at 509 and that the protection accorded beliefs standing alone is very different from the protection accorded conduct. Thus, it held that the policy announced in the challenged regulations is \\"sufficiently substantial and consistent\\" to compel the conclusion that Congress has approved it. Regarding Agee's Constitutional attacks, the Court held that they, too, were without merit. The revocation of his passport did not impermissibly burdens his freedom to travel because the freedom to travel abroad with a \\"letter of introduction\\" in the form of a passport issued by the sovereign is subordinate to national security and foreign policy considerations; as such, it is subject to reasonable governmental regulation. The action was not intended to penalize his exercise of free speech and deter his criticism of Government policies and practices because assuming, arguendo, that First Amendment protections reach beyond our national boundaries, revocation of Agee's passport rested in part on the content of his speech. To the extent the revocation of his passport operates to inhibit Agee, \\"it is an inhibition of action,\\" rather than of speech. And that failure to accord him a prerevocation hearing did not violate his Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process because when there is a substantial likelihood of \\"serious damage\\" to national security or foreign policy as a result of a passport holder's activities in foreign countries, the Government may take action to ensure that the holder may not exploit the sponsorship of his travels by the United States. The Court found that the right to hold a passport is subordinate to national security and foreign policy considerations, and is subject to reasonable governmental regulation. Denial of Agee's passport was not protected under the First Amendment because unlike Kent v. Dulles and Aptheker v. Secretary of State involving denials of passports solely on the basis of political beliefs entitled to First Amendment protection, Agee's actions amounted to more than speech and that the national security interests here, as in Zemel v. Rusk, were sufficiently important to justify revocation. Finally, the Court held that the Government was not required to hold a pre-revocation hearing, since where there was a substantial likelihood of \\"serious damage\\" to national security or foreign policy as the result of a passport holder's activities abroad, the Government may take action to ensure that the holder may not exploit the United States' sponsorship of his travels. Further, a statement of reasons and an opportunity for a prompt post-revocation hearing were sufficient to satisfy the Constitution's due process guarantees. Concurrence Blackmun concurred, stating simply that he believed this case had cut back somewhat on the standards articulated in Zemel v. Rusk and Kent v. Dulles sub silencio and that it would have been better if the Court had forthrightly construed the law such that evidence of a longstanding Executive policy or construction in this area be probative of the issue of congressional authorization. Dissent Justice Brennan wrote a dissent that Justice Marshall joined. He found that the decision strayed from the precedent set by Zemel and Kent because neither Zemel nor Kent held that a longstanding Executive policy or construction was sufficient proof that Congress had implicitly authorized the Secretary's action. Those cases held that an administrative practice must be demonstrated; Kent unequivocally stated that mere construction by the Executive - no matter how longstanding and consistent - was not sufficient. Only when Congress had maintained its silence in the face of a consistent and substantial pattern of actual passport denials or revocations - where the parties will presumably object loudly, perhaps through legal action, to the Secretary's exercise of discretion - can this Court be sure that Congress is aware of the Secretary's actions and has implicitly approved that exercise of discretion. The decision also relied on the very Executive construction and policy deemed irrelevant in Kent. The Court's reliance on material expressly abjured in Kent was understandable only when considering the paucity of recorded administrative practice - the only evidence upon which Kent and Zemel permit reliance - with respect to passport denials or revocations based on foreign policy or national security considerations relating to an individual. Only three occasions were cited over the past 33 years when the Secretary revoked passports for such reasons. Finally, just as the Constitution protected both popular and unpopular speech, it likewise protected both popular and unpopular travelers. The decision applied not only to Philip Agee, whose activities could be perceived as harming the national security, but also to other citizens who may merely disagree with Government foreign policy and express their views. The Justices feared that the majority decision handed too much lawmaking function over the government when the Constitution allocated it to the Congress. The point that Kent and Zemel made, and the majority opinion should make, is that the Executive's authority to revoke passports touched an area fraught with important constitutional rights, and that the Court should therefore \\"construe narrowly all delegated powers that curtail or dilute them.\\" Kent v. Dulles at 129 The presumption should be that Congress must expressly delegate authority to the Secretary to deny or revoke passports for foreign policy or national security reasons before he may exercise such authority and to overcome the presumption against an implied delegation, the Government must show \\"an administrative practice sufficiently substantial and consistent.\\" Zemel v. Rusk, at 12.

It has been operating since June 1999, providing a news bulletin service for UK commercial radio stations operators across the UK and for a number of English-speaking radio stations across the world.  Bulletin service  Sky News Radio launched in June 1999 originally providing bespoke bulletins for Talk Radio UK. The service subsequently expanded in October 2001 to provide hourly news bulletins, audio and scripts for clients including UTV Radio, GMG Radio, Global Radio and DNN. The radio newsroom operated from Sky News' purpose-built studios at Osterley, London. Adverts following peak-time news bulletins were sold via UBC Media and reached more than 80 radio stations. On 15 October 2008, Independent Radio News (IRN) announced it was switching its main supplier of news from ITN to Sky News Radio, expanding its customer client list by more than 280 stations and giving it a near-monopoly in UK commercial radio news provision. The new IRN service began at 2pm on Tuesday 3 March 2009, with the first bulletin read by Ursula Hansford and simulcast on Sky News television. Bulletin duration was reduced from three minutes to two minutes, and the previous IRN 90 overnight and weekend bulletin service was dropped.http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=43094 Audio cuts are distributed to stations via FTP from the IRN website. Stations can also source their own audio cuts from Sky News and Sky Sports News television. Post- bulletin Newslink adverts are managed by Global Radio. IRN operates two audio channels on the Sirius satellite: IRN1 transmits the hourly news bulletins and live sports reports. IRN2 transmits press conferences and live events. IRN1 is also broadcast on an audio channel on the Astra 2B satellite. In the event of a major news story (e.g. royal death or major terrorist incident), audio from Sky News television will be relayed on IRN1 and IRN2 with extended radio bulletins broadcast on the hour and additional two-minute bulletins on the half-hour. IRN supplies match reports from every Premier League match, with reporters supplied by sports radio agency World Sports Communications. A classified football results check is broadcast every Saturday at 1705. Many community, student and hospital radio stations around the UK take the hourly bulletin service. Copy and audio cuts are also used by BFBS Radio, in addition to radio stations in the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Cyprus, UAE, South Africa and Australia.  Proposed radio station  In 2001, BSkyB proposed to become a partner in DAB news station DNN. This deal fell through, although Sky News Radio did become the main national news supplier to DNN. The station closed in July 2006, and was replaced on the MXR multiplexes by London speech station LBC 97.3. In March 2007, BSkyB and Chrysalis Radio announced a new joint partnership to launch a dedicated Sky News Radio station on the proposed bid by Channel 4's 4 Digital Group for the second UK DAB multiplex. Chrysalis's existing London rolling news station, LBC News 1152, was to be re-branded \\"Sky News Radio for London\\". A large amount of programming was planned to be shared with the national DAB service.

Day, 370 U.S. 478 (1962), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court which held that magazines consisting largely of photographs of nude or near-nude male models are not obscene within the meaning of . It was the first case in which the Court engaged in plenary review of a Post Office Department order holding obscene matter \\"nonmailable.\\"MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 495-496. The case is notable for its ruling that photographs of nude men are not obscene, an implication which opened the U.S. mail to nude male pornographic magazines, especially those catering to gay men.Waugh, Hard to Imagine: Gay Male Eroticism in Photography and Film from Their Beginnings to Stonewall, 1996. Background In the 1950s, Herman Lynn Womack of Washington, D.C., published three beefcake magazines, MANual, Trim and Grecian Guild Pictorial. Although the magazines were aimed at gay men, the content did not explicitly mention homosexuality. Beginning in 1959, Womack began to publish softcore photographs showing fully nude men. On March 25, 1960, six parcels containing 405 copies of the three magazines were seized by the postmaster in Alexandria, Virginia. After an evidentiary hearing, the Judicial Officer of the Post Office Department found that the magazines (1) were composed primarily, if not exclusively, for homosexuals and had no literary, scientific or other merit; (2) would appeal to the \\"prurient interest\\" of \\"sexual deviates\\" but would not have any interest for sexually normal individuals; (3) are read almost entirely by homosexuals, and possibly a few adolescent males; and (4) would not ordinarily be bought by normal male adults. The Judicial Officer concluded the magazines were obscene and therefore \\"nonmailable.\\" Womack sued in federal district court for injunctive relief. However, the government moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and sustained the administrative ruling. Womack appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On February 13, 1961, the court of appeals affirmed the district court's ruling. Womack appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari on October 9, 1961.. Decision The MANual Enterprises Court was significantly divided. Since the 1957 decision in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957), the Court had struggled to define and refine its approach to obscenity. The widely divergent opinions in MANual Enterprises may reflect those divisions. The majority opinion was written by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, and joined by Justice Potter Stewart. Justice Hugo Black, who took an absolutist approach to First Amendment jurisprudence, concurred in the result but did not join the opinion. Justice Black did not issue an opinion of his own. Justice William Brennan, joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William O. Douglas, concurred but would have decided the case on much narrower technical rather than First Amendment grounds. Only Justice Tom C. Clark dissented, stating \\"Since in my view the Postmaster General is required by ¬ß 1461 to reject nonmailable matter, I would affirm the judgment on the sole ground that the magazines contain information as to where obscene material can be obtained and thus are nonmailable.\\" Majority opinion Writing for the majority, Justice Harlan crafted a revision of the Court's view of what constituted obscenity. Both lower courts had argued that the intended audience of the magazines (homosexuals) rendered the material obscene. Harlan focused on whether the materials were \\"so offensive on their face as to affront current community standards of decency ‚Äî a quality that we shall hereafter refer to as 'patent offensiveness' or 'indecency.' \\"MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 482. If the materials lacked that quality, Harlan reasoned that the Court need not consider the question of \\"audience.\\" Reaching back to the Hicklin test, Harlan argued that for materials to be obscene requires two distinct elements: patent offensiveness and an appeal to prurient interest. Therefore, Harlan concluded, \\"The Court of Appeals was mistaken in considering that Roth made 'prurient interest' appeal the sole test of obscenity.\\"MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 486. Harlan then approached the Roth standard which required a determination of the relevant \\"community.\\" Harland concluded that since the law in question dealt with the national mail, the relevant community was national.MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 488. But Harlan struggled to define \\"prurient appeal.\\" In the end, Harlan merely asserted that the materials were constitutionally protected. \\"[We] need go no further in the present case than to hold that the magazines in question, taken as a whole, cannot, under any permissible constitutional standard, be deemed to be beyond the pale of contemporary notions of rudimentary decency.\\"MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 489. In part, Harlan reached this conclusion because the majority believed that the government had overemphasized parts of the materials without taking them as a whole (a significant part of the Roth test). But more importantly, the majority found that portrayal of the male nude (and, implicitly, portrayal of the homosexual male nude) \\"cannot fairly be regarded as more objectionable than many portrayals of the female nude that society tolerates.\\"MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 490. Anticipating a series of cases yet to come,, , and . See Barron and Dienes, First Amendment Law, 1993, p. 88-89. Harlan addressed whether the materials had been rendered obscene by the way in which they were advertised. Section 1461 said that advertising could render materials obscene, and Chief Justice Earl Warren (concurring in Roth) had agreed on constitutional grounds. But Harlan, writing for the majority, concluded that the government had not argued that the advertising made the materials obscene. Section 1461, Harlan noted, did not require scienter, and to impose the requirement that publisher investigate every advertiser in their pages would impose an unconstitutional chilling effect on free speech. Subsequently, the majority reversed. Concurrence Justice Brennan concurred in the result. Brennan's concurrence turned on narrow technical grounds, however. Brennan noted that the Post Office Department General Counsel had initially refused to even hold a formal hearing, wishing to seize the materials without giving Womack a chance for rebuttal. The Post Office Department reversed itself a short time later, and a formal hearing was held. For Brennan, the Post Office Department's entire process raised significant constitutional questions. :We risk erosion of First Amendment liberties unless we train our vigilance upon the methods whereby obscenity is condemned no less than upon the standards whereby it is judged. Questions of procedural safeguards loom large in the wake of an order such as the one before us. Among them are: (a) whether Congress can close the mails to obscenity by any means other than prosecution of its sender; (b) whether Congress, if it can authorize exclusion of mail, can provide that obscenity be determined in the first instance in any forum except a court, and (c) whether, even if Congress could so authorize administrative censorship, it has in fact conferred upon postal authorities any power to exclude matter from the mails upon their determination of its obscene character.MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 497-498 (Brennan, J., concurring). For Brennan, this issue surpassed \\"even the important issue of the standards for judging this material's\\" obscenity in importance.MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 498 (Brennan, J., concurring). Brennan, however, found no provision in Section 1461 supporting the establishment of an administrative procedure to censor the mails. Brennan provided a lengthy analysis (including extensive quotations) of the section's legislative history. Based on that evidence, Brennan concluded that there were only two possible constructions of Section 1461: That postmasters could remove matter which they thought, on the face of it, to be obscene, or that postmasters could remove matter only to turn it over to the appropriate authorities. The first construction was constitutionally infirm, Brennan argued. The Post Office Department had not acted in accordance with the second construction. Thus, either way, the Post Office Department's seizure of the magazines, its subsequent investigation of the advertisers, its discover of allegedly obscene materials at each advertiser's place of business, and additional outcomes of its investigation did not withstand constitutional or statutory scrutiny. Administrative censorship of the mail, Brennan concluded, was not in itself unconstitutional. A variety of means were at the government's disposal, including recently enacted provisions to return the items, deny the use of postal banks, refund of monies collected, and more. None of these remedies seize the materials or make a judgment about their obscene nature. \\"But the suggestion that Congress may constitutionally authorize any process other than a fully judicial one immediately raises the gravest doubts.\\"MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 519 (Brennan, J., concurring). Dissent Justice Clark dissented. Clark would have affirmed the judgment of the district court on the grounds that the magazines contained information about where obscene material could be obtained. Therefore, they were nonmailable and constitutionally seized. Clark rejected Brennan's analysis because the government's authority under Section 1461 was not presented or argued by either the plaintiff or respondent, and thus was not before the Court. Nevertheless, Clark addressed the concurring opinion's analysis. Clark, however, concluded that the legislative history of Section 1461 clearly permitted postmasters to refuse mailed materials which were known to be obscene.MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 523 (Clark, J., dissenting). Since subsequent investigation by the Post Office Department had confirmed that the advertisers in the magazine sold obscene materials, the materials published by Womack could be seized. For the dissent, the fact that postal regulations had been in existence since 1902 without challenge weighed heavily in favor of this interpretation of the legislative history. Regarding the majority opinion, Clark concluded that Congress had addressed the issue of scienter in the statute. In Section 1461, Congress made it clear that the act of mailing materials implied scienter: \\"Whoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing, carriage in the mails, or delivery of anything declared by this section to be nonmailable . . . shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both . . . .\\"MANual Enterprises, 370 U.S. at 526 (Clark, J., dissenting). For these reasons, Clark would have affirmed the judgment of the district court. Note about Court composition Justice Felix Frankfurter suffered a stroke several months after hearing oral argument in the case, and did not participate in its decision. Frankfurter resigned from the Court on August 28, 1962. Justice Charles Evans Whittaker had suffered a nervous breakdown prior to oral argument in the case. At the time of the decision, Justice Whittaker was no longer on the Court. His successor, Justice Byron White, was confirmed to the Court after oral argument in the case occurred, and did not participate in either its consideration or decision.

Early years until Dewey's death (1931) Dewey intended the club as a place where educators might find health, strength and inspiration at modest cost. Under his leadership, the club became nationally known for winter sports; it built a winter clubhouse in 1907 that allowed year-round visits to Lake Placid. By 1923, the Club had grown to , with 356 buildings (including 110 residences), its own theatre (seating capacity 1,200), library, boathouses, 21 tennis courts, seven golf courses, farms, a staff of 1100, a fire department, and even a school, today known as Northwood School. Lake Placid Conference Early in September, 1899, trustees of the Club found the time ripe to bring together those most interested in home science, or household economics. They sent out many invitations for the first Lake Placid Conference scheduled to take place September 19-25, 1899. One of the attendees, Ellen Swallow Richards, a founder of the modern domestic science movement, was elected chairman of the conference. The conference took place each year from 1899 to 1907. From 1931 to 1971 The Club had been an active center of skiing ever since the 1910s. Ski-joring as seen in the picture was one of the attractions; ski jumping, ice skating, carnivals and cross-country ski lessons were others. Melvil Dewey's son Godfrey was instrumental in bringing the Winter Olympics to Lake Placid in 1932. Without the club's facilities and its national profile, Lake Placid would not have qualified to host the Games. In the 1930s, a group of students from the Yale School of Drama performed at the Club's Lakeside Theater during the summer months.Lake Placid News, June 19, 1936, p. 12. After 1971 Membership declined steadily as vacationing trends among the wealthy changed. Air travel and time constraints meant that fewer families spent the entire season at the Club. In 1977, only 471 families renewed their membership, compared to 711 the previous year. The Club closed soon after serving as headquarters for the International Olympic Committee during the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. During the 1990s the Club was a frequent target for arson and vandalism. Its last buildings were demolished in January 2002.  Exclusionary policies  For most of its existence the Lake Placid Club excluded Jews and other socially stigmatized groups. A Lake Placid circular explained, \\"No one will be received as a member or guest against whom there is physical, moral, social or race objection, or who would be unwelcome to even a small minority... This invariable rule is rigidly enforced. It is found impracticable to make exceptions for Jews or others excluded, even though of unusual personal qualifications.\\" Dewey was forced to resign as New York State Librarian after it was shown that these policies were traceable to him personally, despite his denials.Silver, M.M., Louis Marshall and the Rise of Jewish Ethnicity in America. Syracuse University Press, 2013. . pp. 90-97 (Dewey soon afterward took up permanent residence at the Club, and beginning in 1906 devoted himself to its development.)Ackermann, p. 15 In 1904, the New York State Board of Regents received a petition demanding Dewey's removal as State Librarian because of his personal involvement in the Lake Placid Club's policy of excluding Jews and other religious and ethnic groups. While the Regents declined to remove Dewey, they did issue a public rebuke, and in the summer of 1905 he resigned as a result. Silver, M.M., Louis Marshall and the Rise of Jewish Ethnicity in America. Syracuse University Press, 2013. . pp. 90‚Äì97 Wiegand, p. 327 In 1954, a New York Times article criticized the Club for its refusal to admit Blacks and Jews. The B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League filed a complaint about the Club. The dispute lasted several years, until the League decided to drop the charges of discrimination in 1959. Representatives of the Club claimed that its members were religiously motivated and therefore wished to vacation as Christians among Christians in order to \\"strengthen their appreciation of and attachment to Christianity.\\"Ackermann, p. 351 Since Dewey's time, the Club had been very strict about membership, avoiding fashionable vacationers, not serving alcohol in the dining room, and only accepting guests who came recommended by other members. The criteria for membership remained intact until 1976.Ackermann, p. 41-43 Lake Placid Club in Florida In 1926, Dewey established a southern branch of the club in Lake Stearns, Florida; the town was renamed Lake Placid as a result. It is now owned by the South Florida District of the Church of the Nazarene, which operates it as the Lake Placid Camp and Conference Center.

Its studios are located just two blocks from the Augusta-Richmond County border in unincorporated Columbia County, Georgia and the transmitter is in Grovetown, Georgia at the interchange of Interstate 20 and GA 388. History WGAC-FM signed on in November 1992 as an alternative rock outlet named \\"Channel Z 95.1\\", giving the area its first station playing that type of music. Although the station had a small but loyal audience, it was handicapped with a signal that covered 2/3 of the Augusta/Aiken market. It was nominated in 1996 for \\"Small Market Station Of The Year\\" as well as then-Music Director Johnny Cage for \\"Music Director Of The Year\\" by Billboard Radio Monitor and was voted \\"Best Radio Station\\" in 1995 and 1996 by readers of \\"Augusta Magazine\\".

It is a popular trail head for access to the old mining town of Monte Cristo and has a branch off to hike up to Gothic Basin, which is about a mile in. The mining boom at Monte Cristo, starting in 1890, resulted in the need for access to the remote town. In 1891 a wagon road was built along the Sauk River, from the Skagit River to Monte Cristo. That same year it was discovered that Monte Cristo could be accessed via the South Fork Stillaguamish River. A surveyor named J.Q. Barlow blazed a route from Silverton to Monte Cristo. Mining interests funded further work and soon a wagon road was built over Barlow Pass to join the Sauk wagon road. Later a railroad would be built over the same route.

He won the silver medal in the heavyweight class. In 1916, Olin captured a claim to the World Heavyweight championship after a controversial bout with Joe Stecher in Springfield, Massachusetts. On December 12, 1916, In one of the great forgotten matches and upsets in wrestling history, he defeated Stecher. After 2 hrs and 40 min., both wrestlers ended up outside the ring brawling. Olin wanted to continue but Stecher declined to return to the ring. Olin was awarded the bout by the referee. Stecher injured his shoulder during the match and was out of the ring for over 1¬Ω months. In newspaper reports no mention of the title is made. Why the public continued to support Stecher is unclear. John Olin's promoters claimed the World Title but Olin was mild mannered and didn't make much noise about being the champion. It may be that the press refused to accept Olin as champion because his win was fluke due to injury and no one believe Olin could truly defeat Stecher. Also Frank Gotch was still alive at the time and many still saw him as the \\"real\\" world champion. As Stecher didn't consider himself defeated, the idea of Olin as champ had much going against it. This claim to the title, called the Olin Line by historians, did continue. Olin lost his claim \\"world title\\" to Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis in Chicago on May 2, 1917. After 2 hours and 37 minutes, John Olin concedes match due to a shoulder injury. Referee was Frank Gotch and he praised Lewis as the best. The Strangler would not be as mild manner as Olin, and actively claimed the title. Olin resided in Worcester, Massachusetts during his stay in the United States, and wrestled as a professional for several years. He died in Ing√•, Finland.

It was written by Kyzza Terrazas and debuted at the Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2007. In the film the lives of the rich Cristobal and his sister are contrasted with those of the servants on the estate. However, the riches are from illegal sources it would seem, and his father is on the run in Europe. In particular it is made clear that his childhood friend Adan, is now firmly kept in his place as the family gardener, and is no longer treated as a friend. Plot It tells the story of a rich young man, Cristobal, and his friends throwing a house party over the course of a weekend at his parents' home in Tepoztl√°n. It is implied through murmurings that his father is in Europe trying to settle finances and avoid corruption charges. At the beginning of the film, he is driven to the house by one of his Indian servants. They drive through a group of protesters without ever really wondering what they are protesting about. His hippie sister, Elisa, has already invaded the place with her drug-addled friends hailing from places such as Brazil and Japan. The two groups seem disparate but it's nothing that can't be resolved through sharing alcohol and marijuana. Already at the house is a family who work as the groundskeepers and Adan, also a twenty-something who has grown up with them but works for them, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere as Cristobal barks out orders. Cristobal and Adan vie for the attention of Dolores, an Argentine girl at the party whose family has also escaped Argentina due to financial problems. Cris also struggles with his girlfriend, Mafer, constantly phoning him and finding out that he didn't get into Harvard University, where his father wanted him to go. When he finds out that Adan did get into a university in the United States, their rivalry grows even greater. During a football match in the garden, Cris purposely fouls Adan, showing his bitterness. Cris and Dolores grow close and begin kissing, only to be interrupted by one of Mafer's phone calls. That night, a rave is held. Elisa, on an ecstasy trip, wanders into the garden and finds Adan sitting in a tree on the perimeter, as he had returned to observe their antics after he had already left. She kisses him, but then begins to overdose. She calls for Cristobal and he takes her into the house and blames Adan for what has happened. Cristobel starts a fight with Adan but is overpowered, and in frustration calls Adan an Indio, as a derogatory, deeply hurting Adan and reinforcing their differences. Elisa insists that he should not take her to a hospital. He finds she has been given three pills by one of the boys and the guests are asked to leave. Mafer then turns up, furious that he has been flirting with other women while she was trying to get to the party (Cris having ignored her phone call asking to come and pick her up). Cris receives a mobile phone call, which he can see is from his father, but he doesn't answer it and bursts into tears. The day saw him rejected from Harvard, lose his girlfriend (and Dolores) and his sister overdose on ecstasy, with the rift from his parents firmly entrenched and the differences between Adan perceived Cast * Gael Garc√≠a Bernal as Cristobal * Luz Cipriota as Dolores * Tenoch Huerta Mej√≠a as Adan * Camila Sodi as Elisa External links * Category:2007 films Category:Mexican films Category:Spanish-language films Category:2007 drama films Category:Films about drugs Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films about suburbia ","title":"D√©ficit"},{"id":"10882697","text":"Tail fin or tailfin may refer to: * Car tailfin of an automobile * Caudal fin of a fish * Vertical stabilizer of an airplane ","title":"Tail fin"},{"id":"10882699","text":"Super Sucker is a 2002 film featuring Jeff Daniels, Harve Presnell, and Kate Peckham.

Knopf, Inc., New York 1956 Synopsis A good-for-nothing boy once begged a sheepskin from butchers; it was so filthy he came to be called \\"Little Johnny Sheep-Dung\\". One day, he met a bourgeois on a horse, who hired him on the promise of little work and feeding him; Johnny did not realize that he was the Devil. At his home, the Devil showed him a horse (actually a prince he had transformed to that shape) and told him to beat it every morning. Johnny did, but not hard, for fear of tiring himself. After a few days, the horse warned him that he worked for the Devil, told him to take ten sacks of the Devil's gold, and had him ride off on it. They rode through an ocean, where waters opened for them. The Devil chased them, but every time he came close, the horse had Johnny drop a sack, so the Devil stopped to pick the money up. When the tenth sack was dropped, they escaped the other side, and the waters closed on the Devil and drowned him. Soon they reached the king's castle, where the king thought his son had been lost hunting. The horse told Johnny to work as a gardener; they would set him to tend strawberries, and he should cut them at the root and lie down beside them. He did that, and fell asleep. His sheepskin vanished, and he was wearing fine clothing. The youngest princess saw him, he was very handsome, and she fell in love. When he woke, the strawberries were ripe, and he was wearing his sheepskin. He went back to the horse, and it had a man's head. The next day, the horse sent him. They put him to tend the arbors, and at the horse's command, he cut all their roots and slept. The youngest princess again saw him looking handsome, the arbors grew back and held fruit by the time he woke, and the horse had become a man to his waist. The third day, the horse sent him again, he planted the spade in the ground he was supposed to spade and slept, the youngest princess admired him again, the ground was all spaded when he woke, and the horse was a man again. The king was thinking of marrying off his daughters. His older two were promised to two princes, but the youngest had refused all matches. She went to her father and told him she wanted to marry Johnny. The king did not want to, but she insisted, and so they were promised. Then the king called all three of the men and told them that the one who defeated the other two would get his crown. The princes set out on fractious horses and scorned Johnny, on a lame horse, but when they had ridden by, the horse and his clothing were changed to a fine horse and outfit. He rode after and told them he had come to fight in Johnny's place. They fought and did not injure each other, and Johnny rode off. A second day, it went the same, but the third, Johnny wounded both the others. He went back with them and revealed who he was; the youngest princess was not surprised. The king said the crown was his. Johnny said it belonged to his son, and when the king said that his son was dead, he brought him to the court. The marriages were performed, the son became king, and Johnny was his most loyal friend. Variants This tale is Aarne-Thompson type 314, which is called \\"the Golden Story\\" because in many variants, the hero's hair is turned to gold. Other tales like this include The Magician's Horse and The Gifts of the Magician. Besides that alternation, it is uncommon for the horse to be transformed back into a man in parts; usually, the horse orders the hero to behead it, which transforms it.

He was a lifelong Protestant, but had to cope with issues surrounding the many religious views of his era, including Anglicanism, Presbyterianism, Roman Catholicism and differing opinions of several English Separatists. James VI and I (James Stuart) (June 19, 1566 ‚Äì March 27, 1625), King of Scots, King of England, and king of Ireland, faced many complicated religious challenges during his reigns in Scotland and England. In Scotland, he inherited a reformed church, the Kirk, which was attempting to rid the country of bishops, dioceses, and parishes and establish a fully Presbyterian system, run by ministers and elders. However, James saw the bishops as the natural allies of the monarchy and frequently came into conflict with the Kirk in his sustained effort to reintroduce an episcopal polity to Scotland. On his succession to the English throne, James was impressed by the church system he found there, which still adhered to an episcopate and supported the monarch's position as the head of the church. On the other hand, there were many more Roman Catholics in England than in Scotland, and James inherited a set of penal laws which he was constantly exhorted to enforce against them. Before ascending the English throne, James had assured the Earl of Northumberland that he would not persecute \\"any that will be quiet and give but an outward obedience to the law,\\" but he soon reinforced strict penalties against Catholics. Partly triggered by Catholics' disillusionment with the new king, the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 led to a new wave of anti-Catholicism and even harsher legislation. In 1606, an oath of allegiance was introduced, though its enforcement later slackened.Krugler, p. 20‚Äì24. His policy of seeking a Spanish Match for his son, Charles, Prince of Wales, produced widespread opposition, particularly in the Commons, where members feared a revival of Catholic power in the country and a threat to the Protestant monarchy and state. Puritans and other Dissenters On James's arrival in London, the Puritan clergy presented him with the Millenary Petition, allegedly signed by a thousand English clergy, requesting reforms in the church, particularly the abolition of confirmation, wedding rings, and the term \\"priest\\", and that the wearing of cap and surplice, which they regarded as \\"outward badges of Popish errours\\", be made optional.Croft, p 156; Willson, p. 201. James, however, equated English Puritans with Scottish Presbyterians and, after banning religious petitions, told the Hampton Court Conference of 1604 that he preferred the status quo,When Puritans spoke against ceremonies because they had been used when England was Catholic, James said shoes had been worn when England was Catholic, so why didn‚Äôt Puritans go barefoot? Willson, p 200. When an unmarried Puritan speaker objected to the phrase \\"With my body I thee worship\\" from the marriage service, James replied: \\"Many a man speaks of Robin Hood who never shot his bow\\". Stewart, p 197. with the monarch ruling the church through the bishops.If bishops were put out of power, \\"I know what would become of my supremacy,\\" James objected. \\"No bishop, no King. When I mean to live under a presbytery I will go to Scotland again.\\" Willson, p. 198, p. 207. He therefore resolved to enforce conformity among the clergy, a decision which led in the short term to about ninety ejections or suspensions from livings and in the longer term to a sense of persecution among English Puritans.\\"In things indifferent,\\" James wrote in a new edition of Basilikon Doron, \\"they are seditious which obey not the magistrates\\". Willson, p 201, p 209; Croft, p 156; \\"In seeking conformity, James gave a name and a purpose to nonconformity.\\" Stewart, p 205. A notable success of the Hampton Court Conference was the commissioning of a new translation of the Bible, completed in 1611, which became known as the King James Bible, considered a masterpiece of Jacobean prose.Willson, pp 213‚Äì215; Croft, p 157. James, who took an interest in the scholarly decisions of the translators, often participated in theological debate. In 1612, for example, he wrote a tract against the unorthodox Dutch theologian Conrad Vorstius, a follower of Jacobus Arminius.Willson, p 240. A year before, he had imprisoned a dissenter called Bartholomew Legate, with whom he had frequent audience during the protracted court proceedings. According to a court official, on hearing that Legate had not prayed to Christ in seven years, the king in choler spurn'd at him with his foot; Away, base fellow (saith he), it shall never be said that one stayeth in my presence, that hath never prayed to our Saviour for seven years together.' In 1612, Legate was convicted of blasphemous heresy and was burned at the stake, along with Edward Wightman.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3ADictionary_of_National_Biography_volume_32.djvu/411Willson, pp 240‚Äì241. \\"Both men emerge as the victims of a complex series of events: the king's desire to be seen as orthodox in the light of the Vorstius affair; the in-fighting for control of the ecclesiastical establishment on the elevation of George Abbot to the archbishopric of Canterbury; and the campaign of the emerging anti-Calvinist group around Bishop Richard Neile against puritans\\". Atherton and Como, pp. 1215‚Äì1250. Another dissenter, the General Baptist leader Thomas Helwys, appealed to James for liberty of conscience, only to be sent to prison, where he died by 1616.In A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity, Helwys declared that \\"men's religion...is betwixt God and themselves,\\" and the king cannot judge \\"between God and man...Let them be heretics, Turks, Jews, or whatsoever, it appertains not to the earthly power to punish them.\\" Watts, p 49; Solt pp 145‚Äì7 Catholics After the Gunpowder Plot in November 1605, the third Catholic conspiracy against his person in three years, James sanctioned stricter measures to suppress them. In May 1606, Parliament passed an act which could require any citizen to take an Oath of Allegiance, entailing a denial of the pope's authority over the king.Stewart, p 225. James believed that the Oath was merely concerned with civil obedience, a secular transaction between king and subject; but it provoked opposition among Catholics, as it did not explicitly restrict itself to political matters.James's chief concern was security. So long as the pope was allowed to sanction and encourage civil action against any monarch he chose to excommunicate, that monarch would be vulnerable to attack from subjects who regarded the pope, not the monarch, as their supreme leader. The Oath, therefore, was designed to discover which of James's Catholic subjects were potentially disloyal. James justified the Oath at length in his Triplici nodo, triplex cuneus. Or An Apologie [explanation] for the Oath of Allegiance, printed in 1608. Stewart, pp 225‚Äì7. In early 1606, the Venetian ambassador reported James as saying: \\"I do not know what they found this cursed doctrine that they are permitted to plot against the lives of princes\\".Willson, p 227; Stewart, pp 225‚Äì6. James' policy aimed at punishing a few instead of creating bloodshed; Jesuits and seminary priests should simply be asked to leave the country.In an address to judges in 1608, James instructed that those who refused to leave be dealt with flexibly, unless they resorted to violence. Francis Bacon recorded James's exact words as \\"No torrent of blowd: poena ad paucos\\" (penalties to the few). Croft, p 161. James proved lenient towards Catholic laymen who took the Oath of Allegiance,Willson, p 228. and tolerated crypto-Catholicism even at court. Henry Howard, for example, outwardly professed Protestantism but remained a Catholic in private and was received back into the Roman church in his final months. Scottish church In Basilikon Doron, James called the Scottish Reformation \\"inordinate\\" and \\"not proceeding from the prince's order\\".Croft, p 163, p 165. He therefore attempted to bring the Scottish kirk \\"so neir as can be\\" to the English church and reestablish the episcopacy in Scotland, a policy which met with opposition from the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly.In March 1605, Archbishop Spottiswood wrote to James warning him that sermons against bishops were being preached daily in Edinburgh. Croft, p 164. In 1610, the boundaries of pre- Reformation dioceses were re-established, and in 1618, James's bishops forced his Five Articles of Perth through a General Assembly; but they were widely resented and resisted.The Five Articles of Perth were: only bishops could carry out confirmations; the five pre-Reformation Holy Days were to be reinstated (Christmas, Good Friday, Easter, Ascension, and Whitsunday); everyone was to receive communion kneeling; private communion was to be permitted for the sick or infirm; private baptism likewise. Croft, p 166; Willson, p 320. James was to leave the church in Scotland divided at his death, a store of future problems for his son.Historians have differed in their assessments of the kirk at James's death: some consider that the Scots might have come round to the Five Articles eventually; others that James left the kirk in crisis.

He played college football at Iowa State University. He was a two-way player, playing both on offense and defense. He played 94 games as a defensive lineman, usually defensive end, and 115 games as a tight end. Early years Because of the small size of Beaver High School, it had no football program, so Doran practiced basketball and baseball. As a High School basketball player, Doran once scored 36 of the 38 total points scored by his team in a single contest. On the baseball diamond Doran possessed prolific home run power as a switch hitter while playing the catcher position. Against Rippey High School as senior, Doran belted 3 home runs, 2 as a right handed hitter and 1 as a lefty. His first exposure to the sport of football was at Buena Vista College in the fall of 1947, on the \\"B\\" team, joining after a short stint in the navy during World War II. He played defensive tackle despite being a relative lightweight at 190 pounds. Doran transferred to Iowa State University in 1947, joining the track team as a sprinter, high jumper and shot putter. Doran had his 1948 football season end in the season opener with a broken right ankle. In 1949, he helped the team post a 5‚Äì3‚Äì1 record, the school's first winning football season in a span of 14 years, and being named to the All-Big Seven team at offensive end, with 689 yards on 34 catches, breaking the single-season Big Seven receiving mark by over 200 yards. He also set a national college record against the Oklahoma Sooners by catching eight passes for 203 yards, a mark that remains unbroken in the Iowa State University record book. In 1950, his 652 yards on 42 receptions and six touchdowns as a senior, earned him first-team All-American and All-Big Seven honors. He was the Cyclone's only football All-American in two decades, and more recently he was voted to the modern All-time All-Big Eight team. Doran closed out his Cyclone career owning virtually every Iowa State and Big Seven receiving mark. He also played in the Hula Bowl and East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game in 1951. In 1997, he was inducted into the Iowa State University Athletics Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was inducted into the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame. In 1983, he was inducted into the Iowa High School Football Hall of Fame, despite never playing high school football. Doran was deemed an \\"outstanding example for the young men of the state of Iowa\\". Professional career=Detroit Lions Doran was selected by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round (55th overall) of the 1951 NFL Draft. He became a starter as a rookie at defensive end. He also was used on the offensive side, registering 10 receptions, 225 receiving yards, a 22.5-yard average (fourth in the league) and 2 touchdowns. In 1952, he was voted the most valuable player on a Lions team that won the 1952 NFL Championship Game. His teammates nicknamed him the Graham Cracker, because of his ferocious rushing of Otto Graham as a defensive end, in all of the Detroit-Cleveland games he played in. In 1953, he started playing both offense and defense because of injuries to teammates. The biggest play of his pro career occurred in the 1953 NFL Championship Game, when he caught a 33-yard touchdown pass, that pulled out a 17‚Äì16 victory. Doran remained playing the offensive end position and led the Lions in receiving in 1957. After the 1959 season, because of his age, the Lions left him off their list of players who were exempt from the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft. Dallas Cowboys Doran was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft. He was converted into a tight end at 33 years of age, becoming the first starter at that position in franchise history, while registering 31 catches (led the team) for 554 yards (led the team) and 3 touchdowns. At the end of the season, he had the distinction of becoming the Cowboys‚Äô first Pro Bowl player in franchise history, and also scoring the Cowboys' first touchdown in franchise history, a 75-yard pass from Eddie LeBaron against the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 24, 1960. Doran started the franchise's legacy of Pro Bowl tight ends that includes: Dick Bielski, Lee Folkins, Mike Ditka, Billy Joe Dupree, Jackie Smith, Doug Cosbie, Jay Novacek and Jason Witten. He was released after playing two seasons in Dallas and a total of 11 seasons in the NFL, compiling 212 receptions for 3,667 yards and 24 touchdowns. Denver Broncos On July 22, 1962, Doran signed as a free agent with the Denver Broncos of the American Football League, but his season ended after injuring his back during a victory against the Dallas Texans and being placed on the injured reserve list on August 27. Personal life Doran rejoined his old Detroit Lions head coach, Buddy Parker, as an assistant with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 1964 and 1965 seasons. He returned to Iowa to farm after football. He died on June 29, 1994, of a heart attack.

History WTVR-FM began broadcasting in February 1947 as WCOD (Capital Old Dominion) and was owned by the Richmond Broadcasting Company. It was the sister station of AM 1380, which is today WBTK. For many years, it was also co-owned with Channel 6 WTVR-TV. The call letters for all three stations, AM 1380, FM 98.1 and Channel 6 were WTVR, signifying TeleVision Richmond. Even though Channel 6 is today owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, the FM and TV stations still share the WTVR call letters and the tower off West Broad Street, a landmark on the Richmond skyline.

WTVR-FM's logo under previous \\"Lite 98\\" branding For much of its early history, WTVR-FM aired beautiful music, although by the 1980s, that mostly instrumental format was falling out of favor with younger listeners. It gradually added more soft vocals to its sound, transitioning to the adult contemporary format heard today. On November 13, 2015, WTVR-FM switched to Christmas music, and began calling itself \\"The All-New Christmas 98.1.\\" In recent years, along with many other adult contemporary radio stations, WTVR-FM switches to all holiday music from mid-November to Christmas Day.

He played college football at the University of Washington. Early years Folkins attended Roosevelt High School, before accepting a football scholarship from the University of Washington. Folkins started as a sophomore playing both offense and defense, standing out as an offensive end, where he eventually formed a massive duo with John Meyers, with both standing 6‚Äì5 and over 200 pounds each. In 1959, Folkins helped the Huskies reach the 1960 Rose Bowl, winning it for the first time in school history, with a 44-8 upset against the University of Wisconsin. In 1960, Folkins was a preseason All-American candidate and again helped the Huskies reach the 1961 Rose Bowl, which they won 17-7 against the University of Minnesota. Professional career=Green Bay Packers Folkins was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round (82nd overall) of the 1961 NFL Draft. He was converted to play tight end and was a reserve behind Ron Kramer. Folkins was part of the Packers 1961 World NFL Championship Team, but spent most of his time playing special teams. On 4 September 1962, Folkins was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for an eighth-round draft choice (#104-Keith Kinderman). Dallas Cowboys Folkins started the 1962 season as the backup for Pettis Norman at tight end, but by the fourth game he had won the starter position and developed into a very good pass receiver, catching 39 receptions for 536 yards and six touchdowns. In the 1962 Chicago College All-Star Game, Folkins swung at a collegiate player, but connected instead with the head official, rendering him unconscious. Folkins made the Pro Bowl in 1963 after making 31 catches for 407 yards and 4 touchdowns, becoming part of the franchise's legacy of Pro Bowl tight ends that includes: Jim Doran, Dick Bielski, Mike Ditka, Billy Joe Dupree, Jackie Smith, Doug Cosbie, Jay Novacek and Jason Witten. After catching 70 passes in his first two seasons in Dallas, Folkins caught only five passes in 1964 after being passed on the depth chart by Pettis Norman. He played mainly on special teams and was forced to be the Cowboys punter in the last 2 games of the season (15 punts for 497 yards). On 6 September 1965, Folkins was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for a twelfth round draft choice (#173-Les Shy). Shortly after being traded by the Cowboys to the Steelers, he returned to play in the Old Cotton Bowl at Fair Park in Dallas. Folkins recovered a fumble during that game and ran along the Cowboy sideline, holding out the football toward Coach Tom Landry and the Cowboy Team, as he ran for a touchdown. Folkins worked for Tecon Corporation, owned by the Murchison Brothers who owned the Cowboys, while with that team. Pittsburgh Steelers In 1965, Folkins didn't have a big impact with the Pittsburgh Steelers because of recurring injuries.

He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round of the 1995 NFL Draft. He played college football at University of Washington. Early years Bjornson attended Bishop O'Dowd High School, where he became a three-year starter at quarterback. As a sophomore, he had a game where he threw for 5 touchdowns. As a senior, he helped his team earn a 10‚Äì1 record and the East Shore Athletic League championship. He received scholar-athlete awards from the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame and the Oakland Tribune. He finished his career with 583 completions for 4,074 yards and 36 touchdowns. College career Bjornson accepted a football scholarship to the University of Washington. As a redshirt freshman in 1991, he was the third- string quarterback behind Billy Joe Hobert and Mark Brunell, on the national championship team. He was converted into a wide receiver as a sophomore, making 14 receptions for 170 yards and 2 touchdowns. As a junior, he returned to quarterback, as the backup to Damon Huard, getting a chance to start the final 3 games of the 1993 season, registering a 2‚Äì1 record. As a senior, he was moved back to wide receiver, leading the team with 49 receptions (at the time fifth highest total in school history), for 770 yards and 7 touchdowns. He was sixth in the Pacific-10 in receptions and tied for second in touchdown receptions, while earning second-team All-Pac-10, Academic All-Pac-10 and second-team Academic All-American honors. He finished his college career with 64 receptions for 958 yards and 9 touchdowns. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys Bjornson was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (110th overall) of the 1995 NFL draft, with the plan of converting him into a tight end. As a rookie, he contributed on special teams (6 tackles) and as a backup, while being part of the Super Bowl XXX championship team. He became a starter in 1996, after Pro Bowler Jay Novacek suffered a back injury, that eventually forced him to retire. He would go on to start 10 games and had career-highs with 48 receptions (second on the team) and 3 touchdowns, despite playing through two sprained ankles that limited his playing time over the final four games of the regular season and the playoffs. In 1997, although the Cowboys had drafted tight end David LaFleur in the first round, Bjornson still was an integral part of the offense, finishing second on the team and third among NFC tight ends with 47 receptions. He also was third on the team with a career-high 442 receiving yards, even though he suffered a fractured left fibula in Week 14, that placed him on the injured reserve list. In 1998, he was re-signed by the Cowboys to a two-year contract. That year, he played in all 16 games mainly as a backup (four starts) to LaFleur and although he was used some times as the slot receiver in four-wide receiver sets, his production decreased when he wasn't the starter. In 1999, he played in all 16 games (six starts), finishing with 10 receptions for 131 yards. He was also used as the placekicker holder and had a 20-yard touchdown run on a fake field goal attempt. Bjornson had 127 receptions for 1,232 yards (9.7 avg.) and six touchdowns during his five seasons with the Cowboys. New England Patriots On February 29, 2000, he signed as a free agent with the New England Patriots, but was released on November 15. He appeared in 8 games (6 starts), collecting 20 receptions for 152 yards and 2 touchdowns. Oakland Raiders On March 1, 2001, he signed as a free agent with the Oakland Raiders. He was released before the season started on August 28.

Description This glossy Tachycineta swallow has a green head and back, blue upper wings, a black tail and wingtips, and a white belly and chin. Range and habitat This swallow breeds only in pineyards on four islands in the northern Bahamas: Andros, Grand Bahama, Abaco, and New Providence. The breeding population on New Providence is, at the very least, greatly reduced from historical levels, and may be extirpated as a breeding species. The Bahama swallow winters throughout the eastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is a rare vagrant elsewhere during migration, including south Florida and the Florida Keys.American Ornithologists Union, (1998): Check-list of North American Birds. 7th edition. American Ornithologists Union, Washington, D.C. It is also an occasional vagrant to the southerly Americas. T. cyaneoviridis is a bird of the Caribbean pine forests. They are somewhat capable of adapting to urban habitat. Although they do not breed in marshland and fields, they need such habitat to forage; like all swallows they feed on flying insects. Reproduction Bahama swallows nest in old West Indian woodpecker holes in Caribbean Pine (Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis), using pine needles, Casuarina twigs, and grass to make the nest, and they line it with feathers from other passerines. They typically lay three eggs. Incubation is 15 days and the fledging period is roughly 22 days.

The Tencteri or Tenchteri or Tenctheri (in Plutarch's Greek, TenteritƒìPlut. Caes. 22 and possibly the same as the Tenkeroi mentioned by Claudius Ptolemy if these were not the TungriGeography 2.10) were an ancient tribe, who moved into the area on the right bank (the northern or eastern bank) of the lower Rhine in the 1st century BC. They are known first from the surviving works of ancient authors such as Julius Caesar and Tacitus. In December 2015, archaeologists found remains of the Tencteri in The Netherlands.Julius Caesar battlefield unearthed in southern Netherlands While the Tencteri and their neighbours were referred to by the Romans as Germanic rather than Gauls, their recorded names (including personal names) are most reasonably explained as Celtic: Tencteri is generally translated as \\"the faithful\\".Tencteri seems to be Celtic rather than Germanic (germ. *Tincteri), but could well be either. Ludwig R√ºbekeil, Diachrone Studien zur Kontaktzone zwischen Kelten und Germanen, Wien, 2002, p. 383f. Tencteri and Usipetes in the time of Julius Caesar In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Caesar describes how two tribes, the Tencteri and Usipetes, had been driven from their traditional lands by the Germanic Suebi, whose military dominance had led to constant warfare and neglect of agriculture. This original homeland of the two tribes is not clear but by the time of Caesar the Suebi had settled in a very large wooded area to the east of the Ubii, who at this time lived on the east bank of the Rhine, on the opposite bank from where Cologne is today. It has been argued that the Tencteri and Usipetes specifically may have come from the area of the Weser river to the east of the Sigambri, because it is near to where the two tribes appeared on the Rhine, and Caesar reports the Suevi in this area. It would also explain the apparently friendly relations of the Tencteri and Usipetes with the Sigambri, who might have been their traditional neighbours. (In later Roman times this area inhabited by Caesar's Suebi was inhabited by the Chatti.) In the winter 55 BC, having failed to find new lands elsewhere in Germania, they came to the mouth of the Rhine, into the territory of the Menapii, a Belgic tribe which had land on both sides of the river and had not yet submitted to Roman rule. Alarmed by the scale of the incursion, the Menapii had withdrawn from their territories east of the Rhine and successfully resisted the Germani bid to cross it for some time. The Germani feigned a retreat, allowing the Menapii to return to their territories east of the Rhine. Their cavalry then returned and made a surprise night attack. They crossed the river and seized Menapian boats, occupied Menapian villages and towns, and spent the rest of the winter living on Menapian provisions. Concerning the exact location of this slaughter, there has long been some doubt. Caesar describes a confluence of the Rhine and Maas rivers, but there is no such confluence. Archaeologist Nico Roymans has announced in 2015 that convincing evidence has been found that it was in fact in the confluence of Waal, a branch of the Rhine and not the Rhine itself, and the Maas/Meuse, near Kessel.http://www.nationalgeographic.nl/artikel/genocidaire- slachting-onder-leiding-van-julius-caesar-bij-kessel On the other hand, the 3rd century historian Cassius Dio described the place as being in the country of the Treveri near the Moselle, which had the same name as the Maas in Latin (Mosa) and does enter the Rhine in that region.Cassius Dio 39.47 English, Latin. This is however very far from the Menapii. Caesar, fearing how the Gauls on the left bank might react, hurried to deal with this threat to his command of the region. He discovered that a number of Gaulish tribes had attempted to pay these Germani generously to leave, but the Tencteri and Usipetes had ranged further, coming to the frontiers of the Condrusi and Eburones, who were both under the protection of the Treveri to their south. Caesar convened a meeting of the Gaulish chiefs, and, pretending he did not know of their attempts at bribery, demanded cavalry and provisions for war against the Tencteri and Usipetes. The Tencteri and Usipetes sent ambassadors to Caesar as he advanced. While they boasted of their military strength, claiming that they could defeat anyone but the Suebi, they offered an alliance, requesting that Caesar assign them land. Caesar refused any alliance so long as the Tencteri and Usipetes remained in Gaul. He proposed settling them in the territory of the Ubii, another Germanic tribe who had sought his help against the aggression of the Suebi, there being no land available in Gaul. The ambassadors requested a truce of three days, during which time neither side would advance towards the other, and they took Caesar's counter- proposal to their leaders for consideration. But Caesar would not accept this, believing the Germani were buying time for the return of their cavalry, who had crossed the Meuse to plunder the Ambivariti a few days previously. As Caesar continued to advance, further ambassadors requested a three-day truce for them to negotiate with the Ubii about his settlement proposal, but Caesar refused for the same reason. He offered a single day, during which he would advance no more than four miles, and ordered his officers to act defensively and not to provoke battle. The Germanic cavalry, although outnumbered by Caesar's Gallic horsemen, made the first attack, forcing the Romans to retreat. Caesar describes a characteristic battle-tactic they used, where a horsemen would leap down to their feet and stab enemy horses in the belly. Accusing them of violating the truce, Caesar refused to accept any more ambassadors, arresting some who came requesting a further truce, and led his full force against the Germanic camp. The Usipetes and Tencteri were thrown into disarray and forced to flee, pursued by Caesar's cavalry, to the confluence of the Rhine and Meuse. Many were killed attempting to cross the rivers.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 4.1-15Lee, K.H. \\"Caesar's Encounter with the Usipetes and the Tencteri.\\" Greece & Rome 2nd vol. 2 (1969): 100-103. They found refuge on the other side of the Rhine amongst the Sicambri. Plutarch reports that back in Rome, > Cato pronounced the opinion that they ought to deliver up Caesar to the > Barbarians, thus purging away the violation of the truce in behalf of the > city, and turning the curse therefor on the guilty man. Of those who had > crossed the Rhine into Gaul four hundred thousand were cut to pieces, and > the few who succeeded in making their way back were received by the > Sugambri, a German nation. This action Caesar made a ground of complaint > against the Sugambri, and besides, he coveted the fame of being the first > man to cross the Rhine with an army.Plut. Caes. 22 Later mentions In 16 BC, the Tencteri, Usipetes and Sicambri once again crossed the Rhine and attacked Gaul. Marcus Lollius was defeated and the Germanic tribes took the standard of the 5th legion. Tacitus describes the Tencteri as living in his time (approximately 98AD), and also at the time of the Batavian revolt (69/70 AD), between the Chatti and the Rhine, across from the Ubii who had been settled in Cologne. This means that they had settled in the area once inhabited by the Ubii (which is what Caesar had been considering already in his time). The Sicambri to the north of this area, had also apparently been moved by this time, and possibly partly replaced by their neighbours the Tencteri and Bructeri. Orosius reports that the Tencteri, and not only the Sicambri and Usipetes, were defeated by Drusus. Later, the difficult to interpret description given in Claudius Ptolemy's Geography describes the Tenkeroi and Incrionoes living between the Rhine and the Black Forest (Abnoba) mountain range, implying that the Tencteri had moved southwards up the Rhine. In the Peutinger map, the area across from Cologne and Bonn is inhabited by the \\"Burcturi\\" (Bructeri), who may have included a mixture of several of the original Germanic tribes from over the Rhine, including the Tencteri and Usipetes. To their north are Franks and to their south on the Rhine were Suevi.

There is also an extensive transcontinental freight rail network, but passenger railway ridership is lower than in Europe and Asia.  Railways = Canada, the United States and Mexico  The North American Rail network The railroad network of North America (using standard gauge) is extremely extensive, connecting nearly every major and most minor cities. The United States, Canada, and Mexico have an interconnected system with railheads stretching from Hay River, Northwest Territories, Canada to Tapachula, Mexico, and on Vancouver Island. The state government of Alaska also operates the Alaska Railroad, which currently does not connect to the North American network. In Canada, rail lines from Labrador City, NL to Sept-√éles, Quebec also currently are not linked to the North American network. = Newfoundland and Labrador = There have been proposals in recent years to link the island of Newfoundland to the mainland of North America via a 17 km-long rail tunnel under the Strait of Belle Isle, which would also carry automobile traffic on flatcars, similar to the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France. This has stalled due to the lack of a large road network and a lack of rail lines in Labrador, and the remoteness of the area on both sides of the strait in Newfoundland and Labrador. Another issue to contend with is that Newfoundland had abandoned its Canadian National/Newfoundland Railway lines ( gauge until 1988‚Äì1990), turning it into the Newfoundland T'Railway, a rail trail spanning the entire island. An automobile tunnel would be most likely unfeasible due to the length needed to cross the strait, and the difficulties of removing automobile exhaust and bringing in fresh air via large circulation fans throughout the tunnel. = Alaska = Although Alaska is currently not connected to the North American rail network, there are plans to connect it via BC Rail's incomplete but graded rail extension to Dease Lake, where the rails have been laid to Jackson, British Columbia. Until this happens, the only way for rail-based equipment to enter or leave Alaska is via rail ferry from Seattle, Washington and British Columbia. The only rail connection is the White Pass and Yukon Route, a narrow-gauge heritage railway linking Whitehorse, Yukon with Skagway, Alaska. A rail connection between Alaska and the North American rail network could prove beneficial, and could even join up with a possible future rail link over a Bering Strait Rail Tunnel (proposed by Russia), if it is ever built. = Railheads of the network = The current railheads or endpoints of the rail network are, in the north, at Hay River, Northwest Territories (the northernmost part of the North American rail network, operated by CN), Jackson, British Columbia (formerly BC Rail), Lynn Lake and Churchill, Manitoba (Hudson Bay Railway), Moosonee (Ontario Northland Railway), Chibougamau, Quebec and Matagami, Quebec (also CN). In the west, the railheads are at Vancouver, British Columbia, Prince Rupert, British Columbia (CPRail), with ferry service to Vancouver Island for the railways linking Nanaimo, Esquimalt, and Victoria. In the east, the North American network extends to Halifax, and Sydney, Nova Scotia. In the south, the rail lines terminate at Port of Chiapas, and Ciudad Hidalgo, with a short dual-gauge spur line to the border city of Ciudad Tec√∫n Um√°n, Guatemala. = Proposed by Russia = Possible route of a bridge or tunnel across the Bering Strait. In April 2007 the Russian government announced that it was considering building a rail tunnel under the Bering Strait between Chukotka and Alaska. The tunnel, as projected, would be long and would include oil and gas pipelines, fiber optic cables and power lines.Blomfield. The tunnel project was estimated to cost $65 billion and take 15‚Äì20 years to build. In addition to the Russian government, sponsors of the project apparently include Transneft and RAO United Energy Systems.Hearst; Associated Press, \\"Bering Strait tunnel proposed\\".  Central America  Mexico has a connection to Guatemala, but it is a break of gauge, since Mexico uses , while Guatemala and Central America use narrow gauge . Aside from a short spur line linking border city of Ciudad Tec√∫n Um√°n, Guatemala, the entire nation is on gauge. South of Guatemala, there are numerous breaks of gauge, such as (with Honduras), and El Salvador (which uses the same 914 mm gauge of rail, but is currently closed, with some sections abandoned and unusable). Nicaragua has also closed its rail network in 1996, though the majority of it was gauge, with some lines along the Atlantic Coast. Costa Rica's railroads are of gauge, along with a private gauge railroad at 3.5 km in length. The railroads of Panama are connected to Costa Rica. The country had two gauges: originally broad gauge , which was converted to standard gauge () in 2000, and narrow gauge (914 mm). Like the situation with roads, the Darien Gap is a formidable obstacle to railroads, and no railways cross it into South America.  Roadways  The continent's roads are of varying quality, with divided highway standards in some areas but poor-quality gravel or unpaved roads in others. The road network extends from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and Anchorage, Alaska, in the extreme northwest, to Sydney, Nova Scotia, Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador, Blanc Sablon and Natashquan, Quebec, in the extreme east, all the way to Yaviza, Panama, in the extreme south. It does not connect with the South American road network due to the Dari√©n Gap. Some roads are seasonal, such as ice roads that cover frozen bodies of water, winter roads which cross otherwise impassable wetlands only in cold weather, and unpaved mountain roads that turn to mud in the spring. The road network does not reach all settlements, and some remote arctic and subarctic communities are only accessible by seasonal road, open land, sea, or air transport. Some North American islands are served only by ferries or private boat. Notable disconnected islands include the West Indies, Vancouver Island, Newfoundland (island), Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Some roads and some entire localities are intentionally car-free.  United States  The United States road network is the largest in the world, with 6.4 million km (4 million mi) of roadways. of those are Interstate Highways, and around another are U.S. Highways. The Interstate Highway system is almost completely composed of multi-lane, dual-carriageway freeways. The contiguous United States are also connected to its exclave, Alaska, via the Alaska Highway, which links the state to Yukon Territory, British Columbia, and the Lower 48 states. The continental United States is disconnected from the state of Hawaii and various insular areas in Oceania. Many settlements in Alaska are disconnected from the continental road network except by ferry or boat, including the capital Juneau, Sitka, Kodiak, Bethel, Nome, and Utqiagvik.According to Google Maps directions, 25 March 2012. The Dalton Highway connects the mainland via Fairbanks with the otherwise remote Prudhoe Bay, Alaska on the North Slope as a service road for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.  Canada  The Trans Canada Highway spans the country along with its auxiliary branches. The Yellowhead Highway branches to the north, and the Crowsnest Highway, acts as a southern spur or shortcut to travelling from Alberta to British Columbia across the Rockies. Canada's national highways are similar to the US Route network, as it is mostly two-lane without freeway sections, aside from in and near large population centres, such as Montreal, Calgary, and Regina. Canada and the United States have also built the vital Alaska Highway, linking Anchorage, Alaska (and the rest of the state) to Canada and the rest of the United States. Although Canada does not have a federal-level network of expressways, all provinces east of Ontario are inter- linked by provincial-level freeways, such as Ontario's 400-series highways network, Quebec's Autoroute network, New Brunswick's upgrades to its portions of the Trans-Canada Highway, and Nova Scotia's 100-series highways. These expressways are the provincial equivalents to the United States' Interstate Highway system. The only gap in the Canadian inter-provincial expressway network (one can travel from Windsor to Halifax using expressways, but this involves crossing into the United States to use their Interstate Highway network, and back into Canada) between Windsor, Ontario, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, is along Route 185/Autoroute 85, which is being twinned and upgraded to become a fully divided Autoroute. This gap is quite busy and will be upgraded within the next 10 years. The province of Ontario is the only province to contain its own system of county roads, which are controlled and maintained by the Counties, Districts, and Regions of Ontario. Provinces west of Manitoba have their own networks of highways (the majority of which are not expressways or divided highways), with Winnipeg also having its own Winnipeg City Routes. Alberta has its own small but growing inter-connected network of divided highways and freeways, such as Alberta Highway 1, Highway 2, and Highway 16. British Columbia also has a small network of freeways linking Vancouver to Kamloops, via Highway 1, and Highway 5, formerly a toll road. = Newfoundland and Labrador = In 2004 the provincial government studied the feasibility of a Newfoundland-Labrador fixed link joining the island of Newfoundland to the mainland of North America via a 17 km-long rail tunnel under the Strait of Belle Isle, which would also carry automobile traffic on flat cars, similar to the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France. This has stalled due to the lack of a large road network and a lack of rail lines in Labrador, and the remoteness of the area on both sides of the strait in Newfoundland and Labrador. Another issue to contend with is that Newfoundland had abandoned its segments of its CN/Newfoundland Railway lines ( narrow-gauge) in 1988‚Äì1990, turning it into the Newfoundland T'Railway, a rail trail spanning the entire island. An automobile tunnel would be most likely unfeasible due to the length needed to cross the strait, and the difficulties of removing automobile exhaust and bringing in fresh air via large circulation fans throughout the tunnel. Labrador is, however, connected to the continental road network via the Trans-Labrador Highway.  Mexico  Mexico also has a very large road network, 323,977 km worth of roads. Of these, 96,221 km are paved (this is including 6,335 km of expressways) The remainder (227,756 km worth) is unpaved. Since 1991, Mexico has been building toll roads that link its major cities together. Currently, there are 6,335 km worth of toll freeways in the country, with the numbering scheme of n-D (n being the number of the road bypassed, such as 45, with toll freeway as 45-D, meaning 45 Diversion).  Central America  Central America's roadway network continues, linking every major city and capital, via the Pan-American Highway, which continues through Panama, across the Panama Canal, to Yaviza, Panama. It is separated from South America by the large Darien Gap.  Waterways  Waterways were the primary method of transportation of people and goods, and used by native aboriginal people in dugout canoes and kayaks. The waterways remained important since Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492, right up until the First World War. Though their use has diminished somewhat with the arrival of rail transportation, the Interstate Highway/400 series highways networks of America and Canada, and with the debut of air travel, they are still widely used for transporting goods from the American Midwest to overseas markets. The cities of Duluth, Minnesota and Thunder Bay, Ontario (to some extent, Chicago, Illinois as well) are the most inland seaports/deepwater ports in the world, being well over 2000 miles from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, yet they still can cater to cargo ships, thanks to the St. Lawrence Seaway, Welland Canal and Soo Locks, a joint-venture binational system of dams, locks, and canals built by Canada and the United States in 1959. The Mississippi/Missouri River system also sees a large amount of oceanbound ship traffic from cities such as St. Louis, Kansas City, and New Orleans. Churchill, Manitoba also serves as a minor port for grain and wheat loaded via railroad cars, and loaded onto ships bound for Europe at the intermodal facilities in that town. The nation of Panama currently operates one of the world's busiest and most familiar waterways, the Panama Canal. This canal cuts through the isthmus of panama, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, shaving off more than for ships, instead of having them travel around the tip of Cape Horn in South America. A ship travelling from New York City to San Francisco would be roughly in distance, while a trip around Cape Horn would be in length. The Canal functions similarly to the Suez Canal in Egypt.  Ferry services  Currently, car ferry and rail ferry service between New York City, New York/New Orleans, Louisiana/Miami, Florida, United States, and Havana, Cuba is suspended, due to the ongoing embargo by the United States against Cuba. There is however, rail ferry service between Whittier, Alaska and Prince Rupert, British Columbia (the AquaTrain, operated by the Alaska Railroad) and Washington state (Seattle), and a ferry to and from Mobile, Alabama and the Port of Ponce Railroad in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Regular ferry service also links Vancouver Island and isolated Sunshine Coast communities to the mainland and to Alaska. There is also automobile ferry service between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, from Quebec to Labrador, and between Labrador and the island of Newfoundland.  Air travel  Air travel first entered as a viable alternative to transcontinental railroads, and to the then-primitive (or non-existent) road networks that crossed the United States and Canada in the early 1930s, but truly increased in popularity after the Second World War. Most of the continent's busiest airports are located in the United States. In fact the U.S. has 9 of North America's 10 busiest airports, including the world's busiest, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta. The busiest airport in North America outside the United States is Toronto Pearson International Airport, located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria were almost completely destroyed and between 75,000 and 82,000 lives were lost. Tectonic settingCause of the earthquake According to Gianluca Valensise, a seismologist at Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology, the earthquake was caused by a large, low-angle SE-dipping, blind normal fault, lying mainly offshore in the Strait of Messina, between plates.Journal of the Geological.Society Retrieved 31 October 2016 Its upper projection intersects the Earth surface on the western, Sicilian side of the Strait.Geophysical Journal International. Oxford Journals. 12 November 2012 Italy sits along the boundary zone of the African Continental plate, and this plate is pushing against the sea floor underneath Europe at a rate of 25 millimeters (1 inch) per year. This causes vertical displacement, which in turn can cause earthquakes. The earthquake was recorded by 110 seismographic stations around the world. The Strait of Messina is part of the regional tectonic feature known as the Calabrian Arc, an area of differential uplift deriving from the dynamics of the Ionian and South Tyrrhenian tectonic units, two of the lithosphere blocks of microplates recognised in the highly fragmented Italian portion of the Africa-Eurasia contact. A number of the strongest earthquakes that took place in the last centuries occurred in the Calabrian Arc such as the 1783 and 1905 Calabrian earthquakes as well as the more catastrophic 1908 Messina earthquake. Records indicate that considerable seismic activity occurred in the areas around the Strait of Messina several months prior to 28 December; it increased in intensity beginning 1 November. On 10 December a 4 magnitude earthquake caused damage to a few buildings in Novara di Sicilia and Montalbano Elicona, both in the Province of Messina. A total of 293 aftershocks took place between 28 December 1908 and 11 March 1909. In 2008 it was proposed that the concurrent tsunami was not generated by the earthquake, but rather by a large undersea landslide it triggered. The probable source of the tsunami was offshore of Giardini Naxos (40 km south of Messina) on the Sicilian coast where a large submarine landslide body with a headwall scarp was revealed on a Bathymetric map of the Ionian seafloor. Earthquake The port of Messina in c.1900, before the earthquake and tsunami On Monday 28 December 1908, from about 05:20 to 05:21, an earthquake of 7.1 on the moment magnitude scale occurred. Its epicentre was in the Strait of Messina which separates the busy port city of Messina in Sicily and Reggio Calabria on the Italian mainland. Its precise epicentre has been pinpointed to the northern Ionian Sea area close to the narrowest section of the Strait, the location of Messina.Geophysical Research Letters Vol. 35, Issue 6, March 2008. \\"On the cause of the 1908 Messina tsunami, southern Italy\\" It had a depth of around 9 km (5.5 miles). The earthquake almost levelled Messina. At least 91% of structures in Messina were destroyed or irreparably damaged and some 75,000 people were killed in the city and suburbs. Reggio Calabria and other locations in Calabria also suffered heavy damage, with some 25,000 people killed. Reggio's historic centre was almost completely eradicated.The number of casualties is based on the 1901 and 1911 census data. It was the most destructive earthquake ever to strike Europe.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The ground shook for some 30 seconds, and the damage was widespread, with destruction felt over a area. In Calabria, the ground shook violently from Scilla to south of Reggio, provoking landslides inland in the Reggio area and along the sea-cliff from Scilla to Bagnara. In the Calabrian commune of Palmi on the Tyrrhenian coast, there was almost total devastation that left 600 dead. Damage was also inflicted along the eastern Sicilian coast, but outside of Messina, it was not as badly hit as Calabria. The mesoseismal area was confined near the coast along a 1‚Äì4 km wide belt that shook and destroyed Messina and surrounding villages. Catania, the largest city in eastern Sicily, did not incur notable damage. A young doctor who escaped with his life later recounted that \\"the profound silence was broken by an extraordinary noise like the bursting of a thousand bombs, followed by a rushing and torrential rain.\\" Then he heard a \\"sinister whistling sound\\" which he likened to \\"a thousand red hot irons hissing in the water.\\" Other survivors reported that there were three separate and different movements during the 30‚Äì40 second mainshock: the first shaking backwards and forwards, the second thrusting violently upwards, with the third moving in a circular motion. All accounts concur that it was the second upwards motion that caused the widespread destruction in Messina; the accompanying noise described as having been \\"exactly like that made by a fast train in a tunnel\\". The elevated death toll was due to the fact that most people were asleep, and killed outright or buried alive in their beds, as their houses collapsed on top of them. Thousands were trapped under debris, suffering horrific injuries of which many would die. One week before the earthquake, 160,000 inhabitants were counted in the entire Messina commune.\\"Local administrative sources on population movements after the Messina earthquake of 1908\\". Giuseppe Restifo. Dipartimento di Studi sulla Civilit√† Moderno, Universit√† di Messina, 1995 PDF file On 28 December, Messina was even more crowded than usual, due to the number of overnight visitors from outlying areas who had come to the city to see a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Aida, which had been staged the previous evening at the Vittorio Emanuele II theatre.  Tsunami  The devastated seafront of Reggio Calabria About ten minutes after the earthquake, the sea on both sides of the Strait suddenly withdrew as a 12-meter (39-foot) tsunami swept in, and three waves struck nearby coasts. It impacted hardest along the Calabrian coast and inundated Reggio Calabria after the sea had receded 70 meters from the shore. The entire Reggio seafront was destroyed and numbers of people who had gathered there perished. Nearby Villa San Giovanni was also badly hit. Along the coast between Lazzaro and Pellaro, houses and a railway bridge were washed away. In Messina, the tsunami also caused more devastation and deaths; many of the survivors of the earthquake had fled to the relative safety of the seafront to escape their collapsing houses. The second and third tsunami waves, coming in rapid succession and higher than the first, raced over the harbour, smashed boats docked at the pier, and broke parts of the sea wall. After engulfing the port and three city blocks inland beyond the harbour, the waves swept away people, a number of ships that had been anchored in the harbour, fishing boats and ferries, and inflicted further damage on the edifices within the zone which had remained standing after the shock. The ships that were still attached to their moorings collided with one another but did not incur major damage. Afterwards Messina harbour was filled with floating wreckage and the corpses of drowned people and animals. Towns and villages along the eastern coast of Sicily were assaulted by high waves causing deaths and damage to boats and property. Two hours later the tsunami struck Malta, rushing into Marsamxett Harbour and damaging property in Msida. About 2,000 people were killed by the tsunami in Messina on the eastern coast of Sicily, and in Reggio Calabria and its coastal environs.  Scale of destruction  Victims' bodies lying outside badly damaged and destroyed buildings in Corso Vittorio Emanuele which fronts the port of Messina Messina lost almost half its population and the entire historical city centre was devastated including the Norman cathedral which had withstood previous earthquakes such as the severe one in 1783; just the perimeter walls and apses remained standing. The Messina shoreline was irrevocably altered as large sections of the coast had sunk several feet into the sea.28 December 1908 Worst European Earthquake in History\\". Retrieved 30 October 2016 Houses, churches, palaces and monuments, military barracks: commercial, municipal and public buildings had all collapsed entirely or were severely damaged. Many structures were cracked shells, roofless, windowless and standing upright precariously. A boys' boarding school was pulverised, burying the students. A total of 348 railway workers were killed when the two railway stations crumbled. The American consulate was reduced to a pile of rubble: the British consulate sustained little outward damage with its flag still flying, but the interior was completely wrecked. American consul Arthur S. Cheney and his wife Laura were killed. The French consul and his children also lost their lives, although his wife escaped. Ethel Ogston, wife of the British vice-consul, died instantly after being struck by a falling balcony as she attempted to escape through the streets with her husband, Alfred, and daughter, both of whom survived. Former US vice-consul and Messina correspondent for the Associated Press Joseph Pierce and his family were crushed to death when their damaged home, close to the port, was brought down by the force of the waves created by the tsunami. A number of notable Italians were among the dead including politicians, the Attorney General of Messina Crescenzo Grillo, local patriots of the Italian unification and members of the nobility and literati. The Chief of Police died in his office, killed by a fallen beam. Tenor Angelo Gamba who had performed onstage in Aida the evening before the earthquake also lost his life together with his two sons when the Hotel Trinacria collapsed. The Hungarian soprano Paola Koraleck (who sang the role of Aida) was lying awake when the earthquake struck. She leapt from a window, breaking both arms in the fall. The earthquake wrecked the commercial section along Messina's Corso Vittorio Emanuele that skirted the seafront which included the elegant \\"palazzati\\". This was a long sequence of seamless 17th-century buildings that fronted the sickle-shaped harbour and most had sustained irreparable damage. The shaking was especially intense in the port area resulting in the permanent displacement of the stone pavings in a \\"wave-like pattern\\". Damage was heaviest in the old historic centre and the low, level central and northern sections of the city due to the soft sandy soil; it was less severe in the mountainous western part as the structures were built on firmer terrain such as Gonzaga Fort which was unscathed and remains to date. The area between Cathedral Square and the Civic Hospital was obliterated as was the Boccetta zone. Via Porta Imperiale was also struck particularly hard. The 17th-century Real Cittadella, which guarded the harbour, was partially destroyed. Huge crevasses and fissures opened in the streets and these as well as the mounds of rubble, and falling masonry, hampered those survivors who had fled from their razed homes to seek safety. The main thoroughfares Via Garibaldi and Via Cavour were rendered impassable by the hillocks of rubble and debris that measured 5 meters (16 ft) in height. Families had become separated and a torrential downpour of rain that had begun only minutes before the earthquake added to the confusion, impeding visibility along with the darkness and thick clouds of dust. The great gas tanks at the northern end of the town blew up, entombing living survivors and the already dead. Fires broke out, caused by broken gas pipes, which added to the chaos and destruction. One such fire gutted the City Hall. The ground continued to shake with repeated aftershocks causing remaining structures to topple down onto the ruins of demolished edifices killing and injuring rescuers and those who had survived the mainshock. Survivors described having seen horribly disfigured bodies and injured people badly maimed and screaming for help. Cobbler Francesco Missiani and his family came upon two dying girls, of whom both had suffered appalling head and chest injuries. The same man picked up a baby but it died in his arms. Processions of naked survivors carrying pictures of saints appeared in the streets. People with bare hands searched through the debris for trapped loved ones. Rescuers at the scene managed to save some people clinging precariously to gaping upper storeys, windows and teetering balconies by using ropes to pull them to safety. Similar scenes of destruction were replicated in Reggio Calabria. Its historical centre was eradicated and the monumental Aragonese Castle, one of the few edifices to have survived the 1783 earthquake, was badly damaged. With the exception of one mansion, all the structures in its principal thoroughfare Corso Garibaldi were destroyed including the Cathedral, municipal buildings and palazzi. Only about 50 houses remained standing in Reggio. The civilian and military hospitals in Messina, and the civic hospital in Reggio Calabria all lay in ruins with nearly all the doctors and nurses dead. The injured in the two cities had no medical support or medicine until outside relief arrived and hospital tents were set up. Telegraph lines were severed and railway lines mangled, making communication immpossible. Most of Messina's officials were killed or gravely injured, along with almost the entire police force and soldiers of the garrison who perished when their respective barracks collapsed. Many officers in the garrison survived, their accommodation being more substantial. Prisoners who had escaped death when the prison fell began looting property and even robbing corpses of their jewellery. In Reggio an estimated 1,800 convicts died when the prison was destroyed. Peasants from nearby rural villages joined the looters. Troops were soon sent to the city and martial law was declared by General Feira Di Cossatto. Rescuers searched through the ruins for weeks, and whole families were still being pulled out alive days following the earthquake but thousands remained buried there. Buildings in the area had not been constructed for earthquake resistance, having been built out of small stones and carelessly-applied mortar with heavy tiled roofs, ornamental cornices, unsupported cross beams and vulnerable foundations on soft soil. Many of the edifices had four or five storeys. Relief efforts Port of Messina after the earthquake and tsunami News of the disaster was carried to Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti by Italian torpedo boats to Nicotera, where the telegraph lines were still working, but that was not accomplished until midnight at the end of the day. Rail lines in the area had been destroyed, often along with the railway stations. The Italian navy and army responded and began searching, treating the injured, providing food and water, and evacuating refugees (as did every ship). Giolitti imposed martial law with all looters to be shot, which extended to survivors foraging for food. King Victor Emmanuel III and Queen Elena arrived two days after the earthquake to assist the victims and survivors. The disaster made headlines worldwide and international relief efforts were launched. With the help of the Red Cross and sailors of the Russian and British fleets, search and cleanup were expedited. The Russian battleships Tsesarevich, and Slava and the cruisers Admiral Makarov, and Bogatyr, British battleship Exmouth and the cruisers Euryalus, Minerva, and Sutlej were ordered to provide assistance; the SS Afonwen was in Messina harbor during the quake (anchored in 45 fathoms (80 m) of water, but there were only 30 fathoms (55 m) when she sailed full of refugees). The French battleships Justice and V√©rit√©, and three torpedo boat destroyers were ordered to Messina. The U.S. Navys Great White Fleet and supply ships and were also ordered to assist. Other nations' ships also responded. Commemoration The King of Italy later awarded a commemorative medal for 1908 earthquake assistance, struck in gold, silver and bronze. Several streets in Messina have been named after the Russian sailors, including Largo dei Marinai Russi. In 2012, a monument to the Russian sailors, designed by Pietro Kufferle back in 1911, was installed in the city, and a bust of Emperor Nicholas II was opened in Taormina; subsequently, a bust of Admiral Fyodor Ushakov was set up in 2013. Aftermath= Reconstruction In the years following 1908, precautions were taken when the reconstruction of Messina began in 1909, building architecture that would be able to withstand earthquakes of variable magnitude, if one should strike again. Initially, authorities adopted a plan to demolish the remaining structures of Messina and transfer the city and its port elsewhere in Sicily but this was discarded after strong protests from the Messinesi. Among the few structures spared by the earthquake was the medieval Annunziata dei Catalani church. San Ranieri lighthouse, Forte del Santissimo Salvatore, Giovanni Montorsoli's Fountain of Neptune and the Barbera spinning mill which was later converted to a museum to house the art treasures salvaged from the ruins. The Real Cittadella, Matagrifone Castle and Monti di Pieta remained standing but sustained considerable damage. The 16th-century Church of Ringo in the fisherman's quarter of the same name along the northern Messina riviera withstood the shock and survives to date. The \\"Scalinata Santa Barbara\\" in the ancient quarter of Tirone and many of the houses known as \\" le mignuni\\" in local dialect, located in the slum of Avignone also survived relatively intact. In Reggio Calabria the Palazzo Nesci was one of the few 19th century structures to withstand the earthquake. The new city of Messina was constructed on the rubble of the old city using the plan of a modern layout of a \\"city regularly cut up like a checker board\\" with buildings of uniform size and height as presented in 1911 by architect Luigi Borzi. This necessitated the demolition of a number of edifices that were salvageable but did not conform to the new urban plan.Messina Kalos Luoghi di Sicilia. Supplement n.3 May‚ÄìJune 1997 edition. Published by Edizioni Ariete, Palermo. Engineer Pietro De Nava designed a similar modern checkerboard urban layout for Reggio Calabria. Relocation In the wake of the earthquake many of the homeless residents of Messina and Calabria were relocated to various parts of Sicily and other regions of mainland Italy. Others, including the majority of the survivors from the poverty-stricken Avignone quarter of Messina, were forced to emigrate to America. In 1909 the cargo ship Florida carried 850 such passengers away from Naples. Lost in a dense fog, the Florida collided with the Republic, a luxury passenger liner. Three people aboard the Florida were killed instantly. Within minutes, pandemonium broke out on the ship. The captain of the Florida, Angelo Ruspini, used extreme measures to regain control of the desperate passengers, including firing gunshots into the air. Eventually the survivors were rescued at sea and brought into New York Harbor where they would start a new life. Effects on society Survivors of the earthquake in Messina, circa 1909 The disaster affected the local economy and Messina faced a temporary depopulation after so many homeless survivors had sought refuge elsewhere; in particular Catania and Palermo where a large number found work as artisans. It has been estimated that only 19,000 remained with just 2000 in the old city centre. However, there was soon a huge influx of migrants, mostly from nearby Sicilian and Calabrian localities who were needed as necessary labourers for the reconstruction. According to the 1911 census the population of Messina had increased to 127,000. Among these were many Messinesi who had returned to their native city. Men notably outnumbered the women which resulted in a decrease in marriages. As late as the 1950s families were still living in the wooden barracks erected in the Tirone area to provide temporary housing for the homeless survivors. Because of its dearth of historical buildings due to the catastrophic 1908 earthquake, as well as the 1943 Allied bombardment during World War II, Messina has been called \\"the city without memory\\".

Today it is practiced by Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz in contemporary Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as diasporas in Bayan-√ñlgii Provinces Bayan-√ñlgii, Mongolia, and Xinjiang, China. Though these people are most famous for hunting with golden eagles, they have been known to train northern goshawks, peregrine falcons, saker falcons, and more.  Terminology  In both Kazakh and Kyrgyz, there are separate terms for those who hunt with birds of prey in general, and those who hunt with eagles. In Kazakh, both qusbegi and sayatshy refer to falconers in general. Qusbegi comes from the words qus (\\"bird\\") and bek (\\"lord\\"), thus literally translating as \\"lord of birds.\\" In Old Turkic, kush begi was a title used for the khan's most respected advisors, reflecting the valued role of the court falconer. Sayatshy comes from the word sayat (\\"falconry\\") and the suffix -shy, used for professional titles in Turkic languages. The Kazakh word for falconers that hunt with eagles is b√∫rkitshy, from b√∫rkit (\\"golden eagle\\"), while the word for those that use goshawks is qarshyghashy, from qarshygha (\\"goshawk\\"). In Kyrgyz, the general word for falconers is m√ºn√ºshk√∂r. A falconer who specifically hunts with eagles is a b√ºrk√ºtch√º, from b√ºrk√ºt (\\"golden eagle\\").

Because of its rapid growth and aggressive nature, it is categorised as a noxious weed in some regions. However, it is also a popular garden lawn species in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the southern region of California in the United States, as it is inexpensive and moderate drought-tolerant. In addition, it is useful as pasture for livestock grazing and serves as a food source for many avian species, including the long-tailed widowbird. The flowering culms are very short and \\"hidden\\" amongst the leaves, giving this species its specific epithet (clandestinum).  Description and habitat  Pennisetum clandestinum is a rhizomatous grass with matted roots and a grass-like or herbaceous habit. The leaves are green, flattened or upwardly folded along the midrib, long, and wide. The apex of the leaf blade is obtuse. It occurs in sandy soil and reaches a height of between . The species favours moist areas and frequently becomes naturalised from introduction as a cultivated alien. Rooted nodes send up bunches of grass blades. It is native to the low-elevation tropics of Kenya and environs, where it grows best in humid heat, such as the wet coastal areas. The description of this species was published by Emilio Chiovenda in 1903, and acknowledges an earlier, invalid, description made by C. F. Hochstetter.Hochstetter, C.F. ex Chiovenda, E. (1903) Annuario R. Istituto Botanico di Roma 8: 41, Fig. S/2 [tax. nov.]  As an invasive species  It has been introduced across Africa, Asia, Australia, the Americas, and the Pacific, where it is subject to eradication through management practices. The ease of cultivation, and the thickly matting habit, have made this species desirable for use as a lawn. In southern California in the United States, the grass is commonly used on golf courses since it is drought resistant and creates challenging rough. The famed Riviera Country Club and Torrey Pines Golf Course both use this grass and host tournaments on the PGA Tour. Other minor golf courses in southern California have kikuyu grass, many are in Long Beach: Lakewood, Skylinks, Big recreation, Little recreation, El Dorado, and others. The aggressive colonisation of natural habitat has resulted in this grass becoming naturalised in regions such Southwest Australia. It has high invasive potential due to its elongate rhizomes and stolons, with which it penetrates the ground, rapidly forming dense mats, and suppressing other plant species. It grows from a thick network of rhizomatous roots and sends out stolons which extend along the ground. It can climb over other plant life, shading it out and producing herbicidal toxins that kill competing plants. It prevents new sprouts of other species from growing, may kill small trees and can choke ponds and waterways. It is resistant to mowing and grazing due to its strong network of roots, which easily send up new shoots. It springs up in turfs and lawns, and can damage buildings by growing in the gaps between stones and tiles. The plant is easily introduced to new areas on plowing and digging machinery, which may transfer bits of the rhizome in soil clumps. While the grass spreads well via vegetative reproduction from pieces of rhizome, it is also dispersed via seed. Rhizomes that have reached very hard to reach places will continue to grow as separate plants if they are snapped off during the attempted removal process.

Licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to the nearby community of Aiken, South Carolina, the station broadcasts on 96.3 FM with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 17.5 kW. Its studios are located at the Augusta Corporate Center near the I-20/I-520 interchange in Augusta, and the transmitter tower is south of Edgefield, South Carolina. History WKSP signed on the air initially in Kingstree SC in the late 1960s WKSP stood for We're Kingstree A Sportsmans Paradise. It was owned by the Williamsburg Country Broadcasting Corp with ownership by HY Hodges, Montague Jacobs, and Edward F Seeger. At the age of 21, Edward F. Seeger became the youngest owner/operator of a radio station in the U.S. Under Seeger‚Äôs ownership, WKSP 1090 ( Kingstree, South Carolina) was recognized as the ‚ÄúStation of the Year\\" by the South Carolina Broadcasters Association and Seeger was named the Broadcaster of the Year with the prestigious Richard G Shafto Award. Williamsburg County Broadcasting sold the station to Gregory Knopp. Knopp was later convicted of trafficking in Cocaine and the FCC took the station's license and deleted the channel and frequency of 1090 which had been allocated to Kingstree SC. Following this the call letters were picked up by the owners of WPBM in Greenville SC, actually implementing those call letters in 1996. The station signed on at 95.9 FM as WLOW-FM on September 17, 1966. Then in 1980, it changed its call letters to WPBM in and branded its self as \\" Z-96\\". In 1986, the frequency was changed from 95.9 to 96.3 as the station increased its power and moved into Augusta. The station became WRXR with an Album Oriented Rock format under the handle \\"96-RXR\\". The station kept the format for the next decade. In the fall of 1996, WRXR flipped to Alternative rock as \\"96X\\". 96X never took off in the market in its 3 years on the air and was flipped to Urban Adult Contemporary in 1999 with the WKSP call letters. The call letters WKSP were previously assigned to station 1090 AM in Kingstree, SC which went off the air in the 1980s. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc..

He left home aged 17 to work as a sailor, but after two years, together with his brother, signed up to a factory in Saint Petersburg, which was then the capital of the Russian Empire. Seeking additional incomes, he became a night-shift guardian in a wrestling club and in this way was introduced to the sport. In 1910 Klein won his first title, at St. Petersburg Championships in the unlimited class. Besides the 1912 Olympics, he also competed at the 1913 World Championships, but withdrew due to a hand injury. The same year he won the Russian heavyweight title. During World War I he served in the Russian army and later took part in the Estonian War of Independence. In 1919 he became a wrestling coach and prepared Estonian wrestlers for the 1920 Olympics. At those Games he was also offered a place as a competitor, but refused in favor of his younger teammates. Klein continued coaching and competing in wrestling in Estonia until 1937. He died as a consequence of a hernia, which he developed when moving logs and was buried in the Tarvastu cemetery. Since 1962 an international Martin Klein Memorial in Greco-Roman wrestling is held in Viljandi, Estonia. Martin Klein's headstone in Tarvastu cemetery.

Comparison of the racist murders of Stephen Lawrence and Kelso Cochrane. Life Cochrane was born in Antigua and after a failed marriage in the United States in 1954 had moved to London, where he settled in Notting Hill and worked as a carpenter. He aimed to save sufficient money to study law. Death After fracturing his thumb in a work accident, he attended Paddington General Hospital. While walking home, shortly after midnight on 17 May 1959, the 32-year-old Cochrane was set upon by a gang of white youths, who stabbed him with a stiletto knife. Three other men arrived on the scene, and the youths ran off. The three men took Cochrane to hospital, where he died an hour later.Raphael Rowe, \\"Who killed Kelso Cochrane?\\" BBC News, 7 April 2006. His funeral procession on 6 June 1959, from St Michael and All Angels Church along Ladbroke Grove to Kensal Green Cemetery, was attended by more than 1,200 people.Steve Silver, \\"Who killed my brother?\\", Searchlight, May 2006.Mark Olden, \\"Stephen Lawrence and echoes of the past\\", Murder in Notting Hill. Context Notting Hill was at the time a stronghold for Oswald Mosley's Union Movement and Colin Jordan's White Defence League. The previous year, race riots had broken out in the area. The detective investigating the cases was initially convinced that the youths' motive was robbery, but Cochrane's lack of money was explained by his fianc√©e, as Cochrane himself had emptied his wallet that morning. Searchlight magazine claimed in 2006 that the police's public denial of any racist motive \\"was almost certainly a misguided attempt to ensure calm in the area\\". Local Union Movement member Peter Dawson later claimed to the Sunday People that it had been a group member who was responsible for the murder. Mosley himself later held a public meeting on the spot where Cochrane had been murdered. Following the murder, the British Government organised an investigation into race relations, chaired by Amy Ashwood Garvey.\\"Black History in Westminster\\" Aftermath From 1959, activist Claudia Jones organised events to celebrate Caribbean culture \\"in the face of the hate from the white racists\\", which are seen as forerunners of the first Notting Hill Carnival in 1964.Steve Silver, \\"The murder of Kelso Cochrane ‚Äì a postscript\\", 17 January 2011. A BBC Two television documentary broadcast on 8 April 2006 covered the first visit by Stanley Cochrane to England that year to try to find out more about his brother's death and ask for a police re-investigation. Steve Silver, who was in contact with the BBC researchers and wrote an article in Searchlight coinciding with the programme, later reported that he had been heard from Kelso Cochrane's daughter in the US and was able to put her in touch with her uncle. Cochrane's murder is believed to have led to a decline in support for Oswald Mosley, who was planning a return to politics in the UK. Mosley polled under 3,000 votes in Kensington North in the general election in October.Lloyd Bradley, Bass Culture: When Reggae Was King, Penguin Books, 2001 (), p. 114.

Notable events * Football matches were telecast in colour, following the official launch of colour television in Australia on March 1, 1975. In response to this, many clubs adopted brighter playing colours: changed its colours from maroon, blue and white to red, blue and gold; changed the primary colour of its guernsey from navy blue to royal blue; and other clubs, such as and adopted coloured home shorts to replace the black they had previously worn. * The centre square replaced the centre diamond (which had been used throughout the 1973 and 1974 VFL seasons). * There was a wild brawl in the Round 1 match between Hawthorn and North Melbourne involving 34 of the 36 players. Hawthorn's Don Scott and North Melbourne's Brad Smith did not participate. There were no reports from this match. * Footscray had three new, highly talented recruits from interstate in 1975: 183 cm centreman Peter Featherby from Subiaco Football Club in the West Australian National Football League (WANFL), 183 cm forward Ian Low from Manuka Football Club in the Canberra Australian National Football League (CANFL), and 190.5 cm forward- flanker Neil Sachse from North Adelaide Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). In an accidental collision in the Round 2 match against Fitzroy at the Western Oval, Neil Sachse was badly injured and became a quadriplegic. * On 17 June, Hawthorn announced that it had given full-forward Peter Hudson who had only played three and a half games for Hawthorn in three years, a clearance to Glenorchy. * The second quarter of the round 14 match between Carlton and Essendon at Windy Hill lasted almost 40 minutes, with Carlton scoring 14.1 (85) to Essendon's 4.1 (25) for a record quarter aggregate score of 18.2 (110). It is the first quarter to beat South Melbourne‚Äôs 1919 team record of 17.4 (106). **Near the end of the quarter, a massive brawl involving all 36 players erupted when Essendon centreman Neville Fields ran past Carlton forward Craig Davis and king-hit him in retaliation for some supposed earlier act of aggression against an Essendon player. Noticing the unconscious Davis, both Rod Ashman and Rod Austin ran to remonstrate with Fields, followed by their Carlton team-mates, and the fight was on. Carlton's Phillip Pinnell knocked out Essendon's Dean Hartigan. It took a long time for the match to resume. Field umpire Ian Robinson was showered with cans by spectators. Eight players were reported. Many more players would have been reported had the umpires been able to turn their attention elsewhere (the VFL responded to this problem by introducing two field umpires in the following season). The tribunal decisions were: ** Rod Ashman of Carlton was suspended for 4 weeks, for striking Neville Fields. ** Rod Austin of Carlton was suspended for 4 weeks, for striking Neville Fields. ** Phillip Pinnell of Carlton was suspended for 2 weeks, for striking Robin Close. ** David McKay of Carlton was found guilty of striking Laurie Moloney, and severely reprimanded. ** Ron Andrews of Essendon was found not guilty of striking David McKay. ** Robin Close of Essendon was suspended for 2 weeks, for striking Phillip Pinnell. ** Laurie Moloney of Essendon was suspended for 2 weeks, for charging Phillip Pinnell. ** Neville Fields of Essendon was found not guilty of striking Rod Austin. * At the end of the season, greatly dissatisfied with the approach of coach Des Tuddenham (especially his emphasis on \\"vigour\\" with players who were renowned for their skill), and disturbed by the fact that, under Tuddenham, Essendon had been involved in two massive brawls in two consecutive years, the committee of the Essendon Football Club sacked Tuddenham and paid out his contract. **Also, given the example of an injured John Nicholls in the 1973 Grand Final, and that of Tuddenham having his leg broken in the round 10 match against Richmond, Essendon now recognized the dangers of having its coach on the playing field and liable to injury.

It consists, from front to rear, of a hypodermic needle, two bilateral flexible \\"wings\\", flexible small-bore transparent tubing (often 20‚Äì35 cm long), and lastly a connector (often female Luer). This connector attaches to another device: e.g. syringe, vacuum tube holder/hub, or extension tubing from an infusion pump or gravity-fed infusion / transfusion bag/bottle. Newer models include a slide and lock safety device slid over the needle after use, which helps prevent accidental needlestick injury and reuse of used needles, which can transmit infectious disease such as HIV and viral hepatitis.  Use  A winged infusion set on the return arm during a plateletpheresis donation. During venipuncture, the butterfly is held by its wings between thumb and index finger. This grasp very close to the needle facilitates precise placement. The needle is generally inserted toward the vein at a shallow angle, made possible by the set's design. When the needle enters the vein, venous blood pressure generally forces a small amount of blood into the set's transparent tubing providing a visual sign, called the \\"flash\\" or \\"flashback\\", that lets the practitioner know that the needle is actually inside of a vein. The butterfly offers advantages over a simple straight needle. The butterfly's flexible tubing reaches more body surface and tolerates more patient movement. The butterfly's precise placement facilitates venipuncture of thin, \\"rolling\\", fragile, or otherwise poorly accessible veins. The butterfly's shallow-angle insertion design facilitates venipuncture of very superficial veins, e.g. hand, wrist, or scalp veins (hence name \\"scalp vein\\" set).  Needle size  Butterflies are commonly available in 18-27 gauge bore,Winged infusion Sets  Air-Tite Products 21G and 23G being most popular. In phlebotomy, there is widespread avoidance of 25G and 27G butterflies based on belief that such small-bore needles hemolyze and/or clot blood samples and hence invalidate blood tests. Contrary to this belief, theoretical calculation and in vitro experiment both showed the exact opposite: namely, that shear stress and hence hemolysis decrease with decreasing needle bore (but the decrease can be clinically insignificant). In agreement with these results, a subsequent clinical trial found that 21G, 23G, and 25G butterflies connected directly to vacuum tubes caused the same amount of hemolysis and gave the same coagulation panel test results.

Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore is a shipping port along the tidal basins of the three branches of the Patapsco River in Baltimore, Maryland on the upper northwest shore of the Chesapeake Bay. It is the nation's largest port facilities for specialized cargo (roll-on/roll-off ships) and passenger facilities operated by the Maryland Port Administration (MPA), a unit of the Maryland Department of Transportation.https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2018/06/11/officials-report- record-quarter-for-baltimore-port/ During a 2006 celebration of the port's 300th birthday, the port was renamed in honor of Helen Delich Bentley (1923‚Äì2016), a former longtime U.S. Representative (Congresswoman) to the United States Congress (1985‚Äì1995) from Baltimore. She was also a former maritime reporter/editor for The Baltimore Sun, local major daily newspaper. History In 1608, Captain John Smith traveled 170 miles from Jamestown (established the previous year) exploring the shores, rivers, creeks, and streams to the upper Chesapeake Bay towards the Susquehanna River, leading the first European expedition to the Patapsco River, named after the native Algonquian peoples who fished shellfish and hunted. English royal and proprietary land grants from 1661 were combined in 1702 by James Carroll who named it Whetstone Point because of the landform shape resembling a sharpening stone. The area is now known as Locust Point a residential and industrial area. The port was founded on this site in 1706 by the colonial General Assembly of the Province of Maryland and designated one of the official Port of Entry for the tobacco trade with the Kingdom of England. In 1729‚Äì1730, the point was incorporated into newly established Baltimore Town to the northwest at \\"The Basin\\" of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco. This area was later known as the Inner Harbor. In 1776 local citizenry erected earthworks for port defense during the American Revolutionary War known as Fort Whetstone. These port fortifications were replaced beginning in 1798. In addition Fort McHenry was expanded and reconstructed with brick and stone in a \\"star fort\\" shape. This work was conducted by the officers and engineers of the United States Army and its Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of War. History of Ft.

Looking north at growing City of Baltimore at \\"The Basin\\" (later Inner Harbor) of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River, with an early steamship with side paddlewheel docked below the heights of Federal Hill in 1849 with the Old Baltimore Cathedral (later Basilica of the Assumption of Mary) (to the left) and the Washington Monument (center) in the distance dominating the city. Fells Point, first named Long Island Point in 1670, is the deepest point in the natural harbor on the north shore of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco. It soon became the colony's main ship building center, with many shipyards, famed for the construction of the unique styled Baltimore clipper smaller sized sailing schooners. These were notorious as they were used by commerce raiders and privateers. This type of activity led to the British attack in September 1814, during the War of 1812 known as the Battle of Baltimore. It is noted for the famous bombardment of Fort McHenry as well as a land attack to the southeast at the Battle of North Point which attacked fortifications on the east side of town at Loudenschlager's and Potter's Hills (today's Hampstead Hill/Patterson Park). Fells Point was incorporated into old Baltimore Town in 1773. The Continental Navy ordered their first frigate warship, USS Virginia, from George Wells at Fells Point in 1775. The first ship named the U.S.F Constellation'' was produced at the Harris Creek shipyard east of Fells Point (the site of future neighborhood of Canton) by a master shipwright from Hingham, Massachusetts named David Stodder. The third USS Enterprise was built at Henry Spencer's shipyard. Over 800 ships were commissioned from Fells Point shipyards from 1784 to 1821. The California Gold Rush of 1848‚Äì1849 lead to many orders for fast vessels. Many overland pioneers also relied upon canned goods supplied from Baltimore factories. New cars waiting for shipment, 1973 After the founding of Baltimore the waterfront developed drydocks, warehouses, ship chandlers, as well as industry including mills were built behind the wharves. In what is now Canton, further southeast of Baltimore and Fells Point along the Patapsco River, John O'Donnell's plantation was developed in the early 1800s for worker housing and industry, including the Canton Iron Works owned by Peter Cooper and later Horace Abbott during the Civil War and others.Canton Timeline , John Cain, Canton Community Association, 2001; and Steam in Captivity, Mary Bellis, Your Guide to Inventors, c.2007. In 1828 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) began track laying eventually extending into Locust Point in 1845. The arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio and other railroads made the port a major transshipment point between inland points and the rest of the world. By the 1840s, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company (\\"Old Bay Line\\") was providing overnight steamship service down the Chesapeake Bay. After the Civil War, coffee ships were designed here for trade with Brazil. Other industrial activities in Canton included Baltimore Copper Smelting Company and small oil refineries, later purchased by Standard Oil. By the end of the nineteenth century, European ship lines had terminals for emigrants from Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Poland. Harbor channels and approaches Maintenance of harbor channels and navigation aids began early. Dredging in the harbor can be traced back as far as 1783, when the Ellicott brothers (of Ellicott Dredges) excavated the bottom at their wharf in the Inner Harbor. In 1790 the state government began systematic dredging using a \\"mud machine\\", which used a horse-drawn drag bucket, later upgraded with steam power. In 1825 Sen. Sam Smith of Maryland petitioned Congress for federal funding for this work. Aerial view of the port Port of Baltimore, 2014 At this time Congress was smarting from the incursions of the War of 1812 and had determined to expand naval defenses. In Baltimore it led to the misconceived construction of Fort Carroll, an island three-tiered brick fortification in the 1840s (similar to various other East Coast island forts built such as the famous Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, South Carolina), supervised by young Col. Robert E. Lee of the United States Army Corps of Engineers but federal dredging appropriations preceded that project, beginning in 1830. This first project was completed in 1838. In the 1850s a second dredging project was undertaken, this time under Capt. Henry Brewerton, who was also later in charge of the Fort Carroll project. He excavated a straight channel from Sparrows Point out to the mouth of the Patapsco near Seven Foot Knoll Light between North Point and Hawkins Point, which was erected in 1855; this channel, known today as the Brewerton Channel, continues to be the central link in the path into the harbor. In 1865 Maj. William P. Craighill took over as Baltimore District Engineer of the Corps of Engineers. His initial survey of the Brewerton Channel disclosed severe shoaling at the mouth of the river, and he excavated a new channel starting from the older channel at a point just northwest of Seven Foot Knoll and running south to the mouth of the Magothy River, where it turned to the south-southeast and continued to Sandy Point, just north of the present location of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. In the 1870s a cut-off channel was dug to ameliorate the turn between the old and new channels; the Brewerton Channel was also extended to provide a connection to the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. Enlarged and extended to access various facilities within the port, the Brewerton and Craighill Channels continue in use to the present, essentially unaltered in configuration. Federal lighthouse construction in the bay began in the 1820s, and one early project was the erecting of range lights to guide ships into the Patapsco. These lights, the North Point Range Lights, were lit in 1822, marking a path roughly the same as that of the current Craighill Cutoff Channel. Subsequent channel construction was followed shortly by light projects. Brewerton's channel was marked by the Hawkins Point and Leading Point lights, constructed in 1868 and converted to skeleton towers in 1924. The original (lower) Craighill Channel was marked with range lights in 1875, following two years of temporary lightships; the cutoff was marked with the upper range lights in 1886, replacing the North Point range, which had been discontinued in 1873. In later years a pair of skeleton towers were erected on Locust Point to mark the Fort McHenry Channel, the final leg from the end of the Brewerton Channel to Curtis Point and the Inner Harbor. All of these lights remain in use, though of course all have been automated. The Craighill Channel Lower Range Rear Light enjoys the distinction of being the tallest lighthouse in Maryland. In 2006, then-Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich participated in naming the port after Helen Delich Bentley during the 300th anniversary of the port. Current operations Currently the port has major ro-ro (roll-on roll-off) facilities, as well as bulk facilities, especially steel handling. The port handles around 700,000 vehicles per year. Most Mercedes-Benz cars that are imported into the U.S were handled here as well in 2004. In 2012, 36.7 million tons in foreign commerce (imports and exports), valued at $53.9 billion were handled by the port. The Port of Baltimore ranked 11th of 36 USA ports in handling of foreign tonnage and 9th in dollar value of the cargo handled during 2012. During the third quarter of 2017, the Port of Baltimore had a 15% increase in general cargo tons from the third quarter in 2016. Since 2014, the Port has become the fourth fastest-growing port in North America with a 9.8% increase in the amount of cargo handled from the previous year. It is currently ranked 8th of 36 US ports for gross tonnage and 7th in dollar valuehttps://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2017/11/20/port-of-baltimore-more- cargo-than-previous-year/http://mpa.maryland.gov/Pages/cargo-stats.aspx Facilities The Port of Baltimore includes five terminal areas: * Dundalk Marine Terminal.

Bush. Bloch served as United States Special Counsel from December 12, 2003, when Bush signed his appointment, filling out his five-year statutory term on December 11, 2008. Biography Bloch was born in New York City and grew up in Los Angeles, where his father, who used the name Walter Black, was a writer for a number of popular television shows. His grandfather was the painter, Albert Bloch. Scott Bloch worked as an associate and then partner for Stevens & Brand, LLP of Lawrence, Kansas between 1989 and 2001.accessed 13 March 2014 Beginning in 2001, Bloch worked as a political appointee in the Bush administration, first as deputy director to the Department of Justice's Task Force for Faith-based and Community Initiatives between 2001 and 2003, and then as Special Counsel, directing the Office of Special Counsel, which has jurisdiction to protect whistleblowers and enforce the Hatch Act (which restricts political activities of government employees). Bloch currently maintains a private law office in Washington, D.C. Bloch is a grandson of American modernist artist Albert Bloch, about whom he filmed a documentary in 2002.Biles, Jan. \\"Bloch on Bloch,\\" Lawrence Journal- World, 7 April 2002, accessed 10 November 2013. Bloch also served on the Founders' Committee of Wyoming Catholic College from 2002 to 2005, and is a member of the Knights of Malta and a local society of admirers of Hilaire Belloc.  Career  Bloch achieved a great deal of oversight while in the United States Office of Special Counsel, which was widely reported on during his five-year tenure, including aviation near miss cover ups and airworthiness safety check cover ups that caused the grounding of 1000 planes.NBC Nightly News, Tom Costello, March 2008, http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21134540 Bloch reversed a policy decision by his predecessor, on issues of sexual orientation, to make \\"sexual orientation\\" a protected category for discrimination cases in the federal government, contrary to controlling case law and statutory interpretation of the office of 20 years prior to her tenure.http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/769bpqpa.asp?page=2 Bloch's first major action as head of the Office of Special Counsel, was to choose as deputy a lawyer who had publicly taken a position against the \\"homosexual agenda\\", and to hire young lawyers from the conservative Ave Maria School of Law. Part of the job of the OSC is to protect whisleblowers. In February 2004, Bloch ordered all mention of sexual orientation workplace nondiscrimination be removed from OSC's website and printed materials, stating that his office lacked the authority to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\\"Gay Federal Workers Fear for Jobs\\", Washington Blade, February 20, 2004 Bloch's critics argued that gay employees were protected by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which prohibits discrimination against federal employees \\"on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee.\\"\\"Bloch to be Probed on Anti-Gay Bias\\", Washington Blade, October 20, 2005 After complaints from Congress,\\"Officials Question Appointee On Gay Bias\\", Washington Blade, February 27, 2004 the Bush Administration released a statement in April 2004 saying homosexual employees were still protected.\\"White House Rebukes OSC Director\\", Washington Blade, April 2, 2004 Bloch also issued a statement saying: \\"It is the policy of this administration that discrimination in the federal workforce on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited.\\" \\"Results of Legal Review of Discrimination Statute\\" , OSC press release, April 8, 2004 This did not satisfy gay rights organizations, which claimed a lack of enforcement of the policy.

There is no information for federal employees on how to file antigay bias complaints, as the site had contained prior to Bloch's tenure. The Federal GLOBE (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Employees of the Federal Government) then called for Bloch's resignation.\\"Federal GLOBE Joins Congressional Call to Fire OSC Head Scott Bloch\\", Federal GLOBE, October 7, 2004 Bloch later retracted his statements and stated his office did not have the legal authority to protect employees from workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  Alleged refusal to investigate complaints  Media sources, Congress, and gay rights organizations continued to criticize Special Counsel Bloch and the OSC's lack of enforcement of its policies, particularly in regards to dismissing gay discrimination complaints. For example, Michael Levine, a 65-year-old and openly gay radio technician, claimed that, after he blew the whistle on a coworker's and his supervisor's workplace misconduct, a personnel officer engaged in retaliatory action against him: pursuing knowingly false allegations of child pornography against Levine, suspending Levine for 14 days, seizing his computer, and referring to gay people as \\"those fucking faggots\\".\\"OSC Rejects Gay 'Whistleblower'\\", Washington Blade, March 4, 2005 One year after filing both a retaliation and antigay discrimination complaint with the OSC, Levine received a letter from the OSC on December 28, 2004. Without interviewing even a single witness, the OSC wrote that it was unable to investigate the complaints because only conduct, not sexual orientation, was protected under the Civil Service Act of 1978‚Äîa reversal of Bloch's April 8, 2004 statement that sexual orientation- based discrimination was prohibited due to imputed conduct and therefore that the OSC has the authority to pursue such complaints. After being embroiled in a related \\"internal purge\\" controversy (see below), Special Counsel Bloch testified before a Senate panel on May 24, 2005 and reiterated his original position that he lacked the authority to protect federal employees on the basis of sexual orientation.\\"Official Says Law Doesn't Cover Gays\\", Washington Post, May 25, 2005 The next day, the Log Cabin Republicans called on Bloch to resign.\\"Log Cabin Calls On Scott Bloch to Resign\\", Log Cabin Republicans, May 25, 2005 Bloch's defenders, including writers at the conservative magazine Human Events, argued that Bloch was being unfairly attacked.J. D'Agostino, \\"Five Myths About Scott Bloch,\\" Human Events, May 21, 2008, http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=26570  Reorganization or internal purge  In January 2005, controversy ensued when Bloch ordered twelve OSC staffers, including the only two known gay employees, to transfer to distant cities or lose their jobs.\\"2 Gays Among Those 'Purged' by OSC Boss\\", Washington Blade (January 28, 2005) Bloch was accused of conducting a political purge of OSC employees by three government watchdog groups (the Government Accountability Project, the Project on Government Oversight, and Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility), two federal trade unions (the American Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union), an LGBT rights organization (the Human Rights Campaign), and the OSC employees themselves.\\"Reorganization of Special Counsel's Office Raises Concerns in Congress\\", Washington Post, February 1, 2005 This prompted several government investigations concerning Bloch's performance as a public employee, including destruction of emails and lying to Congress about it. The Washington Blade reported that, according to unnamed sources \\"familiar with the agency\\", employees had been targeted partly because of their disagreement with diminishing the jurisdiction of the OSC in prosecuting antigay workplace discrimination.\\"Gay OSC Employee Fired For Refusing Transfer Order, Washington Blade (February 18, 2005) Another of the twelve employees had reached a favorable settlement on behalf of a gay federal employee who filed a discrimination complaint against his supervisor. In the end, ten of the twelve employees resigned.Amendment to Complaint of Prohibited Personnel Practices Against Special Counsel Scott Bloch , filed by the Project on Government Oversight (March 31, 2005) Meanwhile, according to complaints, at least one staffer who had been supportive of Bloch's interpretation was promoted. In October 2005, the US Office of Personnel Management ordered an investigation of claims that Special Counsel Bloch retaliated against employees who disagreed with his policies. Ironically, the OSC would ordinarily oversee such whistleblower disputes. The probe is also investigating whether Bloch showed an antigay bias in refusing certain whistleblower and discrimination claims. In February 2007, Bloch was again accused of unfair supervisor practices when several of his staffers complained they felt coerced into not cooperating with the OPM probe. Bloch's deputy issued a memo urging OSC employees to only meet with probe investigaters in a certain conference room and to report their interactions to their supervisors. Employees reported other attempts to obstruct the investigation including \\"suggestions that all witnesses interviewed ... provide Bloch with affidavits describing what they had been asked and how they responded.\\"\\"Special Counsel Accused of Intimidation in Probe\\", Washington Post February 16, 2007  Alleged improper deletion of emails on office computers  Bloch became most notorious for hiring \\"Geeks on Call\\", a private technological services company, to perform a \\"seven level swipe\\" of his home and office computers in 2007 after becoming involved in litigation with OSC subordinates who accused him of politically motivated harassment. This prompted several government investigations concerning Bloch's performance as a public employee, including destruction of emails and lying to Congress about it. Bloch pleaded guilty to criminal charges of contempt of Congress in 2010, but was allowed to withdraw that plea in 2011 after being sentenced by the U.S. Magistrate Judge to serve 30 days in jail in addition to other conditions, of which imprisonment (and public chastisement) his attorney, William M. Sullivan Jr. of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP and U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors had not expected. Bloch later pleaded guilty again in U.S. District Court, this time to the misdemeanor of destroying government property, and was sentenced in June 2013 to serve two years probation and a day in jail, as well as to pay a $5000 fine and devote 200 hours to community service.http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2013/06/former-bush-lawyer-to-spend- one-day-in-jail.html After the OSC settled with the disgruntled former employees concerning the 2006-2008 charges, the Inspector General of the Office of Personnel Management issued a report critical of Bloch's conduct in office.http://www.businessinsider.com/inspector-general-report-on-scott- bloch-2013-12http://www.govexec.com/oversight/2013/12/final-report-confirms- misconduct-bush-era-office-special-counsel/75756/ It is alleged that Scott Bloch erased the files on his office personal computer in 2007, and that the FBI tried to determine whether the emails were deleted improperly. The inspector general of the Office of Personnel Management examined the case at the urging of the White House. The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2007 that Bloch called the tech support service Geeks on Call for help deleting computer files instead of using his agency's own in-house computer technicians. Bloch confirmed that he contacted Geeks on Call, but insisted that it was to remove a computer virus. FBI raid and resignation On May 6, 2008, FBI agents raided Bloch's offices. NPR and the Wall Street Journal reported that the raids were in relation to an investigation into allegations of obstruction of justice by Bloch's office.FBI Raids Bush Official's Office The New York Times reported that the investigation concerned whether Bloch had hired an outside company to \\"scrub\\" computer files to prevent an inquiry into whether he had violated the Hatch Act by mixing politics with his job, which is to shield whistleblowers. As part of an investigation into destruction of evidence, Bloch's person was searched and two portable memory devices were recovered. On October 20, 2008, Bloch announced his intention to resign from his position as Special Counsel at the OSC on January 5, 2009. But his employment ended abruptly on October 23, during a meeting with White House officials. He was subsequently barred from entry to his office by the United States Federal Protective Service, which handles security at federal facilities.\\"Congress Daily: White House Fires Scott Bloch\\", \\"Talking Points Memo - Muckraker\\", October 23, 2008 Criminal conviction and subsequent litigation On April 27, 2010 Bloch pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal conviction for damage to property for, according to the U.S. Attorney, \\"willfully and unlawfully withholding pertinent information from a House committee investigating his decision to have several government computers wiped ....\\" Bloch was originally slated to be sentenced on July 20, 2010. However, the sentencing was postponed after watchdog groups objected to a plea deal which would likely have seen Bloch get only probation. Contempt of Congress carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison. On February 2, Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson ruled that Bloch faced a mandatory sentence of at least one month in prison.Hsu, Spencer. Bush whistle-blower protector faces jail. Washington Post, 2010-02-03. On June 24, 2013, U. S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins sentenced Bloch to 2 years probation which was terminated 1 year early.

History Mark Gillespie and his friend Jonathan Mansfield went to Mile End school in Stockport where, as Gillespie contends on the \\"Supersonic Wednesday\\" DVD, they were \\"the only ones being heterosexual\\". Teachers told them it would be helpful to gain life experience if they wanted to become successful actors. To do so, they hitch- hiked across Europe, which they financed by busking. They named their newly formed band \\"The Blue Jars\\" and toured through countries like Belgium, Germany, Norway, Sweden or finally Israel, where Mansfield stayed. After Gillespie returned from Israel, he mainly toured in Germany. While busking in the Lower Saxonian town G√∂ttingen, Gillespie caught the attention of Peter Herrmann, owner of a recording studio in Gie√üen. Being quite impressed by him, he offered Gillespie to record a CD that he could sell in the pedestrian zones while busking. Gillespie, being in a studio for the first time ever, sang his songs with musicians he had never met (Peter Herrmann had organised them), which resulted in his 1996 debut album, \\"Give it Time.\\" After the CD was done, it was sold very well and people asked for a concert with the band. A CD release concert followed, with Mark Gillespie as singer and guitarist, Peter Herrmann as bassist, Markus Leukel as drummer and Thomas Dill as lead guitarist. The audience and the band were enthusiastic, which galvanised the band into playing another concert and finally forming a band, the Mark Gillespie Band. The Mark Gillespie Band The band line-up remained unchanged for about a decade and yielded several live and studio albums. In 1997, they released their follow-up to the debut, \\"Live at the Traumstern '97.\\" Another live recording, \\"Exit\\", came in 1998, featuring acoustic performances of original and cover songs by Herrmann and Gillespie. In 1999, 2000, and 2002, the band released three studio albums: \\"Mindless People,\\" \\"I believe...,\\" and \\"Barefoot and Naked,\\" respectively. On 9 June 2004, the band returned to the \\"Traumstern\\" venue in Lich to record a live gig, later released on the CD/DVD set, \\"Supersonic Wednesday.\\" The CD and DVD were available separately and slightly varied in editing and track listing. In 2006, Gillespie ran a promotional campaign for his newsletter subscribers, releasing exclusive unreleased live recordings, videos, remixes, guest appearances and demos in regular intervals. At first, these were available for download as MP3 files, but due to legal complications, Gillespie had to switch to streaming some way into the campaign. \\"Unplugged,\\" a set of studio-recorded acoustic versions of original Gillespie songs and covers, was released in 2007, including several new songs. Over the years, guest musicians had occasionally joined the band as well, e.g. Jos√© Cortijo (\\"Percussion and all kinds of strange things\\"), Miriam Pfaff and Tess Wiley (Backing Vocals) on the 2004 DVD, \\"Supersonic Wednesday.\\" Since 2008 The band has been in a state of flux since 2008. By 2008, the members of the Band were Gillespie, Herrmann, Leukel, Oliver J√§ger (Keyboards), Gerd Stein (electric guitar), who replaced Dill (Dill left the band in February 2008), and Thomas Drost (flute), whom Mark got to know during a street music festival. Leukel parted ways with the band some time later as well. Mark Gillespie subsequently mostly performed on his own or in \\"Duo\\" gigs with Thomas Drost on the flute. Interspersed were occasional band performances. 2009 saw the release of the Mark Gillespie Band album, \\"In Your Hands,\\" comprising songs written and recorded over the period of several years and featuring the classic pre-2008 line-up. It was the first studio album not to feature an instrumental song. In 2011, Mark co-founded the Pink Floyd tribute band \\"Kings of Floyd\\", which he has been performing with since, in addition to his continued solo, duo and band performances. In 2012, Gillespie released \\"Real to Reel,\\" a live album pulled from performances with Thomas Drost. The album featured classic Gillespie material as well as cover versions of songs by Sting, Eric Clapton, The Beatles, Snow Patrol. It also featured two new songs, \\"Throw me a Line\\" and \\"The Friends you have Gained.\\" During 2013, Gillespie announced the band were planning to record a new album in the fall. Style, Personality Gillespie's musical style is largely acoustic and soft rock, but comprises influences from Jazz, Progressive Rock and various other genres. Fans of the band especially appreciate Gillespie's humor, spontaneity and talent for improvisation. Gillespie is known for his disfavour of German police and bureaucracy limiting independent artists' liberties to perform and express themselves.

Known today for his quarrels with Voltaire, Desfontaines can be regarded as the founder of the new literary criticism and journalism in France, insofar as he sought to found his criticism on aesthetic and ethical lines, rather than merely summarising, reproducing or paraphrasing. Biography Desfontaines entered the order of Jesuits after being raised by them, and taught rhetoric in Bourges before devoting himself exclusively to letters until 1715. In 1724, he became a contributor to the Journal des scavans, attempting to introduce an amenity of style into his scientific articles, avoiding dryness and pedantry. He then published, with various collaborators such as √âlie Fr√©ron, Granet, the Abb√© Destr√©es, periodical collections of criticism: Le Nouvelliste du Parnasse [The Short-Story Writer of Parnassus] (1731‚Äì1734, 5 vols.), and Observations sur les √©crits modernes Observations on modern writing (1735 on, 34 vols.). These hastily written periodicals distinguished themselves by the vivacity of their criticism and partisanship. Desfontaines notably attacked the dramatic works of Voltaire, who had earlier helped clear the abb√©'s name when, accused of sodomy, he spent time in prison in 1724, and had also used his influence to help him return to Paris after his exile. Voltaire retorted with a lampoon entitled Le Pr√©servatif, ou critique des Observations sur les √©crits modernes [The Condom, or criticism on Observations on modern writing] (1738), which Desfontaines answered anonymously with a short satirical writing entitled La Voltairomanie (1738), which compiled all the scandalous anecdotes defaming its author at the time. This last saw a libel action which Voltaire only gave up after Desfontaines repudiated the work in the Amsterdam Gazette of 4 April 1739. The war continued several years, so that today the memory of Desfontaines is only perpetuated by the epigrams of Voltaire, and those of Alexis Piron, a one-time ally of Voltaire who promised to bring the abb√© an epigram every morning, and did so for fifty days.

At the outbreak of World War I he was commanding officer of the British Royal Navy China Hong Kong submarine flotilla, and from 1915 assumed command of the British submarine flotilla in the Baltic. Later during the First World War and Russian revolution he was naval attach√© to the diplomatic staff of the British Embassy in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), Russia, where he met his death, while defending the British embassy premises. Early life and naval career Born in Duncannon, Ireland, he was the son of British army captain Francis Charles Cromie of the Hampshire Regiment (later Consul-General in Dakar, Senegal). His mother was the daughter of the Chief Constable of Pembrokeshire. Educated at Haverfordwest Grammar School in Wales and at the Britannia Royal Naval College where he became a cadet-in-lay in 1898; he joined HMS Repulse on passing out, and in 1900 as a midshipman of HMS Barfleur took part in the Seymour Expedition to China, for which he received the China War Medal with Peking clasp. Submarine Service In 1901, he was promoted to lieutenant rank, two years later he obtained four \\"first lieutenant\\" appointments. That same year in 1903, he volunteered to join the Royal Navy Submarine Service, and was one of the first officers to command a submarine. In 1906 he was awarded the bronze Royal Humane Society medal, while serving on submarine HMS A3 at Spithead, he tried to save a sailor who was swept overboard. From 1911-12 he commanded the depot ship HMS Onyx and a flotilla of submarines at Devonport, and in 1913-14 the depot ship HMS Rosario and the British China Hong Kong submarine flotilla. In August 1915 he commissioned the submarine HMS E19, the following month he forced a passage into the Baltic Sea to support the Russian Baltic Fleet, preying on iron ore transports from Sweden to the German Empire, where for a week long moment he had succeeded in entirely suspending German maritime traffic in the area. During his service in the Baltic, he torpedoed a German destroyer and on 7 November 1915 sank the German cruiser SMS Undine, as well as sinking or capturing 10 German steamships. Service distinction On 31 May 1916 he received the British Empire Distinguished Service Order (DSO), followed by a succession of imperial Russian orders; Order of St. Anna (2nd Class with Swords), Order of St. Vladimir (4th Class with Swords), Order of St. George (4th Class), as well as the French National Order of the Legion of Honour (Chevalier). Shortly after, he was promoted to the British Royal Navy rank of Commander. Diplomatic service in revolutionary Petrograd British naval attach√© Captain Cromie, socialising at a tennis club in Petrograd, 1918. Together with his knowledge of the Russian language and prevailing conditions, he was appointed in May 1917 naval attach√© to the British Embassy in the tense revolutionary city of Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), Russia. Highly respected among Russia's elite, his diplomatic tact, during the Russian revolution, earned him much respect from the extremists for his fairness. In April 1918, after the Germans had secured control over the Baltic coast, he was responsible for the evacuation and scuttling of the British Baltic submarines. Death defending the British embassy in Petrograd Prior to the embassy incident that involved his killing, Moscow authorities claimed to have received a report suggesting a connection between various counter-revolutionary organizations in the British government and the embassy in Petrograd, and the Bolshevik-government commissioner M. Hillier had been instructed to investigate this report. It had been supposed that the anti-Bolshevik counter-revolutionists Boris Savinkov and Maximilian Filonenko, who had contacts with British Secret Intelligence Service agents, were being aided and hiding in the British embassy. Other accounts and sources, however, reveal that meetings with other Russian members of the counter-revolution were at that time taking place, namely with the former imperial Tsarist officers Lieutenant Sabir and Colonel Steckelmann. On 31 August 1918, commissioner Hillier and a detachment of Cheka \\"scouts\\", the Bolsheviks secret police, went to the British embassy in Petrograd. On entering the building, shouting in Russian and crashing doors, which echoed up from the embassy ground floor where staff were working, Captain Cromie glanced out from his office first floor window, saw trucks and over on the Neva river patrol boats facing the embassy building with weapons trained. Clearly expecting trouble, he pulled out his revolver, and leaving a meeting with three operatives in his office, had gone out into the first floor hallway passage. Other accounts and sources, however, reveal Captain Cromie was having tea with the British Chaplain, Mr. Lombard, and he had stepped out of the room to return in a short moment. Some Cheka scouts were now also proceeding up onto the embassy first floor, panic and protests broke out, and they were met with gunfire, one Cheka scout was killed and another wounded. According to the Cheka scouts report of events and a dispatch received from Moscow quoting Russia's political newspaper Pravda; a fight had ensued in the corridor and the Cheka scouts were obliged to return gunfire. During the ferocious embassy shootout, naval attach√© Captain Cromie, received a fatal gunshot or gunshots, and eventually died where he fell, on the grand embassy staircase. Cheka scouts continued searching the embassy building, and with their rifle butts repelled embassy staff from getting close to the corpse of Captain Cromie, which the Cheka's had looted and trampled. The police then entered the British embassy, and 40 embassy persons were arrested, mostly British subjects, including Prince Schaschowsky. It was alleged that weapons and compromising documents were found on the embassy premises. British Foreign Office advices declared; attach√© Captain Cromie opposed the Bolshevik troops and killed three soldiers with his own hands. Captain Cromie was killed and his corpse mutilated. Documents at the embassy were destroyed. It was feared similar outrages will be committed against the French embassy in Petrograd and that precautionary measures had been taken including the arrival of French soldiers, the Foreign Office said. On 3 September 1918, American Consul Haynes (the first American Consul of career)Embassy of the United States, Helsinki, Finland. at Helsinki in Finland, officially reported the murder of Captain Cromie and attack on the British embassy to the United States Department of State, that the entire British embassy personnel in Petrograd had been arrested, and similar arrests had simultaneously taken place in Moscow. British outrage at embassy attack and killing The embassy attack and killing of naval attach√© Captain Cromie was reported with intense indignation by the British news media. The British media channeled outrage at the Bolsheviks \\"lawlessness\\" acts committed against British subjects and the murder of Captain Cromie, prompting reprisals. In London, the Bolshevik representatives Maxim Litvinov and his staff had been placed by the British government \\"under preventive arrest\\" and taken to Brixton Prison \\"until all British representatives in Bolshevik Russia had been set at liberty and allowed to proceed to the Finnish border unmolested.\\" Following events, the British embassy was subsequently shutdown, and the embassy staff were withdrawn from service in Petrograd. Witness recollection of events A firsthand recount, published in 1934 by Mary Britnieva, a Red Cross nurse who had served on the Eastern Front, recounts the events witnessed by her sister- in-law, who was in the British embassy at the time of the attack: :\\"My sister in law ran out into the hallway and as she emerged she saw Captain Cromie running down the steps two at a time, straight towards her. Behind him at the top of the stairs, stood a man firing at the Captain. Several bullets whizzed by her head and crashed through the glass of the entrance doors behind her. Her horror seemed to root her to the spot and suddenly, just as Captain Cromie reached the last stair, he pitched forward as if he had stumbled, staggered a little and then crashed down backwards with his head on the bottom step. My sister in law ran to him and lifted his head. He was moving his eyelids and she felt something warm trickling down the fingers of her right hand with which she was holding up his head from underneath. Suddenly a terrific blow made her drop Captain Cromie‚Äôs head and sent her spinning against the right hand wall. The man who had struck her grabbed her and ran her up the stairs hitting her violently from time to time and finally pushing her into the Chancery room where she found all of the members of the Embassy and the Consulate standing with hands raised above their heads. After being searched for arms, the Embassy staff were forced to hand over their papers and then marched downstairs and on to the street.\\" Marriage Francis Cromie married Gladys (Gwladys) Catherine Josephine (n√©e Cromie) March 1907, in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England.United Kingdom Marriage Registry No.: 2b 867, Portsmouth, Hampshire, England, March 1907; between Francis Newton Allen Cromie and Gladys (Gwladys) Catherine Josephine Cromie.

When threatened by the Pala ruler Mahpala-I, this Kamboja Dharmapala appears to have sought friendship and help with Rajendra Chola against the Pala ruler by forming an alliance with Rajendra Chola and presenting him a valuable Ratha (Chariot) as a token of friendship. As a consequence, Rajendra Chola led his victorious northern expedition to the banks of the Ganges and also met Dharmapala in Dandabhukti. This demonstrates Kamboja rulers' weakened position and Rajendra Chola's political influence in Bengal. Some scholars, however, think that ‚ÄúKamboja king sent his ratha as a friendly present to Rajendra Chola to avoid war with the latter\\".Proceedings of the Indian Science Congress, 1953, p 10, Indian Science Congress Association, Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal).

Its mechanism of action involves interruption of the binding of cellular initiation factor proteins involved in the translation of transcribed mRNA at the ribosome. The inhibition of these initiation factors prevents the initiation and translation of many proteins whose functions are essential to the rapid growth and proliferation of cancer cells.  Reaction mechanism  4EGI-1 mimics the action of a class of cellular regulatory molecules that naturally inhibit the binding of two initiation factors necessary for interaction of transcribed mRNA with the subunits of ribosomal complexes. These naturally occurring regulatory molecules, or binding proteins (BPs), bind to eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E, preventing its association with eIF4G, another initiation factor. These two proteins, under unregulated conditions, form a complex, known as eIF4F, which associates with the 5‚Äô cap of mRNA and the ribosomal subunits. eIF4E BPs (4E-BPs), as small polypeptides, consist of the same amino acid sequence as the portion of eIF4G that interacts with eIF4E. 4EGI-1 thus prevents the proper association of mRNA, carrying the coded message of transcribed genes, with the ribosome, the cellular component necessary for the translation of those genes into functional proteins. Naturally occurring 4E-BPs are regulated by a protein kinase, mTOR, which through phosphorylation deactivates the binding affinity of 4E-BPs for the eIF4E protein.  Binding site specifics and effects of use  4EGI-1, like 4E-BP polypeptides, displaces eIF4G by associating with a binding site on eIF4E. Not only does the synthetic molecule prevent the association between the two initiation factors, but by binding to a different portion of eIF4E via the same motif, it has been shown to actually increase the binding affinity of eIF4E for endogenous (originating within an organism) 4E-BP1. The Harvard research group leading the study screened 16,000 compounds, looking for one that would displace a fluorescein-labeled peptide derived from the eIF4G sequence that binds to the eIF4E form at the same site. Eventually they turned up 4EGI-1, which displaced eIF4G by binding to a smaller subset of its binding site (on eIF4E). The newly found molecule had the added advantage of enhancing 4E-BP1 binding, a surprise given that this molecule is also believed to bind eIF4E via the same motif. It appears that by displacing the eIF4G sequence without blocking the entire binding interface of eIF4E, 4EGI-1 is able to clear the ‚Äúdocking site‚Äù of the endogenous regulator.  Cap-dependent vs. initiation factor-independent translation  One caveat to the function of 4EGI-1 and thus the entire class of 4E-BP regulatory proteins is that both the synthetic and naturally occurring molecules are effective at inhibiting only cap-dependent translation, not initiation factor-independent translation. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are transcribed from DNA, and serve as templates for the synthesis of proteins by ribosomal translation. Weak mRNAs contain long and highly structured untranslatable regions at their 5‚Äô end. This lengthy region makes it difficult for enzymes to determine where transcription should begin. As a result, initiation factor proteins are required for translation of the message into protein. These weak mRNAs, or mRNAs that carry the code for proteins involved in the development of cancer cells, require cap-dependent translation which necessitates the cellular involvement of the eIFs. Examples of weak mRNAs include those that code for proliferation-related, and anti-apoptotic proteins. Strong mRNAs, in contrast, are translated with much less cellular machinery such as eIFs and generally code for biologically necessary proteins, such as those needed for the essential metabolic processes of a cell. Therapies such as the use of 4EGI-1 against cancer cells can thus be created such that their biologic targets include only the initiation factors involved in the production of weak mRNA‚Äôs. Cap-dependent translation involves a series of steps that join the small and large ribosomal subunits at the start codon of mRNA. The initiation factor complex eIF4F is dependent upon the presence of a 5‚Äô mRNA cap upstream from the start codon in order to initiate translation. Initiation factor independent translation does not require the association of initiation factors with the 5‚Äô cap of mRNA. As an alternative, the associated ribosomal units are moved to the start location by internal ribosome entry site trans acting factors (ITAFs). It has been found that several cellular proteins that respond to apoptotic signals are translated in this fashion.  Techniques of discovery  When attempting to identify biological molecules that would disrupt the formation of the F complex, researchers developed a high-throughput fluorescence polarization (FP)-binding assay. In this assay, a small peptide of a known sequence was synthesized and tagged with a fluorescent molecule. This traceable peptide of sequence KYTYDELFQLK binds to the binding site of endogenous 4E-BPs on eIF4E. 16,000 compounds of known chemical composition were then tested in this assay. Compounds that displace the labeled peptide from eIF4E would yield a decrease in fluorescence polarization. The sequence of 4EGI-1 was such that it displaced the labeled peptide, thus demonstrating its affinity for the complex binding site on eIF4E.

It is part of Grant Township, in Keweenaw County. Located approximately three miles from the mainland, it encompasses around . Manitou has seen limited impact from human activity, due to its remote location and the often-treacherous waters caused by a strong current at the peninsula‚Äôs tip. It is mostly forested, with scattered bogs and an inland lake known as \\"Perch Lake.\\" Dense underbrush can make travel around the island rather difficult, though a few unimproved trails do exist. The Keweenaw Land Trust protects of the island as the Manitou Island Light Station Preserve. History Test pits have been found on the island, hinting at a short-lived past as a possible mining site. Though trees abound, Manitou's remoteness and its lack of quality timber make logging economically unfeasible. Commercial fisherman have used the island as a camping site in the past, staying overnight on the south beaches while setting their nets in the area. Today public access is facilitated by a timber and rock crib dock near the old lighthouse. Beginning in 2002, Manitou Island became the focus of an effort by local birdwatchers to explore and document the various avian species there. Approximately 203 separate species have been recorded, including large numbers of migratory raptors and waterbirds. Observers have also compiled a \\"list of over 80 species as at least possible breeders.\\" Organized observations by the Keweenaw Audubon Society are now happening regularly.Manitou Island Bird Survey. Efforts to investigate this unique habitat and its feathered residents are ongoing, in conjunction with the conservation activities of the Land Trust. The large number of avian visitors should be understood in the larger context of other sites around Michigan and the Great Lakes. This would include Peninsula Point Light, Tawas Point State Park and Whitefish Point Light/Whitefish Point Bird Observatory (which contains a lighthouse configured like this one). Important Bird Areas are found in many parts of Michigan. Lighthouses=Manitou Island Light Station Manitou Island's most important use to date has been the Manitou Island Light Station on its eastern tip. First built in 1849, this lighthouse is still in use, although it is unmanned and solar powered. The island is presently in the custody of the Keweenaw Land Trust, which acquired the Light Station and surrounding land in 2004. The new owners have announced plans to encourage public use of Manitou through camping, rock collecting, hiking, boating, kayaking, fishing, and sightseeing at the old light station, while preserving the island's unspoiled scenery and natural habitats.Keweenaw Land Trust. Gull Rock Gull Rock, a tiny islet about one-half mile off Manitou's western tip, contains a historic lighthouse built in 1867 which still functions (like the Manitou light) as an unattended navigational aid.

History St. Mary's was founded as a \\"North Memphis\\" mission chapel by the Ladies' Educational and Missionary Society of Calvary Church (the city's first Episcopal parish) with oversight from Calvary's rector, Charles Quintard, who later became the second bishop of the Diocese of Tennessee. Quintard led the chapel's first service on Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 1857. An item in the Memphis Appeal, dated November 29, describes the occasion: > The Mission Church on Poplar Street. This Church which has been erected by > the pious zeal of the ladies belonging to the Episcopal Church of this city > was organized Thanksgiving Day by the election of wardens and vestrymen. The > Church is called St. Mary's, and the Reverend Richard Hines has been chosen > rector. Mr. Hines has arrived in the city and will preach at St. Mary's this > morning. The seats are all free, the expenses of the Church are defrayed by > the offering of the congregation. Unlike its mother church, Calvary, this new parish would not have designated family pews or charge rent for them, enabling less affluent Memphians to regularly attend Episcopal services for the first time. St. Mary's was officially consecrated as a parish church on Ascension Day, May 13, 1858, by the Rt. Rev. James Hervey Otey, the first Bishop of Tennessee, with assistance from the rectors of Calvary and Grace (Memphis), St. Luke's (Jackson), St. Mary's (Covington), St. James (Bolivar), and by the new parish's own rector, Richard Hines, who would remain there until 1871. First Episcopal cathedral in the South (1871) Thirteen years after its founding, St. Mary's became the first Episcopal cathedral in the American South. While the 1866 Journal of the Proceedings of the Diocese of Tennessee's 34th convention and the national Episcopal Church's 1868 Journal of the General Convention both list St. Mary's as a cathedral church, the official transition from parish to \\"bishop's church\\" was January 1, 1871. At the time, only a handful of Episcopal dioceses had adopted the English-style cathedral system, mostly in the Midwest and the western frontier, where semi-itinerant bishops required more tangible ecclesiastical bases from which to administer sparse, but expansive, new dioceses and missionary territories. While the Episcopal Church was once a part of the Church of England, the American dioceses were slow to designate official cathedrals in keeping with the Protestant or Reformed character of its members. But as the Oxford Movement's \\"high church\\" or Roman Catholic- style liturgy began to take root in the United States, Episcopal cathedrals began to appear. With a devoted high churchman as its bishop (Quintard), the Diocese of Tennessee became an early adopter of this trend. Relief center during 1878 yellow fever epidemic Memphis suffered periodic epidemics of yellow fever, a mosquito-borne hemorrhagic viral infection (related to dengue fever and Ebola) throughout the 19th century. The worst of the epidemics occurred in the summer of 1878, when 5,150 Memphians died and the fast-growing city lost its charter due to depopulation. Five years earlier, a group of Episcopal nuns from the recently formed Sisters of St. Mary (now the Community of St. Mary) were invited by Bishop Quintard to come to Memphis and take over operation of the St. Mary's School for Girls, now called St. Mary's Episcopal School, which had been relocated to the cathedral site. When the 1878 epidemic struck, a number of priests and nuns (both Protestant and Catholic), physicians, and even a bordello owner, Annie Cook, stayed behind to tend to the sick and dying, despite the high risk of contracting the disease, which often resulted in a painful death. St. Mary's had become a relief center, staffed by the Sisters of St. Mary and Episcopal priests from various parishes. The nuns' superior, Sister Constance, along with three other nuns and two priests, died at the cathedral from yellow fever. They are known throughout the Anglican Communion as \\"Constance and Her Companions\\" or, informally, the \\"Martyrs of Memphis\\". Added to the Episcopal Church's Lesser Feasts and Fasts in 1981, their feast day (September 9) commemorates their sacrifices. A traditional Anglican prayer memorializes the martyrs in this way: > We give thee thanks and praise, O God of compassion, for the Heroic witness > of Constance and her companions, who, in a time of plague and pestilence, > were steadfast in their care for the sick and the dying, and loved not their > own lives, even unto death. Inspire in us a like love and commitment to > those in need, following the example of our Savior Jesus Christ...

Schuyler, newly ordained assistant rector at Parsons' prior parish, Holy Innocents Episcopal Church, Hoboken, New Jersey The Very Rev. George Harris, dean of the cathedral, survived his bout with yellow fever, as did Sister Hughetta (n√©e Snowden), who immediately succeeded Constance as sister superior and remained head of the order's work in Tennessee until 1925. \\"New\\" cathedral building, 1926 Construction of its present Gothic Revival structure began in 1898 and was completed in 1926, when the parenthetical phrase \\"(Gailor Memorial)\\" was appended to the cathedral's formal name in honor of the Rt. Rev. Thomas Frank Gailor, Bishop of Tennessee and president of the National Council of the Episcopal Church. Response to the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. King memorial at Westminster AbbeyThe second historic/tragic event that St. Mary's Cathedral attempted to mitigate was the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. two miles from the church. The day after King's death, Memphis clergy from many churches and synagogues met at the cathedral. In an impromptu move, Dean William Dimmick (later Bishop of Northern Michigan and co-author of certain rites in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer) took up the cathedral's processional cross and led the assembled ministers down Poplar Avenue to City Hall to petition Mayor Henry C. Loeb to end the labor standoff that King was in town to help negotiate. (The sanitation workers were protesting unsafe conditions, abusive white supervisors, low wages and the city government's refusal to recognize their union). Nearly half of the cathedral's membership left during the following months, many in protest of Dimmick's gesture of racial unity. Like Constance and her companions, King was added to the Episcopal Church's Calendar of Saints, where he is commemorated on April 4 (or, as an alternate date, January 15). Elsewhere in the Anglican Communion, King is memorialized with a statue over the western entrance of Westminster Abbey, along with nine other 20th-century martyrs. Diocese of West Tennessee Episcopal Diocese of West Tennessee The Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee spanned the entire state until 1982, when it began a long-considered partition based on the State of Tennessee's three Grand Divisions. The Episcopal Diocese of West Tennessee was created in 1982, with St. Mary's retained as its cathedral church. The Continuing Diocese of Tennessee was again split in 1985 when the Episcopal Diocese of East Tennessee was formed. Each of the three realigned dioceses retained an important legacy of the old statewide body: West Tennessee had St. Mary's Cathedral; the diocese in Middle Tennessee retained the name \\"Diocese of Tennessee\\" and the status as the Episcopal Church's sixteenth diocese; and the East Tennessee diocese welcomed Bishop William Evan Sanders, eighth bishop of Tennessee, as its own first bishop. (Sanders served as the dean of St. Mary's from 1947 until 1961, when he became bishop coadjutor and moved to Knoxville to help manage the statewide diocese's work in East Tennessee.) Ironically, while St. Mary's was the South's first Episcopal cathedral, Tennessee's other two cathedrals, Christ Church (Nashville) and St. John's in Knoxville are both older parishes, having been organized in 1829 with the original formation of the Diocese of Tennessee.

He was influential in developing and promoting the literary style known as magical realism. Life Bontempelli graduated from the University of Turin in 1903. He taught elementary school for seven years, doing his writing on the side, but abandoned teaching for journalism when he could not secure a position at a secondary school. He served as a war correspondent during World War I. After the war, he settled in Milan and became interested in the literary styles of futurism and magical realism. In 1926, he, along with Curzio Malaparte, founded the journal \\"900\\". James Joyce, Max Jacob, and Rainer Maria Rilke sat on the editorial committee and Virginia Woolf and Blaise Cendrars were among the contributors. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Bontempelli was close to the fascism. He served as a secretary of the fascist writers' union and spent time abroad lecturing on Italian culture. However, in 1938 he refused to accept a university post formerly held by a Jewish professor and was kicked out of the Fascist party, drifting towards Communism. After World War II, Bontempelli won a Senate race on the Popular Democratic Front ticket but the results were voided when his fascist ties were discovered. In 1953, Bontempelli's \\"L'amante Fedele\\" won the Strega Prize, Italy's most prestigious literary award. After years of declining health, Bontempelli died in Rome in 1960.

The term \\"super-Earth\\" refers only to the mass of the planet, and so does not imply anything about the surface conditions or habitability. The alternative term \\"gas dwarfs\\" may be more accurate for those at the higher end of the mass scale, although \\"mini-Neptunes\\" is a more common term.  Definition  Artist's impression of the super-Earth exoplanet LHS 1140b. In general, super-Earths are defined by their masses, and the term does not imply temperatures, compositions, orbital properties, habitability, or environments. While sources generally agree on an upper bound of 10 Earth masses (~69% of the mass of Uranus, which is the Solar System's giant planet with the least mass), the lower bound varies from 1 or 1.9 to 5, with various other definitions appearing in the popular media. The term \\"super-Earth\\" is also used by astronomers to refer to planets bigger than Earth-like planets (from 0.8 to 1.25 Earth-radius), but smaller than mini-Neptunes (from 2 to 4 Earth- radii). This definition was made by the Kepler space telescope personnel. Some authors further suggest that the term Super-Earth might be limited to rocky planets without a significant atmosphere, or planets that have not just atmospheres but also solid surfaces or oceans with a sharp boundary between liquid and atmosphere, which the four giant planets in the Solar System do not have. Planets above 10 Earth masses are termed massive solid planets, mega- Earths,Astronomers find a new type of planet: The 'mega-Earth' or gas giant planets, depending on whether they are mostly rock and ice or mostly gas.  Discoveries  Illustration of the inferred size of the super-Earth Kepler-10b (right) in comparison with Earth  First  Kepler Planet Candidates ‚Äì based on 2,740 candidates orbiting 2,036 stars as of November 4, 2013 (NASA) The first super-Earths were discovered by Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail around the pulsar PSR B1257+12 in 1992. The two outer planets (Poltergeist and Phobetor) of the system have masses approximately four times Earth‚Äîtoo small to be gas giants. The first super-Earth around a main-sequence star was discovered by a team under Eugenio Rivera in 2005. It orbits Gliese 876 and received the designation Gliese 876 d (two Jupiter-sized gas giants had previously been discovered in that system). It has an estimated mass of 7.5 Earth masses and a very short orbital period of about 2 days. Due to the proximity of Gliese 876 d to its host star (a red dwarf), it may have a surface temperature of 430‚Äì650 kelvins and be too hot to support liquid water.  First in habitable zone  In April 2007, a team headed by St√©phane Udry based in Switzerland announced the discovery of two new super-Earths within the Gliese 581 planetary system, both on the edge of the habitable zone around the star where liquid water may be possible on the surface. With Gliese 581c having a mass of at least 5 Earth masses and a distance from Gliese 581 of 0.073 astronomical units (6.8 million mi, 11 million km), it is on the \\"warm\\" edge of the habitable zone around Gliese 581 with an estimated mean temperature (without taking into consideration effects from an atmosphere) of ‚àí3 degrees Celsius with an albedo comparable to Venus and 40 degrees Celsius with an albedo comparable to Earth. Subsequent research suggested Gliese 581c had likely suffered a runaway greenhouse effect like Venus. Mass and radius values for transiting super-Earths in context of other detected exoplanets and selected composition models. The \\"Fe\\" line defines planets made purely of iron, and \\"H2O\\" for those made of water. Those between the two lines, and closer to the Fe line, are most likely solid rocky planets, while those near or above the water line are more likely gas and/or liquid. Planets in the Solar System are on the chart, labeled with their astronomical symbols.  Others by year  2006 = Two further super-Earths were discovered in 2006: OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb with a mass of 5.5 Earth masses, which was found by gravitational microlensing, and HD 69830 b with a mass of 10 Earth masses. = 2008 = The smallest super-Earth found as of 2008 was MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb. The planet was announced by astrophysicist David P. Bennett for the international MOA collaboration on June 2, 2008. This planet has approximately 3.3 Earth masses and orbits a brown dwarf. It was detected by gravitational microlensing. In June 2008, European researchers announced the discovery of three super-Earths around the star HD 40307, a star that is only slightly less massive than our Sun. The planets have at least the following minimum masses: 4.2, 6.7, and 9.4 times Earth's. The planets were detected by the radial velocity method by the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) in Chile. In addition, the same European research team announced a planet 7.5 times the mass of Earth orbiting the star HD 181433. This star also has a Jupiter-like planet that orbits every three years. = 2009 = Planet COROT-7b, with a mass estimated at 4.8 Earth masses and an orbital period of only 0.853 days, was announced on 3 February 2009. The density estimate obtained for COROT-7b points to a composition including rocky silicate minerals, similar to the four inner planets of the Solar System, a new and significant discovery. COROT-7b, discovered right after HD 7924 b, is the first super-Earth discovered that orbits a main sequence star that is G class or larger. The discovery of Gliese 581e with a minimum mass of 1.9 Earth masses was announced on 21 April 2009. It was at the time the smallest extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star and the closest in mass to Earth. Being at an orbital distance of just 0.03 AU and orbiting its star in just 3.15 days, it is not in the habitable zone, and may have 100 times more tidal heating than Jupiter's volcanic satellite Io. A planet found in December 2009, GJ 1214 b, is 2.7 times as large as Earth and orbits a star much smaller and less luminous than our Sun. \\"This planet probably does have liquid water,\\" said David Charbonneau, a Harvard professor of astronomy and lead author of an article on the discovery. However, interior models of this planet suggest that under most conditions it does not have liquid water. By November 2009, a total of 30 super-Earths had been discovered, 24 of which were first observed by HARPS. = 2010 = Discovered on 5 January 2010, a planet HD 156668 b with a minimum mass of 4.15 Earth masses, is the least massive planet detected by the radial velocity method. The only confirmed radial velocity planet smaller than this planet is Gliese 581e at 1.9 Earth masses (see above). On 24 August, astronomers using ESO's HARPS instrument announced the discovery of a planetary system with up to seven planets orbiting a Sun-like star, HD 10180, one of which, although not yet confirmed, has an estimated minimum mass of 1.35 ¬± 0.23 times that of Earth, which would be the lowest mass of any exoplanet found to date orbiting a main-sequence star. Although unconfirmed, there is 98.6% probability that this planet does exist. The National Science Foundation announced on 29 September the discovery of a fourth super-Earth (Gliese 581g) orbiting within the Gliese 581 planetary system. The planet has a minimum mass 3.1 times that of Earth and a nearly circular orbit at 0.146 AU with a period of 36.6 days, placing it in the middle of the habitable zone where liquid water could exist and midway between the planets c and d. It was discovered using the radial velocity method by scientists at the University of California at Santa Cruz and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. However, the existence of Gliese 581 g has been questioned by another team of astronomers, and it is currently listed as unconfirmed at The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. = 2011 = On 2 February, the Kepler Space Observatory mission team released a list of 1235 extrasolar planet candidates, including 68 candidates of approximately \\"Earth-size\\" (Rp < 1.25 Re) and 288 candidates of \\"super-Earth-size\\" (1.25 Re < Rp < 2 Re). In addition, 54 planet candidates were detected in the \\"habitable zone.\\" Six candidates in this zone were less than twice the size of the Earth [namely: KOI 326.01 (Rp=0.85), KOI 701.03 (Rp=1.73), KOI 268.01 (Rp=1.75), KOI 1026.01 (Rp=1.77), KOI 854.01 (Rp=1.91), KOI 70.03 (Rp=1.96) ‚Äì Table 6] A more recent study found that one of these candidates (KOI 326.01) is in fact much larger and hotter than first reported. Based on the latest Kepler findings, astronomer Seth Shostak estimates \\"within a thousand light- years of Earth\\" there are \\"at least 30,000 of these habitable worlds.\\" Also based on the findings, the Kepler Team has estimated \\"at least 50 billion planets in the Milky Way\\" of which \\"at least 500 million\\" are in the habitable zone. On 17 August, a potentially habitable super-Earth HD 85512 b was found using the HARPS as well as a three super-Earth system 82 G. Eridani. On HD 85512 b, it would be habitable if it exhibits more than 50% cloud cover. Then less than a month later, a flood of 41 new exoplanets including 10 super- Earths were announced. On 5 December 2011, the Kepler space telescope discovered its first planet within the habitable zone or \\"Goldilocks region\\" of its Sun-like star. Kepler-22b is 2.4 times the radius of the earth and occupies an orbit 15% closer to its star than the Earth to the Sun. This is compensated for however, as the star, with a spectral type G5V is slightly dimmer than the Sun (G2V), and thus the surface temperatures would still allow liquid water on its surface. On 5 December 2011, the Kepler team announced that they had discovered 2,326 planetary candidates, of which 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Compared to the February 2011 figures, the number of Earth-size and super-Earth-size planets increased by 200% and 140% respectively. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars, marking a decrease from the February figure; this was due to the more stringent criteria in use in the December data. Artist's impression of 55 Cancri e in front of its parent star. On 2011, a density of 55 Cancri e was calculated which turned out to be similar to Earth's. At the size of about 2 Earth radii, it was the largest planet until 2014 which was determined to lack a significant hydrogen atmosphere. On 20 December 2011, the Kepler team announced the discovery of the first Earth-size exoplanets, Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20. Planet Gliese 667 Cb (GJ 667 Cb) was announced by HARPS on 19 October 2009, together with 29 other planets, while Gliese 667 Cc (GJ 667 Cc) was included in a paper published on 21 November 2011. More detailed data on Gliese 667 Cc were published in early February 2012. = 2012 = In September 2012, the discovery of two planets orbiting Gliese 163 was announced. One of the planets, Gliese 163 c, about 6.9 times the mass of Earth and somewhat hotter, was considered to be within the habitable zone. = 2013 = On 7 January 2013, astronomers from the Kepler space observatory announced the discovery of Kepler-69c (formerly KOI-172.02), an Earth-like exoplanet candidate (1.5 times the radius of Earth) orbiting a star similar to our Sun in the habitable zone and possibly a \\"prime candidate to host alien life\\". In April 2013, using observations by NASA's Kepler mission team led by William Borucki, of the agency's Ames Research Center, found five planets orbiting in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star, Kepler-62, 1,200 light years from Earth. These new super-Earths have radii of 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.9 times that of Earth. Theoretical modelling of two of these super-Earths, Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f, suggests both could be solid, either rocky or rocky with frozen water.Indian Express On 25 June 2013, three \\"super Earth\\" planets have been found orbiting a nearby star at a distance where life in theory could exist, according to a record-breaking tally announced on Tuesday by the European Southern Observatory. They are part of a cluster of as many as seven planets that circle Gliese 667C, one of three stars located a relatively close 22 light years from Earth in the constellation of Scorpio, it said. The planets orbit Gliese 667C in the so-called Goldilocks Zone ‚Äî a distance from the star at which the temperature is just right for water to exist in liquid form rather than being stripped away by stellar radiation or locked permanently in ice. = 2014 = In May 2014, previously discovered Kepler-10c was determined to have the mass comparable to Neptune (17 Earth masses). With the radius of 2.35, it is currently the largest known planet likely to have a predominantly rocky composition. At 17 Earth masses it is well above the 10 Earth mass upper limit that is commonly used for the term 'super-Earth' so the term mega-Earth has been proposed. YouTube However, in July 2017, more careful analysis of HARPS-N and HIRES data showed that Kepler-10c was much less massive than originally thought, instead around 7.37 (6.18 to 8.69) with a mean density of 3.14 g/cm3. Instead of a primarily rocky composition, the more accurately determined mass of Kepler-10c suggests a world made almost entirely of volatiles, mainly water. = 2015 = On 6 January 2015, NASA announced the 1000th confirmed exoplanet discovered by the Kepler space telescope. Three of the newly confirmed exoplanets were found to orbit within habitable zones of their related stars: two of the three, Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, are near- Earth-size and likely rocky; the third, Kepler-440b, is a super-Earth. On 30 July 2015, Astronomy & Astrophysics said they found a planetary system with three super-Earths orbiting a bright, dwarf star. The four-planet system, dubbed HD 219134, had been found 21 light years from Earth in the M-shaped northern hemisphere of constellation Cassiopeia, but it is not in the habitable zone of its star. The planet with the shortest orbit is HD 219134 b, and is Earth's closest known rocky, and transiting, exoplanet. = 2016 = In February 2016, it was announced that NASA Hubble Space Telescope had detected hydrogen and helium (and suggestions of hydrogen cyanide), but no water vapor, in the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e, the first time the atmosphere of a super-Earth exoplanet was analyzed successfully. In August 2016, astronomers announce the detection of Proxima b, an Earth-sized exoplanet that is in the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun. Due to its closeness to Earth, Proxima b may be a flyby destination for a fleet of interstellar StarChip spacecrafts currently being developed by the Breakthrough Starshot project. = 2018 = In February 2018, K2-141b, a rocky ultra-short period planet (USP) Super-Earth, with a period of 0.28 days orbiting the host star K2-141 (EPIC 246393474) was reported. Another Super-Earth, K2-155d, is discovered. In July 2018, the discovery of 40 Eridani b was announced. At 16 light-years it is the closest super-Earth known, and its star is the second-brightest hosting a super-Earth. = 2019 = In July 2019, the discovery of GJ 357 d was announced. 31 light years from the Solar System, the planet is at least 6.1 . Solar System The Solar System contains no known super-Earths, because Earth is the largest terrestrial planet in the Solar System, and all larger planets have both at least 14 times the mass of Earth and thick gaseous atmospheres without well- defined rocky or watery surfaces; that is, they are either gas giants or ice giants, not terrestrial planets. In January 2016, the existence of a hypothetical super-Earth ninth planet in the Solar System, referred to as Planet Nine, was proposed as an explanation for the orbital behavior of six trans-Neptunian objects, but it is speculated to also be an ice giant like Uranus or Neptune. However, with its refined model in 2019 constraining it to around 5 Earth masses, it is most likely to be a super-Earth.The Search for Planet Nine findplanetnine.com February 26, 2019  Characteristics = Density and bulk composition  thumbComparison of sizes of planets with different compositions Due to the larger mass of super-Earths, their physical characteristics may differ from Earth's; theoretical models for super-Earths provide four possible main compositions according to their density: low- density super-Earths are inferred to be composed mainly of hydrogen and helium (mini-Neptunes); super-Earths of intermediate density are inferred to either have water as a major constituent (ocean planets), or have a denser core enshrouded with an extended gaseous envelope (gas dwarf or sub-Neptune). A super-Earth of high density is believed to be rocky and/or metallic, like Earth and the other terrestrial planets of the Solar System. A super-Earth's interior could be undifferentiated, partially differentiated, or completely differentiated into layers of different composition. Researchers at Harvard Astronomy Department have developed user-friendly online tools to characterize the bulk composition of the super-Earths.www.astrozeng.com A study on Gliese 876 d by a team around Diana Valencia revealed that it would be possible to infer from a radius measured by the transit method of detecting planets and the mass of the relevant planet what the structural composition is. For Gliese 876 d, calculations range from 9,200 km (1.4 Earth radii) for a rocky planet and very large iron core to 12,500 km (2.0 Earth radii) for a watery and icy planet. Within this range of radii the super-Earth Gliese 876 d would have a surface gravity between 1.9g and 3.3g (19 and 32 m/s2). However, this planet is not known to transit its host star. The limit between rocky planets and planets with a thick gaseous envelope is calculated with theoretical models. Calculating the effect of the active XUV saturation phase of G-type stars over the loss of the primitive nebula-captured hydrogen envelopes in extrasolar planets, it's obtained that planets with a core mass of more than 1.5 Earth- mass (1.15 Earth-radius max.), most likely cannot get rid of their nebula captured hydrogen envelopes during their whole lifetime.H. Lammer et al. \\"Origin and loss of nebula-captured hydrogen envelopes from \`sub¬¥- to \`super- Earths¬¥in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars\\", Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Oxford University Press. Other calculations point out that the limit between envelope-free rocky super-Earths and sub-Neptunes is around 1.75 Earth-radii, as 2 Earth-radii would be the upper limit to be rocky (a planet with 2 Earth-radii and 5 Earth-masses with a mean Earth-like core composition would imply that 1/200 of its mass would be in a H/He envelope, with an atmospheric pressure near to ).Eric D. Lopez, Jonathan J. Fortney \\"Understanding the Mass-Radius Relation for Sub-Neptunes: Radius as a Proxy for Composition\\" Whether or not the primitive nebula-captured H/He envelope of a super-Earth is entirely lost after formation also depends on the orbital distance. For example, formation and evolution calculations of the Kepler-11 planetary system show that the two innermost planets Kepler-11b and c, whose calculated mass is ‚âà2 M‚äï and between ‚âà5 and 6 M‚äï respectively (which are within measurement errors), are extremely vulnerable to envelope loss. In particular, the complete removal of the primordial H/He envelope by energetic stellar photons appears almost inevitable in the case of Kepler-11b, regardless of its formation hypothesis. If a super-Earth is detectable by both the radial-velocity and the transit methods, then both its mass and its radius can be determined; thus its average bulk density can be calculated. The actual empirical observations are giving similar results as theoretical models, as it's found that planets larger than approximately 1.6 Earth-radius (more massive than approximately 6 Earth-masses) contain significant fractions of volatiles or H/He gas (such planets appear to have a diversity of compositions that is not well-explained by a single mass-radius relation as that found in rocky planets).Courtney D. Dressing et al. \\"The Mass of Kepler-93b and The Composition of Terrestrial Planets\\"Leslie A. Rogers \\"Most 1.6 Earth-Radius Planets are not Rocky\\" After measuring 65 super-Earths smaller than 4 Earth- radii, the empirical data points out that Gas Dwarves would be the most usual composition: there is a trend where planets with radii up to 1.5 Earth-radii increase in density with increasing radius, but above 1.5 radii the average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating that these planets have a large fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core.Lauren M. Weiss, and Geoffrey W. Marcy. \\"The mass-radius relation for 65 exoplanets smaller than 4 Earth radii\\"Geoffrey W. Marcy, Lauren M. Weiss, Erik A. Petigura, Howard Isaacson, Andrew W. Howard and Lars A. Buchhave. \\"Occurrence and core-envelope structure of 1-4x Earth-size planets around Sun- like stars\\"Geoffrey W. Marcy et al. \\"Masses, Radii, and Orbits of Small Kepler Planets: The Transition from Gaseous to Rocky Planets\\" Another discovery about exoplanets' composition is that about the gap or rarity observed for planets between 1.5 and 2.0 Earth-radii, which is explained by a bimodal formation of planets (rocky Super-Earths below 1.75 and sub-Neptunes with thick gas envelopes being above such radii). Additional studies, conducted with lasers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and at the OMEGA laboratory at the University of Rochester show that the magnesium-silicate internal regions of the planet would undergo phase changes under the immense pressures and temperatures of a super-Earth planet, and that the different phases of this liquid magnesium silicate would separate into layers.  Geologic activity  Further theoretical work by Valencia and others suggests that super-Earths would be more geologically active than Earth, with more vigorous plate tectonics due to thinner plates under more stress. In fact, their models suggested that Earth was itself a \\"borderline\\" case, just barely large enough to sustain plate tectonics. However, other studies determine that strong convection currents in the mantle acting on strong gravity would make the crust stronger and thus inhibit plate tectonics. The planet's surface would be too strong for the forces of magma to break the crust into plates.  Evolution  New research suggests that the rocky centres of super-Earths are unlikely to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of the Solar System because they appear to hold on to their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope. Theoretical models show that Hot Jupiters and Hot Neptunes can evolve by hydrodynamic loss of their atmospheres to Mini-Neptunes (as it could be the Super-Earth GJ 1214 b),Charbonneau, David et al. (2009), A super-Earth transiting a nearby low-mass star, Nature 462, p.891‚Äì894 or even to rocky planets known as chthonian planets (after migrating towards the proximity of their parent star). The amount of the outermost layers that is lost depends on the size and the material of the planet and the distance from the star. In a typical system a gas giant orbiting 0.02 AU around its parent star loses 5‚Äì7% of its mass during its lifetime, but orbiting closer than 0.015 AU can mean evaporation of the whole planet except for its core.Sotin, Christophe; Grasset, O.; Mocquet, A. (2013), Are terrestrial exoplanets Earth-like, Venus- like, or the remnants of gas- or ice-giants?, American Astronomical Society. The low densities inferred from observations imply that a fraction of the super-Earth population has substantial H/He envelopes, which may have been even more massive soon after formation. Therefore, contrary to the terrestrial planets of the solar system, these super-Earths must have formed during the gas-phase of their progenitor protoplanetary disk.  Temperatures  Since the atmospheres, albedo and greenhouse effects of super-Earths are unknown, the surface temperatures are unknown and generally only an equilibrium temperature is given. For example, the black-body temperature of the Earth is 255.3 K (‚àí18 ¬∞C or 0 ¬∞F ). It is the greenhouse gases that keep the Earth warmer. Venus has a black-body temperature of only 184.2 K (‚àí89 ¬∞C or ‚àí128 ¬∞F ) even though Venus has a true temperature of 737 K (464 ¬∞C or 867 ¬∞F ). Though the atmosphere of Venus traps more heat than Earth's, NASA lists the black-body temperature of Venus based on the fact that Venus has an extremely high albedo (Bond albedo 0.90, Visual geometric albedo 0.67), giving it a lower black body temperature than the more absorbent (lower albedo) Earth.  Magnetic field  Earth's magnetic field results from its flowing liquid metallic core, but in super-Earths the mass can produce high pressures with large viscosities and high melting temperatures which could prevent the interiors from separating into different layers and so result in undifferentiated coreless mantles. Magnesium oxide, which is rocky on Earth, can be a liquid metal at the pressures and temperatures found in super-Earths and could generate a magnetic field in the mantles of super-Earths.Super- Earths Get Magnetic 'Shield' from Liquid Metal, Charles Q. Choi, SPACE.com, November 22, 2012 02:01pm ET, That said, super-Earth magnetic fields are yet to be detected observationally.  Habitability  According to one hypothesis,Better Than Earth, Ren√© Heller, Scientific American 312, January, 2015 super-Earths of about two Earth masses may be conducive to life. The higher surface gravity would lead to a thicker atmosphere, increased surface erosion and hence a flatter topography. The end result could be an \\"archipelago planet\\" of shallow oceans dotted with island chains ideally suited for biodiversity. A more massive planet of two Earth masses would also retain more heat within its interior from its initial formation much longer, sustaining plate tectonics (which is vital for regulating the carbon cycle and hence the climate) for longer. The thicker atmosphere and stronger magnetic field would also shield life on the surface against harmful cosmic rays.Box 1 Super-Earths' Big Benefits for Life, Ren√© Heller, Scientific American 312, January, 2015  See also     References  External links  * * Category:Types of planet ","title":"Super-Earth"},{"id":"10883905","title":"Frank Buxton"},{"id":"10883910","text":"Vilis LƒÅcis (May 12, 1904 ‚Äì February 6, 1966) was a Latvian writer and communist politician. LƒÅcis was born JƒÅnis Vilhelms LƒÅce into a working-class family in Vecmƒ´lgrƒÅvis (now part of Riga). During World War I, his family fled to the Altai region in Siberia, where LƒÅcis studied at the pedagogical seminary in Barnaul. In 1921, LƒÅcis returned to Riga and at various times worked as a fisherman, port worker, ship's fireman and librarian while writing in his free time. In 1933, he published his hugely successful novel Zvejnieka dƒìls ('Fisherman's Son'), making him one of the most popular and commercially successful Latvian writers of the 1930s. His novels have been characterized as popular fiction, not always liked by high-brow critics, but widely read by ordinary people. Throughout this period, LƒÅcis maintained underground ties to the officially banned Communist Party of Latvia. LƒÅcis was under periodic surveillance by the Latvian secret services due to his political activities. Eventually LƒÅcis became a favorite of Latvian president Karlis Ulmanis, who personally ordered the destruction of the surveillance files on LƒÅcis. LƒÅcis wrote newspaper editorials highly favorable of the Ulmanis regime, while still remaining a Communist supporter, and Ulmanis's government generously funded LƒÅcis's writing and a film adaptation of 'Fisherman's Son'. During the Soviet period, eight films based on LƒÅcis's works were produced, including a new adaptation of 'Fisherman's Son' in 1957. After Latvia was incorporated in the USSR in August 1940, LƒÅcis became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Latvian SSR (nominally, Prime Minister) and served in this position from 1940 to 1959. When Nazi Germany occupied Latvia from 1941 to 1944, LƒÅcis was evacuated to Moscow, where he continued to write in a socialist realist style. He was regarded mostly as a figurehead, as most of the actual decisions were made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party. As first Minister of the Interior and then Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, he must take personal responsibility for the Stalinist deportations and other aspects of the police state, and signed orders for the arrest and deportation of over 40,000 people. From 1954 to 1958, LƒÅcis also served as Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities. He was awarded the Order of Lenin seven times and the Stalin Prize twice, in 1949 and 1952. LƒÅcis's books have been translated into more than 50 languages, with translations into Russian being the most numerous. He remains the most translated Latvian writer.

It was released in June 2007 in Japan. It is a spin-off of the Katamari Damacy series, the second game on a portable system and the third game produced without the involvement of series creator Keita Takahashi. This version of the game uses a unique method of control, by making use of a new software technology called GestureTek EyeMobile to make phones capable of detecting tilt and vibration via the built in camera on the P904i. The player moves the katamari ball forward, backwards, left and right by tilting the phone. There are traditional controls as an option to the default motion controls. Katamari Damacy Mobile came pre-installed on P904i model phones. Other phone models needed to download the game through the Bandai Namco Games channel. Gameplay In Katamari Damacy Mobile, the player controls a highly‚Äìadhesive ball called the katamari. The object is to make the katamari as large as possible by running over and collecting objects of increasing size. The more objects players collect, the larger the katamari becomes. Instead of using analog controllers to control the katamari as in the home console Katamari games, players roll the katamari by tilting the phone in the direction they want the katamari to go. Criticism Many have noted similarities between the 904i series of phones using motion controls similar to the Wii Remote. DoCoMo's 904i series, however, calculates tilt based on digital camera images; unlike the Wii and PS3 controllers which use different motion sensing technologies. An IGN review of EyeMobile-compatible 3D Tilt-a- World warns that this type of motion control fails \\"if your movements are too sudden for the game to translate\\" and that the setup requires \\"a well-lit area so the camera can get a good 'fix' on an image.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Katamari Mobile & P904i Info & Videos *IGN Game Page *Joystiq article announcement *DoKoMo's Official Website Mobile Category:Namco games Category:Mobile games Category:Bandai Visual Category:2007 video games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Katamari Damacy Mobile"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},F={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your libraryü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",F,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",H]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/68.md","filePath":"quotesmag/68.md"}'),I={name:"quotesmag/68.md"},E=Object.assign(I,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{D as __pageData,E as default};
