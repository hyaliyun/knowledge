It was released by RCA Records in 1987 and was the last of Newton's albums to appear on the Billboard charts. Overview Juice Newton began her recording career in 1975 but did not achieve major stardom until the release of her 1981 album Juice. The album was a crossover success and yielded three hit singles, \\"Angel of the Morning\\", \\"Queen of Hearts\\", and \\"The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)\\". The last of these peaked at number one on the Billboard Country Chart. She followed Juice with Quiet Lies (1982), an album that brought her two more hits, \\"Love's Been a Little Bit Hard on Me\\" and \\"Break It to Me Gently\\", of which the latter earned her the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. Newton's 1985 album Old Flame was her country breakthrough, spawning three number one hits \\"You Make Me Want to Make You Mine\\", \\"Hurt\\", and the duet with Eddie Rabbitt \\"Both to Each Other (Friends & Lovers)\\" and also three additional Top Ten hits: \\"Old Flame\\", \\"Cheap Love\\", and \\"What Can I Do with My Heart\\". Regarding her music Newton stated in 1987, \\"It's country-rock or pop-country or Nashville rock or some word like that, but I feel it\`s the same kind of music that Fleetwood Mac was. To me, that music was folk-rock.\\" Emotion was released by RCA Records in 1987. It was the last of Newton's albums to appear on Billboard's Top Country album chart and peaked at number 59. The album had two single releases. \\"First Time Caller\\" peaked at number 24 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart on September 12, 1987, while \\"Tell Me True\\" peaked at number 8 on the same chart on February 27, 1988. Also featured on the album are \\"Emotions\\", a song originally recorded by Brenda Lee that peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1961, and \\"'Til You Cry\\", which later became a hit for country singer Eddy Raven, peaking at number 4 on the Hot Country Songs chart in 1989. In discussing Emotion, music historian Neil Daniels noted: :With Emotion, Newton chose not to follow in the country rock footsteps of Old Flame and instead opted for a more dulcet, thoughtful sounding release. Emotion's more upbeat songs are \\"Tell Me True\\" and \\"Walkin' Into Trouble\\", with the rest of the material being a far more quiet affair such as the beautiful \\"First Time Caller\\". Nevertheless her vocals are truly magnetic. Other standout performances include \\"The Old Bye And Bye\\", written by her longtime collaborator Otha Young and a rich version of Deborah Allen's \\"If I Didn‚Äôt Love You\\". \\"I Still Love You\\" and \\"Someone Believed\\" are both sung with enviable passion. Emotion is a daunting album rich in emotional texture and a mellow vibe. It was misunderstood upon its original release.

The novel is set during 2016 but because the main detective is in the Historic Case Unit (HCU) the crimes being investigated were actually committed in 1994 and 1996. Synopsis Detective Chief Inspector Karen Pirie walks the streets of Leith in the small hours. She cannot sleep as her lover and colleague, Phil Parhatka, was killed in the last outing in this series (The Skeleton Road). At night she encounters displaced Syrian refugees in alleyways and under bridges gathered together to try and be a community, as since coming to Scotland, they have nowhere to meet up. In 2016, a group of joyriders crash their stolen vehicle and the driver ends up in intensive care. The DNA of the offender leads Pirie to an unsolved rape/murder of a hairdresser from Partick in 1996. Tina McDonald was on a night out with some friends in Glasgow when she disappeared from the group before being found dead the next morning. A supposed suicide of Gabriel, a Kinross man, also leads to Karen unofficially opening a cold case on a 1994 aircraft crash. The aircraft contained 4 people, the pilot was an MP and one of the passengers was Gabriel's mother. It was always believed that an incendiary device had caused the aircraft to crash and that the IRA were responsible. As Karen digs deeper, she finds more and more and comes to believe that the terrorists were far from responsible. Amongst all of this, Karen has to come to terms with Phil's death, worry about her young, na√Øve colleague who makes errors in judgment and procedure, whilst combatting the open dislike that her superior, Assistant Chief Constable Lees, has for her. She even finds the time and opportunity to help the refugees. Critical reception In The Press and Journal, Roddy Brooks noted the determination of the main character and said that McDermid was a writer at the height of her game. David Knights, writing for the Keighley News, said that whilst the novel was a very satisfying police procedural, it lacked the tension of the Tony Hill novels and was not in the same league as A Place of Execution. Janette Wolf, writing in The Independent, gave the book 3 stars out of 5. Wolf noted that DCI Pirie has a tendency to handout nicknames and that Pirie seemed to have a lot of obliging friends in the right places to get her access and information. That said, Wolf described the book as satisfyingly involved and compelling.

Eberts work was being shown as \\"Americana\\" at galleries and shows. He developed his technique in watercolors and gouache on smoothly textured illustration board. The unusual combination of techniques allowed him to capture the full detail of glass, chrome and leather. In 1981, he showed his work at the Meadow Brook Concours d'Elegance. Here he met five other artists specializing in automotive subjects. They decided to start an organization to promote recognition of a new genre: \\"automotive art.\\"Monterey Herald August 12, 2015 James Raia The name of the organization became the Automotive Fine Art Society (AFAS). The organization's goal is to raise the standards of automotive art to a level of acceptance as serious fine from the perspective of collectors and critics. Since 1986, an 8000 sq. ft. exhibit area presents member works as attendees enter the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. In addition to its annual presence for 30 years in Pebble Beach, the AFAS is also a mainstay presenter at the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance in Amelia Island, Fla.

Holland Road Railway Bridge History The station had the status of a halt and opened on 3 September 1905 on the west side of the bridge carrying Holland Road over the West Coastway Line. It was one of a series of halts opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) on the West Coastway line between and Worthing for its new railmotor service which sought to \\"counteract the adverse effect the new electric tramways were having\\" on passenger numbers. Other halts were opened at Dyke Junction, , Bungalow Town and Ham Bridge. Services commenced on 3 September 1905 and the single-coach units were successful in raising traffic figures. Holland Road Halt was situated just beyond the overbridge at the west end of Holland Road goods yard which closed on 14 June 1971. The site of the station corresponded roughly to that of the original Hove station which closed in 1880. The halt was built with timber platforms, which it retained until its closure, and also had wooden steps from the overbridge to the platforms.

History  Jos√© de Anchieta The \\"College of the Fathers\\", as it was initially known, was founded on 13 January 1890. Fr. Francisco Trappe received from Rome permission to buy the house of the Fialho family, located at Church Street (now Duque de Caxias). In the beginning, the College of the Fathers was intended only for boys, divided into two sections, German and Brazilian. In its first year of operation, the number of students began at 42 and rose to 80. The boys were ages 9 through 12, and were only admitted if they could read. In 1897 the College of the Fathers changed its name to St. Joseph, and then to Anchieta Gymasium. It progressed gradually. The current name Anchieta College was adopted in 1901, at the suggestion of the then director Conrado Menz, in tribute to Jos√© de Anchieta. Anchieta College grew and required more space than it had on Duque de Caxias Street. The growth of Porto Alegre also put pressure on the requirements. In 1954 a plot on Nile Pecanha Avenue was bought and a new school was built. A new church was added in 1967.

According to the European Union‚Äôs standards, youth unemployment refers to people of age between 15 and 24. Italy displays one of the highest rates of youth unemployment among the 35 member countries of the Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). The Italian youth unemployment rate started raising dramatically since the 2008 financial crisis reaching its peak of 42.67% in 2014. In 2017, among the EU member states, the youth unemployment rate of Italy (35.1%) was exceeded by only Spain and Greece. The Italian youth unemployment rate was more than the double of the total EU average rate of 16.7% in 2017. While youth unemployment is extremely high compared to EU standards, the Italian total unemployment rate (11.1%) is closer to EU average (7.4%).  Statistics  Youth unemployment in Italy is quantified by many measures. According to the World Bank, the youth unemployment rate is 34.726% as of September 27, 2018. Throughout Italy's history of tracking youth unemployment (1983 to 2018), the average percentage has been 30%. Between 1994 and 2000, youth unemployment averaged 33% In certain regions of Italy, especially the southern region of Calabria, the unemployment rate is higher than the rest of the country. As of 2017, Calabria has the highest rate of youth unemployment in the country with 55.6% of the population unemployed between the ages of 15 and 24. In contrast, the 2017 statistic for the lowest rate of youth unemployment was recorded in the northern region of Italy in Trentino-South Tyrol at 14.4%. In 2017, nearly 1 in 5 young Italians were considered to be in the group of unemployed, not looking for employment, and not enrolled in school. In 2017, young Italian families were shown to have a stronger chance of living without income or in complete poverty. Nearly 60% of these families belonged to the generalized group of \\"new entrants\\", or rather workers that were attempting to join the labor market for the first time. These young Italians and their families are nearly 3.5 times more likely to be unemployed than older Italians. When compared to the ratio of Germany (1.5 times more likely), young Italians have a much higher chance to remain unemployed. Jobs for young Italians are in great demand in Italy, with certain financial positions receiving 85,000 applications and accepting only 30 candidates. Certain Italian hospital positions have received 7,000 applications and accepted only 10 candidates. These examples of limited employment positions are representative of the day- to-day conditions that young Italians face when searching for employment. Historically, 40.3% of 15‚Äì24 year-olds who were actively part of the labor force were unemployed in 2015. 22% of the same population had been unemployed for 12 or more months, meaning more than half of the unemployed active Italian youth had been so long-term. Yet another subset of the youth population is neither in employment nor in education and training (NEET), which in 2015 represented 21.4% of Italy's 15‚Äì24 year-olds. In addition to complete unemployment, Italian youth also have high levels of underemployment. The number of 15‚Äì24 year-olds who worked full-time (30 hours per week) dropped from 1,597,000 in 2000 to 676,000 in 2015, while the number of part-time workers increased from 172,000 to 237,000 people. Furthermore, 83.7% of the young part-time workers in 2015 did so involuntarily because they could not find full-time employment.  Causes  Since the recent financial crisis ended, there was an increase in unemployment rates by 20 percent in several nations in Europe. There were soaring rates of youth unemployment across the countries reaching 40 to 50 percent. While poor outcomes of labour market are driven due to general economic state and cyclical factors, wide literature highlighted the crucial role played in institutions of the labour market for unemployment (Nifo & Vecchione, 2014). The generous reflection of benefit systems or highly restricted regulations of employment protection can be blamed for the overall persistence and magnitude of unemployment. Further ahead, some nations tend to perform well with respect to the overall employment in comparison with the youth unemployment. One basic notion of the literature review regarding the impact of institutions on unemployment is relative to the inconclusive state of empirical results. Analysing unemployment specific to age present a number of benefits (Dietrich & M√∂ller, 2016). Most significant are structural variations between older and youth population across the labour market. Labour programs and regulations are highly different all across the globe. Such variety in benefits and regulations raise important questions on public policy regarding the effect of extremely protective programs and regulations on economic results (Gebel & Giesecke, 2011). Several players across the society pay for such protective measures. If employers bare the burden, they are forced to decrease demand for the workforce. Therefore, protective measures have a paradoxical impact to support employment welfare at the cost of unemployment. This specific problems creates major doubt regarding national labour policies. Since the last few decades, a number of empirical and theoretical contributions focus on several institutions of labour market for explaining why there are differences in labour market performance across time and nations (Blanchflower et al., 2014). From a theoretical perspective, the institutions of labour market impact the behaviour of labour supply and labour demand, and further impacts the decisions of wage setting and hiring. By establishing comparable data, factors such as labour tax system, employment protection, or unemployment benefit system are centralized to empirical macro-economic researches (Zeilstra & Elhorst, 2014). These researches look for cross- national differential sources in the performance of labour market. Majority of the researchers identified the target variable of unemployment as it was most suitable for reflecting the ability of economy to avoid the possible consequence of involuntary joblessness. As a significant example, a generous system of employment benefit enhance the reservation wage of the unemployed, while improving the quality of job match. Further ahead, the duration and coverage of unemployment benefits has a substantial impact on the macroeconomic state of unemployment (Schmid, 2015). Higher protection of employment will result in lowering firings and hirings, and the prevailing effects are unclear. 2.2 Channels of Institutions to Impact Age-Specific Unemployment Analysing unemployment specific to age presents a number of advantages. The most significant aspects of analyses are structure-based differences between older people and youth across the labour market. There can be interpretations for youth to a specific limit, who have to look for first jobs and gain job considerate human capital and job experience. On the other hand, older people specifically consist of employees with job tenure and experience. Therefore, it is expected that some institutions of labour market impact the older and youth population in different terms (Kawaguchi & Murao, 2014). One significant channel used by institutions to impact age-specific unemployment is employment protection regulations. While these regulations are initiated for protecting older employees, it hinders the entry of youth population in the labour market. The entire impact of EPL over unemployment cannot be estimated easily, but the differential impact on older and youth population specifies the general impact of such regulations. One major institutional channel used for affecting age specific unemployment is the educational system (Hipp et al., 2015). The quality held by educational system is significant for explaining cross- cultural differences in youth unemployment. It has been identified by researchers that an effective educational system is helpful to integrate youth people across the labour market for reducing unemployment by the avoidance of youth unemployment period. It has been identified that training the apprentice helps in reducing the duration to locate the first job in Spain. However, there are benefits and costs of training apprentices for companies in Germany. Further ahead, demographic trends play a crucial role in supporting youth unemployment. In the more concrete sense, a large population of youth to prime age people pushes the supply of youth labour (Zeilstra & Elhorst, 2014). These result in higher rates of youth unemployment considering the prime-aged and youth people do not provide effective substitutes for the purpose of production. Italy is a significant example with a rigid and sequential education system under the South European regimes of school-to-work transition. 2.3 Past Research Efforts and Results A number of OECD researches have identified that the legislation of employment protection do not lead towards higher level of unemployment. However, this is possible only during an interaction between other institution based structures, specifically the overall level of centralized collective bargaining (Cracolici et al., 2007). On the other hand, the replacement level of insurance benefits under unemployment impact the rate of unemployment with better advantages from high level of unemployment. According to a past research Nickell (1997), the strict state of employment protection legislation (EPL) does not impact unemployment but it impacts the overall scope of employment, even with the exclusion of women (Basile et al., 2012). Daveri and Tabellini (2000) identified that employment protection legislation has a significant yet negative correlation with unemployment. This suggests that highly restricting legislation is correlated to low level of unemployment. Belot et al. (2001) discovered that EPL is an insignificant factor determining unemployment in maximum regressions. This research further identified that there is no significance of EPL. Further ahead, Baker et al. (2004) explored that the variable of EPL lacks significance across the years, 1960 to 1999 and 1984 to 1994. This became negative in the duration of 1980 to 1999 (Banerji et al., 2014). This fact suggests that strict regulations help in reducing the overall unemployment. For the context of collective bargaining, studies have specified models on the basis of strictly interpreting that intermediate centralization has an impact on unemployment. The models have also been developed by loosely interpreting the negative correlation of high centralization. 2.4 Recent Research Developments There is general skepticism related to data quality on this topic and there are individual efforts to analyse them and they suggest that vast cross-national results reflect high non-reliability (Berlingieri et al., 2014). In the most basic sense, several recent researches incorporated bivariate regression which depicted a highly complex relationship between the rate of unemployment and institutional factors of labour market. While researchers have succeeded in constructing multiple variable regressions regarding the relationship between unemployment rate and labour market institutions, the construction of equally plausible regression seems easy. As a result, recent researches depict that economic evidence regarding the topic is highly inconclusive. The evidence present cannot be used to establish any public policy. Several academic research are making significant contributions to improve the overall measures, but a lot of work still has to be done (Berloffa et al., 2014). Researchers need to focus on more quantitative measures for highlighting the real-life establishments of major institutions in the labour market. These findings will require sufficient standardization across nations with sufficient flexibility in significant national variations. ' Based on the critical analysis of past and present researches, it has been identified that the labour market of Italy is facing extreme flexibility due to two-tier reforms. Families of the youth population play a crucial role to bare the costs of adulthood transition (Etzo, 2011). The questions regarding youth labour market has a number of obscure facets, exacerbating the situation of economic crisis. Italy faced the most difficult aspects of school-to-work transitions, with dramatically relative and absolute drawbacks across the labour market. The evolving state of Italian labour market reforms depict that the education system lack the ability of closing the gap of youth experience instead of an alleged rigid attribute across the labour industry (Blanchflower et al., 2014). One specifically worrisome attribute of the youth labour market in Italy is the high ratio between the rate of unemployment among the youth population and the overall rate of unemployment. Since the years of 1980s, Italy faced a high rate of unemployment across the workforce in the age group 15 to 24 years (Brandt & Hank, 2014). The rate exceeded slightly by 30 percent till the 1990s and it further rose in the current crisis reaching 40 percent. The evolving overall rate of unemployment in Italy reflect the double sided attribute of current Italian crisis. There was a rise in unemployment in the year 2009 after it was declining during the years of 2000s. During the initial period of 2010, several factors depicted recovery but with the second hit of the crisis, there was a growth in unemployment to reach the highest rate at 12.4 percent in the year 2013 (De Lange et al., 2014). Different behaviours in the rate of youth unemployment is extremely startling. The above figure depicts the series of unemployment among individuals in the age group of 15 to 24 years (Dietrich & M√∂ller, 2016). This reflects that the rate of youth unemployment increased to double (reaching 40 percent from 20 percent) from the years 2008 to 2013. This was highest across all counties of Europe, apart from Spain, Portugal, and Greece. The rate of unemployment across the older population did not increase or decrease in such a manner raising queries regarding if there was a recent enactment of the pension reform. If this was the case, several older employees would have been employed for a long time and this had a short-term influence on the unemployment faced by the youth population (Gebel & Giesecke, 2011). The above figure provides that there is a specifically high ratio of unemployment when compared between youths and adults in Italy. This particular fact clearly indicates that there are youth specific issues in the labour market of Italy. Past researchers have indicated that labour market institutes have a significant impact on the subsequent wages and status of employment (Hipp et al., 2015). Therefore, to further complete this analysis, the labour market institutions of Italy will be referred to that impact unemployment in its youth population. In the year 2014, the Law 183 was introduced by the government of Italy, named as the Jobs Act. This legal act helped in determining major changes in terms of industrial relations. This change substantially liberalized the labour industry which resulted in completing the reform process started during the mid-nineties. Following are the key attributes of this act which tend to source unemployment across the youth population of Italy (Kawaguchi & Murao, 2014): a) Introduction of a new contract category for newly hired employees to remove all obligations for reinstated workers in case they are fired invalidly. b) Facilitating the utilization of temporary contracts by eliminating past restrictions prior to the implementation of Jobs Act. c) Weakened state of lawful challenges for businesses with the intention of monitoring the workers by different types of electronic devices. The aim of this research was to analyse the impacts of labour market institutions and relative factors on youth unemployment specifically targeting people between the age group of 15 to 24 years and beyond 25 years. The European nation selected for this purpose was Italy and several channels were identified by which institutions impact unemployment specific to age. Past researchers have indicated that labour market institutes have a significant impact on the subsequent wages and status of employment. Therefore, to further complete this analysis, the labour market institutions of Italy were referred to that impact unemployment in its youth population. Based on the critical analysis of past and present researches, it has been identified that the labour market of Italy is facing extreme flexibility due to two-tier reforms. Families of the youth population play a crucial role to bare the costs of adulthood transition. The questions regarding youth labour market has a number of obscure facets, exacerbating the situation of economic crisis. Labour programs and regulations are highly different all across the globe. Such variety in benefits and regulations raise important questions on public policy regarding the effect of extremely protective programs and regulations on economic results. Several players across the society pay for such protective measures. There are principle benefits of more education. However, several evidences have indicated that rapidly increased population of graduates since the university reform not only increased the temporary rate of unemployment. On the other hand, it made significant contribution to render highly competitive job search across college graduates. In conclusion, it can be stated that the evolving state of Italian labour market reforms depict that the education system lack the ability of closing the gap of youth experience instead of an alleged rigid attribute across the labour industry.  Transition from Education to Employment  One of the primary causes of youth unemployment in Italy is the transition period between school and work. The Italian education system is unable to transition students from studying to gaining work experience. Once finished with education, young Italians are without experience in the employment market. Their inexperience is due to insufficient contact between the secondary education in Italy and the labor market, specifically in the way recent graduates lack vocational training. Recent graduates lack proper training and work experience for post-graduate employment, and statistically receive a lower mean level of education compared to European counterparts. One reason for the failure of the transition period is the effect of the 2008 recession. During and after 2008, more and more young Italians entered into education, causing a decrease in the labor market and subsequently a higher rate of future unemployment. This increase in students resulted in more competition when searching for employment among college graduates. Many, if not most of the students who graduated from secondary education in Italy were overqualified for the jobs available to them, especially jobs in manufacturing and exporting. A result of this situation seen today is that many of the youth of Italy are limited to either temporary work or unemployment. By 2010, temporary contracts accounted for 50% of the youth in Italy, which only facilitated the churning of unemployment and increased the transition period between going back to school and finding a full-time job.  Flawed Education System - History  Before 2005, the time period between graduating from school and the gap between obtaining employment was 51.3 months, which is much higher than the EU average of 30 months. Graduates are then overqualified for the labor market, meaning they have a higher skill level than what is in demand (called a vertical mismatch). Young non-university graduates consequently experience higher rates of unemployment (45%) than their degree- holding counterparts (25.6%).  Welfare system and labor market policy  Italy's problem of youth unemployment is also caused by its protectionist welfare system and labor market. In 2015, 62.4% 15‚Äì24 year-olds who were registered unemployed for 6‚Äì11 months did not receive any benefits or assistance; the same rate measured in the population of 15‚Äì74 year-olds was 52.4%. Though this demonstrates that benefits are exclusive for people of all ages in Italy, the young unemployed are left out at a rate 10% higher than the general population. This can be attributed to the country's corporatist structure; similarly to Greece, Spain, and Portugal (grouped into the \\"Southern Model\\" of European welfare) benefits in Italy are distributed in a very fragmented manner according to occupation. There are separate benefit schemes, or \\"micro-schemes\\", for specific private and public sectors, types of self-employment, and the large group of industrial workers called INPS. This system is split into the core group of labor market insiders receives generous benefits (such as pensions), while the irregular workers receive minimal benefits. For example, upon retirement an institutional worker would receive a pension of 89% their average net earnings, but a non-institutional worker would receive only 19%. Paradoxically, this \\"economic protection\\" model makes it difficult for young people to get their first job because they have never been part of the labor market. To illustrate, the unemployment benefits given to an Italian 18 year-old who has never had a job is 0% of average net earnings. In addition to receiving nonexistent/minimal benefits, a study also found youth were excluded based on factors including: the prerequisites for coverage, the age coverage is extended to, and sanctions for incorrectly using the system. Italy's model has exclusive unemployment benefits coupled with inflexible labor market policy (which means workers have high employment protection and are unlikely to be fired), which creates inhospitable conditions for young people seeking jobs.  Consequences = Emigration  In the last years, the media in Italy increasingly addresses the issue of the international migration flows of young people as a phenomenon of brain drain. The high rate of unemployment encourages young citizens to leave the country. In fact, the main reason of the high numbers of young people leaving the country is the prospect of job opportunities abroad. Qualified Italians who choose to emigrate to Northern Europe are able to make between 29% and 48% more than their counterparts who remain in Italy. Youth emigration as a consequence results in the Italian government losing its investments in education and a considerable amount of young labor force. In the majority of the cases, the young unemployed emigrate in either other countries of the EU (mainly the United Kingdom and Germany) or in the United States and Australia. In 2016, more than 39% of Italian emigrants were of age between 18 and 34. Additionally, the percentage of young Italian emigrants is increasing every year at a steady rate.  North-South Division  It is often argued that Italy is made up of two different economies, one belonging to the North and one to the South. In terms of youth unemployment, there is a regional divide between North and South within Italy. In 2016, Italy presented one of the most internally diverse regional unemployment rates among the EU member states (together with other Southern European countries such as Greece and Spain). More than half of the young population was unemployed in the southern regions of Italy (Calabria, Campania, Puglia and Sicilia). On the other hand, unemployment rates in the northern regions (such as Lombardia, Piemonte and Veneto) varied between 5% and 10%. * See Also * Youth unemployment * Unemployment benefits in Italy * Labor policy in Italy * Youth unemployment in Spain * Youth unemployment in the United Kingdom * Unemployment in the United Kingdom  Notes  Category:Government of Italy Category:Economy of Italy Category:Labor in Italy Category:Unemployment Category:Youth unemployment Unemployment ","title":"Youth unemployment in Italy"},{"id":"52087669","text":"Elisabeth Pickering (c.1510‚Äì1562) was an English printer, the first woman in England to print books under her maiden name. Biography Colophon from The Great Charter, Called in Latin Magna Carta, London: Elizabeth Pickering, 1540/41 Elisabeth Pickering is reputed by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography to being the first English woman to print books under her maiden name; James Raven asserts that \\"as early as 1527-8 a widow is recorded as printing in York\\", and terms Pickering as 'the best-known early press woman'. Elisabeth Pickering was the wife and, on his death in October 1540, widow, of Robert Redman, a printer of law books in London from 1525 until his death. Thirteen editions of Redman's books were printed, eleven under Pickering's name, within nine-months of his death, including an edition of the Magna Carta. Thereafter she sold the printing business to William Middleton. Elisabeth Pickering was married four times; to a Mr. Jackson, with issue Lucy and Elizabeth, prior to her marriage in 1537 to Redman, with issue Alice and Matilda. After Redman's death she married William Cholmeley, a lawyer who may, according to the ODNB have been involved in a 1542 attempt by the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers to be incorporated in London. After William's death she married his relation Ranulph Cholmeley, who from 1553 to 1663 was Recorder of London and thereafter Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. This Cholmeley was responsible for the successful incorporation of the Stationers, and the ODNB suggests that Elisabeth's interest in the matter was related to both Cholmeley's actions. Elisabeth Pickering died in October 1562. She is buried in St. Dunstan-in-the-West Churchyard in London, England.

It formed in 2001‚Äì2002 following Ralph Nader's run for president in 2000 as the Green Party nominee. The party has run candidates for president, governor, lieutenant governor, US Senate, and the Montana legislature. It earned ballot access for the national party‚Äôs presidential candidates in 2004 and 2016. In 2020, a controversy arose regarding the party‚Äôs ballot eligibility, after it was revealed that the state Republican Party had financed efforts to collect the required signatures and some voters who had signed the petitions asked to revoke their signatures. Following a series of legal cases, a US District judge ruled, and the state Supreme Court concurred, that the voters were entitled to revoke their signatures, and that as a result the Green Party had insufficient signatures to appear on the 2020 ballot. Electoral History=2002 election In 2002, Bob Kelleher ran for U.S. Senate as the Green Party nominee and received 2.3% of the vote. 2004 election In Montana‚Äôs 2004 elections, the party attained ballot access for David Cobb, that year‚Äôs presidential nominee, as well as Kelleher, who that year was the party‚Äôs gubernatorial nominee. Cobb received under 1,000 votes, while Kelleher received more than 8,000, and placed third in the gubernatorial election. Following that election, the state party became inactive and was not reaccredited by the GPUS until 2007. 2008 election The MTGP held its 2008 convention in Missoula. However, the party‚Äôs presidential nominee, Cynthia McKinney, did not get on Montana's ballot for the general election. 2016 election In 2016, the party filed more than three times the minimum required number of signatures to place party nominee Jill Stein on the ballot. Many of their supporters were former supporters of U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The Green Party of Montana was considered a recognized party committee as of the 2016 election cycle. 2020 electionPetition controversy= In 2020, the state Republican Party reportedly paid $100,000 to finance the effort to collect the petition signatures necessary to qualify the Green Party for ballot access in the state. This fact wasn‚Äôt revealed until after the Greens had initially secured ballot access. The Republican Party was also accused of violating campaign finance laws by failing to disclose the funding of the petition drive. The Green Party of Montana acknowledged that it had not played a role in the signature collection. Some commentators speculated that the presence of the Green Party on the ballot had the potential to hinder Democratic candidates, particularly in the elections for Senate and the at- large House seat, both of which are expected to be competitive races. Following the revelation that the Republican Party had funded the signature collection, more than 560 voters out of the 13,000 who had signed the petitions asked to have their signatures removed, as they hadn‚Äôt realized that the GOP was involved in the effort. The communications manager of the national Green Party alleged that some of the voters asking to withdraw their signatures had been subjected to pressure to do so. Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton, a Republican, argued that the signers had missed a deadline to withdraw their names, and that there wasn‚Äôt an established procedure for withdrawing a petition signature. =Legal challenges= In response to Stapleton‚Äôs refusal to invalidate the signatures by voters who had changed their minds, four of the petition signers and the Democratic Party of Montana jointly filed a suit in court. James Reynolds, a US District Judge, ruled that no deadline like the one which Stapleton cited existed, and that with those signatures voided, the Party no longer qualified for the ballot. The case marked the second time in two years that Reynolds had issued a ruling removing the Green Party from the Montana ballot: in 2018, he had ruled that the Party be removed from the ballot in response to discrepancies regarding petition signatures. Upon Reynolds‚Äôs ruling, two voters and two Green Party candidates (for state Senate and Attorney General) filed suit in a US District Court, arguing that their rights, and votes in the Green Party primary, were violated by his ruling. However, judge Dana Christensen ruled against them, citing the fact that the parallel case was still in the courts. Stapleton appealed Reynolds‚Äôs ruling to the state Supreme Court. Reynolds‚Äôs judgment was upheld on August 19, 2020, in a 5-2 ruling. The Court, in addition to Reynolds‚Äôs reasoning, noted that the general election ballot had to be certified by August 20. Stapleton announced his intention to appeal the case to the United States Supreme Court. On August 25, 2020, the Supreme Court declined to take up the case, making it unlikely that the party would appear on the ballot, since Montana law required absentee ballots to be sent to members of the military by September 15.

Background Seraphim was born in Jaffa in 1934, and was among the first waves of displaced Palestinian refugees to move to Beirut, Lebanon in 1952. She was 14 when her family fled first to Sidon by boat in 1949. After their move to Beirut, she worked in refugee relief while attending art classes. Education and career In Beirut, Seraphim developed her personal style and produced her most notable works. She privately studied with Lebanese painter Jean Khalifeh (1923‚Äì78) and her first exhibitions took place in his studio. After studying at the Lebanese Fine Arts Academy and privately with other local contemporary artists, she began to show her work in solo exhibitions and gained recognition within Beirut. In her studies, she was awarded grants to study abroad in Madrid, Florence, and Spain. She then went on to internationally represent Lebanon in three biennials - Alexandria (1962), Paris (1963), and S√£o Paulo (1965). Visual Language Whereas her Lebanese contemporaries often take on a figurative style in order to demonstrate the central issues of the Palestinian struggle, Seraphim‚Äôs visual language is characterized as having complex layers of overlapping lines and improvisational dream-like imagery. In this way, Seraphim cultivates a shifting reality of infinite depth and creation. Her dream-like imagery also implies the unsteady nature of a long-held memory of a cherished place - and in doing so she transcribes her political concerns regarding her home through the lens of personal and surreal imagery while also encouraging the viewer to actively participate with the imagery presented. When asked, Seraphim cites the source of her surrealist imagery as memories of her childhood. She drew specific inspiration from the faded frescoes of winged beings on the ceiling of her grandfather's home, and former convent, in Jerusalem.

It is situated northeast of Columbus on the north side of Interstate 10 (I-10). The town was first established in 1846 by German immigrants from near Mainz, Germany. The small community was still served by a Catholic Church in 2016. Geography Mentz is located at the intersection of Mentz and Frelsburg Roads about northeast of Columbus and the Saint Roch Catholic Church is nearby. The community is north of the intersection of I-10 with Farm to Market Road 949 (FM 949) and west of Bernardo. History As early as the 1830s, Germans began to settle near Cat Spring to the northeast.See photo of historical marker. The next impulse of German immigrants was initiated by the Adelsverein in the 1840s. German Catholics, mostly from B√ºdesheim in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz formed a settlement in 1846. It was named Neu Mainz after Mainz, Germany. When the town received a post office in 1853, it was named San Bernard. The name was changed to Neu Mainz in 1860 and the post office was discontinued in 1866. In 1858, the settlers founded the Saint Roch Catholic Church with the assistance of priests from the town of Frelsburg to the northwest. The church was named after a chapel near B√ºdesheim and Bingen am Rhein. In 1872 the Congregation of Divine Providence founded a Catholic school in the community; it closed in 1916. The post office was set up again in 1889. By this date the town's name had been corrupted to Mentz. The post office closed in 1896 and reopened between 1897 and 1913. In the latter year postal service permanently transferred to Alleyton, a town to the southwest. By 1986 Mentz had 167 registered voters and the church with its sanctuary, parish hall, rectory, cemetery and baseball field. The area's population was 100 in 2000.

Life and career  Santa Cruz was born into an upper-middle-class family. His father had been a lawyer, journalist and mayor of a district of Santiago. Santa Cruz began working in the public sector as a lawyer around 1922. Initially a lecturer on criminal and military procedure, he later received an role as a judge on Chile's Superior Military Court. He was appointed as Permanent Representative of Chile to the United Nations in 1946 by President Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla. Though he did not (at the time) believe he had the background or ability to serve effectively, he would come to refer to it as the start of a second existence. Santa Cruz's role in the United Nations, as a delegate of the Third Committee and Human Rights Commission, was a formative one. The U.S. State Department observed that during his service at the UN, \\"on one occasion while his family was out of town,\\" he \\"sold the entire household effects, including his wife's clothing, and gave the proceeds to his mistress.\\"Brian A. W. Simpson, Human Rights and the End of Empire: Britain and the Genesis of the European Convention (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 364. In 1953, Santa Cruz left the Chilean diplomatic service to work for the UN directly. 1958 saw him join the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), where he served as Regional Director for Latin America and later a sub-director of the organization. Other bodies he engaged with included the UNCTAD, ILO, UNDP, G77 and the Non-Aligned Movement. Santa Cruz retired in 1984. He died in 1999 in Santiago and had at least one child, Rodrigo Santa Cruz.  Ideas and legacy  According to Susan Waltz, although Santa Cruz \\"held no position of responsibility...his political and substantive contributions were such\\" that his co-drafter, John Peters Humphrey and the author Johannes Morsink later singled out the important role he played in shaping the Declaration's transition away from \\"eighteenth century Enlightenment philosophy\\" towards \\"socioeconomic rights.\\" In addition to his work on the declaration, Santa Cruz was \\"actively involved in the establishment of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean\\" in 1947.

By 1931, the high court had completed their relocation to a new building beside the Federal Building, the original building was repurposed to accommodate the Audit Department, State Treasury and British Advisory Office, and would later be used to house the Public Works Department and Sewerage and Drainage Department. To mark the silver jubilee of Sultan Abdul Halim in 1983, the building was converted into an art gallery and was officiated and opened to the public by the Sultan on 25 July 1983. Architecture Originally design by architect Muhammad bin Lebai Thambi of the Kedahan Public Works Department, the building adopts an eclectic combination of neoclassical and Sino-Portuguese architectures, with strong Palladian motifs and colonnades from the former mixed with Baroque ornamentation and extensive use of arches from the latter; of note is the presence of the Kedahan shield in the ornamentation over every arch of the building.

Ramadan's work focuses on themes of immigration, identity, diaspora and belonging. His debut novel, The Clothesline Swing, won multiple awards. Currently, Ramadan lives in Vancouver, British Columbia with his husband.  Writing = Early work  Ramadan has translated the work of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi to English, released in 2015 by Greystone Books under the title 1000 Lashes: Because I Say What I Think. Ramadan published two collections of short stories in Arabic while he lived in Egypt. His first collection, Death and Other Fools, was released by Dar Laila in 2004. His second collection, Aria, was released by Dar Malameh in 2008.  The Clothesline Swing  The Clothesline Swing is Ramadan's debut novel in English. Inspired by One Thousand and One Nights, the novel tells the epic story of two lovers anchored to the memory of a dying Syria. One is a Hakawati, a storyteller, keeping life in forward motion by relaying remembered fables to his dying partner. Each night he weaves stories of his childhood in Damascus, of the cruelty he has endured for his sexuality, of leaving home, of war, of his fated meeting with his lover. Meanwhile, Death himself, in his dark cloak, shares the house with the two men, eavesdropping on their secrets as he awaits their final undoing.leftIn its review, titled \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\", Winnipeg Free Press stated that the author \\"has crafted a novel that compels readers to share ‚Äî vicariously, with his characters ‚Äî the beauty and history of Syria, the horrors of civil war and the joy, release and pain of forbidden love.\\" adding that the novel is \\"an enjoyable, if challenging, cultural and historical excursion.\\". Publishers Weekly called the work \\"remarkable\\" stating that \\"Ramadan's delicate use of imagery links these narratives, allowing them to reverberate with meaning and emotion.\\". \\"This debut novel from the Vancouver-based Syrian writer reads as many things,\\" writes Kamal Al-Solaylee for Canadian magazine Quill and Quire, \\"a coming-out memoir, a history lesson, a critique of authoritarianism, a narrative about sharing narratives ‚Äì but above all, it's a requiem for a dying country and people.\\" The Globe and Mail called the novel \\"sombre, fantastical, violent and tender,\\" adding that Ramadan's \\"English-language debut is a gay son's conflicted love letter to Syria.\\" The Georgia Straight called the narration of Ramadan \\"fragmented, poetic, and rich with magic realism,\\" adding that the novel \\"is a lesson in both artistic mastery and human resilience. And, unexpectedly: joy.\\" The Clothesline Swing won the Independent Publisher Book Awards' Golden Medal in the LGBT category, as well as the Canadian Authors Association's Fred Kerner Award for Best Overall Fiction Book in 2017, was picked among The Globe and Mail's 100 Best Books 2017, and was number 7 of the Toronto Star Top 10 Books of 2017. It was long listed on the CBC's Canada Reads 2018 contest, shortlisted to the Forest of Reading's Evergreen Award 2018, shortlisted for the Lambda Literary Award Gay Fiction category in 2018, and longlisted for Sunburst Award for Excellence in Canadian Literature of the Fantastic.

Salma the Syrian Chef  alt= His children's book, Salma the Syria Chef, is released in 2020 by Annick Press. The picture book tells the story of newcomer Salma whose mother is struggling to adjust to their new life in Canada. Salma decides to uplift her mother's spirit by cooking a traditional Syrian meal for her, with the help of their new friends in the Welcome Home they are living at. ‚ÄúSalma is deeply relatable in her determination, frustration, and sensitivity, especially in moments when things do not go as planned\\" wrote Shannon Ozirny for Quill and Quire. The book was also positively reviewed by Kirkus Reviews who stated that ‚Äúthis beautiful story grasps diversity, exploring resilience, love, friendship, and the meaning of home.‚Äù. Publishers Weekly praised the book's inclusive messages, and stated that ‚ÄúRamadan writes with poetic immediacy about displacement, home, and family.‚Äù  Activism  In a Vice Media interview in 2016, Ramadan talked about the underground work he used to do to support and sometimes house queer individuals while he lived in Damascus. He later elaborated on this experience in a 2018 interview and stated \\"I turned my house [in Damascus] into an underground LGBTQ centre... it was actually quite the loving community until I was arrested for it.\\" Ramadan mentioned in a separate interview to The Media Line, that he was arrested at the airport by Syrian officials and held for six weeks. After his release, he was declared a persona non grata by the Syrian government and as a result he immigrated to Lebanonas a refugee in 2012. Eventually, Ramadan was granted asylum in Canada, and in September 2014 he immigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia. By 2015, Ramadan already began working at Qmunity, a queer resource center in British Columbia. Around the same time Ramadan was working for Qmunity, he started volunteering for the Rainbow Refugee Society which describes itself as, \\"a Vancouver based community group that helps individuals seeking refugee protection in Canada based on sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression (SOGIE) or HIV status.\\" While volunteering at the Rainbow Refugee Society, Ramadan helped organize and support the sponsorship of Syrian refugees. Since May 2015, Ramadan has also run an annual fundraiser known as An Evening in Damascus. The goals of the fundraiser are to introduce the community to authentic Syrian culture and heritage, build a safe space for Syrian Queer and Trans refugees to celebrate their identity, offer opportunities to foster friendship and integration between Syrian Queer and Trans newcomers and LGBTQ2+ Canadian community members, and fundraise for private sponsorships. Through the fundraiser, Ramadan has raised over $150,000 for LGBTQ-identifying refugees, and he has helped 23 individuals obtain refugee protection in Canada.Ramadan speaks publicly about issues related to gay Syrian refugees, and he has expressed his views as a speaker at conferences and conventions such as TedxSFU, Qmunity's IDAHOT Breakfast, the Liberal Party Convention, and Six Degrees Conference. Ramadan used to write a bi-weekly column for Daily Xtra between 2012 and 2016, covering topics such as what it's like to live as a refugee in another country, and how to integrate LGBTQ refugees into Canadian society. Since November 2016, Ramadan has served as Director-at-large for the board of Vancouver Pride Society, and as of 2019, Ramadan now serves as Director for the board of the Rainbow Railroad. In 2016, Ramadan was honored as the grand marshal of the Vancouver Pride Festival for his work supporting LGBTQ-refugees and newcomers. In 2017, he was awarded the Social Activist StandOut Award by the Vancouver Pride Society for his social-activist work. That same year he was also picked as one of the 25 Top Immigrants to Canada by Canadian Immigrant. In 2018, he was a recipient of the 2018 Bonham Centre Award from the Mark S.

The main stage resides at the corner of Broad Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue, while the Philly Soul Stock stage is located at the meeting of 17th Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue.  History  In the 1940s through the 1960s, North Philadelphia housed 16 of the city's 30 jazz venues, with a significant number located on Cecil B. Moore Avenue (formerly Columbia Avenue). With the reputation as the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù area for the best entertainment in town, it was dubbed \\"Jump Street\\". Starting in 2006, Beech Community Services has continued this tradition with Jazz on the Ave. Beech Community Services presents this outdoor festival with support from company partners, volunteers and community residents. Festivals feature a variety of local and nationally acclaimed artists representing an eclectic mix of music. The event is traditionally hosted by local radio and TV personalities.

Biography Jean Fleming was born in 1553/4, daughter of James Fleming, 4th Lord Fleming and Barbara Hamilton. Upon his death, his title and estates passed to her uncle, James' brother John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming, and Jean Fleming had to resort to action in the Privy Council of Scotland to secure a share of the inheritance. She married John Maitland, then Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland and later Lord Chancellor of Scotland, in January 1583 and she was then called \\"Lady Thirlestane\\". The couple had two children, Anne, born in 1590 and who died in 1609, and John Maitland, a judge who became President of the Parliament of Scotland and of Privy Council. In December 1587 the poet William Fowler dedicated his Triumphs of Petrarke to her, and a woman \\"E. D.\\", perhaps Elizabeth Douglas of Temple-Hall (Ormiston), contributed two sonnets in her praise.H.

They became one of the most popular bands in their region which included the Quad Cities. Jack Barlow, a popular DG and country music recording artist had them record songs for a planned single at Columbia Recording Studios arranged a contract with Atlantic Records, who released the group's single on their Dial label featuring \\"Psychedelic Siren\\" which included siren sound effects generated by a primitive electronic device. Though the song became a big regional hit in Iowa, Atlantic lost interest in the band and they made no further recordings. In the intervening years, their work has come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts and has been included of several compilations. History The Daybreakers were founded by keyboardist Max Allan Collins in 1966 in Muscatine, Iowa. Collins, a high school senior at Muscatine High School whose father had once a music teacher there, asked George Dunker, the school guitar teacher, to help recruit musicians for the group. SC11186 - liner notes Dunker recommended three junior high students who Collins found acceptable that would form the band's lineup: guitarists Mike Bridges and Denny Maxwell, and drummer Buddy Busch. Bridges would play lead guitar and Maxwell rhythm, with Collins on keyboards and lead vocals, though the other members would occasionally sing leads and harmonies. Collins' father helped the group work out their vocal style. Chuck Bunn, who had played in several other local bands joined on bass. The band rehearsed in the basement of Collins' parents' house. The Daybreakers quickly became one of the most popular groups in Muscatine. Other popular bands were the XLs, from Wilton and the Night People, from the Quad Cities area. In November 1966 when the Daybreakers won the Carnival of Bands competition, held at the Col Ballroom in Davenport. Max Collins, who still has the trophy, recounts: :They had around 30 bands from all over the Midwest, including Minneapolis and Chicago. We won because we did a very different set from everybody else. We did some steps like The Raiders and wore gold sparkle shirts!\\" The band became acquainted with Jack Barlow, a popular radio DJ and country music recording artist, who had been a music student of Collins' father. Barlow asked his A&R; man, Buddy Killen to produce a session for the group for a single initially planned to be released for the local market. Collins played Killen six of the group's original songs, including \\"Psychedelic Siren\\". When performed live the band would use a siren effect generated by an electronic device (a primitive version of a synthesizer built by a college classmate of Collins') operated by rhythm guitarist Denny Maxwell. Despite the song's reference to psychedelia, none of the band members did drugs. According to Collins, \\"...The term 'psychedelic' was largely just a buzz word to the group, describing the sights and sounds of the era\\". Killen took the group to record at the Columbia Recording Studios, where they recorded \\"Psychedelic Siren\\" and four other numbers, including guitarist Mike Bridges' composition \\"Afterthoughts\\". Thom Hetzer was brought in top play bass at the session. Killen offered the group a three-year recording deal with Atlantic Records through its Dial label, who released the single \\"Psychedelic Siren\\" b/w \\"Afterthoughts\\" single in December 1967. Each of the group's members were signed to five-year songwriting contracts. Despite their enthusiasm, on the way back to Muscatine the group heard Jimi Hendrix and the Doors on the radio and realized that their style of music might soon fall out of fashion. According to Collins, \\"I think the contract came just as music was changing...\\" \\"Psychedelic Siren\\", nonetheless became a local and regional hit. It entered the charts at Davenport radio station KSTT in December 1967 and stayed on the charts for over three months. In early 1968, the band did a small tour to promote the single and opened for the Young Rascals and Gary Puckett and the Union Gap at several concerts held in Davenport and Des Moines, as well as the Buckinghams and Strawberry Alarm Clock. In 1969 they won the Iowa State Fair Teen Town Battle of the Bands. The Daybreakers included a lot of original material in their live act, most penned by Collins, Bridges, Maxwell, and Peters. The Daybreakers' deal with Buddy Killen and Atlantic Records led to no further releases. Demo tapes recorded at Fredlo Records in Davenport failed to get attention, while phone calls to Nashville went unreturned. Chuck Bunn departed and was replaced by Bruce Peters on bass and subsequently Terry Beckey, then later Paul Thomas. Peters and Thomas also played guitar. In the early 1970s the Daybreakers evolved into group Rox. They remained under the leadership of Collins but with Bruce Peters came to dominate musically as they moved in a more pop direction suggestive of late the 1960s Beach Boys and early Raspberries. In the mid 1970s, Collins, Peters and Thomas reunited with Crusin‚Äô, one of the first 1960s revival bands, which played with varying members, including Bunn and Maxwell, but always with Collins. Collins also became a writer for the Dick Tracy comic book series. Paul Thomas continued to play music until his death in 2004. Peters and Beckey are also deceased. The Daybreakers reunited with their original lineup on Aug. 30, 2008 Arnolds Park, Iowa for their induction into Iowa Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

History The building was originally completed in November 1922 as the new High Court to assume the functions of its predecessor. The building would see long-term use as the High Court until June 2005, when it was relocated to a new courts complex at Suka Menanti Street. The building was later repurposed as a gallery in 2007 at the cost of RM16 million. Architecture The High Court building was originally designed by architect F. W. Wade with construction overseen by H. W. Fofden. Similar to the old High Court, the building incorporates Neoclassical architecture but adopts a conservative and streamlined late-stage variation of the style, featuring colonnades and a Palladian profile but lacking the eclectic ornamentation of the old High Court. Conversion of the building into a gallery in the 2000s involved repurposing the existing building as well as constructing a modern extension mimicking the exterior style of the original structure behind the original building; the conversion work was undertaken by architect firm Rusman, with the Seri Temin Development Corporation contracted to manage construction work, Azam Hias undertaking exterior works, and Syarikat Mariwasa Kraftangan managing gallery artifacts work.

Prairie remnants have become increasingly threatened due to the threats of agricultural, urban and suburban development, pollution, fire suppression, and the incursion of invasive species.  Prairie remnants in restoration ecology  Prairie remnants offer valuable varieties of rare species thus providing excellent opportunities for restoration ecology projects. Many restoration projects are simply recreations of prairie habitats, but restoring prairie remnants provides the preservation of more complete ecological structures that were naturally created after the end of the last ice age.

In 2011, Mix approached Marrero, who was the president of the New York City chapter of LUPEC (Ladies United for the Preservation of Endangered Cocktails), about creating a competition to showcase talented women in the craft cocktail world. The competition raises funds for Breast Cancer education, prevention and research, while promoting women bartenders in an largely male promoted industry. The competition starts with timed heats in different cities around the country before the final in New York City. Proceeds from the tickets to every stage of the competition are donated to various breast cancer charities and the competition has raised over $350,000 in the past 5 years. 100% of the proceeds go to charity with the supplies and locations being donated, while the show is run by volunteers. Major liquor companies such as Jameson, Stoli and Barcardi are sponsors. Speed Rack got its name from the shelf below a bar where well liquor is stored to make quick cocktails. Stages of competition The competition makes 8 stops around the country each year for the preliminary heats. Only the top 8 in each city advance to the final round of the heat to determine the winner that will head to the finals in NYC. Competitors are given a list of 75 cocktails that could appear in the competition, giving them time to memorize the drinks, practice their speed and improve their quality. In the beginning heats the competitors must make 10 drinks from a pre- determined list as best and fast as possible, this narrows the field down to the final 8 in each city. Competitors must be skilled in both speed and accuracy, even if a competitor does not have the fastest time, if their cocktails are better than those that are quicker they could still advance in the competition. The judges are looking for the best cocktails out of the group that are made the quickest. Each city's winner is crowned Ms. Speed Rack - Seattle or Chicago etc. and given a ticket to attend the final in New York.

Nights of Horror is an American series of fetish comic books, created in 1954 by publisher Malcla, drawn by comic artist Joe Shuster, who is also one of the original creators of Superman. The comic stories were written by an author under the pseudonym Clancy, who also used other pseudonyms for different issues of the books. The stories are based on situations of BDSM, bondage, torture, and sexual slavery, featuring both men and women as the tormentors and victims. The series was important in the conviction of Jack Koslow in 1954, during the trial of the Brooklyn Thrill Killers. The books themselves were seized and banned first by New York City, then by the State of New York for violating obscenity laws, and the case went to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court determined that the ban was not in violation of First Amendment Rights, and upheld New York's request for destroying copies of Nights of Horror. Shuster was never named as the illustrator until Gerard Jones published the information in 2004.  Background  Joe Shuster began creating comic art and stories with his friend, Jerry Siegel, in the early 1930s, after becoming friends in high school. Shuster and Siegel first drew the story of Superman, the Man of Steel, in a hand typed fanzine for their school, called Science Fiction. Superman, the secret identity of Clark Kent, represented an ideal of the American man to Shuster and Siegel, with his muscular, bulletproof physique, foreign origins, and goals of helping to save America and the world from destruction. Both men were from Jewish immigrant families, and both were self described as quiet and meek, so creating a superhero that was strong, confident and won the girls over was a way for them to explore their own ideal selves in print.Paris, Sevan Michael. How to be a hero: A rhetorical analysis of Superman's first appearance in \\"Action Comics\\". Chattanooga: University of Tennessee Press, 2011. It was difficult to break into the comic world, but eventually, the two men found a publisher in called National Allied Publications (later DC comics), who wanted to create a book series called Action Comics. The editor, Harry Donenfeld, paid Shuster and Siegel $130 for the first story, and purchased the rights to Superman. Action Comics published its first issue in June 1938, to much success, beginning the industry of Superman. Unfortunately, Shuster and Siegel were paid less than what Donenfeld and DC earned from the success of the Man of Steel, though it differed between 50-90 percent per strip. Shuster also had weakening eyesight, making the work of drawing multiple comics difficult. After almost 10 years of drawing Superman for DC, with a want for more control over their work, and the stirrings of a moral war against comic books coming from senators, religious leaders and a children's psychiatrist named Dr. Fredric Wertham, Shuster and Siegel decided to sue DC for the rights to Superman and a less popular character called Superboy. In the 1948 trial, the artists were awarded the rights to Superboy, but DC Comics would retain the rights to Superman, under the ruling that the original payment of $130 made the character a \\"work-for-hire proposition\\". Seigel and Shuster were devastated by the loss, leaving them jobless, and almost broke. A second attempt at creating an iconic superhero, called Funnyman, failed after only three issues.  Nights of Horror  Broke and slowly going blind, Shuster took a project from his neighbor, a writer for a publishing company called Malcla. His neighbor \\"Clancy\\" was the \\"Cla\\" in the name, and the \\"Mal\\" was Eugene Maletta, who ran a print shop out of a basement in Queens. The project involved drawing the art for Malcla's new publication called Nights of Horror, a comic series based on tales of BDSM, kidnapping and torture. The series features images of men and women in scenes of humiliation, foot worship, bloodletting, bondage, flagellation, lesbianism, lingerie fetishism and interracial sex, though it has little nudity, and only in the case of women's exposed breasts. Both men and women are drawn in the positions of torturers and victims. The booklet lasted for 16 issues, with Clancy penning them all under pseudonyms. Shuster never signed any of his illustrations, but the work is universally attributed to him, especially when compared to his work on Superman. Some of the characters in Nights of Horror even look like Shuster's Superman character drawings, such as Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Jimmy Olsen, even Clark Kent. It is unknown whether or not Shuster did the work just for the money, or even as retribution for losing the rights of Superman to DC, but in his book Secret Identity: The Fetish Art of Superman's Co-Creator Joe Shuster, Craig Yoe speculates that it most likely was because Shuster was in a dire situation financially, and the character similarities are simply reflective of his drawing style. Shuster never told anyone about his work on Nights of Horror, and therefore never received any notoriety for it until the discovery of a rare remaining copy of the booklet by Craig Yoe.  The Brooklyn Thrill Kill Gang  Nights of Horror would play a role in an infamous murder trial, and be a part of the arguments regarding obscenity laws in the United States. In the summer of 1954, Jack Koslow (18), Melvin \\"Mel\\" Mittman (17), Robert \\"Bobby\\" Trachtenberg (15), and Jerome \\"Jerry\\" Lieberman (17) roamed Brooklyn, terrorized girls with whips they had ordered out of magazines, beat vagrants, and set them on fire. The four teens eventually beat an old man to death, and were caught and arrested soon after forcing a man off of a pier into the East River to drown. It seemed to the people of Brooklyn and the press that this was senseless violence, since they never robbed any of their victims, and they earned the name the Brooklyn Thrill Killers. The teens were brought to a jury trial in November 1954; Trachetenberg's case was dismissed as he decided to be the state's witness against the others, and Leiberman's case was dismissed as there was a lack of evidence that he had participated in the murder. Koslow and Mittman were given life without possibility of parole. When Jack Koslow was being examined by psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham, to see if he was fit to stand for trial, Wertham discovered Koslow's fascination with violent comics. The whips the boys carried were obtained from ads in the back of either Uncanny Tales, or Journey into Mystery, Koslow couldn't remember which. He had discovered Nights of Horror, and this led him to explore his violent sexual fantasies, by engaging in the beatings and whippings around Brooklyn. When Wertham brought a copy to Koslow's cell to ask him about his fascinations, Jack confirmed that was what he had read. He even admitted that he gained sexual pleasures from reading the booklets, and from enacting several of the scenes during their crime spree, by making some of the vagrants beg and kiss their feet while being beaten. This was used as part of the evidence to convict Koslow of his crimes.  Obscenity trial  Dr Wertham had previously spoken out about the dangers of comic books in his 1954 book Seduction of the Innocent, specifically attacking some of Joe Shuster's previous work in Superman. He stated \\"We have established the basic ingredients of the most numerous and widely read comic books: violence, sadism, and cruelty\\" Unbeknownst to him, Shuster also drew the book that Wertham would launch an obscenity attack against. Wertham presented to the court that Jack Koslow had \\"fancied himself a Superman...became steeped in horror comics, his mind becoming filled with all the thrill of violence, murder, and cruelty described in them\\". Wertham presented a chart comparing the activities of the Thrill Killers to the scenes in Nights of Horror, and asked that the law ban all types of literature like Nights of Horror, for the sake of the safety of children. On September 10, 1954, the Corporation Council of New York, out of the mayor's office, filed a court motion asking for an injunction to ban the sale of Nights of Horror. The police commissioner of the City of New York stated \\"It is the informed opinion of those police officials..that there is a definite relationship between the types of crime portrayed in Nights of Horror and similar works, and the crimes of sex and violence which beset the City of New York today\\". The booklets were blamed for a series of juvenile violence crime going back to June 1954, when they were first published. Corporation Counsel Adrian P. Burke obtained a court order on September 11, 1954 to restrain five bookshops in Times Square from distributing or selling the books: Kingsley Books Inc, Metropolitan Books, Time Square Bookshop, Pelley Bookshop, and Publishers Outlet. All of the sellers had to surrender their copies of the books for disposal. Kingsley Books and Time Square Bookshop appealed to the New York State Court in 1955, arguing that banning the book was a violation of their First Amendment rights. Judge Matthew M Levy stated \\"The booklets in evidence offer naught but glorified concepts of lustful and vicious concupiscence, and by their tenor deride love and virtue, invite crime and voluptuousness, and excite lecherous desires\\", and that they were strictly pornography, which fell under current obscenity standards. He argued \\"In short, the volumes of \\"Nights of Horror\\" in evidence before me are obscene and constitute pornography ‚Äî \\"dirt for dirt's sake\\". Though he said it was not the court's job to become a censor or \\"book burner\\", he had to uphold the Judicial responsibility of concern for safety, and upheld the ban of the publication, distribution, and sale of the book, as well as the seizure of all copies for destruction.  Kingsley Books, Inc v. Brown  Kingsley Books appealed the case all the way to the United States Supreme Court. The case was argued on April 22, 1957, and judgement was handed down on June 24, 1957. In a close five to four decision, the Court ruled to uphold the ban on the sale and distribution of Nights of Horror, on the basis that \\"nothing in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment restricts a state to the criminal process in seeking to protect its people from the dissemination of pornography\\". Justice Felix Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the court, stating that the Court affirmed the decision based on the fact that a state court may decide to ban the distribution or sale of a publication considered obscene, for the protection of the people, and that the state may also criminally punish the distributors or sellers of the material if they fail to comply with the law. Justice Frankfurter stated \\"It is not for this Court thus to limit the State in resorting to various weapons in the armory of the law.... If New York chooses to subject persons who disseminate obscene \\"literature\\" to criminal prosecution and also to deal with such books as deodands of old, or both, with due regard, of course, to appropriate opportunities for the trial of the underlying issue, it is not for us to gainsay its selection of remedies\\". Not all of the Justices agreed with the decision. Chief Justice Earl Warren stated \\"It is the manner of use that should determine obscenity. It is the conduct of the individual that should be judged, not the quality of art or literature. To do otherwise is to impose a prior restraint, and hence to violate the Constitution. Certainly, in the absence of a prior judicial determination of illegal use, books, pictures and other objects of expression should not be destroyed. It savors too much of book burning\\". Justice William Douglas added \\"We tread here on First Amendment grounds. And nothing is more devastating to the rights that it guarantees than the power to restrain publication before even a hearing is held. This is prior restraint, and censorship at its worst.\\" Despite these dissenting opinions, all copies of Nights of Horror were ordered to be surrendered for destruction.  Secret Identity: The Fetish Art of Superman's Co-Creator Joe Shuster  A scene from the comic book. After the ban on Nights of Horror, some remaining stories and drawing were published under different titles such as Hollywood Detective and Rod Rule. Some of the remaining books were recovered under titles like Pink Chemise and Black Chemise. Shuster, not indicted or even named in the trials, continued to create art, even for other pornographic periodicals such as Continental. A few rare copies of Nights of Horror remained in private collections. In his 2009 book Secret Identity, Craig Yoe recounts how he stumbled upon one of the copies in \\"a dusty old cardboard box in a used bookseller's stall\\" and immediately recognized it for being Shuster's work. Yoe's book features art and stories from all sixteen issues of Nights of Horror, and art from Hollywood Detective, Rod Rule, and Continental magazine. It also goes into detail on the story behind Nights of Horror, from Shuster's beginnings, to drawing the booklets, to the subsequent trials for the book and those involved. Gerard Jones had previously named Shuster as the illustrator in 2004. The book also includes a forward from Stan Lee, who was a friend of Jerry Siegel's, but never met Shuster, though he greatly admired his work.  Historical significance  Nights of Horror is an example of the sweeping censorship that took place during the 1950s in the United States. Comics became the scapegoat for juvenile delinquency in America. In September 1954, amidst the trial for the Brooklyn Thrill Kill Gang, and the injunction against Nights of Horror, the Comic Magazine Association caved to media and public pressure and asked Charles Murphy to be the comic czar, to oversee self-censorship of comic book publishers. This led to the creation of the Comics Code Authority, which lasted until around 2011. Stores would refuse to sell comics that didn't have the seal of approval on their cover.

It is endemic to Madagascar. The specific epithet ' is from the Latin meaning \\"leathery\\", referring to the leaves. Description Rhodolaena coriacea grows as a tree from tall. Its large, coriaceous leaves are elliptic in shape and measure up to long. The inflorescences have one or two flowers on a long peduncle. Individual flowers are large with five sepals and five purple-pink petals, measuring up long. The fruits are medium-sized and woody, with a fleshy involucre. The involucre is reportedly eaten by lemurs, facilitating seed dispersal. Distribution and habitat Rhodolaena coriacea is only found in the eastern regions of Sava, Vatovavy-Fitovinany, Alaotra-Mangoro and Analanjirofo. Its habitat is coastal and evergreen forests from altitude. Threats Rhodolaena coriacea is threatened by timber exploitation and threats to the lemur population. Future population decline of the tree due to habitat loss is predicted at 50% to 80%, though some subpopulations are considered secure in protected areas. Threats to lemurs would in turn affect the tree's reproduction due to their role in seed dispersal. The timber is used in construction. Deforestation is a threat to this and other tree species. Due to shifting patterns of agriculture, deforestation is extensive outside of protected areas.

History= Planning and construction  Development of the Imperial Arcade was a business venture by the newly formed Imperial Arcade Company Ltd to \\"construct an arcade in the centre of Sydney, from Pitt Street to Castlereagh Street, on a scale hitherto not attempted in any part of Australia\\". Capital was fixed at ¬£80,000, with 40,000 shares of ¬£2 each, 17,000 of which were offered to the public through a prospectus issued in March 1889. A return of 14-percent was forecast. The company's board consisted of six directors: WM Beaumont Esq, chairman George C. Chalmers (of Roberts, Chalmers and Co), Joseph Thomas Burton-Gibbs (of Gibbs, Shallard and Co), JR Linsley, Esq., M.L.A, George Merriman, Esq. (City Solicitor), and Hon. Bruce Smith MLA. Other people involved include George Withers and Callaghan. The designated site consisted of one freehold property fronting Castlereagh Street and an adjoining leasehold (21-year) property fronting Pitt Street, both acquired for a total of ¬£25,000. A design competition was held between several architecture firms, with prominent Sydney architect Thomas Rowe securing the ¬£350 contract.  Opening and early use  The Imperial Arcade was opened on 16 July 1891 by the then Mayor of Sydney, William Patrick Manning. The first hotel in the building was the Imperial Arcade Hotel. While an initial application for a licence had been rejected, a second application by manager Philip Husk was granted on 12 April 1892, despite much opposition. The recent closure of nearby Gompagnoni banquet rooms was cited as a reason for granting the new application. The single license covered both the Pitt St and Castlereagh St lots. The suspicious death of manager Philip Husk two years later, first thought to be business-related, was later ruled to be suicide. In April 1895, rates at the Imperial Arcade Hotel were 15 shillings per week for a single room, or 30 shillings per week for a double. The dining rooms provided a seven course lunch for 2 shillings, the \\"best served luncheon in the city\\". In 1902, a case was brought against Smith for the sale of alcohol on unlicensed premises ‚Äì the Castelreagh Street bar of the Imperial Arcade Hotel (at 83 Castlereagh Street). Details of the licensed area, however, approved in the original 1892 application, had been \\"lost\\" by the court and therefore the case was dismissed on 9 May 1902.  First sale  In June 1897, James Joynton Smith retired after five years as managing director and licensee of the Grand Central Coffee Palace, in the Imperial Arcade. His replacement in the role was Mr Sloye.Walsh, Kay and Hooton, Joy W., Australian Autobiographical Narratives: Vol 2: 1850‚Äì1900 (1998), pg 249, National Library of Australia \\"At the beginning of the [20th] century\\" Smith acquired the lease for the Arcadia Hotel with an option to purchase, which he executed some years later when the estate was in liquidation. While a condition of the purchase was a cash deposit of ¬£5,000, Smith offered ¬£2,000 in cash and ¬£3,000 in promissory notes, convincing the liquidators that the debt would extend their employment, and so the sale was agreed. Smith took out a loan for ¬£28,000 from AMP to finalise the sale. Smith began renovating the Arcadia Hotel \\"piecemeal\\" In 1919, Smith established a new Sydney journal, Smith's Weekly, employing R.C. Packer (founder of Australia's Packer media dynasty) and Claude McKay as co-editors. The first issue was launched on 1 March 1919, with 100,000 copies printed in the basement of the Imperial Arcade. It was reported that the arcade itself was \\"a white elephant for the businessman long after it was redecorated in 1897\\". Smith \\"let shops for practically nothing just to fill the Arcade\\" while the \\"bar trade was meagre\\".  1924 auction  On 2 October 1924, Smith attended the auction for the remaining western (Pitt Street) portion of the Imperial Arcade. One story describes how two of Smith's adversaries, Emanuel Myerson and T. E. Rofe, outbid Smith at ¬£113,000, at which point Smith left the auction room. Theo Marks, on behalf of Smith and the newly formed City Freeholds Ltd, then placed the final and winning bid of ¬£115,000, thus completing Smith's ownership of the entire Imperial Arcade premises between Pitt and Castlereagh Streets. Shortly after, on 5 December 1924, the first Woolworths store was opened in the arcade basement, alongside a billiard saloon and the printing works of \\"Smith's Weekly\\". It wasn't until the opening of the David Jones Castelreagh Street store, on 28 November 1927, that \\"shoppers began to pour through ... and the Imperial began to boom\\". Smith had rejected offers from David Jones on the Imperial Arcade, and secured the right to go below Castlereagh Street into David Jones from Sydney City council. Smith \\"built up a fortune from the Arcadia Hotel\\". By 1927, Smith had the arcade listed under various company names including The Joyton Smith Management Trust, and City Freeholds Ltd, both managed by Otto Camphin. Reports suggest Smith was a ruthless landlord, one describing him as \\"a man so utterly the antithesis of that landed knight\\", another as a \\"wrack-rent landlord\\". In August 1936 Smith was reportedly in negotiations with the Myer Group to sell the property for a tentative price of ¬£600,000. This sale never eventuated. Trustees of the Joynton Smith Management Trust included managing- director William Patrick (Bill) Donohoe who was \\"actively concerned in the management\\" of the hotel.  1941 sale  In November 1941, shareholders of City Freeholds Ltd approved a contract of sale (dated October 24, 1941) for the Imperial Arcade, Arcadia Hotel, and adjoining property 'Durno's' at 176 Pitt Street valued in the company's June 30 accounts at ¬£360,987. The purchase was made by a private company, Weathermakers Pty Ltd, for a reported ¬£500,000. Sydney's Truth newspaper reported a \\"deep mystery\\" surrounding the \\"colossal deal\\". considering that Weathermakers Pty Ltd had no issued paid up capital, and only seven shareholders. This led to speculation that a wealthy Sydney company, Burns Philp and Co. Ltd, proprietors of the prosperous Penney's chain, were also involved in the purchase. Although the company's general manager, Lewis Armstrong, neither confirmed or denied the rumour, it was later proven to be true. The final sale price of ¬£558,000 was also confirmed. Other accounts of the sale appear to have misreported the sale price as ¬£1,000,000.  Demolition and redevelopment  At the time of the 1941 sale of the Imperial Arcade, Sydney's Truth newspaper reported that \\"any great structural changes in the property would appear to be precluded by the National Security Regulations controlling expenditure of building construction work.\\" The same article, however, also speculated that \\"this section of busy Pitt Street may some day see a development which will entirely alter its landscape\\". In 1960, reports first emerged of plans to demolish the Imperial Arcade and replace it with a 36-storey, ¬£4,000,000 mixed-use office block. The building was demolished in 1961. The new Imperial Arcade was developed on the site by property developers Stocks and Holdings Ltd (now Stockland), the company's first Sydney city centre redevelopment project. It was opened on 18 October 1965 by the then NSW Premier, Robert Askin. It consisted of four shopping levels, with office space above. In 2004, the new Imperial Arcade building was purchased for $90 million by Westfield and amalgamated with 3 other properties (Centrepoint, Sydney Central Plaza, and Skygarden) to form Westfield Sydney, which remains on the site today. Architecture The Imperial Arcade building was designed by Thomas Rowe, his third after the Sydney Arcade and the Royal Arcade, in the Second Empire style, based on 17th-century French Renaissance architecture. It was constructed over a two-year period from 1889 to 1891. The 333-foot long arcade formed a thoroughfare from Pitt St to Castlereagh St. The building's footprint spanned two properties. One fronting Castlereagh Street, of size 64-feet, 5-inches x 161 feet (964 sqm), and a second fronting Pitt Street, of size 67 x 163 feet (1015 sqm). to give a combined footprint of 1,979 sqm. The building consisted of seven floors (including the basement) with a combined height of 114 feet (34.75 metres) measured from the basement floor to the ridge of the roof. The floorplan intended for cafes in the basement, 38 shops on the ground floor, and hotel space on the upper floors. The original floorplan was divided into two distinct properties, with a 36-room \\"Pitt Street Hotel\\" and a 39-room \\"Castlereagh Street Hotel\\". Notable features included \\"V-shaped areas in side walls\\" to promote light and ventilation. The Building's original colour scheme of white and grey, deemed too \\"cold and uninviting\\", was redecorated in 1897 under the direction of architect Herbert S. Thompson, in \\"cream and green, with gay touches of salmon, gold, crimson and cinnamon\\".

On October 21, 2016, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center announced that its citizen science project, Disk Detective, discovered a debris disk around J0808, using the WISE telescope, a M5.5V dwarf with significant infrared excess at both 12 and 22 Œºm. Classified as Peter Pan disk number AWI0005x3s, or 5x3s, a BANYAN II Bayesian analysis revealed (with 93.9% probability) the star's radial velocity as 20.6 ¬± 1.4 km/s, associating it with Carina's ‚àº45 Myr old young moving group. Since most M dwarf debris disks fade in less than 30 million years, this would be the oldest M dwarf debris disk detected in a moving group, implying a change in understanding of constraint in M dwarf debris disk evolution. A follow-up study with an optical spectrum obtained with the ANU Siding Spring 2.3 meter telescope showed a Li-rich M5-star with strong HŒ± emission. The data is consistent with a low accretion of 10‚àí10 yr ‚àí1. ALMA observations did not detect any carbon monoxide, but unresolved 1.3 mm dust emission was detected. Observations with CTIO showed a strong flare and variations in the Paschen-Œ≤ and Brackett-Œ≥ lines, which is a clear sign of accretion.  Debris Disk  The fitting of a modeled disk with the Spectral Energy Distribution of J0808 indicates a disk temperature of about 263 K (-10 ¬∞C or 14 ¬∞F). The follow-up study found that a single disk had a poor match with the 22 Œºm data. The researchers found a better match with a \\"warm\\" outer disk with a temperature of about 240 K (-33 ¬∞C or -28 ¬∞F) and a \\"hot\\" inner disk with a temperature of about 1100 K (827 ¬∞C or 1520 ¬∞F). The warm outer disk is located around 0.115 au and the hot inner disk is located around 0.0056 au. The hot inner disk is likely the source of accreted material. The temperature of the inner disk is comparable to temperatures where amorphous silicates anneal into crystalline form. The inner disk also lies near the Roche limit of the red dwarf and therefore the inner disk could be the result of disrupted planetesimals. The warm outer disk could be similar to dust belts seen around B- to K-type stars, which have temperatures around 190 K and which likely represent small dust grains of sublimating ice from icy planetesimals. ALMA detected a third component with a temperature of 20 K (-253 ¬∞C or -424 ¬∞F). Using this temperature the researchers were able to estimate the dust mass to 0.057¬±0.006 . This is higher than the disk mass around ~20 Myr old AU Microscopii and the ~50 Myr old GJ 182, but smaller than the ~10 Myr old TWA 7. The disk has a radius smaller than 16 au. The missing CO detection is explained with two possible scenarios: Either dust grains are released in a collisional cascade induced by the collisions of km-sized planetesimals or a recent collision of planetary bodies generated a large amount of small dust grains. A light curve from CTIO shows variations, which could be disk material blocking light from the star. The TESS light curve shows aperiodic dipping on timescales of 0.5‚Äì2 days.  Peter Pan disks  Other stars and brown dwarfs were discovered to be similar to J0808, with signs of youth while being in an older moving group. Together with J0808, these older low-mass accretors in nearby moving groups are being called Peter Pan disks.

The pub is located at 1 Park End Street, next to the Castle Mill Stream and close to the end of the Oxford Canal. The site of the modern-day Lighthouse pub was within a stone's throw of the Norman city walls. Flanked on either side by the 11th century St George's Tower and Castle Mound, the area was part of the moat system guarding Oxford Castle. The area remained without significant development or residence until after 1790 opening of the Oxford Canal. Inscription commemorating the 300 year anniversary of the Baptist community in Oxford on the former site of a Baptist meeting house destroyed in 1715. The balcony of the Lighthouse pub can be seen in the background. The Baptist Meeting House There is reference to a Baptist meeting house in a plaque to the southwest of the pub. Originally constructed in the early 19th century, the Lighthouse now stands on the former site of this meeting house after it was destroyed in the nationwide Jacobite Rising of 1715. As the geography of the area changed over the centuries, so too did the address and facade of the pub. The earliest recorded entry of the public house has it located within St Thomas' parish. In the years ahead the pub would be addressed at Pacey's Bridge, Middle Fisher Row and Park End Street. From Racer's to Navigations End A new industrial quarter to the west of Oxford arose around the high traffic of the Oxford Canal. Coal, transported along the canal directly to modern day Park End Street, resulted in the area becoming a hotbed of industry: breweries, bakeries, jam factories and more sprung up in what was undeveloped land. Though this particular public house benefitted from being adjacent to both a main canal artery and the Oxford Coal Wharf, it was far from being unique as the area dotted with taverns, all looking to attract the many factory and canal workers. In 1824, the pub is believed to have been called \\"Racers\\" and operated by a Mr C. Collier. By 1830 it was in the proprietorship of one James Pacey and is recorded as \\"Navigation's End\\" ‚Äì deriving its name from the stream then referred to as \\"Old Navigation\\". One may reasonably deduce James was an affluent individual ‚Äì he bequeathed his family name to the adjoining \\"Pacey's Bridge\\". The Queens Arms, the Mayor and Industry in the West End Taken by Henry Taunt in 1905, this photograph shows the charismatic Abel Beesley with the Queen's Arms pub in the background, adjacent to Pacey's Bridge By 1863 the pub had changed significantly, it had been renamed \\"The Queen's Arms\\" in honour of Queen Charlotte (wife of King George III) and ownership had passed to Mr William Lucas. William, a saddler-turned-publican, raised a family in the residences above the pub. His eldest son, Thomas, was elected Mayor of Oxford in 1892 and also lay the foundation stone of the Town Hall the following year. The senior William Lucas died in 1866 (buried in nearby St Thomas Church) leaving his widow Mary to run the Queen's Arms. Fred Thacker's Map of Oxford's West End Canals in 1920 By 1876 the pub had passed into the hands of Albert Thornton and at last 1 Park End Street seemed to have found some stability in this period as the pub stayed in the Thornton family, possibly into the 1930s. This period saw great change in the West End of Oxford, the railway station at Frideswide Square gradually eroded away much of the canal trade. In 1913 William Morris (later Lord Nuffield), without licence, started his own bus service to compete with the city's cumbersome tram network. In 1951, Lord Nuffield further forced change when he acquired the Oxford Canal Basin and proceeded to fill it. Nuffield College and Worcester Street car park now stand where once lay the Basin. This was the death knell of the canal system as a competitive mode of transport in Oxford as technology replaced human labour. An apt example can be found in the reconstruction of Pacey's Bridge to withstand the weight of cars, but at the expense of closing the canal route. Such changes to the local landscape affected the demographic in the area and it seems the Queens Arms kept pace with the social evolution: Rosie O'Gradys and Morrells Brewery Rosie O'Grady's before it closed in 2009 The pub had been in the Morrells Brewing Company portfolio for most its life, with beer brewed at the nearby Lion Brewery. The decline of the publican industry since the 1990s though, saw not only the Queen's Arms change, but also its brewery. In 1996, responding to the need to move with the times, the Queen's Arms was relaunched as the Irish- themed \\"Rosie O'Gradys\\". Patrons of its heyday will reminisce of Irish folk music replete with strings and wind. Further change was afoot two years later in 1998 as Morrells faced a fractious breakup. Lion Brewery was closed and redeveloped as luxury apartments and the various other parts of the enterprise went in different directions. Rosie O'Grady's and the nearby Wychwood Brewery in Witney were a part of the \\"Refresh\\" portfolio eventually acquired by Marstons in 2008. The Duke's Cut and Marstons The Duke's Cut in 2014 Recognising the need for change, Marstons recruited experienced publican Mr James Knox to help turn the fortunes of the pub around. He duly delivered a refurbished venue in 2009: \\"The Duke's Cut\\" ‚Äì its name derived from the Duke of Marlborough's canal construction of 1796 which connected the River Thames to Old Navigation running alongside the pub. The Duke's Cut was very different from its Irish-themed predecessor with a calmer, more family and food-focused environment. The Lighthouse and Novandi In 2013, the Duke's Cut was acquired by Novandi Ltd who gave the pub a new, bolder identity, one which would play on the building's nautical heritage and also pay homage to industry which ended that heritage. In 2014, 1 Park End Street reopened as \\"The Lighthouse\\", no doubt evoking its history as an inland waterways beacon at the terminus of the Oxford canal. One might wonder though, whether any city in England is further from a seafront than Oxford? Perhaps this is part of the charm. The modern-day Lighthouse is a \\"Nautica-Steampunk\\" pub-bar-restaurant hybrid. Its interior can be best described as \\"10,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" meets \\"Moby Dick\\". Like its predecessors, The Lighthouse serves beer and the Witney-brewed \\"Oxford Gold\\" ale is a part of their range. The similarity in services with previous eras most likely ends there though.

The work was first published in Seventeen and covers a Christmas Eve dinner when Tan was 14 years old. It was subsequently published as a part of The Opposite of Fate: A Book of Musings. The work has been used in Common Core classes and features themes of acceptance of differences, growing up, family, heritage, and cultural differences. It typically is used for seventh grade and eighth-grade classes. The work has been compared to a similar work by American chef and author Gabrielle Hamilton, \\"Killing Dinner\\". Summary As the plot in \\"Fish Cheeks\\" progresses, new characters and problems arise that the main character, Amy, struggles to handle. During the exposition, you learn that the main character is a young Chinese girl. The narrative takes place on Christmas eve, when the author was 14 years old. Her Chinese family had invited American friends, a ministers family including a boy Tan has a crush on, for a traditional Chinese dinner. At this point in the story her name is not yet mentioned. She becomes upset when she learns the news because she is afraid of what his white American family will think of their Chinese Christmas. When the action of the story starts to rise and her mother begins to prepare for the dinner, Amy's worries continue to grow and all of the usual foods that her family makes become foreign as the kitchen is filled with appalling mounds of raw food. When the story reaches its climax, both of the families are eating dinner and Amy has lost all hope. Her family acts different and doesn't show the same manners as Robert's family. Her father pulls the tender fish cheek from the fish and offers it to Amy because it is her favorite and this caused her to want to vanish from the dinner. As the Christmas dinner goes on she feels more ashamed and doesn't know what to do. Amy is embarrassed by her family and by the food (including fish cheeks) served to the guests, and again by her father's belching after dinner, although he explains that it's a polite Chinese custom that shows satisfaction. Once the night is over she is in silence and not sure what to even say. After their guests leave, Tan talks with her mother, who tells her, \\"[the] only shame is to have shame\\" and that she should have pride in her own heritage. It is not until later that she realizes how special that meal was for her. She resolves all the hard feelings when she realizes that all the foods that were made for that meal were her favorite and she should have enjoyed the meal instead of worrying so much about the guests. As the plot in the story moves on it reveals how Amy feels worse and worse about the dinner. She is super embarrassed of how different she is compared to her crush and his family. When Tan ends the story she shows how little that dinner actually meant to her later in life. The internal conflict that she had went away and the story ends with her finding peace about the situation.

He was played by Canadian actor Steven Ogg. Simon is the second-in-command of the Saviors and the personal right-hand man of the Saviors' leader, Negan. Simon is instrumental in capturing Rick Grimes and his group as they head in an RV to get Maggie Greene to the Hilltop Colony. Much like Daryl Dixon, Simon is an original character not included in the comic book series of the same name. Appearances=Background While little else is known about Simon before his introduction, in \\"Worth\\", he is revealed to have been responsible for the massacre of all the men of the Oceanside community. Negan recognized that Simon's cruelty could be put to productive means but needed to be watched closely, and thus Negan made him a high-ranking Savior. Season 6 Simon is introduced in the Season 6 finale, \\"Last Day on Earth\\", where he is one of Negan's lieutenants working to route Rick Grimes and his group towards a designated meeting point by creating roadblocks. Once Rick and his allies arrive, Simon and other Saviors force the group to their knees as they are first introduced to Negan and \\"Lucille\\", his baseball bat wrapped with barbed wire. Seeking to force the group into submission for their transgressions against the Saviors, Negan prepares to kill one of them. Season 7 In the Season 7 premiere, \\"The Day Will Come When You Won't Be\\", Negan first beats Abraham Ford's head to a pulp, and then kills Glenn Rhee as punishment when Daryl Dixon tries to stop Negan. Negan, Simon, and the other Saviors take Daryl as their captive as they depart back to their base, the Sanctuary. Simon is assigned to be the Saviors' contact for the Hilltop community, assuring the cooperation of the cowardly Gregory to continue the Hilltop's offerings to the Saviors (\\"Go Getters\\"). When Daryl escapes the Sanctuary, Simon and the Saviors seek him out at the Alexandria Safe-Zone, ransacking the community, and warning Rick that retribution will come if they find him there (\\"Rock in the Road\\"). After Negan kills the Sanctuary's doctor, Simon recovers the doctor's brother who has been serving Hilltop. Simon becomes aware that Gregory is losing control of the community to Maggie Rhee, Glenn's wife, and Simon confides in Gregory to let him know if there is trouble. (\\"The Other Side\\") Eventually, Negan and the Saviors are forced to go to war with Rick and the Alexandria community, but Rick and his allies are able to repel the attack. Afterwards, Rick, Maggie, and King Ezekiel of the Kingdom community agree to launch an offensive against the Saviors, while Negan, Simon, and the other Saviors prepare for a new attack. (\\"The First Day of the Rest of Your Life\\") Season 8 Gregory, now having lost all control of Hilltop to Maggie, comes to the Sanctuary to warn Simon, Negan, and the other lieutenants about this, but assures them that a bit of coercion can bring them back in line (\\"The Big Scary U\\", in flashback). Simon suggests they just wipe out the Hilltop community but Negan firmly dismisses that idea, as he sees the residents of these communities as resources. Just then, Rick's combined allies arrive at the Sanctuary, demanding they stop (\\"Mercy\\"). Negan refuses, and Simon tells Gregory to warn the Hilltop soldiers that they will be evicted from Hilltop if they ally with Rick; none of them defect and remain standing for Maggie, and Simon kicks Gregory off a set of stairs. Rick and his allies proceed to fire at the Sanctuary, forcing Negan to take cover within a box trailer, and the rest of the Saviors back inside as they purposely led a walker horde inside the Sanctuary fences as to contain the Saviors. As Rick and his allies leave, Gabriel Stokes sees Gregory struggling to protect himself, and helps rescue him, but Gregory panics and drives off alone, leaving Gabriel to end up taking shelter in the same box trailer as Negan. Rick's attack leaves the Saviors unable to leave Sanctuary, allowing Rick and his group to seize control of other Savior outposts, including capturing several Saviors at an outpost normally overseen by Simon. At the Sanctuary, Simon, Dwight, and the other lieutenants, believing Negan to be dead, struggle in the power vacuum, and become concerned that one of them leaked information to Rick's group; Dwight, who has opted to help Rick, diverts their attention to other matters (\\"The Big Scary U\\"). Simon starts to take control, and his decisions lead to concern from the workers below. Just as the situation gets tense, Negan reveals himself to still be alive, having escaped the box trailer with Gabriel. Negan reasserts control. Circumstances lead the Saviors to wipe out the horde blocking them, and Negan quickly dispatches his lieutenants to face Rick's allies (\\"How It's Gotta Be\\"). Simon leads a group to Hilltop, capturing Jerry along the way, and stops Maggie and an convoy of vehicles as they head to another Savior outpost. Simon kills Neil, one of Maggie's soldiers, and turns Jerry back over to her in exchange for making her turn around and return to Hilltop. Meanwhile, Negan launches a major offensive at Alexandria, effectively destroying the community, through Carl Grimes is able to help protect the residents by having them hide in a sewer. Dwight, to protect his allies, is forced to turn on some Saviors during this, but one Savior, Laura, manages to escape before he can kill her. As Negan organizes the Saviors to find the missing Alexanderians, he instructs Simon to go to the Scavengers, led by Jadis, and give them his \\"standard offer\\", to kill one of them to bring the others into line. (\\"The Lost and the Plunderers\\") Before he leaves, the Saviors receive a box from the Hilltop, containing the re-animated body of one of Simon's men that the Hilltop had captured, infuriating him. His anger is riled up when he faces Jadis, and orders his men to massacre the Scavengers. Jadis manages to survive by playing dead. Simon returns to the Sanctuary and reports that he had followed Negan's orders. Later, Negan devices a new plan to attack Hilltop with weapons covered in the viscera of walkers, so that those hit would turn and attack the community from inside (\\"The Key\\") As they drive there, Simon has Dwight ride with him, and confides that he believes Negan is not aggressive enough and thinks they should dispose him from power. Rick attacks Negan's car, knocking it out of the convoy. Simon and Dwight have the other Saviors hold guard as they search for Negan. They find his abandoned car, unaware that he is hiding from Rick in a nearby building. Simon asserts to Dwight this is their opportunity, and Dwight sets fire to the car. The two report back to the other Saviors that Negan is likely dead, and now instructs them that they will wipe out the Hilltop community. They are unaware that Negan survives Rick's attack, but is briefly captured by a vengeful Jadis, where he learns of Simon's disobedience. The Saviors' attack on Hilltop commences, but the Hilltop community is well-prepared, and able to fend off the attack (\\"Do Not Send Us Astray\\"). Simon and Dwight sneak into the Hilltop, and Simon is prepared to fire on Tara Chambler, who he knew led the earlier attack on his outpost. Dwight asks to take the shot, discretely but purposely only wounding her with a clean arrow. The Saviors are forced to flee back to the Sanctuary. Simon prepares the Saviors for another large offensive when Negan reappears (\\"Worth\\"). Negan forces Simon to his knees, appearing ready to kill him for trying to seize control of the Saviors, but when Simon succumbs to his orders without question or resistance, Negan tells him all is forgiven. Simon meets with Dwight, urging him to gather any Savior that may be ready to overthrow Negan to a secret meeting. Dwight, trying to cover his own duplicity, agrees. At the meeting, Simon discovers Dwight told Negan about this, and Negan is furious at Simon for having gone against his orders in dealing with the Scavengers as he had with the Oceanside community. He tells Simon the only way to survive is to best him in a fist-fight. With all the Saviors gathered to watch, Simon attempts to kill Negan, but Negan readily overpowers him and chokes him to death. Negan then has Simon's re-animated body chained to the fence outside of Sanctuary. Following peace with the Saviors, the walkers are cleared from the fence and presumably killed, including Simon. (\\"Wrath\\") Development and reception Steven Ogg portrays Simon in the series. In the season six finale, \\"Last Day on Earth\\", Steven Ogg made his debut as Simon, who is a member of the Saviors, the main antagonists in season seven, in which he became a recurring character. Steven Ogg, who portrayed Simon, had been told by showrunner Scott M. Gimple that Simon was going to be killed off at the live season eight premiere event on October 22, 2017. Ogg asked Gimple to have Simon to go down in a \\"big cannonball\\". Both he and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Negan's portrayer, acted out their roles in the final fight, despite neither having fight training. Most critics commented positively on Ogg's performance in the season eight episode \\"Worth\\", with Joe Otterson of Variety saying ‚ÄúOnce again, Steven Ogg proves himself to be one of the best villains in the game in this week‚Äôs episode of ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù. Ogg‚Äôs Simon makes his move to take over the Sanctuary, but his timing proves to be a little off.‚Äù References Category:Fictional lieutenants Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional zombies and revenants Category:Television characters introduced in 2016 Category:The Walking Dead characters ","title":"Simon (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"52089263","text":"Siimurahu is a small uninhabited island in the Baltic Sea belonging to the country of Estonia.

Seen here from Cecil Moses Memorial Park on the west bank of the Duwamish North Wind's Weir or North Wind's Fish Weir south of Seattle on the Duwamish River in Tukwila, Washington is a site that figures prominently in the oral traditions of the Salish people of the Puget Sound region. The legends describe battles between North Wind and South Wind for control of the region.  Salish tradition  According to Salish tradition, North Wind stretched a weir of ice across the Duwamish River at this site; no fish could pass, starving the people up the valley, the people of the Chinook Wind who was married to North Wind's daughter Mountain Beaver Woman. The mother of Mountain Beaver woman survived the starvation, but retreated to the mountain. Mountain Beaver Woman's son, the child Storm Wind, also survived. The people of the North Wind warned Storm Wind to stay away from the mountain, trying to keep from him the knowledge of what had happened to his people, but eventually he defied them and found his grandmother living in misery. He heard her story and helped her out of her misery; she, in return, aided him with a flood that shattered the weir and turned it to stone. Storm Wind and his grandmother defeated North Wind, who only occasionally and briefly torments the area with snow and ice. Location and environs North Wind's Weir is just east of Cecil Moses Memorial Park, in a zone where fresh and salt waters mix, creating a key transition zone for young Chinook salmon swimming downstream to Puget Sound. A pedestrian and bicycle bridge coming out of the park on the Green River Trail crosses the Duwamish River just south of the weir, allowing a view of the rock formation in the river, except when there is a high tide. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, King County, and construction contractor Doyon Project Services completed a habitat restoration project at the site in December 2009, restoring of mudflat and vegetated marsh.

They were held by the Haqqani network until October 2017 when they were rescued by Pakistani forces in Kurram Agency, Pakistan. During their captivity, Coleman gave birth to three children. Background Joshua Boyle was born in Breslau, Ontario, to Linda and Patrick J. Boyle. He attended Rockway Mennonite Collegiate in Kitchener, Ontario, and graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2005. Following the September 11 attacks, Boyle became interested in human rights issues and the case of Omar Khadr, a Canadian held in Guantanamo Bay. Boyle believed Khadr was innocent and spent several years acting as the spokesman for the Khadr family. Through his work with Khadr, Boyle met and eventually married Omar's sister Zaynab in 2009, but they divorced in 2010. Caitlan Coleman was born in Stewartstown, Pennsylvania. Boyle and Coleman met online as teenagers as mutual fans of the Star Wars franchise and were married in 2011. After their marriage, they spent time travelling in Central America before moving to Perth-Andover, New Brunswick, where Boyle worked as a municipal clerk. In July 2012, the two began travelling through Russia and Central Asia, planning on travelling through the \\"safe '-stans\\". For unknown reasons, the couple crossed into Afghanistan in October; Boyle has stated it was to help \\"ordinary villagers\\", while other accounts indicate a more spontaneous decision. Kidnapping On October 8, 2012, Boyle sent an email to his parents saying that he and Coleman were in an \\"unsafe\\" part of Afghanistan. Soon after, the pair were captured by members of the Haqqani network. Coleman was pregnant at the time of their capture. The first ransom video of the couple was released in early 2013. The Haqqani network demanded the release of prisoners in exchange for the release of Boyle and Coleman. It was also revealed that Coleman had given birth to her child, a boy. Over the course of their five-year captivity, Coleman gave birth to a girl and a second boy, and suffered a miscarriage of a second girl. Coleman and Boyle claim that the miscarriage was intentionally caused by their captors, but the Taliban claims it occurred naturally. The two would regularly be separated and beaten, and Coleman claims that she was raped. She also charges Boyle with cruelty saying he \\"was just like my captors.\\" The family would regularly be transported between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rescue In September 2017, a CIA drone spotted what was believed to be Caitlan Coleman and her children in a militant camp in northwestern Pakistan near the Afghan border. SEAL Team Six was tasked with preparing an extraction, but concerns about the accuracy of the image and the logistics of an assault deterred the Americans from taking action. The information about the family's location was passed to the Pakistani government with a request to oversee a rescue operation. On October 11, 2017, Pakistani troops encountered the vehicle carrying the family in the Kurram Valley, Pakistan, shooting out the tires and rescuing them. The family was being held in the locked trunk. The captors managed to escape, and Boyle was injured by shrapnel. The family was then transported to Islamabad before travelling back to North America via the United Kingdom. Aftermath After their rescue, the family stayed with Boyle's parents in Smiths Falls, Ontario, before moving to Ottawa. In December 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with the family after Boyle requested a meeting. Criminal charges In January 2018, Boyle was charged with numerous crimes including assault, sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, and unlawful confinement, relating to incidents that allegedly occurred after the family was freed from captivity by Pakistani security forces and returned to Canada in October 2017. There are two alleged victims but their identities are protected by a publication ban. The charges have not been heard in court. In June 2018, Boyle was released on bail under the condition that he wear a GPS monitor and live at his parents' house in Smiths Falls, Ontario. Coleman attributed Boyle's actions to their captivity, stating, \\"I can't speak about the specific charges, but I can say that ultimately it is the strain and trauma he was forced to endure for so many years and the effects that had on his mental state that is most culpable for this.\\" Boyle faced 19 charges, relating to two victims, being Coleman and another who was not identified; 17 of the charges relate to Coleman who agreed to lift the publication ban as to her identity as one of the victims. The charges included sexual assault, uttering a threat to cause death, assault with a weapon, unlawful confinement, and administering a noxious substance. All relate to incidents alleged to have occurred between October 14 and December 30, 2017. Boyle pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. The trial commenced on March 25, 2019, with judge alone to decide on a verdict. Boyle's lawyer told the court that Coleman's reliability and credibility would be \\"vigorously challenged\\". The trial concluded in October 2019 and on December 18, Boyle was cleared of all charges. The judge's comments indicated a lack of credibility on both sides and he said the limited evidence failed to prove that criminal offences had occurred, beyond a reasonable doubt. Boyle's lawyer told the news media that his client would now take steps to gain access to the children and that his long-term goal was custody. Child custody battle Records of the Ontario Superior Court child custody case, unsealed in early September 2018, indicate that Coleman alleged that Boyle had physically and emotionally abused her during their captivity. According to Coleman, Boyle had physically struck her, once breaking a cheekbone, and depicted her as \\"an enemy in his life,\\" accusing her of betrayal to the guards. Boyle's own affidavit denied the allegations and accused Coleman of child neglect due to mental health issues during the captivity, requiring him to be the primary caregiver. The case is pending, and the allegations have not been heard in court. Since June 23, 2018, Coleman has had temporary sole custody; she relocated to Pennsylvania by mid-summer with the children. Boyle tried to prevent that move, but his request was denied by the court and Justice Tracy Engelking issued a restraining order to prevent him from contacting or approaching Coleman or the children.

She earned her bachelor's degree cum laude from Brigham Young University and her J.D. degree cum laude from New York University. She served as a member of the New York University Law Review. She was an Academic Research Fellow at the New York University School of Law. She joined the law faculty at the University of Georgia School of Law in 2012 and was the J. Alton Hosch Associate Professor, teaching contracts and banking law. Prior to that position, she taught banking regulation, property, and administrative law at Brigham Young University's J. Reuben Clark Law School. Baradaran practiced law in the Davis, Polk & Wardwell financial institutions group in New York City. The Huffington Post described her as one of \\"a powerful cohort of Mormon women of color scholar-activists... who are powerful critics of racism, colonialism, and economic exploitation\\". She spoke about her experience as a refugee from Iran in Slate in January 2017. She pointed out that she was one of the \\"immigrants and refugees from 'terrorist countries' that soon will be banned by executive order from coming [to America]\\". She concluded: \\"The irony for me is that it was Iran's tribalism and nationalism that put my family out in the first place. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime had said 'Iran First', too. They silenced the press, kicked out all the 'others', and ran the liberal intellectuals out of the country. I hope that's not what happens here. But even if it does, this is my home and I will keep working to make America great because I have so much hope in America\\".  Books  Both Baradaran and her first book How the Other Half Banks: Exclusion, Exploitation, and the Threat to Democracy () have received national and international media coverage, the book having been featured in the New York Times, the Atlantic, the Financial Times, the Irish Examiner, American Public Media's Marketplace, C-SPAN's Washington Journal, and TEDxUGA. In the book, she proposes postal banking, an idea that was endorsed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. She gave a speech on the book and her thoughts on America's banking system generally to the American Postal Workers Union and the National Association of Letter Carriers on 15 October 2015, again suggesting a return to postal banking, which was discontinued in 1967. Her second book, The Color of Money: Black Banking and the Racial Wealth Gap was published in 2017 by Harvard University Press. She has also published articles including \\"Regulation by Hypothetical\\" in the Vanderbilt Law Review, \\"It's Time for Postal Banking\\" in the Harvard Law Review Forum, \\"Banking and the Social Contract\\" in the Notre Dame Law Review, \\"How the Poor Got Cut Out of Banking\\" in the Emory Law Journal, \\"Reconsidering the Separation of Banking and Commerce\\" in the George Washington Law Review and \\"The ILC and the Reconstruction of U.S. Banking\\" in the SMU Law Review.

The Bagradis valley became Roman after the Third Punic War about 146BCAppian, Punica 112. and it quickly became an important region for agriculture,Dennis P. Kehoe, The Economics of Agriculture on Roman Imperial Estates in North Africa (Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1988) p.7. with the rolling plains home to numerous Imperial estates. The area around Buruni fell to the Vandal Kingdom around 423 and for a century was ruled by the Arian kings until in 533 the Orthodox Byzantines replaced them. The area was held by Byzantium until the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the end of the 7th century. Saltus Burunitanus The saltus burunitanus (CIL VIII 10570 = ILS 6870) is an ancient Roman era document.

The work was commissioned by the BBC and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. It was composed from 2003 to 2004 and was first performed by the organist Wayne Marshall and the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen at the Walt Disney Concert Hall on October 7, 2004. Paul Jacobs (organist) gave the American East Coast premiere of this work in January 2018 in Philadelphia's Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts with the Philadelphia Orchestra and conductor Yannick N√©zet-S√©guin. Composition=Background A Scotch Bestiary was composed as a set of musical portraits for organ and orchestra. As the subtitle indicates, the piece was conceived in the style of such similarly episodic works as Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns's The Carnival of the Animals, and Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. Knowing the first performance was to be held in the Walt Disney Concert Hall, MacMillan musically based the episodes on the style of early Disney cartoons. These variations were inspired by \\"human archetypes and personalities\\" MacMillan had encountered throughout his life in Scotland. Structure A Scotch Bestiary has a duration of roughly 33 minutes and is composed in two parts, the first of which is divided into several smaller movements: Part I: The Menagerie, Caged :1. Ode to a cro- magnon hyena ::A page is turned :2. Reptiles and Big Fish (in a small pond) :3. Her Serene and Ubiquitous Majesty, Queen Bee ::Another page is turned :4. The red-handed, no-surrender, howler monkey :5. Uncle Tom Cat and his chickens ::Yet another page is turned :6. Scottish Patriots :7. The Reverend Cuckoo and his Parroting Chorus :8. Jackass Hackass ::The book is closed Part II: The Menagerie, Uncaged Instrumentation The work is scored for a solo organ and a large orchestra comprising three flutes (2nd doubling alto flute, 3rd doubling piccolo), three oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais), three clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, four percussionists, harp, electric piano, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a sonically spectacular concerto for organ and orchestra\\" and wrote, \\"What MacMillan has come up with is a two-part, quirkily animated concerto. His bumptious bestiary is just that, a musical book of fanciful animals impersonated by organ and orchestra. In the first part, he introduces 'a cro-magnon hyena' and the 'red- handed, no surrender, howler monkey,' as well as buzzing bees, lumbering reptiles, the cuckoo. In the second part, he lets them loose.\\" Andrew Achenbach of Gramophone similarly described it as \\"a caustic, loopy and exhilarating showpiece for organ and orchestra.\\" Stephen Johnson of BBC Music Magazine observed, \\"...while the Concerto has its moments of spellbound celebration, like the strings' imitation of improvised Gallic psalm-singing (one of the loveliest things in all folk music) in the central slow movement, A Scotch Bestiary is full of a black vitality which always threatens to explode into pure chaos. Some of MacMillan's targets ‚Äì indicated in titles like 'The red-handed, no-surrender, howler monkey' and 'Scottish Patriots' ‚Äì are easy to identify. Others, as the work's subtitle implies ('Enigmatic variations on a zoological carnival at a Caledoninan exhibition'), are more elusive to outsiders, but even then the acrid caricature remains wickedly entertaining.\\" See also *List of compositions by James MacMillan References Category:Concertos by James MacMillan Category:2004 compositions Category:Organ concertos Category:Music commissioned by the BBC Category:Music commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic ","title":"A Scotch Bestiary"},{"id":"52090024","text":"John Adriani (December 2, 1907 - June 14, 1988) was an American anesthesiologist and director of anesthesiology at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. He was president of the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) and he received a Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). He was an early supporter of physician involvement in nurse anesthetist training. Early life and education Adriani was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He was the oldest of nine children. His parents were Italian immigrants. After attending high school in Bridgeport, he earned an undergraduate degree from Columbia College and a medical degree from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. As a medical student, Adriani, who remembered receiving only one anesthesia-related lecture in school, experienced the death of one of his patients from a poorly understood complication, malignant hyperthermia. The experience inspired him to study anesthesiology as a career path. He trained in anesthesiology at Bellevue Hospital and NYU Medical Center. During his training, he was mentored by influential anesthesiologist Emery Andrew Rovenstine. After completing his training with Rovenstine, Adriani stayed on his staff as an instructor. Career In 1941, Adriani became director of anesthesiology at Charity Hospital. The hospital had been constructed two years earlier, and its anesthesia services were disorganized, with poorly trained personnel often administering the anesthetic to patients in the operating room. Adriani worked with physicians and nurses, lecturing to them on anesthesia-related topics. The result was that Charity developed an anesthesia residency program for physicians as well as an accredited school of nurse anesthesia. While Adriani was at Charity, he served on the faculty at the Tulane University School of Medicine and the LSU School of Medicine. In addition to his anesthesia work, he established Charity's blood bank and bone bank, and he directed the hospital's inhalation therapists. In the 1940s, the ABA and ASA held a philosophy that it was unethical for physicians to assist in the training of nurse anesthetists. The ABA went further, saying that they prohibited anesthesiologists from lecturing at meetings of nurse anesthetists and threatening to cancel the board certifications of anesthesiologists who participated in such training. Adriani resisted, telling an ABA official that he would bring a case in federal court if they revoked his certification. The ABA relented then officially dropped the policy in 1965; this change of direction was informally known as the Adriani rule. Adriani was awarded the fifth Distinguished Service Award from the ASA in 1949, and he sat on the board of directors for the ABA from 1960 to 1972. He served as ABA president for one term, and he was a member of the examinations committee who shaped the ABA's modern board certification process. Later life In the late 1960s, Adriani received an appointment to head the Bureau of Medicine at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the FDA appointment was withdrawn based on pressure from the pharmaceutical industry because of controversial statements that Adriani made about drug labeling. Adriani felt that brand name labeling increased consumer confusion around medications, and he had argued that drug companies should only be allowed to label their medicines with generic names. Adriani officially retired in 1974, but he had a continued presence at Charity Hospital even in retirement. He died of diverticulitis in 1988.

History Yaroku Nakamura was instrumental in the delivery of arms to the Philippines. In 1874, the steamship Nunobiki Maru was built by Caird & Company in Greenock, Scotland. The ship was first operated by the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland as SS Sindoro. In 1896, it was acquired by Mitsui Bussan. The ship was best known for her delivery of arms. In 1899, Filipino diplomat Mariano Ponce gained the aid of Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen in finding a way to procure arms. Sun sympathized with the Filipino cause during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and may have seen the Philippines as a staging point for his revolution in China. With Sun's help, Ponce was able to meet pan-Asian Japanese philosopher T≈çten Miyazaki and Japanese silviculturist Yaroku Nakamura. Sympathizing with the Filipino cause as well, Miyazaki and Nakamura managed to make an arms purchase amounting to 155,000 yen with Japanese trader Kihatiro Okura. This amount included the 18,000 yen used to purchase Nunobiki Maru, the ship used to deliver the arms. With the grant given by Nakamura's brother, Vice Minister of War Yujiro Nakamura, the deal was made. On 20 June 1899, the ship sailed off from Nagasaki. The delivery was composed of 10,000 rifles, six million rounds of ammunition, a single fixed cannon, ten field guns, seven field glasses, pressing machines for gunpowder and ammunition, and other military supplies. In order to avoid the American blockade, the ship was supposed to anchor off Taiwan first before arriving in the Philippines. However, she foundered in a typhoon between Taihoku and Shanghai, and the ship was lost on 21 July 1899. Nunobiki Maru was foundered when she was from the Saddle Islands at the mouth of Yangtze River. Despite the sinking of the Nunobiki Maru, Nakamura pressed on for a second delivery which included 2.5 million rounds of ammunition. However, the remaining crew of the Nunobiki Maru revealed the purpose of the cargo. This resulted in a diplomatic dispute between Japan and the United States. The second delivery never went through. Meanwhile, after the disaster that struck Nunobiki Maru, Miyazaki expressed his suspicion that Nakamura's intentions were driven more by profit than altruism, and came to state to Sun that the arms were defective and that ship herself might have been in bad condition when she set sail. In addition, after the incident, it became more difficult to deliver arms out of Japan. Technical details Nunobiki Maru had a compound engine, a drive shaft, and a propeller. It was a ship transport protected by iron. She was 79.3 meters long, and her beam was 9.2 meters. Her hull number was 183.

He also previously served as the Director of Anoto Group AB and Director of Panagroup Corporation. Early life Antonio Mugica was born in 1974. He graduated from the Universidad Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in Caracas, Venezuela, where he earned an Electrical Engineering degree. Career In the late 1990s, Mugica along with two other Venezuelan colleagues, Alfredo Jos√© Anzola and Roger Pinate, created a system where thousands of inputs could be placed into a network simultaneously. Early trials of this system were used on ATMs in Mexico, though after the 2000 United States presidential election, they decided instead to dedicate the system toward electoral functions. Mugica has been an advocate for electronic and internet voting, election modernization, and digital democracy. Some of his views to bring in technological advancement in elections include: the need to create tools for engaging citizens through voting and participation in the governance process, making voting more accessible, making sure that comprehensive pre- and post-election audits become a common practice, and the significance of investing in research and development in the election technology market. Smartmatic Smartmatic formed out of the SBC organization that was owned 51% by Smartmatic, 47% Venezuelan state telecommunications organization CANTV and 2% by an affiliated company, Bizta, also owned by the owners of Smartmatic, with a board member from the Bolivarian government during the time an industry-fostering loan from a government institution was in force. In 2004 Smartmatic was granted a contract worth $128 million with the CNE, the government's elections agency, to acquire its products (an automated voting system, voting machines and support services) for the Regional Elections scheduled for that year's 2nd semester. But then, after collecting the required number of citizens' signatures, the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum was activated to remove Hugo Ch√°vez from the presidency, and Smartmatic had to hastily tailor the Voting System to the changed requirements. Smartmatic's election technology has been used in local and national elections in Venezuela, the United States, Belgium, Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina, Chile, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Estonia and the Philippines.

The War of Independence Museum, another museum which served as the Turkish Parliament (from 1920‚Äì1924) is to the northeast of the Republic Museum. History The former Turkish Parliament building (now the War of Independence Museum) which was used during the Turkish War of Independence, was actually a branch office building of the Ottoman era- Committee of Union and Progress. During the war of Independence the committee was already dissolved and the nationalists used the building as the parliament building, but it was small and inconvenient. Thus, after the Republic was proclaimed in 1923, a new and larger building was constructed just to the southwest of the former building. The architect of the new building was Vedat (Tek). The parliament moved to this new building on 18 September 1924. Up to 1960, all Turkish Parliaments from the 2nd to the 11th Parliament of Turkey served in this building. After 1960, the building served as the CENTO (Central Treaty Organization) headquarters. After CENTO was dissolved in 1979, the building was handed over to the Ministry of Culture, and the ministry redesigned the building as a museum.

The aircraft was to operate in the vicinity of Misurata in Libya on a surveillance mission by the French Ministry of Defence. All five people on board the aircraft died in the crash, making it the deadliest aviation accident in Malta since 1985. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a Fairchild SA227-AT Merlin IVC, registered in the United States as N577MX. The aircraft, which had been built in 1983, did not have a history of technical issues, and had last undergone an airworthiness inspection in 2011. The aircraft belonged to Worldwide Aircraft Services and at the time of the crash was leased to Luxembourg-based CAE Aviation, operating on behalf of the French Ministry of Defence. The SA227 is capable of being flown either by a single pilot or by two pilots. On the accident flight, the aircraft was being flown by a single pilot accompanied by a monitoring pilot. The monitoring pilot was not certified to fly SA227 aircraft, nor was he required to be. Accident The aircraft took off from Malta International Airport at around 07:20, bound for Misrata in Libya on a surveillance flight; and was due to land back at Malta at the conclusion of the mission. Just after take off, the aircraft pitched up to an unusual attitude, rolled right, and crashed into the ground, bursting into flames upon impact. The wreckage landed on the airport perimeter road within the limits of the village of Kirkop, with some debris falling into a nearby Armed Forces of Malta barracks. All five people on board, three passengers and two crew members, died in the crash. All were French nationals, and the passengers were employees of the defence ministry, while the crew worked for CAE Aviation. Aftermath Immediately after the crash, the staff at Mater Dei Hospital were placed in major incident mode. The Malta International Airport was shut down for four hours after the crash before reopening at 11:30. Many flights that were bound to Malta had to be diverted to Sicily. The Maltese government issued a statement that the flight was part of a French customs surveillance operation to combat drug- and human trafficking that had been ongoing for five months. However, the French customs department tweeted that none of its officials were on board, and French Minister of Defence Jean-Yves Le Drian later said that three of the dead were defence ministry employees within the Directorate-General for External Security. However, Maltese Minister for Home Affairs and National Security Carmelo Abela stuck to the government's original statement that the aircraft was involved in a customs operation, and the flight's exact purpose was unclear. Aviation experts, as well as Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, stated that the crash was likely a result of a mechanical failure or pilot error. Malta's Bureau of Air Accident Investigation had responsibility for conducting an investigation of the accident. This was the worst aviation accident on Maltese soil since the 1975 ≈ªabbar Avro Vulcan crash that killed six people and injured another twenty.  Investigation  The aircraft was not fitted with a flight data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder. However, the crash was recorded by multiple cameras, several of which also recorded audio. When combined with data retrieved from the memory in a GPS receiver located in the wreckage, a fairly accurate reconstruction of the aircraft's final moments could be created. The takeoff roll proceeded normally, however after leaving the ground the aircraft continued to pitch upwards, reaching a nose high attitude of 34 degrees within four seconds of rotation. At this point, the aircraft rolled to the right, consistent with a power-on stall (due to the direction of rotation of the propellers, the right wing will stall before the left one at high engine power). The aircraft reached a maximum right bank angle of 152 degrees, at which point the direction of the roll reversed. The aircraft struck the ground at a 70 degree right bank and 38 degree nose-down pitch, just ten seconds after lifting off. Analysis of the audio from several security cameras found no evidence of engine problems, nor could any engine issue explain the aircraft's performance. The aircraft had undergone substantial modifications to its flight control system in 1985; several cables had been re-routed to accommodate the special surveillance equipment installed. The aircraft's stick pusher system, known on the Merlin as the stall avoidance system (SAS), had also been altered for this reason. An examination of the bulb filaments in the cockpit annunciator panel revealed that at some point prior to impact, the SAS FAULT annunciator had illuminated. In addition, recent maintenance had been performed to the aircraft's flight control system, but maintenance instructions for the modified version of the system were not available when this was done. Damage to the wreckage prevented a conclusive analysis of the primary flight controls or the SAS. Based on the performance of the aircraft, the evidence recovered from the wreckage and a study of previous incidents involving aircraft in the same family, the BEA narrowed the cause of the crash to three possibilities.  Possible causes  The most plausible of the three would have been a failure or jamming in the nose down cable of the elevator control system. This scenario would explain why the aircraft continued to pitch up beyond the recommended climb attitude after rotation. In this case, the pilot would not have been able to counteract the upwards moment through pushing forward on the control column. Depending on the nature of the failure, the control column itself would not necessarily have jammed, which would have made the problem more difficult to recognize immediately. The only way to overcome an elevator control failure would be through the pitch trim system, but the aircraft reached a stall situation too quickly for this to be effective. As the aircraft approached a stall, the stick pusher would have activated. As the pusher servo is connected to the same control cabling as the control column, it would have been unable to function correctly, explaining the illumination of the SAS FAULT light. A less likely but still possible hypothesis was an inadvertent activation of the stick pusher system. This was considered possible due to the relocation of the SAS components to an area near a water evacuation drain on the aircraft. If the pusher servo had activated at the point of rotation, the pilot may have reflexively pulled against it with enough force to disable it, causing an abrupt pitch-up. Inadvertent SAS activation had happened on other SA-227 aircraft. However, the aircraft's flight path did not fully support this scenario. If the stick pusher had activated erroneously and been over- corrected by the pilot, the aircraft would likely have pitched down slightly before rapidly pitching up. Instead, the upwards pitch was more or less constant until the moment the aircraft stalled. Nevertheless, without more accurate flight data, the theory could not be ruled out completely. The least likely of the three involved the antenna for the HF radio (consisting of a cable extending from the upper forward fuselage to the tip of the vertical stabiliser) snapping during rotation. Afterwards, the cable may have become wrapped around the right-hand elevator, jamming it upwards. The HF antenna is not standard equipment on the SA-227, and the type installed had been known to fail occasionally. In 1998, a cable had jammed the elevator of a SOCATA MS.893 into a nose-down position, causing a fatal crash. Regardless, no components from the cable were found on the runway, and the physics involved to cause the cable to jam the aircraft's elevators were considered extremely improbable. The final report concluded that whichever malfunction occurred \\"probably originated in the specific modifications of the aircraft and in the application of an inappropriate maintenance to these modifications.\\" NotesReferences Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2016 Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Malta Category:2016 in Malta Category:October 2016 events in Europe Category:Kirkop Category:Filmed accidental deaths ","title":"2016 Malta Fairchild Merlin crash"},{"id":"52090528","text":"Yeltsin Ortega Jacques (born September 21, 1991) is a visually impaired Brazilian Paralympic runner named after the former Russian president Boris Yeltsin.

History  The fortress and the market town of Lichtenau (Matth√§us Merian: Topographia Franconiae, 1648) The fortress of Lichtenau goes back to a medieval water castle. In 1406 Nuremberg purchased the village and the castle of Lichtenau from Frederick II of Heideck. Because of the location of Lichtenau as a tactical outpost of the Imperial City of Nuremberg within the territory of the margraves of Brandenburg-Ansbach there was frequently tension and destruction as a result of warlike conflicts. During the First Margrave War in 1449 Albrecht Achilles invaded Lichtenau, devastated the land and captured the castle. The castle was not returned until 1453. In the course of the Second Margrave War, in 1553, it was totally destroyed by Albrecht Alcibiades even though it had been surrendered without a fight. The Imperial City of Nuremberg had a completely new castle built (by Wolf Jacob Stromerhttp://opus.kobv.de/ubp/volltexte/2009/2797/pdf/MGFN_7_2003_2_pro04.pdf, probably based on older plans by the architect, Antonio Falzon) for 194,000 guilders. Due to the level of destruction, the rebuild took until 1630 to complete. Barely a year later, the fortress was besieged by imperial troops and Georg Scheurl handed over the fortress, again without resisting, to the imperial commander, Tilly who, however, did not damage it. The last major attack on the fortress was in 1688, in a raid by troops of the French \\"sun king\\", Louis XIV. The French demanded that the pfleger, John Frederick Haller of Hallerstein surrender it. He, however, broke the tradition of handing it over without a fight and fought back, whereupon the French gave up storming the fortification. In 1806 Lichtenau fell, like Nuremberg and the rest of Franconia, to the Kingdom of Bavaria, whereupon the fortress was used as a gaol. In this period, Lichtenau was governed inter alia by Ludwig von Redwitz (1779‚Äì1848) as governor of the gaol; his son, later the well known poet, Oskar von Redwitz, was born here in 1823. Lichtenau Fortress is a splendid example of Renaissance architecture even though from a military perspective it did not represent the state of the art of fortifications at the time of its completion and was not easy to defend against siege artillery due to its location in a valley. After thorough renovation, the fortress is used today by the Free State of Bavaria as an satellite site for the Nuremberg State Archives. The inner courtyard and the wall platforms are open during the day for sightseeing. Once a year in July the local history society organizes the castle festival. During this festival, which also attracts young people from the wider region, the castle is open to the public on two days.

As the number of multicultural families increased in Korean society, the number of children in multicultural families also increased. New policies have been created to respond to the problems faced by children of multicultural families. Definition Policies designed to support multicultural families in South Korea are aimed at families with people who have acquired South Korean nationality. It can be defined as a family type where two cultures coexist in one family through international marriage, but also includes the families of foreign workers, North Korean refugee families, and ethnic Korean families moving to Korea. The first category, international marriage families, refers to a family consisting of a married Korean citizen and a foreign spouse. The second category, the families of foreign workers, includes those that foreign workers bring with them to Korea or new families formed by foreign workers in Korea. Most of those families include children. The third category, North Korean refugee families, is composed of residents from North Korea with the official registration. These people have left North Korean society with various motives. In some cases, refugees escape North Korea with their family members, but policies are also designed for those who start a new family in South Korea. The final category includes ethnic-Korean families who were born and raised in China or Russia with a unique Korean culture, and settled in South Korea for the purpose of immigration, employment while their ancestors left Korea with various background.ÍπÄÏòÅÏàô(Young-suk, Kim) ,Ïö∞Ï†ïÌïú(Jeong-han, Woo).

Immigrant worker bring their children over Korea or birth their children in Korea. Most of them have their own country's nationality, live in Korea as foreign. They cannot receive support based on Multicultural families supporting policy. It is a service for multicultural family to adapt to Korea and to support economical self-reliance. But the number of them has been increased and some of them acquired Korea nationality. Third, children of North Korean refugee family called 'saeteomin' as a defector.

Traditionally South Korea is regarded as a country with a single ethnicity so mixing races is not something that traditionally has been supported. However, there has been an increasing number of children of mixed race due to the number of marriages between women from other countries and Korean men. Research using data from stories of 56 youth between the ages of 9 and 17, has shown that children born of mixed race are not seen as ‚Äòpure‚Äô and not accepted as Koreans but they are classed an ‚Äòin-between Korean and foreigner.‚ÄôLee, C. S. (n.d.). Narratives of ‚Äòmixed race‚Äô youth in South Korea: racial order and in-betweenness. Asian Ethnicity, 18(4), 522‚Äì542. Skin color seems to play a large part in the discussion and there is a ‚Äòcolor-coding hierarchy‚Äô that has a lot to do with how Koreans view race and color. Koreans who have whiter skin are given a higher value than those with yellow skin and those with dark brown and black skin tones are placed lower in value. This is directly linked to the Korean War where some African-American soldiers abandoned babies born to Korean women who were prostitutes or came from poor backgrounds. The children ended up being called names such as ‚Äòdarky‚Äô or ‚Äòblacky‚Äô and have a hard time being accepted. There is also an, ‚Äòorigin-coding hierarchy‚Äô and the origin and economic position of the parent becomes a factor. Korean society discriminates against those mixed-race people who are from developing countries. Regardless of whether or not the children or the parents have lived in Korea all their lives and speak fluent Korean, their monoracial peers do not allow them to be fully integrated as ‚ÄòKorean.‚Äô Lee, C. S. (n.d.). Narratives of ‚Äòmixed race‚Äô youth in South Korea: racial order and in-betweenness. Asian Ethnicity, 18(4), 522‚Äì542. In Korea, one drop of ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô blood does not assign them to a particular race, as it does in America, it assigns them instead as ‚Äòforeigners‚Äô ‚Äì and this is always understood to mean not fully Korean.

In an article titled ‚ÄúThe Long Way Home‚Äù he describes what it felt like to have a Korean mother and an African- American father. He describes feeling like an outcast in both black and Asian-American communities even though not living in Korea. Mixed-race children in Korea say that classmates and even some teachers bully and harass them.

Biography  Born in Le Val-d'Ajol in the Vosges department, Lucien Duval was baptized in Plombi√®res. After a few years of primary school, he went to a Jesuit college in Brussels in 1920, already with the desire to become a priest. During this period he wrote a first chanson. In 1936 he joined the Jesuits and studied Catholic theology. On July 24, 1944, he received priest ordination in Enghien (Belgium). He was first employed as a French teacher in Reims until he was able to devote himself entirely to music. A few years after his ordination, Duval began to write songs and to present them first in pubs and cafes. Soon he was invited to give concerts. His tours took him all over Europe: he gave 3000 concerts in 45 countries.Le P√®re Aim√© Duval ‚Äì Chronologie, accessdate 25 October 2016 (in French). His concert in (West-) Berlin had 30,000 visitors.

In 1965 P√®re Duval was the first priest to sing \\"behind the Iron Curtain\\": he gave a free concert in Warsaw. He also performed in America. His first record was issued in 1956.Website of the French Jesuits In 1961 he had already sold more than one million records. Altogether he published 14 recordings. The stress of touring and composing led him to an alcohol disorder that quickly escalated. In February 1969 he made a suicide attempt, and then an alcohol detoxification in Versailles after his rescue. He fought for addiction to be recognized as a disease. In the same year he suffered a relapse. From then on, he regularly visited the meetings of the Alcoholics Anonymous. In order to help his fellow-sufferers, he dictated on a long drive a ruthless account of his addiction, which he published shortly before his death as a book: L‚Äôenfant qui jouait avec la lune -\\"The child who played with the Moon\\"- (). The book, which became a bestseller, was only signed under the author first name: Lucien; As subtitle was his self- description: Chanteur, J√©suite, Alcoolique. Aim√© Duval died on 30 April 1984 after a concert he gave in Metz and was buried in Nancy.  Musical work  He presented his chansons himself and accompanied them with his guitar (which is why he was called \\"Guitarist of God\\" in France).

Designed by Willie G. Davidson and Louie Netz, Harley-Davidson built a prototype Fat Boy in Milwaukee for the Daytona Bike Week rally at Daytona Beach in 1988 and 1989. Fat Boys produced from 1990-2017 are coded FLSTF, and FLFB (& FLFBS) from 2018. The name is said to come from the bike's \\"massive presence.‚Äù History and development The Fat Boy's frame is derived from the 1984 \\"Softail\\" which appears to have a rigid hardtail chassis but which in fact has a swinging arm with concealed springs that was originally designed in a Missouri garage in the 1970's by \\"a mechanical engineer\\" named Bill Davis and later Patented in 1976. Willie G the grandson of Harley-Davidson co-founder William A. Davidson originally turned down engineer Bill Davis' softail concept; but the company later relented, buying the rights and designing its own softail frame in-house. * After 1994, the exhaust was made seamless. * In 1996 the master cylinder and switch gear were revised. * In 1999 a new Twin Cam engine for the 2000 model year was used. This necessitated a bespoke engine variant and changes to the frame. *In 2002 bullet-style indicators, alarm and immobilizer were added. *In 2005 a 15th Anniversary version was sold, with a \\"Screamin' Eagle\\" engine, special paint and custom wheels. *In 2007 the displacement was increased to and the transmission changed six speeds. *The 2010 \\"Fat Boy Lo\\" FLSTFB had the lowest ever Harley seat height. *In 2012 the Fat Boy received the new Twin Cam engine along with the rest of the softail range* The 2018 Fat Boys have a redesigned softail frame with Showa front and rear suspension and new twin- counterbalanced Milwaukee-Eight engines. The two 2018 variants comprise: *The FLFB with , and *The FLFBS with The 2018 Softail frame has a modified swingarm with a Showa rear monoshock suspension mounted beneath the seat (replacing earlier twin shocks). So as to provide a more comfortable and better controlled ride with improved handling, the front forks contain a Showa \\"Dual Bending Valve\\" (SDBV),SDBV image a cartridge simulator using two valves to control compression and rebound damping, giving linear damping characteristics proportional to fork stroke speed. Harley-Davidson claims the 2018 chassis is stiffer and lighter than earlier Softail and Dyna platforms. Further upgrades include an LED headlight and 18-inch ‚ÄúLakester‚Äù rims, with wider 160mm front and 240mm rear rubber. For 2020, the Fat Boy is only available with the Milwaukee-Eight 114 engine. Harley-Davidson also produced a 30th Anniversary edition for 2020. It is one of Harley-Davidson's best selling models, and has appeared prominently in a number of TV shows and movies. The Fat Boy earned a place in American pop culture after appearances in the movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day. One of the motorcycles used in Terminator 2 is displayed at the Harley-Davidson Museum. It appeared again in Terminator Genisys.

Under the leadership of Chellaiah, the son of a landowner, the villagers organise a revolution. Chellaiah goes to Madras to seek help from his friend Sekhar. A series of complications follow which include the heroine being kidnapped and tortured, and Sekhar murdered. How Chellaiah and the villagers solve these problems forms the rest of the story.

Veerabahu were the producers, and Muktha Srinivasan was director. Nagesh, then a struggling actor, was noticed by Srinivasan during a play in Mylapore. Srinivasan, impressed with Nagesh's comic performance, hired him to act in another comic role in Thamarai Kulam, for a salary of 2500. The film thus became Nagesh's cinematic acting debut. S. M. Ramkumar and Kameswaran served as the dance choreographers. Shooting took place at the now non-existent Golden Studios. Soundtrack The music was composed by H. Padmanabha Sarma and T. A. Mothi. The playback singers were P. Susheela, Mothi, P. Leela, Sirkazhi Govindarajan, S. C. Krishnan, A. P. Komala and ‚ÄòNellore‚Äô Janaki. Reception Thamarai Kulam was released on 14 April 1959. The film, which was written with Leftist themes, was not well-received by viewers because, according to film historian Randor Guy, during that period, \\"Tamil cinema was then dominated by movies of Sivaji Ganesan with accent on high-flown, alliterative dialogue.\\" He did, however, state that it would be remembered for being \\"the debut film of ace comedian Nagesh and the early movie of the talented filmmaker Muktha Srinivasan.\\" Nagesh's performance was panned by the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan.

A retired research director of the CNRS in Paris, a specialist of the Khmer language and civilization, she carried out extensive work of Khmer epigraphy, started as a young researcher with her teacher George C≈ìd√®s. Her work in the field of etymology, specifically applied to old Khmer (from the 6th to the 14th) was seminal, but her varied skills enabled her to tackle areas such as the very rich processes of derivation in Khmer, religion, codes of conduct ( CPAP '), zoology and botany, cooking, etc. This encyclopedic spirit is particularly evident in her Dictionnaire vieux khmer-fran√ßais-anglais.  Biography  Born 24 August 1929 in Phnom Penh, Saveros Pou came to France for her graduate studies, carried out under the guidance of teachers such as Fran√ßois Martini, Au Chhieng, Jean Filliozat, Louis Renou and George C≈ìd√®s, which enabled her to acquire very varied theoretical language skills and practices.Notice biographique du Choix d'articles de khm√©rologie de 2003, pp. vii-xi In 1965 she presented a postgraduate doctorate on Khmer toponymy, of which large extracts were included in 1967 in the Bulletin de l'√âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient. In 1978, she supported her State doctorate devoted to RƒÅmakerti, the Khmer version of the Ramayana. She is the author of more than 150 books and articles, published in several orientalist journals such as the Journal Asiatique and the Bulletin de l'√âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient. She developed the transliteration system for the Khmer language used by George Coed√®s, which permits to see very easily borrowings from Sanskrit and Pali, and is complemented by some specific letters in Khmer (vowels ·üÇ ae, ·ûæ oe, ·üÄ ƒ´e, ·ûø ƒ´oe, among others). Thus, the modern word ·ûë·ûì·üí·ûè·ûñ·üÅ·ûë·üí·ûô for \\"dentist\\", pronounced toan'p√®t', but transliterated dantabedy, is a complex formation from the Sanskrit words danta : \\"tooth\\" and vaidya : \\"physician\\" (verbal root VID \\"to know\\"; in Sanskrit, b and v are often used interchangeably and the vowel e like ai derives from i. This transliteration system is used inter alia at the INALCO. She died in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges southeast of Paris on 25 June 2020, 81 days short of her 91st birthday.

The adult leaves are arranged alternately, linear to narrow lance-shaped, long, wide with a petiole long, and the same green or yellow-green, glossy appearance on both sides. The flowers are borne in groups of between seven and thirteen in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oblong to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical to horn-shaped operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from June to August and the flowers are white. The fruit that follows is a woody, hemispherical to a shortened sphere long and in diameter. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus bakeri was first formally described in 1913 by Joseph Maiden from a specimen collected near Wallangarra in 1911 by Edward Swain. Maiden noted that the species is locally referred to as \\"Mallee Box\\". The specific epithet (bakeri) honours Richard Thomas Baker \\"who has done valuable work in connection with this genus\\". Distribution and habitat Baker's mallee occurs near Yetman and Warialda in New South Wales and near Roma, Talwood and Dalby in Queensland with an outlier in the White Mountains National Park.

The Speaker, Edward Phelips The 1st Parliament of King James I was summoned by King James I on 31 January 1604 and assembled on 19 March following. It was known as the Blessed Parliament and took place in five sessions, interrupted by Holy Days and the Gunpowder Plot. The speaker was Edward Phelips, the Member of Parliament for Somerset. King James' objective from the first session of his first Parliament after taking the English throne in addition to that of Scotland was to bring about a statutory union of the two countries. As he said, he did not wish to be \\"a husband to two wives\\". However the House of Commons rejected the proposal on the grounds that it would affect English Common Law, and when James sought legal help, he found the judges agreed with Parliament. He was also denied funds as the subsidy was still being collected. Parliament re-assembled for the second session on 5 November 1605, which was postponed until 6 January 1606 because of the Gunpowder Plot. A bill to outlaw purveyance, whereby the Royal Household could obtain goods by right at reduced prices, was thwarted by the House of Lords. However legislation was successively enacted to prohibit Englishmen from serving in the Spanish armed forces, then at war with the Dutch. The Spanish Company, a trading company which claimed a monopoly on trade with Spain, was also suppressed. In reaction to the Gunpowder Plot, King James was granted subsidies then worth ¬£400,000. The third session (November 1606 to July 1607) returned to the issue of union between England and Scotland, but only agreed to abolish some medieval laws dealing with Anglo-Scottish hostilities. The fourth session, delayed by plague and King James' reluctance, met on 9 February 1610. Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, the Lord Treasurer, informed the House that the King needed ¬£600,000 to clear his debts and modernise the Navy. In addition, he proposed a new annual subsidy for the Royal Household of ¬£200,000, in return for which the King would give up his right of purveyance and other historic privileges. After some negotiation a deal was agreed and members left for the summer to consult their constituents on the issue. The fifth and final session met on 16 October 1610. Support for the \\"Great Contract\\" negotiated in the previous session to guarantee the King's finances ran into difficulties over specific taxes the King was imposing on trade and the Commons withdrew from the deal. The King's patience had by now run out and he dissolved Parliament at the end of the year. The Parliament was officially dissolved on 9 February 1611.

He was born in Vidin, Tsardom of Vidin c. 1330 and died in the Ravanica Monastery, Serbia c. 1385. Romylos was among the brightest followers of the Hesychast tradition in the Eastern Orthodox Church in the 14th century. In the wake of the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria Romylos was among the many Bulgarian intellectuals who emigrated to neighbouring Orthodox countries and brought their talents and texts. His tomb is in the church narthex of the Monastery of Ravanica, Serbian Despotate.  Life  A view of Strandzha where Romylos spent much of his youth developing as a Hesychast He was born in the first quarter of the fourteenth century in the \\"valiant and glorious city Vidin\\", northwestern Bulgaria, and given the Bulgarian name of Rusko or Rayko. He was born in a wealthy family to a Bulgarian mother and Greek father. He studied in a school and made impression with his talents. When he reached the age of 14-15 he left Vidin and headed for the capital Tarnovo to avoid his parents' plans to marry him. There he became a monk in one of the many monasteries around the capital and took the monastic name Romanos, later changed to Romylos. The young monk became a follower of Hesychasm (from Greek \\"stillness, rest, quiet, silence\\") ‚Äì an eremitic tradition of prayer in the Eastern Orthodox Church that flourished in the Balkans during the 14th century and was patronized by the Bulgarian emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì1371). In 1335, Ivan Alexander gave refuge to the renown Hesychast Gregory of Sinai and provided funds for the construction of a monastery near Paroria in the Strandzha mountains in the south-east of the country which it attracted clerics from Bulgaria, Byzantium, and Serbia. Romylos moved to Paroria and became one of Gregory's disciples. There he was one of the most eminent and fervent supporters of the Hesychast theological doctrine, as it was developed in the middle of the 14th century. His stay at Paroria was in difficult times. He had to flee three times to seek safety in the vicinity of Tarnovo near Kilifarevo due to famine and Ottoman brigands. The persistent Ottoman raids at Paroria eventually compelled Romylos to escape to Mount Athos in the early 1350s. On Mount Athos he lived an ascetic life in isolation near the Great Lavra. Following the Christian defeat at the hands of the Ottoman Turks in the Battle of Maritsa in 1371 Romylos fled to Valona on the Adriatic Sea in modern-day Albania. He could not find peace in Valona because the governors of the region were unjust and the priests were unworthy and eventually moved to the Serbian Despotate. There he settled in the Ravanica Monastery in the Kuƒçaj mountains founded in 1377 and completed in 1381 by Prince Lazar of Serbia. The monastery was founded as a refuge for Hesychast monks. Romylos remained in Ravanica until his death a few years later, s. 1385. He died at Ravanica monastery on 16 January. His remains are kept in the monastery and are venerated by both Orthodox and Catholics. His feast day is 16 January according to the Slavonic version of his vita; the Greek version has 1 November. Vita and cult The relics of St. Romylos are kept in the Ravanica Monastery The Vita of Romylos was written before 1391 by one of his disciples from Mount Athos called Gregory. Both the Greek and the Slavonic version of his Vita refer to the period he spent on Athos interlacing popular hagiographical clich√©s with patristic sermons on the eternal value of the monastic virtues, yielding no essential data about his participation in the cultural and philological life of the monastic peninsula. The commonly accepted opinion on the chronological sequence of the Slavic and Greek variant of his Life has been established only in the last two decades of the twentieth century. P. A. Syrku (1855-1905), the scholar who first discovered and published the Slavic text in 1900, based on a Serbian manuscript belonging to the Alexander Hilferding collection, was inclined to accept that it was not a translation but an original text composed directly in Slavic. St. Romylos was definitely a specific, but neither very popular nor widely venerated saint. According to K. Ivanova, his cult is well attested only on Athos and in the region adjacent to the Monastery of Ravanica in Serbia, where he passed away.

He was active at Uppsala University where he studied under the supervision of Filip Hjulstr√∂m eventually succeeding him on the chair of physical geography. Besides his studies of rivers Sundborg made contributions on the climate of cities, the distribution of loess and the sedimentation of reservoirs and lakes. He studied rivers in Sweden as well as various large rivers in Africa and Asia. Academic career Sundborg's filosofie licentiat thesis had as subject the city climate of Uppsala. The thesis came to be internationally recognized with climatologist Helmut Landsberg praising it for containing one of the first theories on the climate of cities. √Öke Sundborg was drawn to the charismatic Filip Hjulstr√∂m who influenced him to shift his field of study and pursue Ph.D. studies on fluvial geomorphology under his tutelage. Sundborg's 1956 Ph.D. thesis explored the link between geomorphology and hydrology in the meanders of the lower course of Klar√§lven in his native V√§rmland. The thesis came to be considered a reference work for similar studies. By 1956 √Öke Sundborg had greatly improved the Hjulstr√∂m curve diagram adding lines and a higher level of detail.Hjulstr√∂m's Diagram. Idaho State University. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011. Subsequently, he was employed by the Uppsala University where he directed the construction of the geomorphological laboratory. Over time this laboratory attracted numerous visiting scholars and Ph.D. students. Together with the other Ph.D. students of Hjulstr√∂m, Anders Rapp, Valter Axelsson and John O. Norrman, Sundborg was part of what came to be known as the Uppsala School of Physical Geography.Gregory, KJ, 1985: \\"The Nature of Physical Geography\\", E. Arnold Beginning in the 1960s Sundborg begun a series of river studies outside Sweden, both as researcher and as foreign advisor. As such he studied the Mississippi, Rufiji, the Nile, Ganges, Brahmaputra, the Red River and the Yellow River. In the 1960s Sundborg studied the consequences of the damming of the Euphrates prior to the building of the Tabqa Dam in Syria. Sundborg estimated the amounts of sediments that would enter the new lake (that in the 1970s originated Lake Assad) and made a mathematical modell on how a new river delta would develop in it. Later upstream dam-building in Turkey however diminished greatly the sediments carried into Lake Assad.L√§ngs floder v√§rlden runt - m√§nniskor och milj√∂er (2003). Sundborg succeeded Hjulstr√∂m as professor of physical geography at Uppsala University in 1969 and held that position until 1986. He was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1973.

History  The company was founded in 2009 by Denis Frolov, the former development director at Wimm-Bill-Dann group, who decided to start his own business after he learned that the group was planned to be sold to PepsiCo in 2010. Before Frolov had been buying LED lamps for the production, and he assumed that the demand for them will grow. The parliamentary debate of the law On Energy Saving (adopted a year later, in November 2009) also contributed to his choice of business niche. Start-up capital amounted to 40 million rubles of his own and borrowed funds. The company started with sales of Chinese compact fluorescent lamps under its own brand Gauss. Ilya Sivtsev, who previously helped Frolov find suppliers and distribute Gauss products, soon became his business partner, co-owner and executive director of Varton. The decision made in 2010 to reorient to LED lighting, led to making enough profit by the fall of 2012 to purchase an abandoned factory in the town Bogoroditsk of Tula region and to invest 250 million in the launching of the production and enter the corporate market with a new trade mark Varton. By 2016, total investment in the factory reached 1 billion rubles.  Business model  The structure of Varton includes laboratory and scientific-production center of 20 thousand square meters in Bogoroditsk, the central office in Moscow and overseas in Hong Kong and Italy. The company employs 500 people, half of them work at the production site, where students of the Bogoroditsk polytechnic college take part in work experience programs. 20 full-time employees work in the company‚Äôs design center developing new lamps. Factory in Bogoroditsk produces lamps and lenses, imports sockets, lamps radiators, electronic drivers and LED elements, organizes the final assembly. Production is sold through a dealer network, available in Russia, CIS countries, some countries in Europe and Africa. Since April 2015 the company is included in the list of organizations that have a significant impact on industry and trade of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation. In 2015, the company sold about 1.4 million lamps, factory revenue amounted to 1.3 billion rubles, the turnover of the company amounted to 3.25 billion rubles. In autumn of 2015 it was estimated by the general director of Development Corporation of the Tula region, that Varton company controls 18% of Russia's LED lighting market. In August 2016 in an interview with Director General the CEO at Varton reported that the company stopped using the principle of the conveyor assembly in favor of the entire product assembled by one person, which increased productivity and helped to expand the range without increasing the staff number. Responding to questions from the newspaper RBC in 2015, the COO told about the company‚Äôs plans to localize LED production in Russia and use component made in Russia only by 2017.  Projects  The company has developed and supplied lighting for the federal highway M11 (Moscow‚ÄìSaint Petersburg motorway), the design of which takes into account the great distance between lampposts, and lights of the GUM fa√ßade, that emit light of a certain tone, are strictly protected from moisture, frost up to -60 ¬∞C and heat up to + 60 ¬∞C. According to the First Deputy Governor of the Rostov region, the company's lamps are used for indoor lighting of the stadium Rostov Arena. Emergency lighting equipment produced by Varton is used in the IKEA store in the Moscow suburb of Khimki, Burger King restaurants, the Moscow City Clinical Hospital ‚Ññ72, trade and industrial zone Altufyevo in Moscow region. As part of an experiment made together with one of the residents of innovative territorial cluster Zelenograd, the company has installed a vending machine for the sale of LED bulbs in the territory of the cluster.  Awards  In 2013 the company has won in two nominations of the III annual award in the field of energy saving Save energy! ‚Äì in the category of household and industrial lighting, and in the category of an innovative energy-saving technology and energy efficiency. Packaging design of Gauss lamps was awarded first place in the category \\"Packaging and Label\\" at the national advertising festival Idea! in 2009, a silver award in 2009 and the bronze medal in 2013 at the international packaging design competition Pentawards.

Yeung, the party's chairman, also hosted an online programme critical of other localists, especially Yeung's former mentor Wong Yuk-man, for their militant and populist tendencies.

The franchise began in 2001 with the success of The Blue Planet. As of 2017, The Blue Planet has spawned 5 series and one feature film. Development In 2001 the BBC broadcast The Blue Planet, a landmark series on the natural history of the world's oceans. It received critical acclaim, high viewing figures, audience appreciation ratings, and many awards. It also became a hugely profitable global brand, eventually being sold to 150 countries worldwide. Feedback showed that audiences particularly liked the epic scale, the scenes of new and unusual species and the cinematic quality of the series. Programme commissioners were keen for a follow-up, so Alastair Fothergill decided that the Natural History Unit should repeat the formula with a series looking at the whole planet. The idea for Planet Earth was born, and the series was commissioned by Lorraine Heggessey, then Controller of BBC One, in January 2002. A feature film version of Planet Earth was commissioned alongside the television series, repeating the successful model established with The Blue Planet and its companion film, Deep Blue. Earth was released around the world from 2007 to 2009. There was also another accompanying television series, Planet Earth: The Future, which looked at the environmental problems facing some of the species and habitats featured in the main series in more detail. Television series=Planet Earth (2006) Planet Earth is a 2006 British television series produced by the BBC Natural History Unit. Five years in the making, it was the most expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC and also the first to be filmed in high definition. Planet Earth premiered on 5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom on BBC One, and by June 2007 had been shown in 130 countries. The series has eleven episodes, each of which features a global overview of a different biome or habitat on Earth. At the end of each fifty-minute episode, a ten-minute featurette takes a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of filming the series. Planet Earth: The Future (2006) Planet Earth: The Future is a 2006 BBC documentary series on the environment and conservation, produced by the BBC Natural History Unit as a companion to the multi-award-winning nature documentary Planet Earth. The programmes were originally broadcast on BBC Four immediately after the final three episodes of Planet Earth on BBC One. Each episode highlights the conservation issues surrounding some of the species and environments featured in Planet Earth, using interviews with the film-makers and eminent figures from the fields of science, conservation, politics, and theology. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was Fergus Beeley. Saving Planet Earth (2007) Saving Planet Earth is a season of nature documentaries with a conservation theme, screened on BBC Television in 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of its specialist factual department, the BBC Natural History Unit. The series featured films contributed by a number of celebrities on the plight of various endangered species, and coincided with the launch of the BBC Wildlife Fund, a charitable organisation which distributes money to conservation projects around the world. The television series culminated in a live fundraising telethon on BBC Two, hosted by Alan Titchmarsh, which raised over ¬£1 million for the charity. The BBC broadcast a second live telethon in 2010. Wild Night In was presented by Kate Humble, Chris Packham and Martin Hughes-Games and featured conservation projects which had benefited from the support of the BBC Wildlife Fund. This helped to raise a further ¬£1 million. Planet Earth Live (2012) Planet Earth Live is a live action nature documentary screened on British television. Produced by the BBC Natural History Unit and broadcast in May 2012, the programme was presented by Richard Hammond and Julia Bradbury. Planet Earth Live featured real-time footage of young animals from five continents throughout the month of May. Broadcast three times per week, teams of nature experts and documentary makers monitored the activity of animals in their area, reporting back on the day‚Äôs events. Animals featured included meerkats in the Kalahari Desert, American black bears in Minnesota, lions and African bush elephants in East Africa, toque macaques in Sri Lanka, gray whales off the coast of California, polar bears in Svalbard and giant otters in Peru. The programme was shown in May 2012 on BBC One in the United Kingdom and was broadcast in 140 countries in total, making it the most ambitious global wildlife series the BBC had ever undertaken. In the US it was retitled 24/7 Wild and aired on NatGeo Wild; in South Africa, Asia, Australia, Italy, Nordic countries, New Zealand and Poland it was shown on BBC Knowledge; and in India on BBC Entertainment. Planet Earth II (2016) Planet Earth II is a natural history documentary series, produced by the BBC as a sequel to the highly successful Planet Earth television series, which aired roughly a decade earlier, in 2006. The series was presented and narrated by Sir David Attenborough with the score composed by Hans Zimmer. The first trailer was released on 9 October 2016, and the series was broadcast in November 2016 (United Kingdom) on BBC One and BBC One HD. Planet Earth II is also the first television series that the BBC have produced in Ultra-high-definition (4K). Feature film=Earth (2007) Alongside the commissioning of the television series, BBC Worldwide and GreenLight Media secured financing for a US$15 million film version of Planet Earth. This followed the earlier success of Deep Blue, the BBC's 2003 theatrical nature documentary which used re- edited footage from The Blue Planet. The film was co-directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield and produced by Alix Tidmarsh and Sophokles Tasioulis. Only 30% of the footage shown in Earth is new, with the remainder being reworked from the television series to suit the narrative of the film. David Attenborough was replaced as narrator by high-profile actors: Patrick Stewart for the UK market and James Earl Jones for the United States. Earth had its worldwide premiere in September 2007 at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival in San Sebasti√°n, Spain, in Basque Country. Lionsgate released the film in several international markets over the following year. In the United States, it became the first film to be released by Disneynature, the Walt Disney Company's new nature documentary arm. When released on Earth Day 2009 it set the record for the highest opening weekend gross for a nature documentary, and went on to become the third highest grossing documentary of all time. It has grossed more than $108 million worldwide; in the nature documentary genre, only March of the Penguins has achieved greater box-office success. Planet Earth Live (2010) This 90-minute film presents highlights from 2006 television series. Its premier was celebrated in the U.S. with a tour featuring narration and live orchestral accompaniment.  Television specials=The Making of 'Planet Earth' (2012) BBC America produced a two-hour making-of documentary narrated by Dan Stevens. It includes interviews with some producers and cameramen of the 2006 series.

After holding leadership positions in the youth wing and women's section of the Mauritanian People's Party, she served in the cabinet of President Moktar Ould Daddah from 1975 to 1978. Her time as a minister ended when Daddah's government was overthrown by a military coup. Early life Kane was born into a Toucouleur (Halpulaar) family in Dar El Barka, a small town in Brakna Region. Her father, Mame N'diack, was a long-serving district chief. Educational opportunities in Mauritania were limited during Kane's childhood, especially for women. Despite several of her relatives objecting to Western education, she was sent to a French-language school in Saint-Louis, Senegal. She is believed to have been one of the first Mauritanian girls to attend a Western school. In 1959 and 1960, Kane attended the Free University of Belgium on a scholarship. She was unable to complete her degree due to family issues, and after returning to Mauritania settled in the capital Nouakchott. Politics In 1957, the final year of her secondary education, Kane formed a group for the promotion of girls' education, called the Comit√© pour la fr√©quentation scolaire f√©minine (\\"Committee for Female School Attendance\\"). Her efforts received criticism from both Mauritanian and Senegalese sources, but she defended the group on the grounds that women's education was justified by Islamic law. In 1961, Kane helped to found the Union Nationale des Femmes de Mauritanie (UNFM; \\"National Union of the Women of Mauritania\\"), Mauritania's first national women's organisation. She represented the UNFM at a 1962 meeting of the Conference des Femmes Africaines (CFA; \\"Conference of African Women\\"), a Pan-African women's group, and subsequently went to work for that organisation in Algeria, living in Algiers for several years. She was also involved with the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF), attending its 1968 conference in Helsinki, Finland.Akyeampong and Gates, p. 287. One of the co-founders of the UNFM was Mariem Daddah, the wife of President Moktar Ould Daddah. The UNFM was eventually integrated into the Mauritanian People's Party (PPM; the country's sole legal political party at the time), and became known as the Mouvement National F√©minin (MNF; \\"National Women's Movement\\"). Kane became a high-ranking MNF official, and was responsible for the publication of its magazine, Marienou. She was also elected to the executive council of the PPM's youth wing in 1966. Having gained a reputation as a \\"powerful public speaker and a gifted organiser\\", Kane was added to Daddah's cabinet in August 1975, becoming Minister for the Protection of the Family and Social Affairs. She was Mauritania's first female cabinet minister. However, Daddah's government was overthrown by a military coup in July 1978, and Kane was excluded from the new ministry. Another woman was not appointed to cabinet until 1987, under President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya. Women's rights Kane had developed a national reputation as an advocate for women's rights even before becoming a government minister. She led efforts to improve women's health and education in Mauritania, and when the country adopted a new legal code successfully lobbied the government to include a provision for marital rights. She also successfully lobbied for the introduction of a quota for female representation in the Mauritanian Parliament, which initially stood at 10 percent and has since been raised. During her time in cabinet, Kane introduced a program that aimed to reduce the rate polygamous marriage, but was unable to significant lower it. On the subject of female genital mutilation, which occurs at high rates in Mauritania, she called for \\"all those involved in carrying out the procedure\\" to face penalties, and for the government to work towards its total eradication.\\"MAURITANIA: Low HIV Prevalence, Widespread AIDS Stigma\\", IPS News, 26 February 2005. Retrieved 25 October 2016. Kane received support from high-ranking government officials during her career, including President Daddah, but some of her more radical reforms met opposition from religious conservatives. Death She died on 10 August 2019, eight days before her 81st birthday.

He served as the first acting Jathedar of Akal Takht from 19 December 1937 to 1948 and 19th Jathedar of Akal Takht from 1952 to 15 February 1955.  Early life and career  Partap Singh was born on 3 January 1904, at Nara village in Rawalpindi division of Panjab, British India. His father was Makhan Singh and mother Mathura Devi. His grandfather, Sundar Singh served in the army of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Between 1909 and 1918, Singh completed 5 years of education at the local primary school in Nara and further education at the middle school in Bishan Daur. Near the completion of his primary education, he took the vows of the Khalsa and became an initiated Sikh. Subsequently, for some 3 years he studied Sikh literature and attended the services of Singh Sabha Movement and Isher Singh Rara Sahib. In 1922, Singh enrolled into Khalsa Updesh College at Gujranwala, where he passed the certificate of Giani with the second highest marks in Panjab. From 1918 to 1921, he attended various conferences organised by Chief Khalsa Diwan, Na-Milvartan Lehir and Sikh League. These conferences had a great impact on his mind and conscience. In 1923, Singh contributed with immense participation in the Kar Seva (literally \\"service with hands\\") of Harmandir Sahib. Considering the service and education of the Giani, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) employed him as a priest.

Protodeboronation is a well-known undesired side reaction, and frequently associated with metal-catalysed coupling reactions that utilise boronic acids (see Suzuki reaction).Boronic Acids: Preparation and Applications in Organic Synthesis, Medicine and Materials, 2nd ed.; Hall, D., Ed; Wiley VCH: Weinheim, Germany, 2011; Vols. 1 and 2, pp 1-133. For a given boronic acid, the propensity to undergo protodeboronation is highly variable and dependent on various factors, such as the reaction conditions employed and the organic substituent of the boronic acid. The deliberate protodeboronation of boronic acids (and derivatives) have been applied to some synthetic procedures, such as the installation of a stereospecific proton at chiral centers,Roesner, S.; Blair, D. J.; Aggarwal, V. K. \\"Enantioselective installation of adjacent tertiary benzylic stereocentres using lithiation‚Äìborylation‚Äìprotodeboronation methodology. Application to the synthesis of bifluranol and fluorohexestrol\\". Chem.

A., \\"Selective protodeboronation: synthesis of 4-methyl-2-thiopheneboronic anhydride and demonstration of its utility in Suzuki-Miyaura reactions\\". Tetrahedron Lett. 2007, 48, 8242. Recent mechanistic studies have revealed a variety of protodeboronation pathways in aqueous media, and have demonstrated the reaction pH (and subsequently the boronic acid speciation) to be an important factor in understanding the modes of protodeboronation.Cox, P.

A general reaction scheme for the protodeboronation of boronic acids History One of the earliest reports of protodeboronation was made by Ainley and Challenger, who were the first researchers to explore the reactivity of boronic acids with common chemical reagents.Ainley, A. D.; Challenger, F. \\"Studies of the boron-carbon linkage\\" J. Chem. Soc. 1930, 2171. They reported the reaction of phenylboronic acid in water (140-150 ¬∞C) to afford the protodeboronated product, benzene, after 40 hours. Initial synthetic applications of protodeboronation were found alongside the discovery of the hydroboration reaction, in which sequential hydroboration- protodeboronation reactions were used to convert alkynes or alkenes into the corresponding saturated compounds.Brown, H. C.; Zweifel, G. \\"Hydroboration. XI. The Hydroboration of Acetylenes‚ÄîA Convenient Conversion of Internal Acetylenes into cis-Olefins and of Terminal Acetylenes into Aldehydes\\" J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961, 83 (18), 3834. Beyond this synthetic application, protodeboronation was rarely noted or valued in other chemical processes throughout the early 20th century. However, in more recent years, protodeboronation has emerged as a problematic side reaction with many chemical processes that utilise boronic acids. In particular, boronic acids have become increasingly important reagents for the facile construction of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds via metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. This has resulted in an increased usage of boronic acids, and subsequently followed by an increased number of reports concerning problematic protodeboronation. Many boronic acids are now commercially available and many novel boronic acids and derivatives are constantly in pursuit. Many efforts have been put towards mitigating undesired protodeboronation in cross-coupling reactions. Catalyst design and optimisation has led the way for very efficient systems that can undergo rapid catalytic turnover.Billingsley, K. L.; Anderson, K. W.; Buchwald, S. L. \\"A Highly Active Catalyst for Suzuki‚ÄìMiyaura Cross-Coupling Reactions of Heteroaryl Compounds\\". Angew. Chemie Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 3484. This increases the rate of productive reaction and thus subdues unwanted decomposition pathways such as protodeboronation. Cross- coupling reactions have also been accelerated with metal additives such as silverChen, J.; Cammers-Goodwin, A. \\"2-(Fluorophenyl)pyridines by the Suzuki- Miyaura method: Ag2O accelerates coupling over undesired ipso substitution (SNAr) of fluorine\\" Tetrahedron Lett. 2003, 44, 1503.Nishihara, Y.; Onodera, H.; Osakada, K. \\"Synthesis and structural characterization of the first unsymmetrical from transmetallation between 2,4,6-trifluorophenylboronic acid and trans-Pd(C6F5)I(PEt3)2\\" Chem.

MIDA boronate esters and organotrifluoroborates have both been utilised in \\"slow release\\" strategies, in which the reaction conditions are optimised to provide a slow release of boronic acid. This protocol has proved useful in the cross-coupling of some notoriously unstable boronic acids, such as the 2-pyridine boronic acid.Knapp, D. M.; Gillis, E. P.; Burke, M. D. \\"A general solution for unstable boronic acids: slow-release cross- coupling from air-stable MIDA boronates.\\". J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 6961.Molander, G. A.; Ellis, N. \\"Organotrifluoroborates: Protected Boronic Acids That Expand the Versatility of the Suzuki Coupling Reaction\\". Acc. Chem. Res. 2007, 40, 275. This ensures that the boronic acid concentration is low during the cross-coupling reaction, which in turn minimises the potential for side reactions. Reaction mechanism=Simple non-basic boronic acids The mechanism of protodeboronation was initially investigated by Kuivila in the 1960s, long before the discovery of the Suzuki reaction and the popularisation of boronic acids. Their studies focused on the protodeboronation of some substituted aromatic boronic acids in aqueous conditions, and they reported the presence of two distinct mechanisms; a general acid-catalysed and a specific base-catalysed mechanism.Kuivila, H. G.; Reuwer, J. F.; Mangravite, J. A. \\"Electrophilic Displacement Reactions. X. General Acid Catalysis in the Protodeboronation of Areneboronic Acids\\". Can. J. Chem. 1963, 41, 3081. Kuivila, H. G.; Nahabedian, K. V. \\"Electrophilic displacement reactions. XV. Kinetics and Mechanism of the Base-catalyzed Protodeboronation of Areneboronic Acids\\". J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961, 83, 2159. The acid-catalysed process is dependent on a reaction between boronic acid and an acid, such as sulfuric acid. On the other hand, the base-catalysed process arises from a pre-equilibrium between boronic acid and hydroxide to form the corresponding boronate, this is usually followed by a rate-limiting reaction between boronate and water (acting as the proton source). Substrates that display only these two modes of protodeboronation (typically simple aromatic and alkyl boronic acids) are generally very stable in neutral pH solution, where both acid- and base-catalysed processes are minimised. For aromatic boronic acids bearing electron-withdrawing substituents, there is a competing dissociative mechanism involving generation of a transient aryl anion. These substrates are stabilized by acidic conditions. Acid and base catalyzed protodeboronation Basic heteroaromatic boronic acids Basic heteroaromatic boronic acids (boronic acids that contain a basic nitrogen atom, such as 2-pyridine boronic acid) display additional protodeboronation mechanisms. A key finding shows the speciation of basic heteroaromatic boronic acids to be analogous to that of simple amino acids, with zwitterionic species forming under neutral pH conditions. For the 2-pyridine boronic acid, the zwitterionic compound is responsible for its rapid protodeboronation under neutral pH, through a unimolecular fragmentation of the C-B bond. In fact, the addition of acid (H+) or hydroxide (OH-) acts to attenuate protodeboronation by shifting the speciation away from the reactive zwitterion. It is important to note that not all basic heteroaromatic boronic acids are reactive through a zwitterionic intermediate.

He was previously a Wellington City Councillor and Deputy Mayor, and was the first person of MƒÅori descent to enter the office of Deputy Mayor of Wellington. Early life and career Eagle's birth mother put him up for adoption and he was adopted by a Methodist minister and his wife who was a hospital worker. He has kept contact with his birth mother who told Eagle she couldn't keep him due to the lack of a domestic purposes benefit. When Eagle was five, his adoptive father ran for the Mt Eden Borough Council as a candidate for the Labour Party, a race in which he was ultimately unsuccessful. When he was aged 12 the family relocated to Wellington and became socially and politically active and agitated against the 1981 Springbok tour. Eagle was educated first at Wellington High School and then at St. Patrick's College in Wellington, where he showed an aptitude for art, leading him to study the subject at Elam Fine Arts school and Auckland University. He later found employment in the desktop publishing design profession. Before entering local government politics Eagle held several jobs working for the New Zealand Police, Sport New Zealand and the Ministry of Economic Development. Political career Eagle, a member of the Labour Party, was first elected to Wellington City Council in 2010, replacing long-time Green Party councillor Celia Wade-Brown who was subsequently elevated to the Mayoralty. Eagle was re- elected in 2013 and in 2016 with increased majorities. He was frequently referenced as one of the city's most popular and best-performing councillors. Eagle resigned his seat on the council after his election to parliament, necessitating a by-election in the Southern Ward. The by-election was won by Fleur Fitzsimons of the Labour Party, who received Eagle's endorsement. Member of Parliament Upon the announcement that Annette King intended to stand in the 2017 general election as a List MP only, Eagle stated that he had encouragement from local constituents to stand for King's Rongotai seat. However he had not yet decided whether or not to contest the Labour nomination for the electorate. On 20 January 2017, days after Labour leader Andrew Little (who also lives in Island Bay) announced he was not intending to stand in the seat, Eagle confirmed he would allow his name to go forward as a nominee for Labour in Rongotai. He also announced that he had the full backing of Wellington Mayor Justin Lester, and if he was successful in entering Parliament he would step down from the position of Deputy Mayor. On 3 February 2017 Eagle was confirmed as the sole applicant for the Rongotai candidacy and nominated unopposed. Eagle was also ranked 34 on Labour's party list for the election. He won the seat with a 10,900 majority. Personal life Eagle lives in Wellington with his wife, who is an environmental scientist, and their adopted son.

He served three terms on the Philadelphia City Council and as chairman of the Philadelphia Gas Works. Early life Moore was born in Illinois in 1897. After moving to Philadelphia as a child, he attended West Philadelphia High School, where he excelled in baseball and football. While attending the University of Pennsylvania, he also took up rowing, which became a lifelong pursuit. Through rowing, Moore became associated with John B. Kelly Sr., the Olympic medallist and Democratic politico. In 1935, he was elected president of the Schuylkill Navy's Malta Boat Club. He also became successful in the tool and equipment business. Philadelphia politics Through his connections with Kelly, Moore became involved in local politics, being appointed executive secretary of the Democratic City Committee in 1940. The following year, Governor Arthur H. James appointed Moore as a Democratic member of Philadelphia's new bipartisan Registration Commission. Later that year, Moore was the subject of a write-in campaign for mayor, which city officials declared invalid. After World War II began, he became involved in the Civil Defense Corps. In 1943, there was a grand jury investigation of the Registration Commission, which Moore called a \\"fishing expedition.\\" No charges were brought, and in 1945 Governor Edward Martin reappointed the entire board, including Moore. He was among the group of investors that bought the Philadelphia Eagles in 1949. In 1951, Michael DiSalle appointed Moore to a temporary post with the Korean War-era Office of Price Stabilization, a federal agency devoted to price controls. City Council Later that year, after Philadelphia adopted a new city charter, Moore ran for an at-large seat on the reformed city council. He was elected, part of a wave election that swept the Republicans from power for the first time in 67 years. Moore won the highest vote total of any of the seven at- large candidates elected. In Council, he chaired the Transportation and Public Utilities Committee. In 1952, just a year after the city charter's adoption, Moore called for revisions to it that would take certain powers from appointed officials and return them to City Council. That same year, he advocated tearing down Philadelphia's City Hall and replacing it with a modern office building (the proposal was not adopted). Moore resisted calls from Democratic Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr. to increase the city budget and raise taxes, proposing a budget smaller by $19 million. Clark's budget eventually passed Council without Moore's vote. Moore continued to oppose Clark and the charter, joining the efforts James Hugh Joseph Tate and Michael J. Towey to weaken the charter's civil service reforms (they were unsuccessful). He was re-elected in 1955, again leading all candidates for at-large seats. In the next council session, Moore became chairman of the Finance Committee. On the Finance Committee, Moore developed a reputation as the city's \\"financial watchdog\\" as he scrutinized spending requests from the new mayor, Richardson Dilworth. He served as Council's representative on the Philadelphia Transportation Company's board of directors, and fought for the construction of the Delaware Expressway. In addition to fighting tax increases, Moore and Tate worked to keep utilities costs from increasing excessively. In 1958, Moore considered a run for Lieutenant Governor, but changed his mind when Clark, now a United States Senator, blocked the Democratic Party establishment from endorsing him. Instead, he ran for a third term on City Council in 1959, and garnered the second-most votes of any at-large candidate. Gas Works and grand jury In 1960, Moore investigated waste within the Philadelphia Gas Works. At the same time, he found himself (and fellow Councilman John F. Byrne, Sr.,) under investigation after campaign contribution pay-to-play allegations concerning work done by city contractors to rebuild the Market-Frankford Elevated Line.

It finds an envy-free item assignment of a subset of the items. Moreover, the resulting allocation is Pareto efficient in the following sense: there is no other envy-free allocation which is better for one person and not worse for the other person. The AL procedure was first published by Brams and Kilgour and Klamler. It was later generalized by Haris Aziz to handle the case where agents may express indifferences.  Assumptions  The AL procedure requires the following assumptions on the people: * Each person can rank the items from best to worst (i.e., each person can report a strict preference relation on the items). * Each person has a preference relation on bundles of items which is compatible with the responsive set extension of the ordering on items.  Requirements  It is not assumed that the people can report their preference relation on bundles. There are many bundles, and it may be difficult to report a ranking on all of them. Therefore, the procedure should return an allocation that is envy-free for every preference relation that is consistent with the item ranking and with weak additivity. In other words, the procedure should return an allocation that is necessarily envy-free (NEF). Suppose the two people are Alice and George. An allocation is NEF for Alice if there is an injection f from George's items to Alice's items, such that for each item x received by George, Alice prefers f(x) to x. An allocation is NEF for George if the symmetric property is satisfied. An item assignment is NEF if it is NEF for both partners. Note that in a NEF assignment, Alice and George receive the same number of items. The empty allocation is obviously NEF, but it is very inefficient. Therefore, we are looking for an allocation that is \\"best\\" among all NEF allocations. A NEF allocation is called Pareto-efficient if there is no other NEF allocation that is better for one person and not worse for the other one.  The BT procedure  As an introduction, consider the following simple division procedure: * Put all items on the table. * While there are items on the table, do: ** Ask the partners to choose their favorite item from all items on the table. ** If the choices are different, then give each partner his/her favorite item and continue. ** If the choices are identical, then send the chosen item to the Contested Pile. It will not be allocated. This procedure returns a NEF allocation. It is very simple but not very efficient, since many items are discarded to the contested pile. The AL procedure is slightly more complicated, but it guarantees that the contested pile is never larger, and may be smaller than under BT.  The AL procedure  The AL procedure works similarly to the BT procedure, but, before moving an item to the contested pile, it tries to allocate it to one partner while compensating the other partner with another item. Only if this doesn't succeed, the item is sent to the contested pile. For example, suppose there are four items (1, 2, 3, 4) and the preferences of the partners are: * Alice: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 * George: 2 > 3 > 4 > 1 The BT procedure gives 1 to Alice and 2 to George, since these are their favorites and they are different. Then, both Alice and George choose 3 so it is discarded. Then, both choose 4 so it is also discarded. The final allocation is: Alice‚Üê{1}, George‚Üê{2}. It is NEF but not PE. The AL procedure also starts by giving 1 to Alice and 2 to George. Then, instead of discarding item 3, it is given to Alice, and George is compensated with item 4. The final allocation is: Alice ‚Üê {1,3}, George ‚Üê {2,4}. It is NEF and PE. Both procedures are manipulable: a partner can gain by reporting incorrect preferences. However, such manipulation requires knowledge of the other partner's preferences, so it is difficult in practice.  The AL procedure with indifferences  The original AL procedure crucially relies on the assumption that the item rankings are strict. generalizes this procedure to general rankings, with possible indifferences.

The annexation of Crimea is an example of an irredentist claim. Orthographic projection of Greater Russia and near abroad: The Soviet Union in 1945 Soviet territories that were never part of the Russian Empire: Tuva, Eastern Prussia, Zakarpattia and Western Ukraine Additional annexed/occupied territory from the Russian Empire: Finland and Poland Maximum extent of the Soviet near abroad, 1955: Warsaw Pact, Mongolia and North Korea Maximum extent of the Russian Empire's sphere of influence after the sale of Alaska in 1867, despite later Soviet attempts to restore them (Northern Iran, Xinjiang, Manchuria) History=Russian Empire From roughly the 16th century to 20th century, the Russian Empire followed an expansionist policy. The state expanded eastwards, westwards and southwards, which led to the conquests of Siberia, the Caucasus, Turkestan, and Uzbekistan. Few of these actions had irredentist justifications, though the conquest of parts of the Ottoman Empire in the Caucasus to bring Armenian Christians under the protection of the Tsar may represent one example. Post-Soviet Union (21st century) Greater Russia, showing the territories once under direct control, or within the sphere of influence of the Russian Empire and the USSR After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, it was thought that the Russian Federation gave up on plans of territorial expansion or kin-state nationalism, despite some 25 million ethnic Russians living in neighboring countries outside Russia. Stephen M. Saideman and R. William Ayres assert that Russia followed a non-irredentist policy in the 1990s despite some justifications for irredentist policies‚Äîone factor disfavoring irredentism was a focus by the ruling interest in consolidating power and the economy within the territory of Russia. Furthermore, a stable policy of irredentism popular with the electorate was not found, and politicians proposing such ideas did not fare well electorally. Russian nationalist politicians tended to focus on internal threats (i.e. \\"outsiders\\") rather than on the interests of Russians outside the federation. It has been proposed that the annexation of Crimea in 2014 proves Russia's adherence to irredentism today. The annexation of Crimea led to a new wave of Russian nationalism, with large parts of the Russian far right movement aspiring to annex even more land from Ukraine, including the unrecognized Novorossiya. Vladimir Socor proposed that Vladimir Putin's speech after the annexation of Crimea was a de facto \\"manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism\\". However, after international sanctions were imposed against Russia in early 2014, within a year the \\"Novorossiya\\" project was suspended: on 1 January 2015, the founding leadership announced the project has been put on hold, and on 20 May the constituent members announced the freezing of the political project. Some Russian nationalists seek to annex parts of the \\"near abroad\\", such as the Baltic states, while some fear potential escalation due to Russian irredentist aspirations in northern Kazakhstan also.

Estate of Leopold de' Medici The jovilabe is a brass scientific instrument, undated and of unknown maker currently in the collection of the Museo Galileo. The jovilabe was used by Galileo Galilei to determine the orbital periods of Jupiter's moons and to compute the times of their eclipses. The instrument is engraved with tables showing the mean motions of each of the four moons. Two connected disks of different diameters are rotated by means of a movable rod. They are used to create a \\"view from the Sun\\" of the movements of Jupiter's moons observed from the Earth (movements that seem irregular because of the heliocentric motions of the Earth and Jupiter). After announcing the discovery of Jupiter's moons in his 1610 treatise Sidereus Nuncius, Galileo began the systematic study of their periods in 1611, developing a micrometer for the purpose. Galileo immediately realized that eclipses of the moons could provide a precise method to determine longitude. Galileo compiled tables of the periods that he offered, with his telescopes, first to the King of Spain (1611, 1612, 1616, and 1627-1628), then to the States General of Holland (1637-1641). To convince his Spanish interlocutors that Jupiter and its moons could be observed on unstable ground, such as a ship's deck, Galileo designed a special helmet carrying a small telescope on a hinged mount. The device was named the celatone (celata = \\"helmet\\" in Italian). In this second proposal, he also described the advantages of applying the pendulum to the clock. Despite the interest they aroused, neither of his proposals were accepted.

History  The company was founded in 2014 by CEO Andrew Watkins-Ball and has received undisclosed funding from several digital financial services investors including LeapFrog Investments, Anthemis Group and Vostok Emerging Finance. JUMO started as a mobile financial services startup company under Ghana-based Afb, a finance business providing payroll loans to government and corporate workers and consumer loans to informal and market traders. After its potential to deliver digital financial services over mobile (primarily feature phones) became apparent, it was turned into a standalone business. Through September 2016, it had delivered more than 10 million loans to customers in 6 countries including Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda and Uganda. The firm's customers are mostly unbanked merchants and individuals in emerging markets where the amount of active mobile money users is high. According to Watkins-Ball, \\"A $20 loan that can be accessed without collateral in the middle of the night in a rural village can mean the difference between getting a sick person to hospital and going without medical care.\\" JUMO works with mobile network operators including Airtel, MTN Group and Tigo (Millicom) to make credit decisions for each loan application by drawing on non-traditional data points such as GSM records and mobile wallet transaction data. The platform leverages an unconventional digital credit model that does not require customers to have prior financial account ownership or a credit history. Loan decisions are automated and the digital credit application process happens over a mobile device with no need for in-person interactions. In May 2017, the firm was selected for class 4 of Google's Launchpad Accelerator alongside 5 other African companies. In July 2017, Amazon EC2 founder Chris Pinkham joined the board as an active independent director of the company.

For a time it was thought to have been built by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei but no longer bares that attribution. Description This Museo Galileo microscope is a compound microscope made of cardboard, leather and wood, and is inserted in an iron support with three curved legs. The outer tube is covered in green vellum decorated with gold tooling. There are three lenses (an objective lens, a field lens, and an eyepiece), all double-convex. The objective measures 11 mm in diameter and has a thickness of 3.5 mm. The glass is clear with few imperfections; the edge is ground and there are some fine chips. The field lens (diameter 30 mm, thickness 4.7 mm) is in a cell that pushes into the bottom of the inner tube. The glass is amber-green, with air bubbles, and has a ground edge that is chipped; the eyepiece, with an aperture of 24 mm, also has some bubbles; it is protected by a wooden cap that screws onto the mount. The instrument is attributed to Giuseppe Campani, an Italian optician and astronomer who lived in Rome during the latter half of the 17th century, known as an expert lens grinder and instrument maker.

Early life Gurdev Singh was born in 1949 at village Kaunke Kalan under Jagraon subdivision of Ludhiana district in Punjab, India. His father was Gurdial Singh and mother Chand Kaur. Gurdev Singh's grandfather, Jathedar Totha Singh was a companion of Baba Nand Singh of Nanaksar. At a young age, Singh took the vows of the Khalsa and became an initiated Sikh. After completing 6 levels of primary school, he enrolled into Damdami Taksal. Jathedar of Akal Takht A Sarbat Khalsa was called at Akal Takht in Amritsar on 26 January 1986. At the gathering, the delegation of Sarbat Khalsa announced Jasbir Singh Rode as the Jathedar of Akal Takht. Rode was imprisoned during his appointment; therefore, the delegation assigned Kaunke to serve as the acting Jathedar of Akal Takht. On 29 April 1986, the Panthic Committee held a press conference at Harmandir Sahib and declared an independent Punjabi Sikh homeland, Khalistan. Straight after the declaration, all members of the Panthic Committee escaped the scene. Subsequently, the police and army surrounded the premises and arrested Jathedar Kaunke, being the only person of significance at the complex. Whilst Gurdev Singh Kaunke was imprisoned, Gurbachan Singh Manochahal and later Professor Darshan Singh served as the acting Jathedar of Akal Takht. Personal life In 1970, Singh married Gurmel Kaur through the Anand Karaj ceremony. The couple had seven children. Tortured to Death Gurdev Singh Kaunke was arrested by a group of police officers led by Inspector Gurmit Singh on 25 December 1992, from his home in Kaunke Kalan. On 28 December, Jathedar Kaunke's wife, Gurmail Kaur found out that he had been moved from Sadar Police Station Jagraon to the Criminal Investigation Agency (CIA) interrogation center at Jagraon. When Kaunke's wife brought food to the interrogation center, the police officer told her that Gurdev Singh Kaunke was in no shape to eat anything due to torture. This fact was also confirmed by a youth who was released on 30 December and a doctor who had seen him in custody. On 31 December, Gurmail Kaur was informed that Gurdev Singh Kaunke was taken away from the CIA interrogation center. After that, Jathedar Kaunke's whereabouts could not be discovered. The police authorities claimed that Kaunke escaped from custody of 2 January 1993, after breaking a chain restraining him. In May 1997, the Committee for Coordination of Disappearances in Punjab (CCDP) investigated the enforced disappearance of Gurdev Singh Kaunke. The CCDP acquired conclusive evidence to show that Kaunke was inhumanly tortured first at Sadar police station of Jagraon and then at the CIA interrogation center of Jagraon from 25 December 1992 to 1 January 1993. The Committee also acquired irrefutable evidence to establish that the former Jathedar of Akal Takht was killed under torture. Police Accounts The Committee for Coordination of Disappearances in Punjab (CCDP) led by Ram Naryan Kumar uncovered the mysterious disappearance of Gurdev Singh Kaunke through the deposition of two police officers who had personal knowledge of the incident. The first deposition was given by Darshan Singh who had been invited by Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Swaran Ghotna of Jagraon to join the police in May 1992. The other deposition was given by a serving SSP of the Punjab Police who was an eyewitness of the torture and death of Gurdev Singh Kaunke.

Created with the aim of reuniting and preserving as much of the artistic patrimony of the diocese of Ascoli-Piceno as possible, the museum was opened in 1961 by bishop Marcello Morgante. The space consists of seven areas that house wooden and stone sculpture, paintings on canvas and wood, silver and sacred vestments made by the minor schools of the city that had a notable growth in the 1400s. There is also notable Florentine art of the 16th century. Many of the objects come directly from the city of Ascoli, while others were recovered from elsewhere in the diocesan territory. As a whole, the collection includes works from the 13th century to the present day.  Rooms in the Museum  Carlo Crivelli, The Madonna of Poggio Bretta (c.1472) * The entrance contains a terracotta polychrome cross dated to between 1430 and 1450; * The gallery runs through the entire museum space and contains numerous objects made with precious metals. Of note are: a processional cross from a local shop made prior to the 16th century and showing a clear influence of the Abruzzo-Sulmona region; a wooden box with ivory decoration that represents the parable of The wise and foolish virgins; a portrait of Girolamo Bernerio by Venceslao Correggioli; two silver statues, one of Saint Emidio by Pietro Vannini, and the other of the Madonna of Loreto from the 17th century by goldsmith Curzio Compagni of Florence; * Room 1 contains mostly paintings from the Venetian painter Carlo Crivelli, who was active in the region of Ascoli from 1468, and his most important student, Pietro Alamanno. Among the works by Crivelli is the Madonna of Poggio Bretta made between 1470 and 1472, and by Alamanno is the tavola cuspidata of 1485, brought here from Cerreto di Venarotta. Also found here is an interesting antependium textured with silk and gold thread from the end of the 15th century which comes from the cathedral of Ascol. * Room 2 contains painted works by Cola dell'Amatrice among which is a panel painting of Saint Victor from 1517. * Rooms 3 and 4 contain Baroque works among which are paintings by Carlo Allegretti, Ludovico Trasi, and Nicola Monti of the Miracle of Christ from the 18th century. * Room 5 (known as the Room of Eden) was the residence of the Vicar General of Ascoli and its name comes from the columns of travertine that represent Adam and Eve. Also found here are the Arm-reliquary of Saint Emygdius made by Pietro Vannini in the 15th century, several Baroque paintings, and a 15th-century coffered ceiling decorated with rosettes.  Specific Highlights = St. Emygdius statue by Pietro Vannini  A silver statue of Saint Emygdius in the Cathedral of Ascoli Piceno similar to the one by Pietro Vannini This statue was made in 1482, the year that Pope Sixtus IV granted ¬´libertas ecclesiastica¬ª to the city of Ascoli. On the octagonal base of the statue is written: ¬´Ex quo libertas porta est asculea cumque iustitia rutilans ensis in urbe sumptibus hoc sacre residentum atque ere catedre Petri et Francisci celte refulget opus¬ª. The inscription contains the names of both Peter (which refers to Peter Vannini) and Francis (which refers to Francis di Paolino of Offida), but most likely the sole artist of the work is the former. The statue is 152 cm in height and made with embossed silver. The statue shows the patron saint of Ascoli in his pontifical garb giving a blessing with his right hand, while in his left hand he holds his crosier. Added in the 17th century, well after the statue's creation, the crosier was donated by Cardinal Bernerio as indicated by the coat of arms depicted at the end of the handle. The work, wrote Luigi Serra, is considered to be one of the best of the 15th century for its \\"vivacious expression in both his face and gesture\\". The folds in the cloth of his garments are particularly well-done; on the front of the mitre are incised six oval forms showing images of the four saints of Ascoli. The edges of the stole and cope are richly woven in relief, and the work of the hood is decorated with floral motifs. The round clip of the cope, centred inside a starred perimeter, has an engraving indicating the moment in which Pope Marcello I consecrated the saint as a bishop. This statue, along with the arm-reliquary and the beheading stone (preserved in the little shrine of Sant'Emidio Rosso), are among the icons most venerated by the faithful of the city of Ascoli.  Saint Emygdius arm-reliquary by Pietro Vannini  The arm-reliquary of Saint Emygdius is made of gold-plated silver, stands 87 cm high, in the shape of an arm ending in the hand of blessing, contains a relic of Saint Emygdius. The arm rises up from a base in the shape of a hexagonal star made of superimposed disks. The reliquary, attributed by Emile Bertaux to goldsmith Pietro Vannini, was made in the 15th century and commissioned by the priest Giovanni di Filippo, as written in its inscription: ¬´HOC OPUS FECIT FIERI DOMINUS IHOANNES PHILIPPI SAC.¬ª The hand, which shows a precious episcopal ring on its ring finger, appears wrapped up among the pleats of a glove in a portion of the hem of which is inscribed in gothic characters: ¬´IESUS AUTEM TRANSIENS P.R.¬ª. The part of the forearm is covered by the silver sleeve of a shirt brocaded in leaf and flora designs affixed with a silver ribbon. On the inside of the ribbon can be read: ¬´AVE MARIA¬ª. The trim is held together by a golden clip in which are embedded four rubies and four emeralds. At the centre can be seen a stylized representation of the city of Ascoli with a bridge and many towers that rise above and in front of a Roman she-wolf.  The 16th-century Florentine crosier  This crosier, 180 cm in height, is made of embossed silver by the masters of Florentine gold-work of the 16th century. It was donated to the Capitolo di Ascoli by Girolamo Bernerio, a cardinal who belonged to the Dominican order. The renaissance design is usually attributed to Giorgio Vasari. It is made of a long handle ending in a precious spiral that is composed of acanthus leaves that encompass at the center a small Christ Child giving a blessing. The figure of the Baby Jesus is set up at the base of a little iconic temple with columns and pediments. Under the pediments are four small niches that hold images of the Madonna of Loreto, Saint Emygdius, Saint Francis, and Saint Dominic. In the portion over the pediments, inside the tympanum, are the coats of arms of Cardinal Bernerio and of the city of Ascoli.

A perfect coffin corner kick is one that goes out of bounds just before either orange pylon located in the front of the end zone. The punter tries to place the ball so that it lands out of bounds or is downed on the field by another member of the kicking team anywhere inside the 5-yard line without touching the goal line, thus forcing difficult field position for the receiving team on their next scrimmage. The name comes from the \\"coffin corner\\" found in Victorian houses (the slang and often refuted term for a decorative niche, or very small 'corner', cut into the wall of a staircase landing), because the target area is very small. A high level of skill is required to execute such a punt, for if the kick is slightly too far into the end zone or if a member of the kicking team touches the goal line while maintaining possession of the ball, a touchback is awarded, losing the advantage that comes with a successful execution of the kick. If the ball goes out of bounds too far upfield, the receiving team will usually have more options on offense, such as being able to drop back for a pass without fear of possibly giving up a safety. More often than not, a kicker's attempt to land the ball accurately within the coffin corner fails, as the amount of skill required to angle a kick inside such a small area is extraordinary. In recent years, as punters have become more adept at kicking the ball so as to not bounce forward after landing, punting teams have increasingly eschewed coffin corner punts in favor of kicking inbounds and downing the ball before it reaches the end zone.

The Conservation Area focuses on the area around the historic crossroads, and stretches from the station down to Trinity Square. It also takes in part of Grove Road, in particular the late 19th century masonic hall. It includes two churches, Sutton Baptist Church and Trinity Church. The Carshalton Road section includes the Edwardian era police station. The local authority noted that the buildings, especially their upper storeys, were worthy of preservation and enhancement. Its report concluded that conservation status was warranted on the basis of the historic importance of the area together with its architectural and aesthetic merit. The designation would enable the provision of guidance to landowners and developers on maintaining and improving the historic aspects of the area.Sutton Council document Gordon Rookledge in his \\"Sutton Architectural Identifier\\" remarks on the \\"vivid, Victorian, polychrome brick and stone fa√ßades\\" in his description of Sutton High Street.

Gaining this status will unlock resources to enhance the historic environment, including the conservation area, with the aim of encouraging economic growth.

It was designated in 1992, is nine hectares in size, comprises 138 properties, and is located between Sutton town centre and Cheam Village. Most of the houses are large detached villas. The grandeur of the houses is a notable feature of the area, which is surrounded by mature trees and grass verges.Borough Heritage Study[Part 1 https://moderngov.sutton.gov.uk/documents/s21850/Part%201.pdf Borough Heritage Study] The development of these roads began in the late nineteenth century and was fully completed in 1913. The roads are lined with, according to Gordon Rookledge, the \\"finest, detailed Edwardian detached and semi-detached houses\\" in Sutton Borough. The Sutton Garden Suburb Conservation Area The Sutton Garden Suburb is in Benhilton in north Sutton. Inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, it was the first of the Sutton conservation areas to be designated as such, in 1989. Thomas Wall, famous for his sausages and ice cream, developed the Sutton Garden Suburb between 1912 and 1914. This suburb contributed to the garden city movement that was originally conceived by Ebenezer Howard and was similar to the development of the Hampstead Garden Suburb in north London. Designed by Frederick Cavendish Pearson for Rose Hill Park Limited, which sold out its rights in 1913 to Sutton Garden Suburb Limited, it has an integrated house and landscape design, some secreted around small greens and others along well-planted avenues. The original plans would have provided for 1,000 houses, to be built around greens and woods including a recreation ground and a clubhouse for members of the Suburb. Tennis courts and a clubhouse were in fact built at the centre of the Suburb, and the remnant of a post of one of the courts can be found on the land, but during the Second World War most of the land was put to use as a victory garden instead. Local residents continued to use the land as allotments until they were evicted by the then landowner in 1997. The Sutton Garden Suburb Residents Association was formed soon after, principally to oppose residential development of the site. The land has since fallen into disuse and been taken over by local wildlife. The site is designated as Urban Green Space. The first houses to be built were at Oak Close, followed by Meadow Close, Hawthorne Close and Horseshoe Green. Between 1912 and 1914, 79 houses to Cavendish's plans and elevations had been started on site. Houses in Woodend were started in 1914, and in 1915 a further 55 houses were under construction in Greenhill and Aultone Way, with footings already set out. However, Sutton Garden Suburb Limited failed to obtain permission from the Local Government Board to borrow further money in the winter of 1914. The government also intervened and put a stop to all house building in 1915 following the outbreak of the First World War. After the war, financial difficulties meant that the remaining plots envisaged for development were sold off to local builders for as little as ¬£2 per footing. This is visually evident in the different styles of housing in the area, with most of the semi-detached properties and bungalows being built on those plots waiting to be developed before the First World War. Cavendish Pearson was later employed by private individuals to design houses in the Suburb, and notably became involved in designing the nearby St Helier estate for London County Council. Cavendish Pearson is known to have lived at two houses he designed in the Suburb, 12 Woodend in 1914-15, and 20 Meadow Close from 1920-63. Grove Avenue Conservation Area Grove Avenue Conservation Area was built as a private estate in the 1920s or early 1930s. It is situated between Grove Road and Cheam Road, near the Landseer Road Conservation Area. The properties consist of single blocks, each containing four maisonettes, presenting a symmetrical facade to the road. The blocks are alternately built in modernist or half-timbered styles. Many of the details survive, including iron-framed windows, hand-painted number and instruction boards, garage facades, front-garden walls, tree plantings and the estate gate-piers.

It consists of a large frame carrying two beams from which two rows of six and two wooden balls, respectively, are suspended from pairs of strings. The instrument was often used with two elastic balls (of ivory) or inelastic balls (of wet clay), of equal or different mass. By changing the parameters of the experiments such as height of fall and mass, one could conduct a systematic investigation of collision-related phenomena.

The mechanical paradox is an apparatus for studying physical paradoxes. This apparatus, mounted on an elegant table, consists of a trapezoidal veneered wooden frame with two brass rails. A pair of brass cones joined at their bases by a wooden disk rests on the rails. When the double cone is placed at the low end of the frame, it automatically starts to roll upward, giving the impression of escaping the universal law of the gravitational force. Because of this phenomenon, astonishing in its seeming contradiction of common sense, the apparatus was often described as a \\"mechanical paradox.\\" In fact, the paradox is only apparent. This is due to the fact that the natural motion of bodies depends on that of their center of gravity, which has a natural tendency to descend. Since the rails diverge, the center of gravity of the double cone‚Äîwhen placed on the rotation axis at its maximum diameter‚Äîdoes not rise when the entire body seems to be moving upward; rather, the center is shifting downward. In its travel, the resting-points of the double cone on the rails converge toward its two apexes. As a result, the distance of the center of gravity from the horizontal plane decreases as the double cone rises. The instrument is held in the Lorraine collections of the Museo Galileo in Florence.

Encompassing some of bottom lands on either side of the Mad River, the area has seen active agricultural use since the late 18th century, and retains a number of mid-19th century farmsteads. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history Vermont's Mad River is a north-flowing tributary of the Winooski River, which feeds Lake Champlain at Burlington. The historic district, with the river meandering through its middle is roughly bounded on the east by North Road, the west by Vermont Route 100, and the south by Tremblay Road. Its northern boundary is roughly Downsville Brook, an east-flowing tributary in Moretown. This area is one of the broader stretches of the river's flood plain, bounded at the northern and southern ends by terrain that narrows the river's passage. It is roughly bisected by Meadow Road, which crosses the river at one of the area's oldest crossing sites. with This section of the Mad River valley was populated in the 1780s by white settlers, drawn by its agricultural potential. The earliest road, roughly North Road to the Meadow Road crossing, was laid out by 1796, and the Mad River Turnpike (now Vermont Route 100, and Route 100B from their junction) was opened in 1807. Early farmers were generally diversified in their early production, and had begun focusing on cattle and Morgan horses by the mid-19th century. With the introduction of the railroad in a neighboring valley, and the development of refrigerated rail cars later in the 19th century, the area's farmers turned to the production of butter. It is during this period that many of the area farmsteads achieved their present form, although many of the active ones have had modern facilities added. Prominent examples of farmsteads are found on Vermont 100 and North Road, generally set outside the flood plain, because the river has historically flooded on numerous occasions.

The binding to these receptors by catecholamines will generally stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, the arm of the autonomic nervous system responsible for the fight-or-flight response. The mechanism of adrenergic receptors. Adrenaline or noradrenaline are receptor ligands to either Œ±1, Œ±2 or Œ≤-adrenergic receptors. Œ±1 couples to Gq, which results in increased intracellular Ca2+ and subsequent smooth muscle contraction. Œ±2, on the other hand, couples to Gi, which causes a decrease in neurotransmitter release, as well as a decrease of cAMP activity resulting in smooth muscle contraction. Œ≤ receptors couple to Gs, and increases intracellular cAMP activity, resulting in e.g. heart muscle contraction, smooth muscle relaxation and glycogenolysis. The implications of high titers of these circulating antibodies are still being worked out and further investigated. There is compelling evidence that autoimmunity against this class of G protein-coupled receptors results in a variety of pathologies. Associated pathologies: Cardiovascular diseases and events: Circulating autoantibodies to adrenergic receptors have been identified in numerous heart diseases and cardiac symptoms. Laboratory models have revealed a mechanism by which adrenergic autoantibodies accomplish their effects on the cardiovascular system. ‚ÄúBeta1 autoantibodies trigger conformational changes in the receptor, attenuate receptor internalization. The combination of these two properties can result in bimodal effects on receptor activity that are meaningful for basal activity and chronotropic catecholamine responses of human cardiomyocytes.‚Äù Beta-1 adrenergic receptors are the primary receptor of the heart and, therefore, autoantibodies to these receptors have been tied to many different heart diseases. Autoantibodies to beta1-adrenergic receptors are linked to chronic heart failure. However, it has been proposed that both beta1-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms and autoantibodies could be working together in the development of chronic heart failure. Cardiomyopathy due to autoimmune dysregulation and production of autoantibodies has been seen in humans and reproduced in animal models. In rabbit models, increased expression of autoantibodies has been directly correlated with induction of atrial fibrillation. In canine models inoculated with adrenergic autoantibodies, it has been shown that beta blockers can negate certain cardiac arrhythmias. Refractory Hypertension associated with autoantibodies to beta1-adrenergic receptors has been documented in diabetic patients. While the exact pathophysiology of Chagas disease is not completely understood, some models have shown that an overstimulation of the immune system causes production of adrenergic autoantibodies. Current research is trying to determine the exact role of these autoantibodies and whether they correlate with the symptomatology of Chagas disease. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome The Heart Rhythm Institute at the University of Oklahoma points to an autoimmune basis in a condition that presents as chronic malfunction of the autonomic nervous system. The work of endocrinology labs have correlated autoantibodies to the beta-adrenergic receptors with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). Doctors compare the level of disability seen in POTS to the quality of life experienced in conditions like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or congestive heart failure. With the vast and vague symptomatology, and no previously known etiology, diagnosis and treatment proved elusive and challenging. The identification of these antibodies and the development of better testing provide hope for more targeted therapies and better treatment outcomes. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), a disease characterized by profound fatigue, sleep abnormalities, pain, and other symptoms that are made worse by exertion, is infamous for its confounding etiology. Studies have revealed the specific connection between infection-trigger and disease onset in a cohort of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients. These patients showed significantly elevated antibodies to beta2-adrenergic receptors. Future research solidifying this correlation of CFS with autoantibodies to adrenergic receptors would be useful to clinicians tackling this difficult-to-treat condition that affects 200,000 people per year in the US. Other: Experimental studies observed that activating autoantibodies to the beta1/2-adrenergic and M2 muscarinic receptors are associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias in patients with hyperthyroidism. Additional research into the prevalence of these biomarkers in Grave's Disease (Grave's Hyperthyroidism) showed facilitated triggering of pulmonary veins and atrial fibrillation. Adrenergic autoantibodies have been linked to Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans). Buerger's disease is a rare disease in which the arteries and veins in the arms and legs become inflamed, swell and can become blocked with blood clots, also known as thrombi.

The group's core members were Jamie and Joe Silvia, a married couple who played with a number of session musicians and other singers. They worked within the booming mid-20th century Chicago advertising industry in both radio and television with clients including well- known food companies, politicians, appliance manufacturers, and industry associations. The couple declined invitations to go on tour, opting to stay in Chicago with their family, but did record three albums for Columbia Records, including a combination of original songs and covers of standards and Broadway show tunes. At the 6th Annual Grammy Awards in 1964, The J's with Jamie were nominated in two categories: Best New Artist and Best Performance by a Vocal Group. Shortly before disbanding in 1967 to found a commercial production firm, the Silvias released another two albums as Jamie and the J. Silvia Singers. Formation The J's with Jamie was formed by husband and wife Joe and Jamie Silvia. Jamie's background was as a dancer, but she took up singing as a career in her late teens, citing Sarah Vaughan as one of her influences. She went on tour as the lead vocalist for The Mellowlarks in the 1950s but left to form The J's with Jamie in 1958. One year for Christmas, the couple decided to record Christmas songs for their friends instead of sending out a more traditional greeting card. To do so, they went to the Columbia Records recording studio in Chicago. The audio engineer was impressed enough with their performance that he shared the music with Ernie Altschuler in Columbia's artists and repertoire division, leading to a recording contract.This citation mistakenly calls the group \\"The Jamies,\\" an error for which it issued a correction in the following issue: From their start until the group disbanded in 1967, Jamie and Joe Silvia were the core of the group. They worked with session musicians and a number of other singers. Their most prominent collaborator was Don Shelton, a tenor who was part of The Hi-Lo's, but others included Marshall Gill and Len Dresslar, whose deep bass voice is best known for the Jolly Green Giant's \\"Ho! Ho! Ho!\\". Jingles and recordings Recounting the group's career years later, Jamie estimated the group recorded 25‚Äì30 commercials each week between 1958 and 1967. Their clients were as varied as the companies, organizations, and individuals who advertise on television and radio, such as food manufacturers, home goods companies, cigarette companies, department stores, politicians, appliance makers, and industry associations. Examples of well-known brands for which they recorded jingles include Campbell's, Marlboro, Schlitz, Sears, Pillsbury, Alka-Seltzer, Wrigley, Amana, Mr. Clean, Green Giant, and Kellogg's. In 1963, they recorded a song, \\"Hey, Look Him Over!\\" for Birch Bayh's Senatorial campaign against incumbent Homer Capehart. The song, telling voters how to pronounce Bayh's name, ran extensively in commercials in the weeks leading up to the election, and was credited in part with Bayh's victory. The commercial went on to win a Clio Award. A July 1964 Time article reported that they were earning $250,000 per year for their work, and that even Broadway producers interested to hire Jamie learned that she was out of their price range. Jamie and Joe declined invitations to go on tour, opting to stay in Chicago with their two daughters, Jana and Risa. Their primary activity was always commercial, but they did record three albums for Columbia Records, including both original songs and covers of standards and show tunes. Despite not concentrating on recording albums, The J's with Jamie received two Grammy Awards nominations at the 1964 ceremony. Their album Hey, Look Us Over! earned a nomination for Best Performance by a Vocal Group, losing to Peter, Paul and Mary (for \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\"), and they were in the running for Best New Artist, which was won by The Swingle Singers. A single from the album, \\"Yoshiko,\\" earned some international attention, even reaching the #1 on the Radio Malaysia chart in 1964. In 1966 and 1967, the Silvias released two more albums on ABC Records as Jamie and the J. Silvia Singers, retaining their familiar style. The J's with Jamie formally disbanded in 1967, when the couple moved to New York City to found a commercial production house. Shelton and Dresslar remained in Chicago, teaming up with Bonnie Herman and Shelton's bandmate from The Hi-Lo's, Gene Puerling, to form another successful commercial music group, The Singers Unlimited. Reception and legacy The J's with Jamie are best known for their work in marketing. A Time article about them titled \\"Oratorios for industry\\" called them \\"the best commercial- single ensemble [in which] all four singers deliver their words with the sort of enunciation that makes poets out of admen.\\" Among other recognition for their work in advertising, they received a Clio Award for a political commercial in 1963. They also received a positive reception for the musical quality of their popular music work. In the 1962 Billboard Artist Popularity Poll, they were ranked 5th in the \\"Most Promising Vocal Group\\" category. They received two Grammy Award nominations in 1964 following the release of Hey, Look Us Over! A Variety review of that album noted that The J's with Jamie sound young and \\"sprightly,\\" but show a wide range of genres and \\"professional efficiency.\\" In their review, Billboard said the group was \\"the best thing to come around since The Modernaires\\" and remarked on their \\"matchless vocal quality and attention to detail.\\" Music journalist Marc Myers described Jamie's voice as \\"lovely and special [with] an upbeat warmth and polished perfection to her intonation that came with a girl-next-door naturalism reminiscent of Eydie Gorme.\\" Despite being Grammy-nominated and being among the most prominent vocal performers on the radio in the United States in the 1960s, little is known about the group. In 1964 Time Magazine wrote that \\"they have probably been heard by more people more times than any other group in the history of sound. Yet next to nobody knows who they are. They are the world's most successful singers of TV commercials.\\" A WFMU blog noted that although the Columbia records are long out of print, bootlegs in Japan have had a \\"substantial\\" influence on J-pop. Discography For most of their recording career, the group worked with Columbia Records, which released three LPs, several singles, and promotional albums. In the late 1960s, as Jamie and the J. Silvia Singers, they issued two more LPs with ABC. As The J's with Jamie Albums * Hey, Look us Over!

He was promoted to corporal before the regiment was disbanded on December 16, 1775.Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army, 1789-1903. Francis B. Heitman. 1903. Volume 1. p. 601. Kingsbury remained in the Continental Army when it was reorganized in January 1776. He was promoted to sergeant and then was commissioned an ensign in Webb's Additional Continental Regiment on April 26, 1780. He served until the Continental Army was disbanded on November 3, 1783. After the war, he became an original member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati. Post Revolution After a break in service of almost four years, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the First American Regiment (today known as the 3rd Infantry Regiment) on October 15, 1787. He served in the ill- fated campaigns of Colonel Josiah Harmar (in 1790) and General Arthur St. Clair (in 1791) against the Miami Tribe in what is modern-day Ohio. On January 10 and 11, 1791, Kingsbury distinguished himself at the Siege of Dunlap's Station, where he led a detachment of only 12 soldiers, along with a few settlers, in defending a small outpost against a far superior force of Native Americans. Following St. Clair's Defeat in November 1791, he was promoted to captain in April 1792 retroactive to December 28, 1791. Kingsbury was assigned to the 1st Sub-Legion when the Army was re-organized in 1792 and commanded a company in the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794, which decisively defeated the Native Americans in Ohio. When the Army was re-organized in 1796, the 1st Sub-Legion reverted to being designated as the 1st Infantry Regiment. Kingsbury was promoted to major in 1797 and lieutenant colonel in 1803. Early in 1802 he was assigned to command Fort Wilkinson in Georgia, where he was under the command of General James Wilkinson. In 1805 he established Fort Belle Fontaine on the Missouri River and served there until he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of the 1st Infantry in 1808.http://www.fortwiki.com/Fort_Belle_Fontaine In 1807 Kingsbury was elected to membership in the United States Military Philosophical Society, which was the first professional association of officers of the United States Army.

This appliance primarily focused on the modulation of neuromuscular activity in order to produce changes in jaw and teeth. The appliance was opposite to the Bionator appliance and Activator appliance. History It was developed by Rolf Fr√§nkel in Germany in 1950s. In his practice, Fr√§nkel had used the activator functional appliance and experienced mixed results with this appliance. He believed that a treatment outcome is more stable if the functional deviations of muscles are also corrected along with dentition. Therefore, through his work he developed an approach which allowed the maxillary and mandibular muscles to play an important part in an orthodontic treatment. He achieved that through development of functional regulator appliances. These appliances allowed him to train and reprogram the musculature around the mouth. He published around 70 articles which stressed the importance of his appliance in expanding the dental arches. He first introduced his functional orthopedic approach in 1966 at a meeting for European Orthodontic Society. Fr√§nkel's Philosophy Fr√§nkel's philosophy mirrored that Melvin Moss. Their philosophy was that the functional performance of the muscular portions of the oral capsule influence the developing functional spaces. Fr√§nkel also thought that the functional spaces are influenced by the atmospheric pressure. He believed that the perioral muscles had restraining effect on the dental arches and that the insertion of appliance expands the capsule and allows new functional adaptation of the muscle. Types= Frankel Appliance I (FR 1)  This appliance had Type A, B and C. The difference between A and B was the lower lingual loops in one and lower lingual shield in another. This was mainly used for Class 1 and Class 2 Division 1 malocclusion. * Acrylic Components ** Buccal Shield - They were about 2.5mm thick and their goal was to expand the soft tissue capsule in the back. ** Lip Pads - They are tear drop shaped acrylic pads which were placed in the vestibule of the lower arch. ** Lingual Shield - This allows mandibular muscles to overcome their poor posture. * Wire components ** Palatal bow - This rests on maxillary molar and has a stabilizing action for the appliance. ** Cross over wire - They run between 1st and 2nd premolars and are responsible for movement of the buccal segments. ** Lower lingual wires - They prevent the lingual movement of lower incisors. ** Labial bow - ** Canine loop - Used for guided eruption of canine and also for intermaxillary anchorage.  Frankel Appliance II (FR II)  This was used primarily in Class 2 Division 1 and 2.  Frankel Appliance III (FR III)  Used in patients with Class 3 malocclusion. In this appliance the lip pads are used in the maxillary arch to allow the maxilla to grow. The mandibular arch does not have pads in the anterior to allow the soft tissue forces to act on the mandible.  Frankel Appliance IV (FR IV)  Used in patients with open bite and bimaxillary protrusion cases.  Frankel Appliance V (FR V)  This appliance can be used with headgear in patients with high mandibular plane angle and vertical maxillary excess. Modifications * Otton (1992) - Capped Frankel Appliance. * Owen (1985) - Modified functional regulator for Vertical Maxillary Excess. * Chate (1986) - Angulation of Cross Wires was changed. * Kingston - He modified the buccal shields. * Haynes (1986) - He modified appliance to have continuous buccolabial shield palatal acrylic support.

She and literary historian Archibald Campbell Jordan were the parents of politician Pallo Jordan. Personal life Phyllis Priscilla ‚ÄúNogqaza‚Äù Ntantala was born on 7 January 1920 at Gqubeni, along the bends of the Nqabarha River, eDutywa in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Ntantala-Jordan's father, George Govan Ntantala was a prosperous farmer who served on the Transkei General Council, iBhunga and her mother, Ida Balfour, was a descendant of the earliest African Christian community, founded by the prophet Ntsikana during the second decade of the 19th century in the Eastern Cape. In describing her upbringing, Ntantala-Jordan said, \\"Like Trotsky, I did not leave home without the proverbial one-and-six in my pocket. I came from a family of landed gentry in the Transkei\\". Ntantala-Jordan started her schooling at the tender age of four years. Six months later, she lost her mother. After completing Standard 6 (Grade 8),then aged 12, Ntantala-Jordan was sent to Healdtown. Healdtown was highly recommended to her father over Lovedale by her primary school principal Rhodes Cakata. Ntantala says at Healdtown students were treated equally despite their background and smaller than Lovedale. At 15, Ntantala was awarded the Transkeian Bhunga Scholarship to study at the University of Fort Hare. At the time, Fort Hare, although offering degrees, admitted students for matric studies. After completing her matric, she completed a teachers‚Äô diploma at the University of Fort Hare in 1937. Ntantala-Jordan began working at Bantu High School in Kroonstad as a teacher in 1938. In 1939, Ntantala-Jordan married isiXhosa writer Archibald Campbell Jordan, whom she had met during her time at Fort Hare University. In 1945, following the appointment of AC Jordan as lecturer of Bantu Languages at Fort Hare, the Jordan‚Äôs, then with two children, and a third on the way, left Kroonstad for the Eastern Cape. However, Their stay at the University of Fort Hare was short-lived. In 1946, AC Jordan moved with his family to Cape Town after he successfully applied for a lectureship in Bantu Languages at the University of Cape Town (UCT). In 1957, Dr Ntantala-Jordan registered at the University of Cape Town for a Higher Diploma in Native Law and Administration. She would later obtain qualifications from the University of South Africa, the Madison Area Technical College as well as an honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from the University of Fort Hare. Due to the political pressures exerted by the then apartheid South African government during the late 1950s and 1960s, the Jordans went into exile in 1961. The Jordans moved to America, where they and their two children are laid to rest. Ntantala-Jordan died at the age of 96 in Michigan on 17 July 2016. She was 96 years old. She was laid to rest at the Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison, Wisconsin on 30 July 2016. Ntantala-Jordan and AC Jordan are survived by their son Pallo Jordan Political Work Ntantala-Jordan attributes her political awakening to her time as a teacher at Bantu High School in Kroonstad. In describing her political awakening, Ntantala-Jordan says \\"I always tell people that it was my experience in the Free State that really roused to anger my social consciousness...Most of our students in Kroonstad did not see a future beyond their school. They remained in school because it was a better place than life in the location. I knew that something was wrong somewhere.\\" When her family moved to Moshesh Avenue in the Langa location after her husband AC Jordan's appointment at the University of Cape Town in 1946, Ntantala-Jordan fought hard to ensure her family moved out of the township. In October 1946, after months of house-hunting in the then white areas (under Group Areas Act), the Jordans wrote to Governor General Mr Brownlee, requesting permission to purchase a lot from a Mr Guttman in Fleur Street, Lincoln Estate, Cape Town. In November, the Jordans acquired permission to buy the lot from Mr Guttman becoming one of the first African families to do so in the area. They named their residence \\"Thabisano\\", a place of rejoicing. The Jordans never sent their children to African schools as the government demanded but sent them to St Marks English Church in Athlone, Rosmead and Livingstone High School in Claremont. During her first five years in Cape Town, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, while she was raising their children, she ‚Äúwas busy with political work and in the Cape African Teachers‚Äô Association\\".The issues that CATA focused in the early 1950s revolved around the condemnation of the Group Areas Act of 1950, the Bantu Authorities Act of 1951, the Jan van Riebeeck celebrations at the Grand Parade in Cape Town in 1952 and the Bantu Education Act of 1953. Ntantala-Jordan wrote Ukwayo:Isikrweqe nekhakha, an isiXhosa translation of I.B Tabata's \\"Boycott as a weapon of struggle\\", which was widely distributed by the Society of Young Africa (SOYA) in Transkei. Ntantala-Jordan made a speech at the largest rally in opposition to the celebration of Jan van Riebeeck on 4 April 1952, two days before the celebration which were scheduled for 6 April. Ntantala-Jordan describes the celebrations as a flop for the government and a success for the people's boycott. In 1957, Ntantala-Jordan was asked to contribute an article for a magazine called Africa South on ‚ÄúAfrican women\\" by Ronnie Segal she chose to write about the ‚Äúother women whom nobody ever hears about, whose story had never been told, because they are not the \`pillars‚Äô of their societies‚Äù. According to her, these ‚Äúwere some of the girls I had grown up with, now married and living the lives of widows, as their menfolk were away in the cities‚Äù. Her second article in this magazine was entitled ‚ÄúThe Widows of the Reserves‚Äù which was later translated to Flemish, French and Dutch. During the State of emergency as a result of the Sharpeville massacre and Langaprotest of 21 March 1960, there was general harassment of blacks. AC Jordan was arrested and assaulted on the 4th of April 1960, five days after the declaration of the State of Emergency. Against this background, the Jordan opted to moved to the United States of America. In early in 1961, AC Jordan was awarded a Carnegie Travel Grant to visit universities and colleges in the US. When he was denied a passport, he opted for an exit permit. His family followed him in 1962 and they ended up in the United States of America. Legacy Ntantala-Jordan is remembered as an intellectual, an author and an outspoken political activist. In describing her role in the struggle for liberation, The African National Congress said \\"the passing of Mama Phyllis Ntantala-Jordan has robbed South Africa and the world at large of an astute, inquisitive and inspiring mind. We have lost a champion of gender equality for African women in particular...\\" Ntantala-Jordan translated into English her husband AC Jordan's novel, Ingqumbo Yeminyanya, spoke at a number of public lectures, wrote essays, a book Let's Hear Them Speak, a book amplifying the voices of many unsung heroines being South African women and her autobiography: A Life‚Äôs Mosaic: The Autobiography of PHYLLIS NTANTALA.

As Rob Gaylard notes, \\"Central to Wicomb's collection of stories is the question of identity, and intimately bound up with this are the polarities of home and exile. Significantly, the stories were written while Wicomb was in exile in England.\\"Gaylard, Rob, \\"Exile and Homecoming: Identity in Zo√´ Wicomb's You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town\\", ARIEL: A Review of International English Literature 27:1 (January 1996), p. 177. You Can‚Äôt Get Lost in Cape Town was also published in the US in 1987 by Pantheon Books, and in 2000 by The Feminist Press at CUNY. The book was translated into Italian by Maria Teresa Carbone as Cenere Sulla Mia Manica (Rome: Edizioni Lavoro, 1993), with an Introduction by Dorothy Driver, who suggests that Wicomb's stories are without precedent, that no one previously had written from the pariticular perspective a woman brought up \\"Coloured\\" in South Africa. Critical appraisal Gaylard sees the stories collectively as a kind of bildungsroman, noting that \\"...while Wicomb's work has obvious affinities with that of Bessie Head and Arthur Nortj√© (whose poetry supplies two of the epigraphs for her collection), her stories may also gain by being viewed in the wider context of postcolonial writing. Comparison with the work of recent women writers from the Caribbean may be particularly rewarding: writers like Jamaica Kincaid and Michelle Cliff share a preoccuption with the problems of a mixed or hybridized identity; they often write about home from the perspective of exile and often appropriate first-person narrative forms in order to do so.\\"Gaylard (1996), pp. 178, 187‚Äì188. According to the Wall Street Journal review, \\"Wicomb deserves a wide American audience, on a part with Nadine Gordimer and J. M. Coetzee\\", while the Seattle Times stated: \\"Wicomb is a gifted writer, and her compressed narratives work like brilliant splinters in the mind, suggesting a rich rhythm and shape.\\"You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town\\" at Google Books. Describing the book as \\"superb\\", Bharati Mukherjee wrote in her New York Times review: \\"Ms. Wicomb's subject isn't ‚Äì as American readers might expect - simple apartheid. It is the desperate search of the coloured for identity in a harshly hierarchical society. In this acceptance of apartheid and the desire to see beyond it, Ms. Wicomb follows Faulkner and certainly echoes her black countryman Njabulo Ndebele, who (in his recent collection, Fools and Other Stories) wrote: 'Our literature ought to seek to move away from an easy preoccupation with demonstrating the obvious existence of oppression. It exists. The task is to explore how and why people can survive under such harsh conditions.' ... Ms. Wicomb's prose is vigorous, textured, lyrical.... This is a sophisticated storyteller who combines the open-endedness of contemporary fiction with the force of autobiography and the simplicity of family stories.\\"Bharati Mukherjee, \\"They Never Wanted To Be Themselves\\", The New York Times, 24 May 1987.

Origins The site chosen for the greyhound track in 1947 was to the north of Huntingdon in a small village called Sapley. It was constructed south of the Kings Ripton Road adjacent to the west side of Sapley Road (originally Sapley Lane). Opening The circumference of the track was a small 380 yards and was described as a tight circuit with a maximum capacity of just 500 spectators. Originally running race distances over 260 & 460 yards the first Proprietor & Racing Manager was B.Morehen who resided at Phylbern Kennels in the nearby village of Graveley. Initial trials were arranged for September 1947 with the opening meeting being held on Saturday 20 September 1947 at 3pm. History The stadium traded as an independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) track. Morehen conducted his own rules that included all greyhounds having to have a trial within eight race meetings and should a greyhound find too much time the race would be voided and re-run without the offending greyhound. During the 1960s Monday and Friday night racing took place on an all-grass track with distances of 330, 440 and 710 yards behind an 'Inside Sumner' hare. By 1980 Friday night racing had changed to Thursday night racing and regular open races featured events called the Hunt Cup, Derby, Cambridgeshire, St Leger & Cesarewitch (not the official National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) licensed races). The NGRC offered the chance for independent tracks to join a new permit scheme in the early 1970s but only six tracks decided to take the option because of the added costs and legislation involved. However the permit scheme remained open and on 10 July 1984 Huntingdon joined. One of the requirements was the building of 64 on site racing kennels and the Racing Manager under NGRC rules was Mrs S.Johnston. In April 1986 the permit licence was withdrawn by the NGRC for failure to adhere to their rules (mainly concerning unlicensed staff) but the track continued to trade as an independent under owners Alan Chalkley, C Reeves & P Curtis. Race nights consisted of Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday evenings and distances were 70, 245, 410, 585 and 750 metres. Closure The stadium closed on 18 May 1993 becoming part of the recreation ground and then a housing estate on Burnett Way & Lamport Drive.

The elected speaker was Sir Thomas Richardson, the Member of Parliament for St Albans. After the disappointment of the 1614 Addled Parliament King James had attempted to rule without a Parliament, but was obliged by events in continental Europe to summon a third Parliament. His son- in-law Frederick V, Elector Palatine had accepted the throne of Bohemia and triggered an invasion by Spanish forces and James needed additional funds if he were to intervene on his son-in-law's behalf. To his relief Parliament voted him the additional subsidies and then moved on to investigate the abuse of monopolies and reform the Court of Chancery. During their investigations the Commons discovered that the Lord Chancellor, Sir Francis Bacon, the Viscount St Albans, had been taking bribes, resulting in him being dismissed from his office, fined and imprisoned. Other investigations into monopoly abuse revealed that a royal favourite George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham and his associates were deeply involved, including Sir Giles Mompesson, who was stripped of his parliamentary seat and knighthood, and Buckingham‚Äôs half- brother Sir Edward Villiers. King James reacted by threatening to dissolve the Parliament in June 1621 but relented and allowed it to continue after the summer recess. When Parliament reassembled James demanded further subsidies and Parliament reluctantly acceded to his demand on condition that they should be allowed to finish their other business and also suggested that his son Prince Charles should seek a Protestant wife rather than the Spanish match James had in mind. James furiously asserted that Royal marriages were nothing to do with Parliament, who in return drew up a Protestation affirming their right to free speech, as a result of which James adjourned the sitting and ordered the arrest of the Protestation's principal author Sir Edward Coke. Further arrests followed and James downgraded the Parliament to a convention (i.e. a Parliament without royal approval) and finally dissolved it by Proclamation on 6 January 1622.

As a lightweight, he also won a gold medal in boxing in 1899. Athletic career Billy Christmas was the third of eight sons born to Thomas Henry \\"Harry\\" Christmas and Jane \\"Jennie\\" Christmas (n√©e McCaughey). Christmas began his athletic career with the Westmount Lacrosse Club in the City and Suburban Junior League. Christmas soon graduated to the intermediate and senior teams of the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association (MAAA), nicknamed the Winged Wheelers for their unique logo that would later be adopted by the Detroit Red Wings. With the MAAA, Christmas played for two teams: the Montreal Hockey Club and the Montreal Lacrosse Club. He also played halfback for the Britannia Football Club. In 1899 the MAAA sponsored the Amateur Boxing Championships of Canada. Christmas entered the competition as a lightweight. On April 24 he defeated Ben Haynes in the semifinals. Then two nights later he defeated Ed Outlet for the title. During the 1899-1900 season of the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL), Christmas was the top scorer for the Winged Wheelers and the league's third leading scorer posting 12 goals in 8 games. The only hockey players to outscore Christmas were two of his friends‚ÄìHarry Trihey of the Montreal Shamrocks and Russell Bowie of the Montreal Victorias, both future Hockey Hall of Fame members. Family life In 1902 Christmas was expected to captain the Britannia Football Team. Instead, he met and fell in love with Ellen \\"Hattie\\" Harriet Turk. Though admiring Billy's athleticism, Hattie did not want him to get hurt. As a result, she convinced him to retire from contact sports. They would subsequently marry at Owen Sound, Ontario in 1905. Billy and Hattie Christmas had four children. Their elder daughter Doris died of a brain tumor at age fifteen. Hattie Christmas died at age 51 from breast cancer. Later life and death Using his business and medical connections, Christmas worked to develop a group hospitalization scheme, whereby the poor and middle class could receive health care.Montreal Daily Star, March 26, 1941. Before he could get the project off the ground, however, Christmas, age 62, died of a massive heart attack. Three days after his death, fellow MAAA member Percy Roberts said Christmas \\"was the greatest exponent of Canadian sport: rugby, hockey and lacrosse of his time.\\"Montreal Daily Star, March 28, 1941 In 2015, Christmas was inducted into the Canada's Sports Hall of Fame as an Honoured Member.http://www.sportshall.ca/hall-of-famers/hall-of-famers- search.html?proID=557&catID;=all‚ü®=EN References Category:1879 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Canadian ice hockey players Category:Canadian lacrosse players Category:Players of Canadian football from Quebec Category:Canadian male boxers Category:Ice hockey people from Quebec Category:Sportspeople from Montreal Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:Mount Royal Cemetery burials Category:Lightweight boxers ","title":"Billy Christmas"},{"id":"52095310","text":"Azas Plateau is a volcanic field in Russia. It is also known as East Tuva Plateau, Khamsara-Biykhem Plateau and Northeast Tuva Plateau. It covers a surface area of west of Lake Baikal. Volcanic activity in the area also occurred at the Oka Plateau and the Jom-Bolok volcanic field. The field is formed by a late Pliocene lava plateau. Several volcanoes formed under the influence of ice and are constructed by lava flows and hyaloclastite, these are so-called tuyas which form by eruptions of volcanoes into ice. Ice meltwater floods may have accompanied this activity. The youngest dated volcanic centre was active 48,000 ¬± 20,000 years ago, but some lava flows may be even younger.  Geography  The field is located in southern Siberia, between the East Sayan Mountains and the Todzha basin. There it covers a surface area of west of Lake Baikal, at an altitude of . Volcanic landforms include cones, lava fields, tuyas, and other volcanic structures including scoria cones, volcanic dykes, volcanic necks and volcanic vents. Other landforms are cirques and U-shaped valleys left by previous glaciations. The Bii Khem river, a tributary of the Yenisei River, crosses the field. Politically the field belongs to the Tuva Republic of Russia, and is in a remote area where access is difficult. The volcanoes were first described between 1850‚Äì1900.  Geological context  It is part of the Tuva volcanic province of the Baikal Rift Zone, which is linked to a hotspot that has raised the terrain as high as . Activity in the rift zone started in the Oligocene and reached its maximum during the Miocene. Together with the Oka Plateau, the Azas Plateau forms the East Sayan province of the Baikal Rift Zone. Activity in the Azas Plateau has been influenced by a tectonic graben in the area. The Azas Plateau is the largest lava field in the Tuva volcanic province. The Jom- Bolok volcanic field may be related to the Azas Plateau.  Geomorphology  A large lava field with thicknesses of formed during the Late Pliocene, when the largest eruptions took place. These flows reached a thickness of approximately . Nine volcanoes bearing evidence of having formed beneath ice are found in the southeastern part of the field. Volcanoes on the plateau are about high and have the form of tables. Ash cones formed on the individual edifices. The lava flows on the table-shaped volcanoes also display rounded hollows. Many volcanoes appear to be part of a lineament. Volcanism may be influenced by strike-slip faults associated with the Jom-Bolok fault. Individual volcanoes in the Azas Plateau volcanic field include the Derbi-Taiga tuya (), which is formed by several layers of hyaloclastite and lava flows and displays a prominent \\"winged\\" topography. The hyaloclastite layers were formerly considered to be tuffs and reach thicknesses of . Pillow lavas also exist. A system of ancient valleys formed by floods are found near to Derbi-Taiga. Ulug-Arginskii () is a cone that formed exposed in the air. The cone is accompanied by a maar with a lake to the south, and a lava flow from the cone reached in length. Shivit-Taiga with a length of over and a height of is among the biggest volcanoes in the world that formed beneath ice, but Derby-Taiga may be even larger depending on how the size is measured. Shivit-Taiga covers a surface of and is high. This edifice is a stratovolcano and it features two craters with diameters of and . Lava lakes formed in two craters on the volcano. Shivit-Taiga too is accompanied by a topography that indicates that ancient floods passed there. Kokhemskii is and was affected by glacial erosion. Sorug-Chushku-Uzu north of Shivit-Taiga is high. Some volcanoes have been affected by landsliding, gully formation and glaciation after their formation. Likewise, the field has been affected by erosion, forming deep valleys with glacier deposits.  Effects of glaciation  The Azas Plateau was affected by an ice sheet which formed on the East Sayan mountains during the Pleistocene. When volcanoes erupt into ice, the ice melts and volcanic structures named tuyas can form in meltwater lakes. Runny lavas can form such edifices, which tend to have steep slopes, only when trapped within ice. During tuya activity, the subaqueous activity forms hyaloclastite and when the activity occurs in the air lava flows are formed, including lava deltas. Some of the tuyas in the Azas Plateau may have formed through complex eruptive processes. Based on the tuyas of the Tuvan field, it has been determined that ice thicknesses in the area exceeded and that at least three different ice ages occurred in the field. The tuyas in the Azas plateau have been compared to volcanic edifices in the Valles Marineris on Mars. Non-tuya volcanic ice interaction landforms are also found, such as Albine-Bondok, Charash-Dag and Sagan which are subglacial mounds. Glaciation was already in progress under marine isotope stage 5 (127,000 - 71,000 years ago) and by the stage 4 (71,000 - 57,000 years ago) it was continuous over the Azas Plateau. Glacier retreat was underway by the isotope stage 3 (57,000 - 24,000 years ago), when some volcanoes formed in the air.  Composition  Volcanism is overall basaltic, volcanic rocks erupted by the Azas Plateau include basalt and trachybasalt. Other volcanoes in the Baikal Rift Zone have erupted the same rocks. These rocks are alkaline and their texture is aphyric. Minerals contained in the rocks include augite, clinopyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, -containing magnetite and nepheline in the more alkaline rocks. The total volume of volcanic rocks is about . Hematite is present in the rocks and gives many tuyas a red colour. Based on geochemistry, the magma formed at depths of . Volcaniclastic rocks were originally considered to be tuffs. Cumulates and xenoliths from the mantle have been found at some volcanoes.  Chronology  Volcanic activity in the Azas Plateau commenced during the Late Pliocene. Activity continued into the Holocene. Before volcanism of the Azas Plateau started, volcanism occurred in the Oka plateau. The Azas trough formed in the Miocene-Pliocene. The first volcanic activity beginning 2 million years ago formed voluminous lava flows from fissure vents. Later the activity focused on deep seated lineaments. Volcanic activity between 1.65 - 1.75 mya occurred beneath ice in the ancient valleys of the Bii Khem river. In the middle-late Pleistocene volcanism occurred in the southeastern parts of the field. Some dates obtained on edifices in the Azas Plateau are 725,000 ¬± 50,000 - 760,000 ¬± 50,000 years for Derbi-Taiga, 600,000 - 560,000 years for Kadyr-Sugskii, 600,000 - 290,000 for some volcanoes surrounding Derbi-Taiga, 350,000 - 290,000 for Yurdawa between Derbi-Taiga and Shivit-Taiga, 225,000 ¬± 50,000 for Ploskii, 150,000 ¬± 50,000 for Kokhemskii, 130,000 ¬± 40,000 - 110,000 ¬± 000 for Shivit-Taiga, 75,000 ¬± 40,000 for Priozernyi, 60,000 ¬± 40,000 for Sorug- Chushku-Uzu and 48,000 ¬± 20,000 for Ulug-Arginskii. Some lava flows in the Bii-Khem valley are even younger than the Ulug-Arginskii volcano. It is possible that when eruptions in the Azas Plateau occurred beneath ice, they caused floods of glacial meltwater called Jokulhlaup; corresponding landforms have been found at Derbi-Taiga and Shivit-Taiga volcanoes.

The discourse, models, and styles of communication in planning are adapted to the various local conditions of each community such that planning approaches from one part of the world are not necessarily transferable to other parts of the globe. Planning culture can refer to how planning professionals undertake their practice in a given location, where they are \\"affected by both individual and collectively shared cognitive frames\\" that shape their view of the world. Planners, as stated by Simone Abram, are \\"constantly in the process of actually producing culture\\". The concept of planning culture also encompasses how planning actually unfolds within a community, as shaped by its culture and influenced by its people. Differing cultural contexts produce different planning and policy responses to issues \\"bound to specific local (cultural) contexts\\". Examples of planning cultures include those specific to different countries, regions, and parts of the globe, as well as differing cultures that exist within the same location, such as indigenous planning cultures. In general, planning cultures evolved throughout the 20th century from a state- centred attempt at city beautification toward a more collaborative process involving the public. This differs depending on local culture; however, as planning in some locations has remained a top-down process where plans are prescribed by senior government (for example, in China). Planning culture requires treatment of different local circumstances and as such, varies around the world. In Canada, planning culture has evolved from its roots influenced by town planning in Great Britain to become a values-based political process that promotes public involvement in an attempt to give agency to various groups, although social inequalities and colonial legacies are still largely present. Indigenous planning culture, which has evolved over hundreds to thousands of years, is another distinct planning culture, within which exists distinct, fluid, and evolving planning cultures that are unique to land, history, and peoples. Today, the reclamation of Indigenous planning cultures has planning in many countries exploring how non-Indigenous and Indigenous planners can work collaboratively toward a reconciliatory, culturally- responsive, and respectful process. Planning cultures operate within the institutions of their locations. As such, planning cultures play out within the institutional spheres of society, spheres which are consistently evolving and changing in a dynamic response to cultural stimuli. Educational institutions across the world differ in their approach to planning, contributing toward the formation of distinct planning cultures and demonstrating transformations within planning cultures through changing subject matter and emphases.  Development of planning cultures  Planning cultures evolved alongside processes of industrialization and the advancement of societies. Prior to World War II, planning was considered a city beautification movement proposed by architects and politicians. In Europe, with industrialization, planning was conceived as an attempt to provide city leaders with a framework to develop new neighbourhoods and towns outside of the urban core. After World War II, planning expanded from beautification to include many social elements such as economy, history, religion, and public policy. It became understood that such social factors influence how urban infrastructure develops. Increasingly, planning cultures are involving the general public throughout the planning process. The formative years for planning cultures were the 1940s and 1950s, during a global period of rebuilding after World War II. Planning cultures emerged from planning practices as the public became increasingly aware of the impacts of planning. During this period, planners also started to take into consideration the impacts of planning practices on the public. Efforts began to shift from building functional and aesthetic architecture, to analytical and rational development approaches for resolving issues faced by a city or region. The planning culture in many countries has shifted from a design-centric practice led by a small group of professionals to a much broader social activity involving the general public throughout the process. Starting in the 1960s, the traditional ‚Äútop-down‚Äù and ‚Äústate-centered‚Äù planning paradigm was criticized as being static and unresponsive in dealing with complex issues in local level. Accordingly, planning practice in many industrialized nations began to shift towards a more ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù and ‚Äúpeople-centered‚Äù process. During this transitional period, planning evolved from its original object of providing solutions for specific issues to a more comprehensive goal of addressing socioeconomic challenges. This was an attempt to explore more efficient, flexible, and accountable options for complex problems. As planning culture in industrialized states became more inclusive and aware of issues related to the environment, social equality, multiculturalism, and other non- spatial issues, planners felt it necessary to reflect upon their professional views in order to engage with general public and to search common ground across public in different background and interest groups During the same period, some developing countries maintained their ‚Äútop-down‚Äù paradigm in planning, such as China, Cuba, and Iran, where planning still followed comprehensive national strategies. Since the 1980s, planning practices in those and other developing counties have begun to take different directions.  Comparing international planning cultures  Planning processes and results are highly subject to political influences and institutional structures, which vary significantly around the world. The process of planning involves many stakeholders, although primarily, it is overseen and approved by governments. As such, the largest influences on planning culture are the variables of: constitutional government structures (unitary states, federal states, multinational states), economic structure (market economies, those in transition from command economies), the pace of urban population growth, political culture (involvement of civil society, role of media, competitiveness among parties, openness of political process), and the level of economic development. In all cases, planning institutions are constantly evolving themselves to adapt to new needs and changes. One such broad shift is the embracing of market-led development, where planning institutions now facilitate market forces in an entrepreneurial fashion instead of restraining them. Several examples of planning cultures are presented below, in alphabetical order by country name.  Planning culture in Canada  Regional districts in the province of British Columbia are one example of a regional scale at which some planning processes are undertaken in Canada. Planning culture in Canada is inherently value-laden, and cultural and moral values are important aspects of this practice. Canadian planning culture has been influenced by the planning practices of Great Britain, who partly settled Canada, and by the United States, Canada's neighbour to the South. The culture of planning in Canada has retained its unique identity by focusing on community planning, while Great Britain focuses on town planning, and the United States on urban planning. Canada's legacy as a sparsely populated nation has led to a planning culture that centres on regional planning as a way of tackling disparities between rural and urban areas. The conflict of Canada's regional planning culture lies in the fact that a region can be defined in many different ways. For example, a region could be a large area centred around an urban area, a watershed area, or as an area based on the valley section between mountains. Combined with the regional approach to planning, the diverse and multicultural nature of the Canadian population has led to some challenges in the way that planning is conducted in Canada. Jill Grant explains that a potential solution to these conflicts that has been adopted by Canadian planners is a planning culture where the professional works proactively to anticipate conflicts and mitigate them before they reach a tipping point. This flexible and proactive approach is useful in Canadian planning culture because it helps balance the needs of different groups living, an often very diverse geographic, political, and social, region to come to positive solutions. Planning practice is influenced by politics, and in Canada social justice has been incorporated into progressive planning cultures since the 1960s. Social justice in planning has focused on enabling typically under-resourced groups, such as the poor. The legacy of planning in Canada as a form of social justice has permeated to planning schools, including the School of Community and Regional Planning at the University of British Columbia, where agency, democratization, and sustainability are declared to be important values of the curriculum. Participatory planning culture in Canada is in part inspired by Porto Alegre's participatory budget, which has led to a culture of consensus-building, collaboration, and community agency. Canada's planning culture is rife with colonial legacies and inequalities and this is not forgotten in today's planning culture. Today, planning culture in Canada has evolved to a values-based practice embedded within the political realm that attempts to give agency to various groups by promoting collaboration and conflict resolution.  Planning culture in China  Traffic in Shanghai, China. It is divided into two roads, one serving each direction. In China, planning activities and planning bureaucracies have expanded significantly in recent decades, with over 60,000 practicing planners in what is now a well-reputed profession. Local development and land use decisions are guided by socio-economic plans developed by senior governments, which in turn are aligned with national 5-year plans. The Ministry of Land and Resources is a vertically-integrated organization with branches in every major city that oversees the allocation of land uses and coordinates major projects along with the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. This is indicative of planning culture in China, which is characterized by centralization of decision making: for example, Civic Mayors are appointed by higher levels of government. Planning is largely seen as a responsibility of government, with little involvement from civil society. Citizens who take issue with planning decisions may sue the local government, file a petition, or engage in a public demonstration; however, these actions are largely futile. As a result, planners have significant latitude to implement their ideas without inhibition.  Planning culture in India  Relative to China, planning culture in India is characterized by jurisdictional and administrative autonomy. The civil service in charge of planning is accountable to, yet separate from, the political sphere. Five-year national economic plans guide the direction of development and land use planning at the state and municipal level. With the quadrupling of urban populations over the past 50 years, planning is challenged to keep up with such rapid urbanization. As a result, civil society is still finding its role in balancing planning actors with increasing influence for historically marginalized groups. While planning in India is seen as a vehicle by which to organize and bring significant benefits to society, the planning culture is marred by a socio- economic disconnect between planners and the populations they serve, a highly bureaucratic administration, and the continued marginalization of vast swathes of the urban poor who often live without land rights.  Planning culture in Japan  In Japan, planning was a large part of the dynastic society throughout the known recent history of Japan. During successive heredity an Emperor or the appointed Shogun had the authority to provide centralized planning for the areas of the country under their control. Individual provinces would report to the authority and power of the central government. After the Meiji Restoration the government developed separated functions and planning functions largely centralized on a regional basis. During the 1990s, local governments were empowered to begin producing urban development Master Plans to guide long-term changes in their jurisdictions. While municipalities were still tied financially to the central government, this change in planning was seen as a major innovation, and one that created a planning culture with increased opportunities for localized public participation.  Planning culture in Russia  In Russia, prior to the late 1980s, planning was highly centralized and plans were not publicly available. 30-year plans and designs for most areas were produced in government institutes in the largest cities, far removed from the realities where they were to be applied. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, local governments were rapidly given increased planning responsibility, but did not yet have the tools and structure in place to effectively regulate land use. Significant political, societal, and economic changes in that period of transition further complicated the challenges faced by local planning authorities. Attention was given to addressing these immediate needs, and less to the long-range planning tasks of the Soviet era.  Planning culture in South Africa  A road sign in South Africa In sub-Saharan Africa, including the country of South Africa, urban growth rates remain some of the highest in the world. A severe lack of institutional capacity and financial resources characterizes the context of planning challenges in sub-Saharan states. The planning culture is characterized by a process that focuses in the areas inhabited by urban elites, while the vast majority of urban populations live in informal and squatter settlements, which are technically illegal and beyond the official realm of planning jurisdiction. However, local and national authorities are increasingly directing attention to such settlements, and, combined with foreign financial support, are improving basic infrastructure needs. The precarious nature of these unofficial residential lands limits the ability of residents to obtain services and raise issues with local planning administrations, further maintaining their marginalization. Enforcement of regulations, public participation, and plan execution are notably weak, while nepotism is strong, resulting in much urban development taking place outside of official planning processes. Studies of planning culture have tended to focus on national scales for comparative analysis; however, a need has been identified to focus on the contextual factors that differentiate planning cultures at the local level. Further research is also needed to understand the underlying forces that affect the core values of planning cultures; while \\"planning artifacts\\", such as institutional planning structures, are evident and can be easily compared, intangible aspects of the \\"social environment\\" require more thorough examination.  Indigenous planning cultures  Indigenous planning culture is an approach to planning that is both by and for indigenous peoples and is a practice that has evolved over hundreds to thousands of years. Its cultural practice is defined by the sets of traditional knowledges, customs, practices, and cultural identities that are unique to the approximately 350 Indigenous peoples worldwide. Indigenous world views ground Indigenous planning cultures, that have evolved and been sustained through time. Indigenous Planning is defined by Dr. Theodore (Ted) Jojola as, \\"both an approach to community planning and an ideological movement. What distinguishes indigenous planning from mainstream practice is its reformulation of planning approaches in a manner that incorporates 'traditional' knowledge and cultural identity. Key to the process is the acknowledgement of an indigenous world-view, which not only serves to unite it philosophically, but also to distinguish it from neighbouring, non land-based communities.\\" Many scholars, practitioners, and community leaders see Indigenous planning as a cultural practice of reclaiming traditional and reformulating mainstream planning approaches that are respectful, responsive to, and owned by Indigenous communities.  Planning cultures in transition: institutional transformation  According to Sanyal, (p.xxi) \\"planning cultures are cultures of planning practice. They are the collective ethos and dominant attitudes of professional planners toward the appropriate roles of the state, market forces, and civil society in urban, regional, and national development.\\" As Reimer notes, this ethos refers to the \\"basic ideas, traditions, and values of planning professionals.\\" Reimer further suggests that planning cultures are \\"complex and multi-dimensional institutional matrices comprising formal and informal institutional spheres that need to adapt to ever-changing external and internal circumstances.\\" In this context, planning cultures operate in an institutional setting and any evolution of a planning culture must contend with a \\"persisting institutional stability\\". Reimer evaluates planning cultures as \\"an analytical concept (and not as a normative paradigm in theory and practice).\\" Planning is embedded and operates in specific cultural contexts, subject to changing planning cultures. This change can be seen as it plays out in institutional spheres, a form of social transformation. Institutional change can be theorized as a process comprising six stages: equilibrium, shock event, deinstitutionalization, preinstitutionalization, theorization, diffusion, and reinstitutionalization.Greenwood, R.; Suddaby, R.; Hinings, C.R. Theorizing change: The role of professional associations in the transformation of institutionalized fields. Acad. Manage. J. 2002, 1, 58‚Äì80. Transitions in planning cultures can also be seen in the style and focus of education programs for new planners. Traditionally, planning was closely aligned with architecture and engineering; this is evidenced in planning programs in continental Europe, which emphasize urban design and land use planning. In North America, the United Kingdom, and select European countries, the breadth of planning subject matter in education has expanded and directs more attention to environmental sustainability and social justice, while also focusing on built form and land regulation. Planning programs are evolving to train planners to be more creative, innovative, and collaborative. Such skills are essential to meet the increasing challenges faced by planning, for which traditional methods will not suffice. In unprecedented, uncertain, and unstable times, adaptation of planning cultures is seen as key to their efficacy. The foundation of Anglo-American planning values has long been guided by a yearning to implement utopian ideals.

The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2018. It was released on July 20, 2018, by Amazon Studios. Plot In the not-too-distant future, the most cutting-edge technology has honed romantic relationships down to a science: A computerized test can determine the likelihood of successful partnership between two individuals, and androids‚Äîknown as ‚Äúsynthetics‚Äù‚Äîhave been designed as the ideal partners, ones who are completely understanding and will never leave. Zoe (L√©a Seydoux) and Cole (Ewan McGregor) work in the research facility responsible for developing this technology. Zoe and Cole are friends but Zoe harbors a crush on him, and is disappointed when she takes the compatibility test and finds out they have a 0% compatibility. When she tells Cole this information, he gently tells her that the fundamental incompatibility between them is that she is a synthetic. Synthetics had always been programmed to know they were synthetics, but Zoe was a new model and an experiment to see if a synthetic could pass as a human. Although Zoe has been implanted with false memories that she believed were her own, it‚Äôs clear that Zoe is special, as she has developed her own feelings. Cole gently takes Zoe in the world with this new self-awareness, seeing her reactions to things, but also falling in love with her. He is wary of getting physical with her, but they eventually do. Zoe still feels like Cole is holding back. However, when Zoe gets hit by a car, ripping open her stomach and exposing her synthetic insides, it causes Cole to completely pull away from Zoe after he repairs her. Meanwhile, the AI company has shifted direction to releasing Benysol, a pill which gives the person taking it the feeling of being in love for several blissful hours. it‚Äôs a huge success, with people going to Benysol clubs and even hanging out in certain parks to meet partners they take it with. Cole and Zoe clearly miss each other, but they both take Benysol with multiple partners, which only leaves them feeling empty. Cole‚Äôs friends encourage him to be with Zoe, even though she‚Äôs synthetic, but he can‚Äôt do it. One day Zoe visits the AI lab and discovers a room full of Zoes, the next generation of her, Zoe 2.0. She realizes she doesn‚Äôt wish to live without Cole and visits the brothel where she asks the owner to shut her down. However, at the last minute she changes her mind and some of the brothel girls take her to her apartment, where Cole finds her and professes his love. She cries, which her model wasn‚Äôt supposed to be able to do.  Cast  *Ewan McGregor as Cole *L√©a Seydoux as Zoe *Christina Aguilera as Jewels *Theo James as Ash *Rashida Jones as Emma *Miranda Otto as The Designer *Matthew Gray Gubler as Michael  Production  On August 19, 2016, it was announced that Charlie Hunnam and L√©a Seydoux would star in the untitled sci-fi romance film, which Drake Doremus would direct from a script by Rich Greenberg who collaborated with Doremus on the Emmy winning web series The Beauty Inside. On October 25, 2016, Stuart Ford's IM Global came on board to fully finance the film, titled Zoe, with Scott Free Productions' Michael Pruss producing along with Doremus and Robert George.

She amassed a large wealth through corruption, including high-priced real estate. She was killed in the 1974 Nigerien coup d'√©tat. Biography Aissa Diori was born in Dogondoutchi in 1928. She came from the Foulani ethnic group. She married the teacher Hamani Diori on 9 May 1945.Salifou 2010, p. 29 The couple had six children, including Abdoulaye Hamani Diori who later became a politician and businessman. Aissa Diori was a patron of the Union of Women of Niger and had several artists, such as Bouli Kakasi, sing her praises. The Union of Women of Niger was founded on 6 October 1958. Under her leadership, the Union emphasized the participation of women in community projects, education, and job creation. It formed a network of women's organizations but was not able to influence legislation protecting women as wives and mothers.Decalo & Abdourahmane 2012, p. 451 The First Lady and her UFN, however, anchored the presence of women-specific concerns to the public, to which later feminist endeavors for political participation from the 1990s onwards took their root.Sheldon 2005, p. 250 Diori became First Lady of Niger on 3 August 1960 when her husband was inaugurated as President. In international geopolitics, A√Øssa Diori was part of almost all the official travels of the President. In the United States, she did not hesitate to lend her support to black school children that were victims of racial discrimination. While in Niger, she was concerned with the education of nomadic children, as she was not educated. She filled the role of Minister of Promotion of Women. Diori had amassed a considerable fortune through corruption. Diori owned many luxury houses in Niamey which she rented to foreign embassies and corporate executives at very high rates. She had also obtained a large amount of fertile land on the Niger River near Niamey. Many other members of the Nigerien Progressive Party- African Democratic Rally elite were also profiteering, but not as much as Aissa Diori.Fuglestad & Higgott 1975, p. 390 As a result, she was called the Austrian (referring to the French queen Marie Antoinette) by radical students, who reviled her.Decalo & Abdourahmane 2012, p. 181 She was shot and killed in the 1974 Nigerien coup d'√©tat on 15 April 1974 by Sergeant Niandou Hamidou.Salifou 2010, p. 248 Her Tuareg guards also died in the coup, the only casualties in a largely bloodless affair that led to the dissolution of her husband's government.Fuglestad & Higgott 1975, p. 397 Succeeding her as First Lady was Mintou Kountche, who also acquired a reputation for greed and corruption.

The stadium became the third stadium to race greyhounds in Leeds after Elland Road Greyhound Stadium and Fullerton Park although the latter by now was only running speedway. Opening Racing started on 12 December 1932 under the promotion of Parkside Stadium Ltd who chose to affiliate themselves with the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS), an organisation formed to assist tracks wishing to race under regulations and a rival to the larger National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC). The main stand was situated on the north side with the paddock located on the Old Run Road where the Great Northern Railway (Hunslet branch) passed over the road. History When the BGTCS disbanded in 1935 the track remained independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) so as to appeal to a different clientele including owner trainers. Facilities remained basic with covered stands and a licensed club with car parking available. Race distances included 290 and 429 yards mainly over handicaps. After the war the track raced every Wednesday and Saturday evening with trams number 12 & 26 stopping outside of the entrance gates.

She was portrayed by Meg Wynn Owen. On 15 April 1912 Richard hires Hazel Forrest to type the biography of his father-in-law, the old Earl of Southwold, which he is writing. She is a middle class young woman who has been earning a living as a secretary for ten years, against her parents' wishes. This character gives the viewer a rare view of the interior of her parents' middle class home, one of the few locations other than the Bellamys' home. James is immediately attracted to her. Miss Forrest - imdb.com Miss Forrest - Updown.org.uk The class divide between James and Hazel causes early conflicts with Hazel's parents, the Bellamys' staff and in the marriage. After about seven months of courting, James proposes in November, but Hazel tearfully refuses him. She does not tell him that she was married before to a violent alcoholic named Patrick O'Connor. Hazel's sad past is now the Forrest's family secret. This leads Hazel's father, Arthur Forrest, to visit James and reveal the family secret. He explains that Hazel was previously married to a drunkard, Patrick O'Connor, who beat her. They divorced and Hazel moved back in with her parents. Mr. Forrest wants his daughter to be happy, while the prickly Mrs. Forrest is sure the Bellamys would never accept Hazel as a divorced woman (there being such a stigma against divorce in 1912). James asks Hazel again, and after talking, during which he informs Hazel that his own sister Elizabeth divorced and remarried, she accepts his second proposal. They marry in late 1912 or early 1913, and honeymoon in Paris. A Family Secret - imdb.com A Family Secret - Updown.org.uk James and Hazel Bellamy are going for a weekend hunting party to Somerby Park in 1913, the country house of James' school- friend Lord \\"Bunny\\" Newbury. The other guests encourage her to surprise James and join the hunt, something she has never done before. Diana Newberry, a childhood friend and love interest of James Bellamy, is jealous and contemptuous of James' middle class wife. Diana secretly switches the horses and gives Hazel a spirited mount. The horse bolts and runs away with Hazel. She is nearly killed. She and James then argue, as he feels humiliated. This, in addition to Major Cochrane-Danby claiming that James and Diana are sleeping together, leads Hazel to flee Somerby with Rose. James follows her back to London and they soon make up.The bolter - imdb.comThe bolter - updown.org.uk The tea party that was arranged by Hazel and Lady Prudence in Home Fires takes place in the Morning Room of 165 Eaton Place, and only three officers are there, along with Lady Berkhamstead and Mrs Vowles. Hazel befriends a shy, young airman called Jack Dyson, who, like her, has risen from the middle class. They soon start going out with each other. They go boating, see a show and go dancing, where they kiss passionately. The day before he goes back to the Front, Dyson goes to Eaton Place to say goodbye, but Hazel is out at the canteen. He then writes her a note, calling her his \\"only girl in the World\\". In the episode The Glorious Dead Rose gets a letter from Captain Peter Graham, Gregory's company commander telling her that her fianc√© has been killed. Hazel comforts Rose and tells her that she know what she is feeling, because she read in the newspaper that Lt. Jack Dyson MC had been killed in an aerial battle: \\"One grief-stricken woman urges another to be strong and to seek comfort in prayer. Ultimately, Hazel tells Rose ‚Äì and herself ‚Äì that time will help accommodate bereavement and loss.\\"Upstairs, Downstairs Season Four James Bellamy comes home on leave. When he opens a drawer he sees the letters from Jack Dyson and photo of him, but he closes the drawer and says nothing. It is November 1918 and James and Hazel argue.

He attended segregated public schools, graduating from Waverly High School on the day of the Battle of Midway, and began studies at the Virginia Military Institute in 1942. He left VMI in 1944 to join the U.S. Navy as an ensign, and served on a minesweeper in the South Pacific until his discharge in 1946. He then returned to VMI and received his bachelor's degree in 1948.The General Assembly of Virginia, 1962‚Äì1981 (Richmond, 1982), p. 207 In 1990, he received an honorary degree from his alma mater. He married Pamela Spencer Burnside, and they had two sons (Bruce Burnside Gray and Garland Gray II) and a daughter (Kathryn Taylor Gray). Career Upon returning from World War II and graduating from VMI, Gray joined his father in the family lumber business, Gray Lumber Company, based in Waverly. He became its president in 1953, and in the following decades expanded its operations into real estate development in the Richmond suburbs. In 1992, as he retired from his part-time position in the Virginia Senate as described below, Gray Land & Timber Company sold substantial portions of the remaining timberland, and exchanged them for apartment rental properties, becoming GrayCo (which Elmon Gray headed until his death). He was also active with the Virginia Forestry Association (president 1969‚Äì71), the Reforestation Advisory Committee (1971) and the Ruritans. Gray also served on several board of directors, including on the Bank of Waverly, James River Bankshares, First and Merchants National Bank, Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO), and Universal Leaf Tobacco Company. Gray also invested in his passion, thoroughbred horseracing. Although Virginia approved pari-mutual racing in 1988, he and his consortium of investors were unable to secure regulatory approvals for a horse track in Hampton Roads. Active in philanthropic causes, Gray especially favored those with educational missions. He served on the VMI Board of Visitors from 1956 (and as President from 1964‚Äì66), as well as with the Sussex County School Board (1963‚Äì72), John Tyler Community College (1965‚Äì72), the University of Richmond (Board of Trustees 1969‚Äì73) and Elon University (Board of Trustees 1990‚Äì1999). He also served on the vestry of his local Episcopal Church (having been converted from his grandmother's Congregational Church to Christ Episcopal Church Waverly by his wife) and was a Mason.1995 legislative bio Gray also helped raise money for the Boy Scouts of America, Virginia Historical Society, Appomattox Regional Governor's School for the Arts and Technology, Stuart Hall, the National D-Day Memorial at Bedford and the Southeast 4-H Center in Wakefield. In 1971, his father decided to retire from his part-time Senatorial seat, as his longtime Southside district underwent a major reorganization after the 1970 census and a federal court order consolidating Norfolk and Virginia Beach senatorial districts into one three- member district in 1971. Elmon Gray succeeded to much of his father's 6th Senatorial District, now renumbered the 16th Senatorial District, and encompassing Price George, Surry, Sussex Counties and the cities of Colonial Heights, Hopewell and Petersburg.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia 1962-1981 (Richmond 1983) pp. 112, 116 Re-elected four times, Gray served five four-year terms.Cynthia Miller Leonard, General Assembly of Virginia 1619‚Äì1978 (Richmond: Library of Virginia, 1978) pp. 733, 744‚Äì745 In the Senate, Gray led efforts to improve higher education, and also thwarted efforts to curb abortion rights. He also led efforts to establish Martin Luther King's birthday as a state holiday, and protected the Southside economy, including truckers and gasoline retailers. Gray advocated a bridge across the James River to replace the Jamestown Ferry but the bridge was vehemently opposed by residents of a nearby upscale waterfront residential community as well as historic preservationists who were concerned that a bridge would adversely affect the historical, environmental and visual characteristics of the Jamestown area. The plan was ultimately defeated when the Commonwealth Transportation Board unanimously killed plans for the span. Gray announced his retirement from the Senate upon receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis, and expecting major redistricting following the 1990 census (which also affected his friend and fellow Senator Howard P. Anderson of Halifax). Shortly before retiring from the Senate, Gray helped persuade Sussex officials to consider allowing a large regional landfill to open in the county as a revenue-raising opportunity. Gray then sold 700 acres of his timberland at $4,415 an acre, for a total of $3.1 million for the site of the landfill, which drew the ire of many of his constituents who didn't want this massive garbage dump in their backyard. At a public hearing in 1991 on the proposed landfill, more than 700 people showed up at the Sussex County courthouse to oppose the landfill. Gray, the largest landowner in Sussex county, became increasingly unpopular in Waverly and Sussex due to his support of the mega- landfill. A local preacher stood in front of his congregation and referred to Gray as \\"the enemy\\" and landfill opponents compared him to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein at a protest against the garbage dump due his determination to open the landfill over the stiff opposition of local residents, and the totalitarian control they believed he had wielded over local government for decades based on his wealth. The Gray family's sawmill, land and timber holdings were estimated to be worth approximately $100 million in 1992. Even in political retirement, Gray continued to lobby for a Jamestown-Surry bridge, for new economic development in Sussex, and to keep women out of his alma mater, Virginia Military Institute. \\"I never thought that any self-respecting girl would want to go there\\", he said of VMI and the lawsuit that would have required the all-male, state-sponsored military school to admit women. \\"Thank God the first phase went in our favor, but this thing is a long way from over\\", Gray said in 1991, referring to the possibility of appeals of the court's decision against allowing women into the school. The lawsuit was ultimately appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court which ruled against VMI. After defying the Supreme Court order for three months, VMI's governing board ultimately voted 9 to 8 to admit women in 1996, transforming the nation's last single-sex state-supported school into a co-ed institution. After leaving the Senate, Gray moved from Waverly to a home overlooking the James River at Jordan Point in Prince George, and in his later years lived on Monument Avenue in Richmond. Gray survived his cancer diagnosis by two decades, his friend Sen. Anderson by more than a decade, and his beloved wife by nearly a year. Death and memorials He died on September 27, 2011, about two and a half years after receiving VMI's Harry F. Byrd Jr. Public service award in March 2009. His funeral was conducted by Rev. David Anderson, son of his late friend Sen. Howard Anderson. VMI has his papers, awards a scholarship in his name, and named its athletic stadium jointly after Gray and fellow alumnus Minor. At the time of his death he was a parishioner of Merchant's Hope Episcopal Church in Prince George.

Television images broadcast to the billions of people watching around the world show Nazzal frequently throughout the crisis, seemingly always smoking, wearing sunglasses, open neck red shirt and a cowboy hat, which led him to be identified as the 'Cowboy'. According to author Serge Groussard, Nazzal \\"liked to be called Guevara\\". Early life According to Abu Daoud, Nazzal was a young officer in the Al-'Asifah, the armed wing of Fatah, who towards the end of 1971 had been based in Nabatieh, Southern Lebanon, where he was involved in conducting operations across the border in Israel. Nazzal had fought in Amman in 1970 after Jordan's expulsion of the PLO, and in the battles of Jerash and Ajlun in July 1971. Described by Daoud as a \\"very good fighter\\", Nazzal had purportedly begged Abu Iyad to \\"organize something, somewhere\\" in retaliation against Israel after deadly Israeli air raids in Southern Lebanon. He moved to West Germany to study. According to Simon Reeve, Nazzal worked for a Munich oil company. Munich massacre=Days before the attack Nazzal is reported to have flown to Libya on the 11th or 12th of August for \\"intensive training\\" in preparation for the attack on the Israeli quarters. In the weeks prior to the attack, Nazzal, the leader of the attack Luttif Afif and Abu Daoud carried out reconnaissance of the Olympic Village by pretending to be Brazilian tourists, managing to gain access to the Olympic village, after Daoud had struck up a rapport with a guard stationed at one of the entrances, during previous visits to the Village. Abu Daoud claims that on this visit, Nazzal, Afif and himself, were able to get inside 31 Connollystra√üe after being accompanied by an unsuspecting Israeli female, which resulted in them attaining crucial information such as the layout of the building, how many athletes were in each apartment, and where they slept. Simon Reeve states that both Nazzal and Afif were able to gain temporary employment in the Olympic Village with Nazzal working as a cook. Afif and Nazzal would sit playing chess and observing the coming and goings of athletes in and around 31 Connollystra√üe in preparation for the attack on the Israeli quarters. Nazzal was found inside 31 Connollystra√üe apartments at 8:00am on the day prior to the attack, by Uruguayan official Luis Friedman. Reportedly, Nazzal shyly told Friedman, in English, that someone in the building occasionally gave him fruit, Friedman gave him all the fruit he could carry. The hostage crisis Whilst Afif was designated the leader, Nazzal would at times accompany him in deliberations with the German delegates in front of 31 Connollystra√üe. Whenever outside of the building, Nazzal was always armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a revolver in the waistband of his trousers. More often though, Nazzal could be seen at the window of the first floor apartment window, continuously smoking. F√ºrstenfeldbruck Upon landing at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base, Afif and Nazzal each left their Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters and walked slowly over to inspect the Lufthansa Boeing 727, parked just 150 metres away on the tarmac apron. Whilst Nazzal waited outside, Afif went inside to check the plane. Finding it empty, they immediately suspected a trap and jogged back towards the helicopters shouting warnings to the six fellow fedayeen guarding the two helicopters containing the Israeli athletes. As they ran, the area lit up and police commander George Wolf, lying next to the three marksmen on the roof of the control tower, instructed the marksmen to open fire. Two shots rang out from two of the three police marksmen on the tower, hitting two terrorists guarding the helicopters, Ahmed Chic Thaa and Afif Ahmed Hamid both fell to the ground, though only one was killed outright. A third marksmen moved around a corner pillar on the tower in order to keep both Afif and Nazzal in sight as they were still running back to the helicopters. His first shot hit the tarmac near Issa (Luttif Afif) who steadied himself and managed to make it back to the safety of the helicopters by zigzagging across the tarmac. The marksmen's second shot hit Nazzal in the leg, making him collapse on the tarmac. One of his fellow fedayeen, eighteen year old Jamal Al-Gashey, managed to crawl over to Nazzal during firefight and was shot through the wrist which according to Al-Gashey made his weapon \\"fly out of my hand.\\" Despite being wounded in the opening exchange of gunfire at F√ºrstenfeldbruck and after a two-hour exchange with the German marksmen, Nazzal managed to escape across the airfield to a parking lot pursued by police, dogs and West German border guards. Nazzal managed to elude police for another hour before being cornered and shot dead around 1:30 am, though not before shooting a West German border guard in the neck. Aftermath of Munich The bodies of Nazzal and his four compatriots were handed over to Libya and after a procession of 30,000 people from Tripoli's Martyrs' Square, were buried in the Sidi Munaidess Cemetery. . In popular culture Nazzal has been portrayed by the actors Djamchid \\"Jim\\" Soheili in the 1976 television film 21 Hours at Munich and Merik Tadros in Steven Spielberg's 2005 film Munich.
