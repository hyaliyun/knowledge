In 1933, Santuc was described as \\"a crossroads trading center with scarcely a dozen houses in it, a railroad depot, three stores, and two filling stations.\\" A former slave, Eison Lyles, who was born in Santuc was interviewed as part of a Works Project Administration effort.

Hahm was committed to organising lesbian women and improving their social situation. She was especially known for her organizing activities. Together with K√§the Reinhardt, she ran the largest lesbian clubs of the time in the 1920s, with up to 2000 members and 500 participants, as well as various bars. She also wrote articles, organized lectures, readings and excursions and supported the establishment of lesbian networks in other cities. In 1929 she was co-founder of the \\"Transvestite Association D'Eon\\", the first German organization of transgender.  Weimar Republic  Hahm was born in Dresden in 1890, where she still ran a mail order bookstore in 1920. In the first half of the 1920s she came to Berlin, where she started working as a lesbian activist in 1926. Of particular importance for the city's lesbian scene was her founding of the \\"Damenklub Violetta\\", which was one of the largest lesbian clubs in the city with up to about 400 participants. The club was associated with the Deutscher Freundschaftsverband, one of the major homosexual organisations of the time. In 1929 Hahms club Violetta united with K√§the Reinhardt's club \\"Monbijou\\", in the course of this Hahm and Reinhardt changed to a larger competing organization, the Bund f√ºr Menschenrecht. The merger of the two big clubs and the change caused a great stir in the lesbian scene of the time, in the Frauenliebe and the DFV there was talk of betrayal and intrigue. As justification Hahm wrote that it would have been considered \\"grotesque\\" that \\"a heterosexual man should be the leader of homosexual women\\" and on the other hand of financial irregularities of Bergmann. She summed up that \\"the time has finally come for Karl Bergmann, who founded the Monbijou Women's Club only to exploit it for his personal purposes, to disappear.\\" Advertising photos of Hahm show her in a casual position wearing men's clothes. It is suspected that she was the holder of a so-called transvestite license, but nevertheless an identity of Lotte Hahm as a woman is assumed. Together with Felix Abraham, in 1929 Hahm was involved in the foundation of the first German organisation for transgender, the transvestite association D'Eon, which still existed in 1932. D'Eon was open to biologically male and female transpersonalities alike, was based at the Institute for Sexology of Magnus Hirschfeld and was directed by Hahm until 1930.t. Hahm was also involved in the organization of lesbian groups, for example, she had been the leader of the women's group of the BfM since 1928 and in 1930 she called - unsuccessfully - for the foundation of a Germany-wide \\"Federation for ideal women's friendship\\". Between 1926 and 1929, Hahm met K√§the Fleischmann, ten years her junior, her long-time partner. The bar and restaurant owner, married and mother of two sons, divorced in 1929 and supported Hahm in opening and running the two lesbian restaurants \\"Monokel-Diele\\" and \\"Manuela-Bar\\".  Nazi era  As a Jew, Fleischmanns bars had been repeatedly disrupted by the SA since the autumn of 1932, which ultimately led to Fleischmann having to sell her premises at a knock-down price as part of the anti-Semitic deprivation of rights by the state. Then in 1933 all lesbian bars were closed by the National Socialists, magazines were banned, open events as before were no longer possible, so that Hahm could no longer work either. In spite of the risks involved, Hahm and Fleischmann have now joined forces to continue offering places of lesbian subculture. They renamed the women's club \\"Violetta\\" veiled in \\"Sportclub Sonne\\", whose events took place until December 1934 in the Jewish Lodge House in Joachimsthaler Stra√üe 13 (today the Central Orthodox Synagogue Berlin) and in 1935 in Berliner Stra√üe 53. After a denunciation on 17 July 1935, officers of the police and the Reich Chamber of Music observed about 65 women there, 54 women were recorded by name in the subsequent raid on 24 July, and further events of the club were prohibited. Hahm was not found at this event because, according to her representative, she was in Hiddensee, according to a note in the file \\"known as a meeting place of homos. women\\". There she opened a pension, probably for lesbian women. Her further life under National Socialism is poorly documented and partly contradictory reported. It is possible that Hahm first came into the National Socialists' focus in 1933. According to a report by a contemporary witness, she was arrested when she was charged by the father of a friend with seducing minors. It is certain that she was taken to the Moringen concentration camp in early 1935, but files from there no longer exist. She told fellow prisoners that an unknown person at Alexanderplatz asked her to look after his suitcase. The Gestapo had searched the suitcase, found Communist material in it and arrested her. In the camp, Hahm had joined a communist group, presumably she has been tortured. Hahm kept silent about her experiences in the concentration camp even after the Second World War. By 1937 at the latest, Hahm was free again and worked as a textile trader in the Berlin area. Her success was limited, for lack of money she cheated her driver for his wages, who sued her for fraud. Hahm was sentenced to a fine and imprisonment, the latter she probably did not have to face. At least in 1939 Hahm resumed her earlier activities and again founded a lesbian meeting place on Alexanderplatz on the first floor of the Lehrervereinshauses which, however, was only of short duration. Fleischmann remained secretly active as a restaurateur, despite the life-threatening situation for her. In 1938 she was sentenced to forced labour, in 1941 she managed to escape and survived in changing hiding places, supported by Hahm.  Afer the war  Immediately after the end of the war, Hahm began to become active again in 1945 together with K√§the Reinhardt. They tried to organize lesbian balls in the \\"Magic Flute\\", later they moved to Oranienstra√üe 162. In the same year Hahm and Reinhardt opened a bar for lesbian women near Alexanderplatz, the name and exact location is unknown. The bar existed from 1945 to 1947 for about one and a half years and was the first lesbian restaurant in East Berlin. Hahm was involved in the 1958 refoundation of the Bund f√ºr Menschenrecht, which failed. Hahm and Fleischmann separated at the end of the 1950s at the latest. In the 1960s, Fleischmann was asked whether she would agree to an official tribute to Lotte Hahm for her support during the Nazi era. Fleischmann denied with the reason that she felt abandoned. In 1967 Fleischmann died in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg, Hahm died in August of the same year in Berlin-Wannsee.  Legacy  Lotte Hahm's work was already highly appreciated in contemporary times. Already for the first anniversary of Klub Violetta two poems on her were published in Frauenliebe, one by Selli Engler: \\"You, who have prepared a home for us through noble and serious diligence, and who with a proud and free forehead only strides forward with strength, you shall continue to be our guide, and we shall trust in you... Therefore, guide, show us the way to good and happiness, and build with us a strong bridge to all the world.‚ÄúSelli Engler: An meine liebe Charlotte Hahm zum 1. Stiftungsfest des Damenklubs Violetta. In: Frauenliebe, 1927, 2. Jahrgang Nr. 51, S. 8 In 1928 the gay magazine Neue Freundschaft described Hahm as \\"one of our best known and most popular leaders in the Berlin homoerotic women's movement.\\" Franz Scott saw Hahm in retrospect at the beginning of the 1930s alongside Selli Engler as an important personality of the first lesbian movement. Today, Hahm is recognized for her activist work as one of the \\"most important activists of the homosexual subculture, especially in Berlin\\" and \\"a significant champion* for the organization of homosexual women and \\"transvestites\\" during the Weimar Republic\\".Her \\"organizational skills, untiring energy and [...] a lot of courage are emphasized.‚Äú.

With 3,200 boats built, it became one of the most successful Canadian sailboat designs. The company moved into bigger boats with the Sirius series of keelboats, which commenced with the Sirius 20 in 1976, a design that evolved into the Sirius 21 in 1977 and the Sirius 22 in the early 1980s. The Sirius 28 was introduced in 1982 and finally the Sirius 26 1987. The Sirius 21 became the first North American production sailboat to use both ballast and positive flotation. Closed-cell foam was injected into some of the boat's compartments and also in between the inner and outer hull to accomplish this, a feature that added cost, but improved safety. The largest design produced, the Sirius 28 had 120 examples completed between 1982 and 1987. The company went out of business in 1987.

Adendorff's grandfather Michiel Joseph Adendorff was a German surgeon who had been on his way from Europe to the Far East but on disembarking at the Cape with a case of fever had decided to stay. Here his son Michiel Joseph Adendorff (1799-) was born who with his French wife had 13 children: Michiel Joseph; August Rouverie Adendorff, who later served as a Captain in the Abalondolozi Regiment in the Transkei c.1880-1881; Jeremie August; Jan; Edward Christiaan; Christiaan Hendrik; Frederik Barend; Frans Louis; Gert Wilhelm; Joseph Johannes, Louis Danel, and George Frederick Adendorff. Gert Adendorff was born in 1848 in Graaff-Reinet in the Eastern Cape. He volunteered to join the Kaffrarian Rifles, an Irregular unit formed from amongst the German-speaking settlers of the Cape frontier during the 9th Frontier War against the amaXhosa. At the conclusion of that campaign and the likelihood that a new one would commence in Zululand he volunteered and joined the 3rd Regiment of the Natal Native Contingent as a Lieutenant. With that rank he served at Isandlwana where he was in the camp on the morning of the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879, serving with No. 6 Company NNC under Captain Krohn and Lieutenant Higginson.Higginson - WO 33/34 56333 - National ArchivesSam Stopps, Lieut. Adendorff ‚Äì Rorke‚Äôs Drift Defender ‚Äì Fact or Fiction? - Anglo Zulu War Historical Society Escape from Isandlwana The Battle of Isandlwana (Charles Edwin Fripp) On the morning of the Battle of Isandlwana Adendorff brought reports in to the Camp from the outlying Natal Native Contingent pickets on the iNyoni Ridge. During the battle Adendorff‚Äôs company was held in reserve formed up in front of the Camp where Adendorff remained with his men until they broke and fled during the final ferocious and determined Zulu attack. He and the other officers of the NNC, realising that the battle was lost, fled with them. Lieutenant Higginson of the NNC in his report recorded that: > Capt. Krohn, Lieut. Ordendorf [sic] and myself had been firing for some time > on the right of our companies tents, and when we saw the soldiers retreating > we went for our horses which we had fastened close to us to be ready for any > emergency.Higginson, ‚ÄúA report to Lord Chelmsford dated 17th of February > 1879.‚Äù When his horse was killed under him as he rode down into the Manzimnyama Valley he commandeered another at gunpoint from a mounted auxiliary and escaped from the battlefield with inkosi Hlubi's mounted Sotho troop. Breaking through the 'right horn' of the Zulu attack they followed the Buffalo River upstream where many were caught and killed by the fast-moving Zulu warriors pursuing them. The survivors including Adendorff stopped and rested their horses on the ground just below Rorke's Drift. Rorke's Drift The Buffalo River at Rorke's Drift Adendorff and another soldier named Vane who had escaped from Isandlwana with him rode up to Rorke's Drift to warn the garrison there of an imminent attack. They arrived at about 3.15 pm on the Zulu side of the Buffalo River while Lieutenant John Chard was in his tent by the ponts on the other side.Adrian Greaves, Rorke's Drift, W&N; (2003) - Google Books They called out to be taken across the river.Frances Ellen Colenso, History of the Zulu War and Its Origin, Havertown, Pa.

It was them who gave the alarm at Rorke's DriftThe Mysterious > Lieutenant Adendorff of Rorke's Drift; Hero or Coward? By Ian Knight AZWHS The Defence of Rorke's Drift by Lady Butler (1880). In his official report of the Battle of Rorke's Drift Chard stated that Adendorff was the only survivor from Isandlwana who stayed to assist with the defence at Rorke's Drift, taking up position inside the storehouse and remaining there throughout the battle. Private Henry Hook later stated: > One of the horsemen was Lieutenant Adendorff and the other was a Natal > Carbineer. The lieutenant stayed behind with us, and the Carbineer, who was > in his shirt-sleeves, dashed on to Helpmakaar, twelve miles away to take the > news there. As the mission station at Rorke's Drift was being fortified ready for the imminent attack the soldier who had arrived with Adendorff was sent to Helpmekaar to warn them of what was happening. Chard later stated that Adendorff called out he would stay and help with the defence of the mission station. In his letter to Queen Victoria describing the battle Chard added: > As far as I know, but one of the fugitives remained with us - Lieut. > Adendorff, whom I have before mentioned. He remained to assist in the > defence, and from a loophole in the store building, flanking the wall and > Hospital, his rifle did good service.John Chard, letter to Queen Victoria, > 21 February 1880, quoted in Norman Holme, The Noble 24th: Biographical > Records of the 24th Regiment in the Zulu and South African Campaigns > 1877-1879, Savannah Publications (1999) Chard in his two reports on the battle stated that he believed Adendorff was among the defenders at Rorke‚Äôs Drift. Further testimony that Adendorff was among those fighting in the storehouse was provided by Trooper Symons of the Natal Carbineers who, while not present at the battle himself, spoke to some who were. Symons wrote: > When the hospital was fired by the Zulus, the men at once set to work to > pull off the thatch from the dwelling house.

(Fred) Symons - unpublished > typescript (N.D.) - Campbell Collections, University of Natal This is clearly a description of Adendorff who was the only man speaking a foreign language at Rorke‚Äôs Drift apart from Corporal Schiess who was fighting on the barricades before he was injured. Aftermath Lieutenant John Chard VC mentioned Adendorff as a defender of Rorke's Drift twice in his report In the weeks after the Battle of Isandlwana Henry Charles Harford, an officer of the Natal Native Contingent, wrote an Almanac which included details of the officers and men of the NNC who had deserted, including Captain Stephenson, and those who had fought at Rorke‚Äôs Drift, which included Adendorff. Hartford included details of Adendorff‚Äôs next of kin and where they lived, implying that Harford had spoken to Adendorff and believed he was among the defenders.Payne, David and Emma, Henry Charles Harford - ‚ÄòThe Beetle Collector‚Äô Hero of the Zulu War, Soldier and Entomologist, The Ultimatum Tree Limited (2008) Harford also drew a sketch of Adendorff at Rorke‚Äôs Drift with some of his men when the NNC was disbanded and the Natives were handing in their weapons and equipment. Trooper Symons of the Natal Carbineers was among those with Lord Chelmsford‚Äôs relief column recorded that Adendorff was present that morning. Adendorrf took little part in the rest of the Anglo-Zulu War and left the military when the 3rd Regiment of the Natal Native Contingent was disbanded as a result of their failure at Isandlwana. By 1882 Adendorff was a Clerk working for the Gold Commission and living in the Newcastle area of northern Natal. Later he moved to the Transvaal where he married Hester Grobler, a widow. During the Boer War Adendorff 'surrendered' when the British forces occupied Elandsfontein in January 1901. The War caused him financial loss, and writing from his home in Pretoria he later claimed for the loss of a 'Scotch cart' taken by the British after his surrender as well as for a horse and two mules taken by the Transvaal Government in February and May 1900. Adendorff was then employed as \\"Responsible Clerk and JP\\" at the Charges Office in Elandsfontein. Gert Adendorff died in about 1914. In the film Zulu which depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift Adendorff was portrayed by Gert van den Bergh. Controversy Private Henry Hook VC verified Adendorff was present during the Battle of Rorke's Drift The author Donald Morris in his The Washing of the Spears made the unverified claim that Adendorff was not present at Rorke's Drift, saying that he fled early in the battle in the same way he had fled Isandlwana. Morris imputes cowardice to Adendorff, saying he must have left Isandlwana earlier than he claimed to have arrived at Rorke's Drift by 3.15 pm, and that as the other survivors of the Natal Native Contingent fled with the approach of the Zulus so too must have Adendorff. The imputation of cowardice to Adendorff is unfair as he was a volunteer while professional soldiers such as Horace Smith-Dorrien and others thought the best option was to escape from Isandlwana and head for Helpmekaar and remain with their reputations unblemished. However, Adendorff clearly was present throughout the battle as verified by several important witnesses including Lt. John Chard VC, Private Henry Hook VC and Adendorff's own account of his involvement in the battle which can be independently verified.Ian Knight, Companion to the Anglo- Zulu War, Pen & Sword Militay (2008) - Google Books The fact that he was a stranger and was in the storehouse throughout the battle accounts for his relative invisibility.Adrian Greaves and Ian Knight, Who's Who in the Anglo Zulu War, 1879: The Colonials and The Zulus, Lamorna Publishing Services (2006) - Google Books The war correspondent Charles Norris-Newman was among Lord Chelmsford‚Äôs relief column that entered Rorke's Drift the morning after the battle and recorded: > The following officers were also present at the post and rendered material > aid in the defence: Dr. Reynolds, 1-24th, Lieutenant Adendorff 1-3rd NCC, > Messrs.

The 1st Missouri Light Artillery Regiment formed on 1 September 1861. The battery participated in Fr√©mont's expedition to Springfield in October 1861. This was followed by actions at Prairie Grove and Van Buren in December 1862. The following year, the battery fought at Cape Girardeau, Chalk Bluff, Vicksburg, the Expedition to Morganza, Brownsville, and Fort Esperanza. After performing garrison duty at Brownsville, Texas, the unit was mustered out in June 1864. For a few months at the end of 1864, a Pennsylvania battery took the name of this unit. Formation The battery's parent unit began its existence on 10‚Äì12 June 1861 in St Louis and Boonville, Missouri as the 1st Missouri Volunteer Infantry. On 1 September 1861, it was re-designated the 1st Missouri Light Artillery Regiment. At that time, Battery L and Battery M were transferred into the regiment from United States regular army units. These two batteries brought the regiment up to the strength of 12 companies, with batteries named A through M, excluding J. Battery C was disbanded in September 1861. Battery I and Battery L were disbanded in January 1862 and Battery B was disbanded in February 1862. Captain Nelson D. Cole assumed command of Battery E upon its establishment; as a result, it was sometimes called Cole's Battery. Other officers were First Lieutenants John L. Woods, Cyrus L. Edwards, Lucien J. Barnes, and Joseph Foust and Second Lieutenant Robert Armstrong. Barnes was reported missing on 31 October 1862 and Edwards was discharged on 2 November 1862. Woods received promotion to captain and quartermaster on 15 November 1862. Armstrong was discharged in April 1863. Abram S. Hoaglund was appointed second lieutenant on 21 May 1863. Foust was promoted to captain of Battery F on 26 May 1863. Cole received promotion to major on 12 August 1863. Joseph B. Atwater was promoted captain on 16 October 1863. First Lieutenant Edward S. Rowland was appointed and awaiting muster into U.S. service. History=1861‚Äì1862 On 29 September 1861, Battery E left St Louis and marched to Jefferson City. Later, the battery was attached to the Department of the West and took part in Major General John C. Fr√©mont's advance to Springfield, Missouri. The cavalry vanguard dispersed a Confederate force in the Action at Springfield on 25 October 1861, while Fr√©mont's main army arrived two days later. Soon after, Major General David Hunter assumed command of the army. On November 7, Hunter ordered a retreat in three columns, including one under Brigadier General John Pope to Sedalia. Battery E marched to Sedalia on 28 November. Later, Battery E moved first to Otterville and then to Lexington, Missouri where it remained on duty from 11 February to 3 June 1862. The battery participated in operations near Waverly on 25‚Äì28 May. It was assigned to the District of Central Missouri, Department of the Missouri from January to June 1862. Battery E was on duty at Sedalia from 3 June to 29 July 1862. The unit marched to Rolla, Missouri on 29 July and returned to Sedalia on 18 August. The unit marched to Springfield from 29 August to 4 September. It was assigned to the District of Southwest Missouri from June to October 1862, when it was transferred to the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, within the Army of the Frontier. Prairie Grove Battery E was armed with four 10-pounder Parrott rifles. On 12 October 1862, the department commander Major General Samuel Ryan Curtis formed three divisions into the Army of the Frontier with Brigadier General John M. Schofield as its commander. Schofield's army entered northwest Arkansas on 17‚Äì18 October. On 28 October, Schofield with the 2nd and 3rd Divisions skirmished with Major General Thomas C. Hindman's Confederate forces. Hindman withdrew from the area the next day. On 4 November, Schofield withdrew the 2nd and 3rd Divisions from northwest Arkansas and pulled back to Springfield. On 20 November, Schofield reported sick and turned over command to Brigadier General James G. Blunt. On 3 December, Hindman launched an offensive designed to crush Blunt's isolated 1st Division. However, Blunt's intelligence service alerted him at once and he called for reinforcements. Between 3 and 7 December, the 2nd and 3rd Divisions under Brigadier General Francis J. Herron made a remarkable forced march to Blunt's assistance, covering respectively. During the Battle of Prairie Grove, Battery E under Lieutenant Foust was attached to Colonel William W. Orme's 2nd Brigade in Herron's 3rd Division. The other units in the 2nd Brigade were the 19th Iowa and 94th Illinois Infantry Regiments, and the 8th Missouri Cavalry Regiment. At 10:00 am on 7 December 1862, Herron found his two divisions blocked by Hindman's army on the Prairie Grove hill. He detached Lieutenant Edward's 2-gun section of Battery E and sent it forward with the purpose of getting the Confederate artillery to reveal its positions. After a 10-minute exchange of fire with two opposing batteries, Herron withdrew Edward's section. At 1:30 pm Battery F, 1st Missouri Light Artillery opened fire on the Confederate positions. Under Battery F's covering fire, Herron sent the rest of his 20 guns into action, including Battery E and Battery L, 1st Missouri Light Artillery. Battery E galloped forward, then swerved to the left to unlimber on a knoll to the east of the Fayetteville Road. Foust's gunners deployed four 10-pounder Parrott rifles and two 3-inch Ordnance rifles. Confederate counterbattery fire caused few Union casualties, though a near-miss round shot knocked Orme off his horse. Battery E's mascot, a dog named \\"Old Bull\\", chased Confederate projectiles during the cannonade. By 2:00 pm the Confederate guns fell silent and Herron's guns pounded their adversary's positions for the next 30 minutes. Foust's battery was \\"particularly effective\\" because it obtained enfilade fire on the Confederate lines from its forward position. After the Confederates repulsed the Union 3rd Division's attack, they counterattacked and were stopped by the rallied Union infantry and fire from Batteries E and L and two Illinois guns. Foust reported that he \\"forced them back with canister\\". Herron complimented his gunners, \\"Never was there more real courage and pluck displayed, and more downright hard fighting done\\". When the Confederates drove back the 2nd Division's attack, they counterattacked again and the result was the same. The rallied Union foot soldiers and the gunners drove back their opponents with heavy fire. Afterward, Foust withdrew Battery E from the knoll and redeployed next to Battery L. The battery left behind eight dead horses and one caisson; there were 11 horses wounded. Battery E participated in the expedition over the Boston Mountains to Van Buren on 27‚Äì29 December 1862. During this operation, the Union artillery bombarded the south bank of the Arkansas River. At Van Buren, the Federals burned five steamboats and tons of supplies needed by the Confederate army. In the 31 December 1862 summary statement, Battery E reported having four 10-pounder Parrott rifles and two 3.5-inch \\"English Guns\\". Fr√©mont ordered the 3.5-inch guns early in the war. They were Blakely rifles manufactured by Fawcett & Preston in Liverpool. Battery E reported having the following 10-pounder ammunition: 420 Parrott common shell, 133 Schenkl common shell, and 131 Parrott canister shot. It also reported having 85 Army revolvers and 53 cavalry sabers. 1863‚Äì1864 Herron's division is at the bottom of the siege of Vicksburg map. Battery E marched to Springfield, reaching there 15 February 1863. It remained on duty at Springfield and Rolla until April when it took part in operations against Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke's Confederate cavalry from 17 April to 2 May. The battery fought at the Battle of Cape Girardeau on 26 April. The Federal troops led by Brigadier General John McNeil drove off Marmaduke's attack. The defenders included Welfley's Missouri Battery and another battery from the 2nd Missouri Light Artillery Regiment, plus reinforcements of two cannons from a third battery. While pursuing Marmaduke, Battery E took part in skirmishes at the Castor River on 29 April, Bloomfield on 30 April, and at Chalk Bluff on 1 May. The battery moved to St Louis on 9 May. At some time in the early spring, Captain Cole resumed command of Battery E and the unit temporarily added a third 3.5-inch Blakely rifle. On 4‚Äì16 June 1863, Battery E moved from St Louis to take part in the Siege of Vicksburg. At this time, Herron's division was re-assigned to XIII Corps which was led by John A. McClernand. During the Vicksburg siege, Battery E under Captain Cole was part of Brigadier General William Vandever's 1st Brigade, Herron's division, Major General James B. McPherson's XVII Corps, Army of the Tennessee according to Battles and Leaders. The siege was successfully concluded on 4 July. Battery E participated in the expedition to Yazoo City on 12‚Äì22 July. The unit moved to Port Hudson, Louisiana on 24 July and Carrollton on 16 August. After the Vicksburg siege, Battery E was part of the 2nd Division, XIII Corps. At Vicksburg, the battery reported having four 10-pounder Parrott rifles and two \\"Fawcett Rifled Iron Gun, Cal. 3.5\\" (i.e., Blakely rifles). In August 1863, Battery E transferred to the Department of the Gulf. Batteries B, E, and F, 1st Missouri Light Artillery were assigned to Herron's 2nd Division, Major General Cadwallader C. Washburn's XIII Corps. Battery E took part in the expedition to Morganza on 5‚Äì12 September. There were skirmishes at the Atchafalaya River on 9‚Äì10 September and Sterling's Plantation on 12 September. The Battle of Stirling's Plantation occurred on 29 September. In this action, a Confederate force led by Tom Green attacked and overwhelmed a Federal detachment, inflicting 515 casualties. Part of Battery E fought at Stirling's Plantation and suffered the following losses in enlisted men: three killed, three wounded, and 12 missing. The battery traveled to New Orleans on 11 October. Major General Napoleon J.T. Dana commanded the 2nd Division from 28 September 1863 to 3 January 1864. At the end of 1863, Captain Atwater was in command and Battery E reported from Brownsville, Texas that it was armed with two 10-pounder Parrott rifles and two 3.5-inch Whitworth rifled guns. All earlier reports called the latter weapons \\"Fawcett\\" or \\"English\\" guns. Battery E participated in the expedition to the Rio Grande from 27 October to 2 December 1863. On 6 November, the 13th Maine and 94th Illinois Infantry Regiments plus a Missouri battery occupied Brownsville. A total of 6,998 Union troops took part in the effort. The expedition's goals were to raise the U.S. flag in Texas, to cut off the cotton trade with Mexico, to damage the Texas economy, and to serve warning to the French occupation force in Mexico. On 16 November, 1,100 Federal troops seized Mustang Island and captured 98 Confederate soldiers and three heavy cannons. Soon after, the Union forces marched north on San Jos√© Island and crossed to Matagorda Island. At the Battle of Fort Esperanza, a battery of 1st Missouri Light Artillery bombarded the fort, which guarded the Pass Cavallo inlet. The fort was abandoned by the Confederate garrison on 29‚Äì30 November. Battery E performed garrison duty at Ducrow's Point and Brownsville before being mustered out in June 1864. Reorganization On 14 September 1864, Segebarth's Battery C Pennsylvania Artillery, Mississippi Marine Brigade was renamed Battery E, 1st Missouri Light Artillery. The new Battery E was attached to the artillery post of the District of Vicksburg until November. After that it served as garrison at both Vicksburg and Natchez. The new Battery E was mustered out of service on 1 January 1865. The officers were Captain Edmund H. Nichols, First Lieutenant Robert L. Crouch, and Second Lieutenants Hugh J. Randolph and Andrew J. Gibson.

Background  With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Napoleon III deemed it an opportune moment to establish a Latin-American Catholic satellite as a bulwark against the United States' growing influence over the Americas. The ideal pretext for a French invasion of Mexico presented itself as Mexican president Benito Ju√°rez suspended repayment of debt originating from British, French, and Spanish loans issued during the Mexican War of Reform. On December 6, 1861, Napoleon III launched a French military expedition into Mexico which devolved into an all-out war, the second French intervention in Mexico. For a brief stretch of time in the mid-to-late 19th century, the Mexican port of Bagdad served as a strategic center of trade and commerce, comprising an invaluable link between Mexico and the Confederate States of America while controlling river access to the twin cities of Matamoros, Tamaulipas and Brownsville, Texas. As the French intervention in Mexico progressed, Bagdad was the principal conduit for Confederate aid to Mexican Republicans. Accordingly, France decided to seize the port, entrusting conservative colonel Thom√°s Mej√≠a to undertake the operation in 1864 with the help of 2000 men and the French Navy. Mej√≠a easily occupied an undefended Bagdad that same year. Following his seizure of Bagdad, Mej√≠a's forces endured constant harassment from the troops of Republican general Miguel Negrete. However, upon learning of the arrival of 500 Mexican soldiers' and 140 French artillerymen worth to reinforce Bagdad, General Negrete decided to withdraw until he received adequate reinforcements and supplies of his own In 1865, increasing tensions with the US placed further pressure upon the French and Mejia to relinquish control of Bagdad. Following the expulsion of a contingent of Confederate soldiers from Brownsville to Matamoros, the United States sent 40,000 men to the border, pressuring the French to make a move. The French ordered the disembarkation of a vessel, the Tisiphone, from Bagdad to ease military tension in the face of constant threats from both the United States and Mexico. On September 28, 1865, General Mariano Escobedo marched towards Bagdad with an 11-gun artillery detachment in tow, determined to expel the occupying forces. In response, French admiral Georges-Charles Clou√© reinforced the city with four more navy vessels, the Adonis, Magellan, Tactique, and Tartare, effectively converting Bagdad to a war fortress. This development forced Escobedo to withdraw, whereupon Admiral Clou√© sent a complaint to the American forces stationed in Brownsville on the grounds that their mobilization threatened to incite a war between the United States and the French Empire and the Second Mexican Empire. The French naval vessel l'Antonia soon added to the defense of Baghdad. In November of 1965, Escobedo besieged the neighboring city of Matamoros, prompting the finest French ships and many soldiers in Bagdad to reinforce Matamoros. With the departure of the Antonia, Adonis, and Tartare, the defenses of Bagdad were stretched thin, rendering it easy prey for a Mexican Republican or American attack. In light of this, General Fran√ßois Achille Bazaine sent two reinforcement columns to Baghdad, led respectively by Colonel De Ornano and General Pierre Joseph Jeanningros, while also ordering the ship l'Allier to disembark 300 Austrian soldiers, 20 conservative Mexican soldiers and 60 French cavalry soldiers to Baghdad on November 20.  Battle  All the elements were then gathered for the main battle that took place in January 4,1866. Exploiting the weakened defenses of Bagdad, Escobedo orchestrated a surprise attack on the coastal city, commanding a standard Mexican Republican army while reinforced by black regiments from the United States Navy. In the ensuing scramble, the French- allied forces of Bagdad were pushed from the outer city limits to the docks of Bagdad. Realizing their imminent defeat, The French-allied troops boarded the vessels of le Magellan, le Tactique, and l¬¥Allier, sailing away from the scene. The conclusion of the battle resulted in a decisive victory for the Mexican Republicans.  Aftermath  Northern General Wetzel sent 150 men to restore order in Bagdad that had been occupied by Mexican forces. After learning of the sending of 150 American men to this battle, there was a new protest by the French Admiral Georges Clou√©, who demanded the departure of the American forces on January 25. In June, a unit of 2,000 Conservative Forces Monterrey to reinforce Matamoros. THe first half of the unit pauses due to illness. The 300 men of General Olvera of the unit's second half were attacked on June 15 in Camargo by 5,000 Mexicans and US mercenaries. Only 150 men remained in Matamoros together with General Tom√°s Mej√≠a. The French, being henceforth unable to sustain the constant attacks of the city, evacuated the 400 men who remained in Baghdad, leaving the Adonis ship bound for the port of Veracruz.

The 10-foot statue was created by Italian American Carlo Brioschi. In June 2020 American Indian Movement activists toppled the statue as part of the series of protests following the killing of George Floyd. History=Origin A Minnesota memorial for Christopher Columbus was first proposed at a 1927 meeting of the Italian Progressive Club of Duluth. Later that year, the idea was endorsed at a meeting of the Minnesota Federation of Italian-American Clubs in Hibbing. The Christopher Columbus Memorial Association was then established and chapters in Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul and the Iron Range raised funds from Italian-Americans for a statue. The statue was originally conceived as a way to counter discrimination against Italian Americans, who were considered outsiders by the earlier, predominantly Northern European settlers. The 10-foot bronze statue was created by sculptor Charles \\"Carlo\\" Brioschi, with assistance from Leo Lentelli.Harris, Moira A., Monumental Minnesota: A Guide to Outdoor Sculpture, Pogp Press Inc., 1992, p. 17 A site for the memorial was set aside in Saint Paul on the grounds of the Minnesota State Capitol, across from what was then the Minnesota Historical Society Building but is now the Minnesota Judicial Center. The statue was unveiled before a crowd of 24,000 on October 12, 1931. Speeches were given by Governor Floyd B. Olson and Minnesota Historical Society president Guy Stanton Ford. Attendees included former Senator Frank B. Kellogg and Senator Henrik Shipstead. Minnesota proclaimed Columbus Day an official state holiday that same year. An inscription on the memorial's plaque reads \\"To Christopher Columbus, Discoverer of America.\\" A 2015 bill introduced by John Persell sought to change the plaque to say that Columbus \\"landed in America.\\". A second plaque, added in 1992, claims that Columbus started \\"the merging of the cultures of the old and new worlds; Thereby changing forever the course and history of mankind.\\" In anticipation of the quincentennial of Columbus sailing to the Bahamas, the Italian-American Society made a donation for the preservation of the statue in 1991. The statue was pressure washed and treated to restore a \\"Roman bronze\\" patination. Just before the anniversary in 1992, vandals doused the statue with red paint, necessitating an emergency cleaning. Controversy The push to remove Confederate monuments in the wake of the 2015 Charleston church shooting and the 2017 Unite the Right rally sparked discussions over the future of the Columbus statue. Indigenous Peoples Day became an official city holiday of Saint Paul in 2015 and a state holiday in 2016. Native American activists and their allies argued that the statue legitimizes the myth that Columbus discovered America and creates an unwelcome environment on the Capitol grounds, citing his role in genocide, colonialism, and dispossession. Minnesota newspapers ran articles about the controversy surrounding the statue and a 2017 petition sought to replace the statue with one of Prince and another selected by the state's Native American community. 2020 removal A demonstrator raises a fist next to the empty pedestal In the weeks following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, protests spread to Saint Paul then to rest of the nation. The removal of monuments became a theme of the movement early on and by June 10, protesters in Richmond, Virginia had tore down their Columbus statue, set it on fire, and tossed it in a lake while protesters in Boston had severed the head of theirs. Members of the American Indian Movement, led by Mike Forcia of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians, announced via social media their intentions to topple the statue on June 10. Governor Tim Walz addressed the plans during a news conference and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington announced that the Minnesota State Patrol would meet with the protesters and seek an alternative resolution. State Patrol troopers and a Department of Public Safety tribal liaison met with organizers prior to the event, encouraging them to follow a legal process for removal and warning them that they could face charges for destruction of public property. Forcia countered that they had already waited far too long, having worked through official channels for years without success. Members of the American Indian Movement of Twin Cities joined residents, including Dakota and Ojibwe community members at the northeastern corner of the Capitol Mall. They looped a rope around the statue and pulled it off its granite pedestal. The group drummed, sang songs, and took photos with the fallen statue. No one was arrested at the event. State Patrol troopers watched from a distance and did not intervene. Troopers eventually formed a line to protect the statue before it was transported offsite. =Reactions= Governor Walz said he did not condone the action, calling it dangerous and an act of civil disobedience for which there would be consequences. Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, previously co-authored a bill to remove the statue when she served in the Minnesota legislature. Flanagan indicated she was not sad that the statue was gone, saying \\"I will not shed a tear over the loss of a statue that honored someone who by his own admission sold nine- and 10-year-old girls into sex slavery.\\" Republican politicians Paul Gazelka, Jim Nash, and Steve Drazkowski condemned the failure to protect the statue, with Drazkowski calling the act a \\"lynching-like desecration.\\" Fate The statue suffered minimal damage in its fall and was removed to an undisclosed location. It is in the possession of the Capitol Area Architectural and Planning Board, which is responsible for its fate. It is unknown whether the statue will be returned to the Capitol grounds. Paul Mandell, a member of the board, said \\"we don't have any process for how to handle removals; we've never done this before.\\" Mandell previously said that removing a statue would break a promise to the organization that devoted time and money to erect it.

After earning a degree in fine art from Cornell University, she worked briefly at the British Embassy in Washington, D. C. and Cornell, before embarking on a radio career in 1924. She was initially the Director of Speakers and was promoted to Director of Talks when NBC took over WEAF from AT&T.; She became well known for the range of celebrities she was able to secure to broadcast readings and presentations. Later, she was promoted to Director of Women's Activities, Director of the Children's Department and Director of Public Affairs. Among the programs Cuthbert produced were Peabody Award-winning NBC Theater, as well as its precursor World's Greatest Novels. She also produced Consumer Time, Echoes of History, Gallant American Women, Round the World, Stories to Order, and Tales of our Foreign Service. In addition to her production, Cuthbert gave lectures, wrote books and articles, and worked with organizations to develop programming that would be beneficial on both local and national levels for women and children. She received numerous honors from Women's organizations throughout her career for her pioneering career in radio. Early life Margaret Ross Cuthbert was born on 12 May 1887 in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada to Charlotte and Major Albert Edward Ross Cuthbert. She had two brothers and was raised with a love for nature and horseback riding. Her father served in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as an assistant commissioner, causing the family to move often. Among their residences were Dawson City and Whitehorse in the Yukon and Edmonton, Alberta. She completed her secondary schooling at Dawson City High School. Though her father opposed Cuthbert obtaining higher education, she attended Cornell University and earned a degree in fine arts in 1908. During her time at Cornell, she met Alice Blinn, who would become her life-long partner. Returning to Maple Creek, Saskatchewan, where her parents were then living, Cuthbert bowed to her father's wishes for her to spend a year learning to cook. Career In 1917, Cuthbert moved to Washington, D.C. to work at the British embassy. After a year, she began working as a secretary in the Home Economics department at Cornell. After 18 months, she resigned and moved to New York City, with the ambition of becoming a writer. She resumed her relationship with Blinn and the two women lived together with Cuthbert's widowed mother and a housekeeper in an apartment. Spurred by a radio broadcast in which a reader with a droning monotone reported, \\"Alabama casts 24 votes for Oscar W. Underwood\\", she decided to work in radio. In 1924, she went to work at American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;)'s affiliate WEAF, as Director of Speakers. She not only produced shows, but announced speakers, and made sure that various segments of the productions continued without interruption. When the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Radio Network was organized and took over WEAF as its flagship station in 1926, Cuthbert was made an executive of the firm and Director of Talks. Drawing on her experience from university when she organized campus speakers, she organized a range of authors, doctors, educators, explorers, philanthropists, scientists, and women leaders to present on NBC. Guests included Lady Astor, Amelia Earhart, John Galsworthy, Vachel Lindsay, Emily Post, Eleanor Roosevelt, and many others. In 1932, Cuthbert convinced Edna St. Vincent Millay, a friend she had corresponded with since 1926, to read her poetry on the airwaves. It marked the first time that a literary figure with an international reputation was broadcast on equal footing and pay with actors and singers. In 1934, Blinn and Cuthbert bought a summer home in Connecticut and the following year, Blinn assisted Cuthbert in attaining naturalization as a US citizen. In 1935, she was placed in charge of the new Women's Activities Department. She produced four weekly programs Stories to Order, featuring storytellers; Tales of our Foreign Service, providing intrigue from the archives of the Department of State; Consumer Time, aimed at providing information from the War Food Administration; and World's Greatest Novels, part of the University of the Air series. She also made regular appearances at conventions, women's club meetings, and educational gatherings to teach women about the uses of radio and to gain ideas of programming that would be beneficial on both local and national levels for women and children. Cuthbert focused on women because she their voices had previously been underrepresented. Cuthbert was chosen in 1936, as one of 24 honorees as Women of Achievement by the New York League of Business and Professional Women and in 1941 she was honored by the General Federation of Women's Clubs. In the 1940s, she produced a program called Round the World and was known for her production of Echoes of History, and Gallant American Women. In 1942, she was given the additional responsibility for children's programming. She organized programming for NBC's United Nations Series in 1946 and that year was honored by the National Women's Press Club for her pioneering contributions. In 1948, she retooled World's Greatest Novels, developing and producing NBC Theater, which won a Peabody Award for its adaptations of literature. That year, she was also promoted to Director of Public Affairs. In addition to her radio work, Cuthbert published articles and books for women and children, about radio. When the Association of American Women in Radio and Television (AAWRT) was founded in 1951, she was selected as its inaugural president. She used her network of contacts to assist Alma Vessels John one of the first black women to become a radio commentator to develop contacts to broaden her reach. Cuthbert also nominated John as the first black member of the AAWRT, which was approved in 1953. She retired from NBC in 1952 and she and Blinn moved to Captiva, Florida. They wintered in Florida and spent their summers on Cape Cod. Death and legacy Cuthbert died on 25 July 1968 at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts after a month-long illness. A collection of her and Blinn's letters exchanged over the years from 1924 to 1965 with Eugen Boissevain, Millay, and their family members are housed at Vassar College. An endowment to Cornell's library of $27,500 to purchase books was made in 1983 in Cuthbert's honor by Blinn.

The lower part of this small valley is served by Chemin Royale (route 368) which runs along the northwest shore of √éle d'Orl√©ans. Forestry is the main economic activity in the upper part of this valley; and agriculture in the middle and lower part. The surface of the Pot au Beurre River is generally frozen from the beginning of December until the end of March, except the rapids; however, safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to mid-March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.  Geography  The Pot au Beurre River originates from a forest stream on the northwest side of a marsh area, in the southwest part of the municipality of Sainte-Famille-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans. This source is located south-west of the village center of Sainte-Famille- de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans, to the west of the chenal de l'√éle d'Orl√©ans and north- west of the shore of the chenal des Grands Voiliers (St. Lawrence River).

The expression \\"Pot au Beurre\\" has also been used in toponymy to designate another small river in the municipality of Yamaska, which flows into the St. Lawrence River. In the past, locals kept perishable food such as butter, cheese, meat and milk in containers immersed in cold water. A river or lake pit or well allowed food to be kept cool.

Life Widgoff was born in Buffalo, New York on August 24, 1924, graduated from the University at Buffalo in 1944 with a bachelor's degree in physics, and came to work for the Manhattan Project at Columbia University. She earned a Ph.D. in 1952 studying cosmic rays at Cornell University with Giuseppe Cocconi and Kenneth Greisen; her dissertation was Neutrons from Interactions of Mu Mesons in Various Targets. After completing her doctorate, she became a researcher at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and, in 1955, at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, where she continued to work until 1961. In 1958, she became a research faculty member at Brown University, and in 1961 she became a full-time faculty member at Brown. She was promoted to full professor in 1974, and retired in 1995. At Brown, Widgoff was executive director of the physics department from 1968 until 1980. She served as chair of the American Physical Society (APS) committee on the status of women in physics and of the APS New England Section in the 1970s. She died on July 21, 2004 in Barrington, Rhode Island. Research Widgoff's doctoral research involved observations of cosmic rays both at high altitude on Mount Evans in Colorado and deep underground at Cornell University. Her early research at Brown centered on the \\"tau-theta puzzle\\", in which two different decay paths were thought to originate with different strange particles that could not be distinguished from each other experimentally. This was eventually resolved through the discovery of parity violation and the realization that both paths had the same starting particle, the kaon. Widgoff's work on this problem combined experiments on the Cosmotron at Brookhaven and the Bevatron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In subsequent years she became part of the Cambridge Bubble Chamber Group associated with the Cambridge Electron Accelerator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, the International Hybrid Spectrometer Collaboration at Fermilab, and spectroscopy experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Her final experimental work involved the detection of cosmic neutrinos at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Europe.

The establishment of Jenny's Place was integral in the response to the recognised need for feminist housing and crisis services for women and children escaping domestic and family violence, part of the original New South Wales Refuge Movement. It was one of the earliest refuges to open following that of Elsie Refuge, Bonnie Women's Refuge and Marrickville Women's Refuge. Today, the refuge continues to operate as Jenny's Place Inc., and is a registered public benevolent charity.  History  In 1977 a group of passionate women, including Marcia Chapman and Josephine Conway, established the refuge in a run down suburban cottage in Islington. The women approached Joy Cummings, the Lord Mayor of Newcastle at the time and a progressive politician who supported social reform, to obtain a building for a refuge. The Jenny's Place website provides the following description of the original refuge building; An old, two-bedroom house in Islington was retained, which the council charged a peppercorn rent of $1.00 per year. The kitchen was used as an office and we had numerous women and children not only sleeping in the bedrooms but on lounges and mattresses on the floor. In 1988, Jenny's Place received a new, upgraded building for the purpose of the refuge and the refuge relocated to Cook's Hill. A purpose-built refuge that contained five bedrooms and communal living areas including a kitchen, lounge room, dining room, laundry, internal playroom, toilets and bathrooms. An outside child support building was also established, containing two playrooms, a kitchenette, a toilet and an office. Historically, the refuge was funded under the Commonwealth's Support Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP). Under the SAAP act, the refuge was allocated ongoing funding, including $40,446 in 1980-81, $185,002 in 1985-1986, a one-off grant of $23,116 in 1992 and $1,230,707 in 2015-16, to assist with the ongoing running costs and payment of employees. Jenny's Place was successful in tendering under the NSW government's 'Going Home Staying Home' reform agenda in 2014, securing funding for their Women and Children‚Äôs Supported Crisis Refuge, a Single Women‚Äôs Crisis Refuge, Supported Transitional Accommodation and Outreach Support Program. In 2017, the refuge received a crucial charitable grant which allowed for the renovation of the shelter's outdoor facilities and the installation of new children's play equipment. In 2008, the shelter established the Jenny's Place Domestic Violence Resource Centre for women requiring non-accommodation support and contact services, funded solely by community support and donations. The service provides women who do not require accommodation with information on how to leave their situation safely, access to counselling and other support services. In September 2019, private funding provided to the resource centre by the Port Waratah Coal Services ran out. The resource centre has since been under threat of closure due to government refusal to allocate the necessary funding. For the 2019 and 2020 period, the government allocated Jenny's Place approximately $1.4 million in funding to support its specialist support services, including its refuge and outreach services, however this funding did not extend to the ongoing operation of the resource centre. In 2015, Jenny's Place received a $9000 grant from the Equal Futures Project fundraiser. In 2020, the refuge was awarded a $5000 NIB Foundation 'Good Cause Grant'. Today, Jenny's Place receives state government funding through the Specialist Homelessness Services and continues to provides support and crisis accommodation to women and children escaping domestic violence through two refuges, and its outreach program which includes fifteen transitional properties and ten boarding houses.

It originally was created with a flat head, rounded out by Columbus-based sculptor Alfred Tibor in his 1987 restoration. History The statue was created in 1959, commissioned by Anthony De Tomasi. It was offered to the city of San Francisco, which declined the gift. In 1966, De Tomasi installed the sculpture in a park he was developing in Barrington, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. After several decades there, it fell into disrepair, including one of its eyes shot out. The statue was moved to Columbus in 1986, in three pieces in a Columbus Parks and Recreation office. It was restored by Tibor in 1987 and donated to the college one year later, installed in May 1988. The 2020 George Floyd protests in Columbus created calls to remove the statue, with petitions circulating to also remove other statues of the explorer and to rename the city. The college stated it was looking into removing the statue, and it may be the first to be removed out of the three in the city. On June 16, the school administration announced it will remove and store the statue, and will aim to place a different work of art on the statue's pedestal. The family of the sculptor stated that they are against its removal. Columbus City Council President Pro Tem Elizabeth Brown supported the statue's removal, stating that City Hall's must be next. The statue was vandalized in mid-June, 2020. Hours after the statue's removal was announced, it was vandalized again, with spray- painted \\"America's first Atlantic slaver\\".

He participated in attacks against Spanish possessions in the New World and explored Nassau Bay in Tierra del Fuego. Biography He sailed as rear admiral of a fleet that was equipped by order of the States General of Holland and Prince Maurice of Nassau for an expedition against Peru, under command of Admiral Jacob L'Hermite Clerk, which left Amsterdam April 29, 1623. They stopped at the Cape Verde islands, where rich prizes were secured, and, on February 1, 1624, arrived at Cape Pe√±as on Tierra del Fuego. The admiral was already very sick, and after July 1623, the fleet was virtually commanded by Vice-Admiral Gheen Huygen Schapenham and Verschoor. On February 2 they entered the Strait of Le Maire, and, the fleet being dispersed by winds, Verschoor entered Nassau Bay, between Navarino, Hoste, and Wollaston islands. His mathematician, Johan von Walbeck, made a chart of the southeastern coast of Tierra del Fuego and the Strait of Le Maire, which was at that time the most authentic map of the extremity of South America. In March 1624, Verschoor was detached with a division for the American coast, while the admiral sailed for Juan Fernandez. Verschoor joined him there, and the fleet attacked Callao on May 12, burning thirty merchant vessels in the harbor. On 23 May, Verschoor was sent to attack Guayaquil, which he partly burned, but he was repelled there and again at Pisco. After Hermite's death, 2 June, 1624, Schapenham took the command-in-chief, and, in opposition to Verschoor's advice, refused to attack Callao again, which could have been easily carried, and a new expedition against Pisco was decided upon; but the Dutch were driven back on August 26. When the fleet reached the coast of New Spain, Verschoor secured several rich prizes and was ordered to sail for the East Indies, Schapenham returning by way of Cape Horn to the Atlantic. Verschoor arrived on March 2 at Ternate, in the Moluccas, and, the vessels being assigned to other services, he returned to Holland to report to the States General. Documents Verschoor's secretary, Hessel Gerritz, published Journal van de Nassauche Vloot (Amsterdam, 1626). A German version, with additional remarks, was made by Adolf Decker, who had served as captain of marines in the expedition. It is entitled Journal oder Tag-Register der Nassauischen Flotte (Strasburg, 1629). Theodor de Bry published a later version of it in his Histori√¶ American√¶ (1634), but the best-known version was published in French in the Recueil des voyages de la Compagnie des Indes. Charles de Brosses gave also an account of the expedition in his Voyages aux terres australes, and Capt. James Burney published an English translation in his Voyages to the South Sea (London, 1811).

State Deputies L√∫cia Helena and Luiz Paulo Correa filed a petition accusing governor Witzel of the following crimes: acquisition of overpriced respirators; suspect bidding for the construction of temporary hospitals; linking with the arrested entrepreneur M√°rio Peixoto; rejection of the 2019 budget by the state Court of Accounts. Once approved, the process moves to a special committee, where each one of the 29 parties in the Assembly chose representatives to make an impeachment committee. The report, authorizing the impeachment process was approved by the special committee on 17 September. If the state assembly passes the request (36 of the 70 deputies must approve), the governor is suspended from his duties (besides his current suspension authorized by the Superior Court of Justice on 28 August) and a trial will begin through a mixed court. Context At least 10 impeachment requests had been presented against Governor Wilson Witzel, elect in 2018 based in the Bolsonarism, severing ties with it later, besides not having any history with politics. A series of accusations of embezzlement of public money rose during the COVID-19 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro, with Operations Placebo and Favorite putting in doubt the suitability of the own governor and some of his state secretaries in relation to the management and acquisition of health supplies. The accounts of the state government of 2019 were also reject by the state Court of Accounts. Precedents The last four governors elect of Rio de Janeiro (Anthony Garotinho, Rosinha Matheus, S√©rgio Cabral and Luiz Fernando Pez√£o) were arrested for corruption. Besides the former commanders of the state government, a series of former State Deputies, such as former presidents of the Legislative Assembly, Jorge Picciani and Paulo Melo, were also arrested. All of them were part of a group which dominated Rio for about 15 years. This caused a hard financial crisis, as one of the reflexes being the regression of the rating of many municipalities, including the capital, in the FIRJAN Index of Municipal Development (IFDM) of 2018, as well as the federal intervention in public security. All of these circumstances helped decrease trust in the political class - not only in Rio, but also in the federal scope - making this scenario a fertile territory for polarizationa and for fake news. COVID-19 pandemic After the declaration of coronavirus pandemic, lots of other accusations of embezzlement of public money had surged envolving state secretaries in relation to the fight against the pandemic, and the own governor was target of Operation Placebo, of the Federal Police. With the aggravating of having a weak government support in the Legislative Assembly, representatives criticized the head of the state government for keeping people investigated by the state Public Prosecutor's Office and Police in his staff. Process in the Legislative Assembly The impeachment process signed by deputies Luiz Paulo Correa and L√∫cia Helena was unanimously accepted on 10 June 2020 by the Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro. Among the items covered in the request, it includes the suspect of overpricing and delay in the construction of campaign hospitals, as well as the rejection of the governor accounts of 2019 by the state Court of Accounts. Once approved, the process moved to a special committee, where each one of the 29 parties in the Assembly delegated representatives to create the impeachment committee. As the request was accepted by the Assembly floor (69 out of 70 deputies voted to accept it), the head of the executive branch was suspended from his duties and a mixed court was formed by: * 5 deputies chosen by ALERJ; ** Alexandre Freitas (NOVO); ** Carlos Macedo (REP); ** Chico Machado (PSD); ** Dani Monteiro (PSOL); ** Waldeck Carneiro (PT); * 5 judges drawn by the state Justice Court; ** Fernando Foch; ** In√™s Trindade Chaves de Melo; ** Jos√© Carlos Maldonado de Carvalho; ** Maria da Gloria Bandeira de Mello; ** Teresa de Andrade Castro Neves; * the President of the Justice Court, Claudio de Mello Tavares, who will vote only in case of draw.

History In 1901, the Deniliquin footballers, under the name of the Commonwealth Football Club won the premiership and received premiership medals from Mr. John Moore Chanter, MHR. In 1903, Imperials FC won the Deniliquin Football Association premiership and P Hickey won the goalkicking award. It appears that the Deniliquin FA went into recess at the conclusion of the 1904 season, when it was superseded by the Deniliquin Half Holiday Football Association in 1905, with this competition active up until 1913 , when the Deniliquin FA was re-established in early 1914. In 1919, the Deniliquin FA was reformed after a three year break due to World War One, with the following three club's participating - East End, Federals and Railways. In 1923, Ron Turner, from the Mathoura Football Club won the Derbyshire Trophy for the Most Consistent Player in the Deniliquin FA. In 1926, Australian Wallaby International Rugby Union player, Tom Lawton - Senior played Australian Rules Football in Deniliquin, with the East End Football Club. Bill MacDonald played for the Colts Football Club before making his debut the Melbourne Football Club in 1929. In August, 1930, at a meeting of the Deniliquin FA, it was decided that if larger attendees of the public were not forthcoming at local matches, the season would be abandoned, due to the effects of the Great Depression.

The Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle was an internal counter-intelligence operation by the Abwehr and the Gestapo. Consisting of a small independent Gestapo unit and led by SS- Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Friedrich Panzinger, its remit was to discover and arrest members of the Red Orchestra in Germany, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy during World War II. Name The name Rote Kapelle was a cryptonym that was used by the German central security office, Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA), the counter-espionage part of the Schutzstaffel (SS), which referred to resistance radio operators as \\"pianists\\", their transmitters as \\"pianos\\", and their supervisors as \\"conductors\\". The Rote Kapelle was a collective name that was used by the Gestapo, the German secret police for the purpose of identification, and the Funkabwehr, the German radio counterintelligence organisation. The name of Kapelle was an accepted Abwehr term to denote secret radio transmitters and the counterintelligence operation against them. Formation In August 1941, Rote Kapelle was the original counterintelligence operation started by Abwehrstelle Belgium (Ast Belgium), a field office of Abwehr IIIF. When Soviet agent Anatoly Gurevich was arrested in November 1942, a small unit made up of Gestapo personnel was formed in Paris in the same month. It was created by RSHA Amt (department) IV (Gestapo) section A2 (Sabotageabwehr), during September 1942, and led by SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (Colonel) Friedrich Panzinger. It grew out of a 1942 agreement between the Funkabwehr, Abwehr and the Gestapo to identify members of the resistance group Red Orchestra.

He was also an early member of the old yishuv, immigrating to Jerusalem in 1514.  Biography  Born in Toledo, Spain, to a distinguished family. In his early years, he studied under Rabbi Isaac Gakon. While in Spain, he wrote several kabbalistic treatises, the most famous of which is \\"Masoret ha-Hokhmah\\" a brief account of Spanish Kabbalism which he finished shorty before the Expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492. After said expulsion, Rabbi Abraham lived in Portugal for a short time, where he published \\"Meshare Qitrin\\". It was also during this time that be became affiliated with Abraham Zacuto and Isaac Abrabanel and was influenced by apocalyptic sentiment popularized after the Spanish inquisition. Like many of his contemporaries, he believed that the year 1524 would be the beginning of the messianic era and that the Messiah himself would appear in 1530‚Äì31. This belief became an obsession for Rabbi Abraham would spent countless years searching for proof in the Bible and the Talmud as well as in kabbalistic literature. He left Portugal and briefly settled in Greece where he wrote the treatise \\"Mashreh Kitrin\\" an apocalyptic explanation of the Book of Daniel. The work was printed in Istanbul in 1510 and was one of the earliest printed Hebrew books. In 1514 he immigrated to Jerusalem alongside Isaac ha-Kohen Sholal. In Jerusalem, he widely respected and became widely known through his literary and religious activities. In Jerusalem he wrote \\"Ma'amar Perek ·∏§elek\\" an explanation of talmudic statements in tractate Sanhedrin relating to messianism. Interestingly, Rabbi Abraham viewed Martin Luther in a good light, as he believed him to be a component of the Messianic era. Seeing Martin Luther as the destroyer of the Christian faith. In 1521, Rabbi Abraham wrote \\"Iggeret Sod ha-Ge'ullah\\" in which, he interpreted the Zohar, relating it back to his Messianic beliefs. Various other kabbalistic writings of Rabbi Abraham have been preserved: \\"Ma'amar ha- Yi·∏•ud\\" and \\"Megillat Amrafel\\" . In 1528 Rabbi Abraham wrote to the Beta Israel, making it one of the easiest correspondence with said community. Rabbi Abraham must have died between 1529 - 1535, as in 1535 David ben Solomon mentions Rabbi Abraham as being died for a long time.

History Dennis Flores in 2016 One of the founders of El Grito de Sunset Park is Dennis Flores, a \\"cop watcher\\" who began documenting the activities of the New York Police Department in 1995. He has been arrested more than 70 times for his activities. Flores and others founded El Grito de Sunset Park in 2002, before filming police activities was common. According to Flores, the organization was founded with a $270,000 settlement he received after the police attacked him in 2002. The group became a 501(c)(3) organization in 2015. The organization has roots in the primarily Puerto Rican neighborhood of Sunset Park in Brooklyn. The name \\"El Grito\\" means \\"the cry\\" or \\"the call\\" in Spanish, and is a reference to the independence movement El Grito de Lares in Puerto Rico and El Grito de Dolores in Mexico. El Grito de Sunset Park has ties to the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican radical group. The group's founders were influenced by social movements in Latin America; Flores witnessed organizing efforts in the Mexican city of Oaxaca in 2006 and 2007, while Jason Del Aguila, also a cofounder, worked for some time in Guatemala and El Salvador. Activities El Grito de Sunset Park's activities include organizing an art festival; advocating against gentrification; and photographing police activities. When it began, the organization would film police responses to the Puerto Rican Day Parade, which were sometimes violent. Eventually, the group began to film all year. In 2012, the group supported a rent strike in Sunset Park. Hispanic music and spoken word poetry are commemorated in videos made by El Grito de Sunset Park. In 2015, the group began organizing its own Puerto Rican Day Parade and Festival. It worked to gather and send supplies to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. In 2014, one of the group's videos played a role in charges against a teenage resident of Sunset Park getting dropped, while in 2015 another helped get charges dropped against a Mexican street vendor accused of attacking a policeman.

Her work has helped to elucidate how uncontrollable aversive events affect fear learning and how learning to control aversive stimuli can improve emotional resilience.  Early life and education  Hartley has been interested in how experiences guide decision making and behaviors for as long as she can remember. In her high school AP Psychology class, she read a book by Oliver Sacks and this was one pivotal moment in her decision to pursue a career in academic psychology. She pursued her undergraduate degree at Stanford University, majoring in Symbolic Systems. During her undergrad, she joined the lab of John Gabrieli and worked under the mentorship of a graduate student in the lab, Noam Sobel. She conducted her undergraduate research in Cognitive Neuroscience and became a co-author on three publications exploring human olfaction. Her work helped elucidate that the anterior cerebellum plays a role in regulating sniff volume in relation to odour concentration and that the human brain is activated by odourants at undetectably low concentrations. After graduating from Stanford in 1999 with a Bachelors of Science, Hartley decided to pursue work in industry as a software engineer at a small artificial intelligence startup in New York City. She worked with the startup for two years, building intelligent machines into software systems. Hartley later used this training in AI where she learned to think about the basic ingredients of intelligence, in her own independent research program. She then joined her former colleagues to work on algorithmic financial market predictions. By 2006, Hartley was ready to return to academia, and pursued her graduate work at the New York University in the Department of Psychology. She worked under the mentorship of Elizabeth A. Phelps studying Individual differences in the expression and control of conditioned fear. Hartley had her first child during her PhD. Hartley's PhD work to elucidate the neural circuits underlying emotional regulation and expression of fear began with an exploration of how individual variations in brain structure correlate to fear responses in humans. She found that the thickness of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was correlated with fear- related arousal and that increased thickness of the posterior insula was correlated with larger conditioned responses during fear acquisition. She then explored how serotonin signalling impacts fear memories. Her article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that specific risk alleles in the human serotonin transporter are associated with spontaneous fear recovery after extinction and heightened depression and anxiety. This work highlighted the role that individual differences in serotonin signalling might play in the propensity for depression and anxiety. Hartley completed her PhD in 2011, and then pursued her postdoctoral work at the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology at Weill Cornell Medical College. She worked under the mentorship of B.J. Casey. During this time, she continued to publish many papers from her graduate work and also had her second child. The work she published from her graduate studies explored how control of an aversive experience is related to the behavioral consequences and fear responses. She found that when stressors were controllable, fear extinction was improved and spontaneous recovery of fear associations was limited. Her new postdoctoral further work began to explore the relation of stress to fear learning throughout development. Along with several collaborators, Hartley explored when anxiety-related treatments might be most effective throughout development. They found that lack of synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex in adolescent mice was associated with blunted fear extinction.  Career and research  Hartley was then recruited to join the faculty at Weill Cornell Medical College in 2014. As an assistant professor in the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology and as a principal investigator of the Hartley Lab, she focused on exploring how learning and decision making change throughout development and how adverse experiences and uncontrollable events in adolescence contribute to aberrations in cognitive and emotional processing and how the ability to control stressors might enhance emotional resilience and improve goal-directed cognition. In 2016, Hartley returned to NYU and became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Center for Neural Science. She also became an investigator in the Max Planck - NYU Center for Language, Music, and Emotion (CLaME). In 2020, Hartley received tenure at NYU. In 2020, Hartley was also elected to become a Board Member of the Flux Society to advance research in the understanding of human brain development.  Developmental changes in decision making and motivated behavior  Hartley was interested in exploring how decision-making strategies are employed and change throughout development. She found that model-free strategies were employed across all age groups while model-based strategies began to be recruited in adolescents and strengthened in adults suggesting that the development and recruitment of model-based valuation system, and development of goal directed behavior. h Following this study, Hartley probed the cognitive mechanisms by which the memories of reinforced and unreinforced aversive events are enhanced across adults and adolescents. She found that, in both adults and adolescents, autonomic arousal and reinforced exemplars enhanced recognition. Her work in humans supported the findings from rodents that acquisition of Pavlovian conditioned aversive responses is compared across adolescents and adults.  Behavioral control and threat responses  A large component of Hartley's research pertains to exploring how exerting behavioral control over threatening stimuli changes the response to threats in the environment. It is known in rodents that fear responses diminish when rodents are able to exert control over threatening stimuli, so Heartley and her team sought to determine if this was also true in humans. Using fMRI they found that active avoidance is more important than extinction in leading to long term changes in fear responses in humans.

He was a stylite attached to the monastery of Atarib and part of a circle of Syriac intellectuals active in northern Syria under the Umayyad dynasty. Few of John's writings have survived. Although he maintained a correspondence with Jacob of Edessa (died 708) and George, bishop of the Arabs (died 724), his only surviving letter is fragmentary and unpublished (as of 2011). It is addressed to an Arab priest, Daniel ·π¨u øoyo, and concerns the prophecy in . He also wrote a history with a strong chronographical focus, apparently as a continuation of the chronicle of Jacob of Edessa that ended in 692, which itself was a continuation of the 4th- century Chronicle of Eusebius. John took the history down to the Council of Manzikert in the year 726. It has not survived, however, although it is referenced and in a few places quoted by Dionysius of Tel Ma·∏•re and Michael the Syrian. Dionysius' comments suggest that John did not exactly follow the format of Eusebius or Jacob. Other evidence suggests that John corrected Jacob's chronology of Mu·∏•ammad by giving him a reign of ten years (622‚Äì632). It is a matter of debate whether the \\"John the Stylite in the monastery of MƒÅr Z øurƒÅ at Sarug\\" who wrote a short grammatical treatise and a disputation is to be identified with John the Stylite of Litharb. The monastery of MƒÅr Z øurƒÅ at Sarug is mentioned by Michael the Syrian in the 12th century. In favour of the identity is the fact that the grammatical treatise is dependent on Jacob of Edessa's grammar; against it that it is preserved only in a Nestorian manuscript. The disputation likewise survives only in the form of a Maronite summary. It is written as a theological dispute between John and a non- Christian (possibly Muslim) opponent. Harald Suermann argues for parallels between the disputation and a letter of Jacob of Edessa to John of Litharb. Carl Anton Baumstark did not accept it as a work of the stylite of Litharb, but he did accept the grammatical treatise. Robert Hoyland considers there to be two distinct men. Although his own writings are largely lost, something of John's intellect and education can be gathered from the surviving eleven letters of Jacob of Edessa and four of George addressed to him. They show a circle of intellectuals discussing a broad variety of topics: chronology, history, philosophy, astronomy, literary criticism and biblical exegesis. John was a younger contemporary of Jacob and his death is usually placed in 737 or 738.

The life of Josiah shows some similarities to the life of Joash, king of Judah, that: # Both ascended the throne at the age of eight years old (2 Kings 22:1, cf. # At the age of 18, both repaired the Temple, reversing the acts of the last ruler before them (Joash replaced Athaliah; Josiah succeeded Manasseh). # The key event in Josiah's reign was the discovery of the book of law (Hebrew: \\"book of the Torah\\") in the temple by Hilkiah the priest (2 Kings 22:8-13), a person with similar stature as Jehoiada, the priest in Joash's reign. In 625 BCE Babylon achieved independence under Nabopolassar and in 612 BCE took the Assyrian capital Nineveh. This situation enables the kingdom of Judah, not under the threat of the Assyrians anymore, could make internal changes, including religious reforms. records the instruction of Josiah, through the scribe Shaphan ben Azaliah ben Meshullam, to the high priest Hilkiah to lead the renovation of the Temple in Jerusalem. Verse 3 : And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the , saying, KJV * \\"Shaphan\\" (, which means \\"hyrax, rock badger, coney\\"), son of Azaliah, a scribe or secretary of Josiah's court who was mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible (2 Kings , ; parallels in 2 Chronicles ; Jeremiah 26:24; ; 39:14; ff; and 43:6). He had at least sons named in the Hebrew Bible: Ahikam (Jeremiah 26:24; ; ), Elasah (Jeremiah 29:3), Gemariah () and Jaazaniah, who was among the idol worshippers seen in vision of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 8:11). His grandson were Micaiah, the son of Gemariah () and Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the short-lived governor of Judah appointed by Nebuchadnezzar after the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE (39:14; and 43:6). The name \\"Shaphan\\" is attested in a bullae discovered during the excavations at the City of David headed by Israeli archeologist Yigal Shiloh in the layer of destruction by the Babylonians in ca. 586 BCE, with the inscription belonging to Gemaryahu ben Shaphan, identified with \\"Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe\\" (Jeremiah 36:10), although it is equally possible that there is no connection between the names found on the bullae and the person mentioned in the Bible.Yair Shoham, \\"Hebrew Bullae\\" in City of David Excavations: Final Report VI, Qedem 41 (Jerusalem: Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2000), 33 *\\"Azaliah, the son of Meshullam\\" (cf. 2 Chronicles 34:8) may be attested by a bulla with the inscription \\"belonging to Azaliahu son of Meshullam\\" according to archaeologist Nahman Avigad.; WSS 90, published by the Israel Academy of Sciences & Humanities The Book of the Law was discovered (22:8‚Äì13) Hilkiah reported to Shaphan about the discovery of a book of Torah in the temple during the renovations.(verse 8; cf. 2 Kings 12). Critical studies suggest that the discovered book was Deuteronomy or its core (Deuteronomy 6ab‚Äì28), which contains the speech made by Moses shortly before his death and might include some older materials as well. The closing admonitions (Deuteronomy 28), the strict demand for the exclusive worship of YHWH () and the cultic veneration of YHWH alone in the central holy site of Jerusalem () would impress Josiah, and rules such as the social laws of Deuteronomy (e.g. ) would become state law during his reign.

The flag was updated in 1967 to its current form, when a new city seal design by Alfred Lewis Aydelott was adopted by the city government, as it transitioned to a mayor-council form of government. Design The flag consists of a field divided into three main parts, in red, white, and blue; with the city's seal depicted in gold with black detailing, and positioned at the intersection of the three colors. The white portion of the flag, along the hoist, has an angled edge toward the fly that narrows as it proceeds downward; the progression starts from the top near the halfway point of the flag's length, angling downward to approximately one third of the flag's length. Symbolism Colors in the flag are emblematic of the three states represented in the Memphis metropolitan area ‚Äî red for Tennessee, white for Arkansas, and blue for Mississippi ‚Äî with the angled edge of the white portion representing the angle of the Mississippi River. The flag is double- faced per the municipal code, allowing the city seal to be properly viewed from either side. The black lettering and artwork in the common city seal depiction differs with the city's municipal code, which stipulates the detailing should be in white. Another variant of the flag, seen from the flag's adoption until the city's sesquicentennial in 1969, disregarded the ordinance's instruction for an angled right edge of the white portion of the flag.

Inspired by memories from his childhood and interest in supernatural events, Myrick wrote the premise to be a \\"character study\\" comparable to the real-world psychological trauma and life-long experiences of alien abducties. In interviews leading up to the film's release Myrick stated, \\"This isn't Dan trying to do another found footage horror film. This is its own thing.\\" The film was met with an overall mixed critical reception, while praise was directed at the actors, and realistic portrayal of letting go of the past.  Premise  The story of Carl Merryweather, a man who is famous in his local town as someone who believes he experienced an alien encounter at 10-years-old, is explored. Now thirty years later, he is convinced that the extraterrestrials will reconnect with him on his 40th birthday. Merryweather, who is obsessive with making contact with UFOs, attempts to do so at the same location of his previous interaction. His skeptical sister Gina agrees to go with him for support, while bringing a film crew to document the event.  Cast  * Michael Selle as Carl Merryweather ** Jack Sandler as young Carl Merryweather * Nicole Sweeney as Gina Merryweather * Faleolo Alailima as Marcus Florio * Michele Yeager as Vanessa, the news anchorwoman * Paul Wilson as Timothy, the news anchorman * Willow Hale as Mrs. Cummings * Lee Broda as Nurse Mary * Dominic Medina as sound guy * Avery Guerrera as abductee  Production = Development  Based on his interest and fascination in sci-fi based activity from his childhood, Myrick wrote the script as a character-study story after researching the topic of the film. Myrick studied real-world self-proclaimed alien abducties Barney and Betty Hill, as well as read books detailing abduction by extraterrestrials including Messengers and Communion. Developed and marketed as the first new film directed by Myrick in years, and drawing attention to his co-directorship on The Blair Witch Project (1999), the low-budget project garnered some significant media attention. A joint-venture production between Daniel Myrick Films, Red Arrow Studios, and Hungry Bull Productions; Gravitas Ventures purchased distribution rights of the indie faux-documentary following its debut at the 2019 Austin Film Festival.  Casting  Unknown actors were cast in the roles, in an effort for perceived realism, with Emily Schweber serving as Casting Director.  Filming  The project was filmed in as a documentary film-styled found footage movie. This filming style was chosen after consideration over traditional photography, by the filmmaker, as he felt like it game him and the actors creative freedom with improvisational flexibility. The intent by creatives involved was to keep the budget small, while Myrick stated \\"I really think it was the best way to tell this story in and of itself, and I hope people embrace that about it.\\" Dan Myrick served as co-cinematographer, alongside Kevin Burke. Release The film premiered at the 2019 Austin Film Festival, after which distribution rights were purchased by Gravitas Ventures. The film released as a drive-in theater exclusive on June 30, 2020. Myrick expressed his excitement in doing so, stating \\"You're literally under the stars. It doesn't get any better than that...It's just a great movie to see under the stars and that's the big thing for me. You get to look right up at the very constellations that Carl is contemplating.\\" Skyman had a direct-to-video VOD release on July 7, 2020. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 63% based on reviews from 16 critics. The film was met with a mixed reception, with critiques targeting the pacing, as well as the \\"exhausted\\" sub-genre in horror, stating that it doesn't reach \\"the spooky heights to which it aspires\\"; while praising the realistic and \\"touching\\" story of an \\"all-too-real examination of the way a single childhood incident can infect an entire life\\".

He is an expert on Akkadian language and literature and on the history and culture of ancient Mesopotamia in the first millennium BCE, in particular the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods. Since 2008, he has served as Director and Editor-in-Chief of The Royal Inscriptions of the Neo- Assyrian Period (RINAP), an international research project funded by the U.S. government‚Äôs National Endowment for the Humanities and other granting agencies, to translate the royal inscriptions of the rulers of Assyria from 744 to 609 BC. The RINAP project marks the continuation of the Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) project, which Frame‚Äôs teacher and mentor, Albert Kirk Grayson, founded at the University of Toronto in 1978 and led until his retirement with support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.  Education and career  A native of Toronto, Grant Frame attended the Royal York Collegiate Institute before earning a B.A. degree in Near Eastern Studies, with honors, from the University of Toronto. He earned an M.A. degree in Assyriology from the University of Toronto as well. He then pursued his PhD at the University of Chicago, where he earned a PhD in 1981 for a dissertation entitled, Babylonia 689‚Äì627 B.C.: A Political History, which he wrote under the supervision of J.A. Brinkman, Simo Parpola, and Erica Reiner. For this study, Frame analyzed cuneiform tablets from several collections, including the British Museum, the Ashmolean Museum, the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin, and the Louvre. He traced events from the destruction of Babylon by the Assyrian king Sennacherib in 689 to the death of the Babylonian ruler Kandalanu in 627, a period that witnessed the height of the Neo-Assyrian empire as well as the beginning of the collapse of the Assyrian Empire in Assyria and of the shift of power to Babylonia. From 1980 to 2006, Grant Frame was a member of the faculty in the Department of Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations (formerly the Department of Near Eastern Studies) at the University of Toronto. During this time, he contributed to the Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia Project, by serving as its Assistant Director and at times as Acting Director. In 2006 he joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, initially as an Associate Professor in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and ultimately as full Professor. During this time, he was also Associate Curator and later Curator of the Penn Museum‚Äôs Babylonian Section which contains approximately 30,000 cuneiform clay tablets. From 2017 to 2020 he directed the Center for Ancient Studies at Penn.  Research and publications  The Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten published Grant Frame‚Äôs dissertation as a book in 1992 and issued a second edition in 2007. As an outgrowth of his work on the University of Toronto‚Äôs Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia project, Grant Frame published Rulers of Babylonia: From the Second Dynasty of Isin to the End of Assyrian Domination (1157‚Äì612 BC), in 1995. The University of Toronto Press reprinted this book in 2002 and issued a paperback in 2015. Frame edited or contributed to many other volumes and published articles in dozens of journals ranging from the Journal of Cuneiform Studies and the Zeitschrift f√ºr Assyriologie to the Journal of the Canadian Society for Mesopotamian Studies. He co-wrote exhibition catalogues, such as for a Penn Museum exhibit on magic in the ancient world, and served on the team that produced the Penn Museum‚Äôs new Middle East Galleries, which opened in 2019. He has delivered public lectures on ancient Near Eastern history and has advised media sources. He spoke in a panel in the BBC Radio World Service series on ‚ÄúBabylon, City of Wonders‚Äù which aired in June, 2020. In his book The Archive of Mu≈°ƒìzib-Marduk, Son of Kiribtu and Descendant of S√Æn-nƒÅ·π£ir: A Landowner and Property Developer at Uruk in the Seventh Century BC (2013), Frame published thirty-three cuneiform tablets describing the approximately 45-year career of an individual who bought properties in the city of Uruk in southern Iraq, including in the midst of a major rebellion. This private archive from Babylonia consists of land sale documents, loans with property given as security, and a legal proceeding. The tablets Frame studied come from the British Museum, as well as from the Louvre, the Babylonian collection of Yale University, the Free Library of Philadelphia, the National Museum of Iraq, and the Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire in Geneva.  Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period: RIM and RINAP Projects  As a faculty member for many years at the University of Toronto, Grant Frame contributed to the Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia Project, for as assistant director under the leadership of Professor A. Kirk Grayson. Grayson retired in 2000 and ceded responsibility to Frame. Shifting the focus to examine inscriptions to the Neo-Assyrian period, Frame established the Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period, or RINAP, and assembled a team to translate all known royal inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian kings from the era of Tiglath-pileser III (who ruled from 744-727 BCE through the era of Sin- shar-ishkun (ruled 627‚Äì612 BCE). RINAP secured funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities in order to produce editions in printed volumes and in a fully searchable and indexed online format. The translations cover thousands of texts that survive on clay tablets and cylinders, and in inscriptions on walls, objects, and other materials, from the region corresponding to what is now Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Turkey. So far several volumes of translations from the RINAP project have appeared in print from the publisher Eisenbrauns.

Its course is exclusively in the municipality of Saint-Jean-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans, in the L'√éle-d'Orl√©ans Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Capitale-Nationale, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.

The lower part of this small valley is served by Chemin Royale (route 368) which runs along the southeast shore of √éle d'Orl√©ans. Agriculture is the main economic activity in the upper part of this valley. 25C3% 25A8re_Maheu OpenStreetMap. The surface of the Lafleur River is generally frozen from the beginning of December until the end of March; however, safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to mid-March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.  Geography  The Lafleur river originates in the \\"Les Savanes\\" marshes (altitude: ), at the limit of the forest and agricultural zones, in Saint-Jean-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans. This source is located southwest of the Mitan road, southeast of the chenal de l'√éle d'Orl√©ans and northeast of the shore of the St. Lawrence River (Chenal des Grands Voiliers). From this source, the course of the Lafleur river descends on , with a drop of , according to the following segments: * towards the southwest by following more or less the limit of the forest zone in Saint- Jean-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans, then generally in agricultural zone at the end of the segment, up to a bend in the river; * southward generally in agricultural area, to its mouth.Atlas of Canada - Department of Natural Resources Canada - Lafleur River - Distance and altitude measurements established from the application of site measurements. The Lafleur river flows at the bottom of a small harbor (length: at low tide), in the hamlet \\"Rivi√®re Lafleur\\" in Saint- Jean-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans. The bridge at route 368 spans the Lafleur River near its mouth. This harbor whose sandstone of about at low tide, is attached to Chenal des Grands Voiliers whose width is at this location. This channel is crossed by the St. Lawrence River.  Toponymy  The toponym \\"Lafleur river\\" evokes the surname of a resident of French descent by the name of Dumont dit Lafleur, who in 1681 owned land in this area of Saint-Jean-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans, in the south-east of the island. The name of the Lafleur river appears on the map of Villeneuve of 1689, under the spelling \\"Rivi√®re √† la Fleur\\". The 1709 plan of Gideon of Catalonia rather includes the designation of \\"Ruiso at the Fountain\\" to identify this watercourse. Then, the original designation of the watercourse comes back into force with an evolving spelling according to the authors: \\"Rivi√®re La Fleur\\" according to Le g√©ographe Joseph Bouchette (1831); \\"Lafleur River\\" according to the 1914 Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec; \\"Rivi√®re √† la Fleur\\" according to the Geographic Directory of Quebec in 1969 and finally \\"Rivi√®re Lafleur\\" in 1978 according to the Toponymic Directory of Quebec published by the Commission de toponymie.Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec - Rivi√®re Lafleur.

The Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) used it both as a local train and as a train bus .  The vehicle  The vehicle is a special omnibus with all the facilities necessary for road traffic . The rail road bus was equipped with a diesel engine from Kl√∂ckner-Humboldt-Deutz from the bus construction. This had an output of , it allowed a speed of on the road and on rails. The vehicles had 43 seats and 15 to 24 standing places. The car was a one-way vehicle , but was equipped according to the regulations for rail traffic. So it had doors on both sides, had a train-compatible brake that acted on the track wagons, a safety drive circuit and an emergency braking device . For operation on railroad tracks , the bus was placed on two two-axle bases - called \\"track wagons\\". For this purpose, the rail-road bus had two hydraulic lifting devices, with which the front and rear vehicle halves were alternately lifted for putting on and taking off the track wagons. In front of the front axle and behind the rear axle was a bearing for the Trolley pivot . A grooved track at street level was required for the positioning . The front axle was completely raised in rail mode, the tires of the rear wheels were seated on the rails and provided the drive. During the change to and from the track wagons, the passengers stayed on the bus.Nagel.  Procurement  Rear view Showing details In 1951, the Deutsche Bundesbahn ordered two prototypes from the Nordwestdeutscher Fahrzeugbau company in Wilhelmshaven . The track wagons were manufactured by Waggon- und Maschinenbau GmbH Donauw√∂rth . The prototypes were delivered and tested in 1952. Shortly afterwards three series vehicles followed, one was presented in March 1953 at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt am Main . In 1953 another 50 vehicles were ordered. In total, however, only 15 wagons were used on the rails, the rest ran as pure road vehicles.

Because of the snow in winter, year-round operation seemed out of the question.Bufe, S. 27.. = Passau ‚Äì Cham = The first three series vehicles were at the beginning of the summer schedule as of 12 June 1953 on the route from Passau to Cham used: * Passau‚Äì Grafenau : street * Grafenau‚Äì Bodenmais : 46.0 km of rail on the Grafenau ‚Äì Zwiesel and Zwiesel ‚Äì Bodenmais railway lines * Bodenmais‚Äì K√∂tzting : street * K√∂tzting ‚Äì Cham: 17.8 km of rail on the Cham ‚Äì Lam railway line Of the 140.7 km total distance So: Amtliches Kursbuch der Deutschen Bundesbahn vom Sommer 1955; Bufe, S. 27, nennt 142,7 km. 63.8 were thus covered on rails. Ten minutes each were planned for moving from rail to road and vice versa. In addition, the direction of travel was changed at Zwiesel station . The total travel time was five and a half hours. The connection was offered once a day. Because there was no storage facility in Cham, the connection was later extended by 19.2 km to Furth im Wald using the Schwandorf ‚Äì Furth im Wald railway line . To this end, a further change of direction in Cham was required. The connection in the Bavarian Forest existed until June 1, 1957 and was abandoned mainly because of the traction problems that occurred in winter. It was the only one of the connections with the rail-road bus that received its own timetable table in the course book of the Deutsche Bundesbahn under number 426h and was therefore also marked with a special signature on the attached map.Angaben gem√§√ü amtlichem Kursbuch der Deutschen Bundesbahn vom Sommer 1955.  Augsburg ‚Äì F√ºssen  From 1954 to 1958, the Augsburg - F√ºssen connection was operated once a day . It ran from Augsburg on the road to Pforzen , then on the track via the Allg√§u Railway , the Biessenhofen ‚Äì F√ºssen railway and the Marktoberdorf ‚Äì Lechbruck railway to Ro√ühaupten . From there we continued on the road to F√ºssen. In the course book she was led under the number 406c. The journey took three hours and ten minutes.  Koblenz ‚Äì Betzdorf The Koblenz - Betzdorf link was established for the 1954/55 winter timetable . The route ran from Koblenz on the road to Dierdorf and from there over the railway line Engers-Au to Au (Sieg) and further on the Siegbahn to Betzdorf. It proved to be the greatest success of this concept and therefore lasted the longest. The number of seats was often not sufficient for the number of people willing to travel.Zu dieser Verbindung insbesondere: Strack, Seiten 200f. A trip took two and a half hours. This was the only connection that offered two trips per day and direction. The last scheduled trip on May 27, 1967 sealed the end of the rail-road bus.  Wutach Valley Railway  The Wutach Valley Railway was built for military strategic reasons. The middle section between Weizen and Blumberg covered a distance of 9.6 km as the crow flies with a railway line of 24.7 km in length due to inclines. As expected during construction, the operating result was strongly negative, since the prices of the tickets were based on the route length, not on the airline distance. Traffic on the street was faster and cheaper. In the post-war period, when the military strategic importance of the route no longer existed, rail traffic was discontinued in the middle section in 1955, but the further sections in the north and south continued to be served by rail traffic, which caused two changes in theStation wheat and the train station Blumberg-Zollhaus meant. These transfers were to be spared for passengers, which is why the Deutsche Bundesbahn used the Schi- Stra bus on the parallel federal road 314 . However, the experience with the two-way vehicle was so bad that its use ended when the timetable changed in December 1955.Schi-Stra-Bus im Einsatz auf der Wutachtalbahn.  Further missions  There were other, only short, operations, for example from Bernkastel to Remagen , via the Black Forest Railway (Baden) to Immendingen or between May 1953 and November 1955 from Waldshut via the Hochrheinbahn .  Remaining vehicle  A vehicle with two track wagons is owned by the Bochum Railway Museum Foundation and is exhibited in its Railway Museum. This vehicle is operational. However, the approval of the Federal Railway Authority limits its use today: tunnel passages and oncoming traffic on multi-track routes are not permitted. Tomas Meyer-Eppler: Der Schie‚ÄìStra‚ÄìBus f√§hrt wieder. In: Lok Magazin 3/2002, S. 22. The reaction between road and rail is sometimes presented in larger venues.  Other  When the computer-readable vehicle numbers were introduced on January 1, 1968, the series number 790 was still assigned for the rail-road bus, but all vehicles had already been retired by the cut-off date.  Cars similar to other tracks = France  In the early 1940s, the engineer Talon developed a system in which a normal street bus ran on rails and was able to pull a light \\" Decauville \\" railcar sidecar . The bus drove over a special ramp to two track wagons, after which the front wheels no longer touched the rails, but the inside of the rear double wheels remained in contact with the track. At least one of these vehicles powered by wood gas was used in the summer of 1943 on the 54 km long railway line of the Carcassonnaise de Transports en Commun (CCTC)L‚Äô√©tonnant autorail-bus de l‚ÄôAude bei grandsudinsolite.fr, abgerufen am 6.

The DMV920 model no longer used external bogies, the two axles that are carried along are only lowered on the single rail.  Netherlands  Demonstration of the Michelin so called car-train with rubber tyres in the Netherlands in 1932 =History= A test vehicle (DMV901) began trials in January 2004 and DMV911/912 began in September 2005. Further testing began 4 April 2007, on the Senmo Line between Mokoto and Hamakoshimizu. One leg is from Hamakoshimizu to Mokoto (about 11 km) as a rail trip and Mokoto to Hamakoshimizu as a passenger bus (about 25 km). DMV920 was completed in June 2008 with a capacity of 28 passengers.

She typically casts non-actors in her films, and focuses on marginalized communities.  Early and personal life  Lessovitz is from San Francisco and Kansas City, but is based in New York City. She has a degree in documentary film from Northwestern University, and a Master of Fine Arts from New York University Tisch School of the Arts, for which she was awarded a scholarship to study. Her professor here was Ira Sachs. She works as a professor of filmmaking at Rutgers University. She identifies as a queer woman. Lessovitz uses female pronouns and sees herself as \\"quite genderless\\", explaining: \\"gender [is] a sort of weird thing for me, because I don't necessarily feel one way or another\\". She is Jewish.  Career  Lessovitz is part of the Brooklyn Filmmakers Collective. She has said that she got into filmmaking as \\"a way to be honest about what [she] was seeing and experiencing, [she] wanted a way to make sense of very complex feelings and to communicate those as best [she] could\\", comparing filmmaking to poetry and painting. Lessovitz's films typically depict marginalized communities and star non-actors. She directed her first short film, Batteries, in 2009, and followed this with the 2012 short The Earthquake, which won awards in Philadelphia and Kansas City, and Neon Heartache, a 2013 short that also played the festival circuit. She wrote The Earthquake in 2010 after reading about Haitian communities in Queens experiencing loss from afar after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, setting the film in Brooklyn; she won the Ben Lazeroff award for screenwriting for it. Her first film shown at Cannes Film Festival was 2017's Vladimir de Fontenay-directed Mobile Homes, which she co-executive produced (with Charles de Rosen) and co-wrote (with de Fontenay). Eric Kohn for IndieWire said that for Mobile Homes, Lessovitz \\"burrows inside a persecuted world without pandering to it\\". In 2019, TheWrap included her in their list of the top 16 directors at Cannes Film Festival, which also featured names such as Pedro Almod√≥var, Werner Herzog and Agn√®s Varda. Her film at the festival this year was Port Authority, her directorial debut feature film set in the New York ball subculture and telling the love story of a black trans woman and a homeless white man. It stars Fionn Whitehead and Leyna Bloom, who became the first black trans actress to star as lead in a film at the festival. The film was executive produced by Martin Scorsese, who Lessovitz said she was scared to reveal the final product to, explaining that \\"to feel like you have one of the most if not the most important American auteurs opening up his wisdom and his mentorship to you is surreal\\". Taylor B. Hinds for I AM FILM wrote that Lessovitz \\"displaces the ... white-male role to the outskirts of the queer culture\\" in the film, also forcing Whitehead's character Paul to rediscover his sexuality and masculinity while engulfed in the ball scene. Lessovitz has said that she knew of ball culture from having seen Paris Is Burning as a film student, but did not know that it was still around in the 2010s until she was invited to one while in a crisis after her father's suicide; watching people vogueing gave her \\"respite\\" in this time, and speaking to drag families helped her gain a fresh understanding of family structures. The character of Paul has several parallels with Lessovitz, but she explains that his male privilege is explored in the film, something she has never experienced, and that he is used to explore forms of masculinity from this perspective. The film also confronts Paul's identity as a white person, something that IndieWire's Jude Dry said Lessovitz \\"clearly gave a lot of thought\\"; interviewed by the outlet from Cannes, she said: > We need to have conversations, especially as white allies ... How do we tell > these stories that are important to us and relevant to us? How do we do it > in a way that's consistent with the deeper humanity that runs through all of > us? And we need to have a middle ground where we're not working in a space > that's commercial or fetishistic and sort of wanting to exploit or profit > off of the beautiful cultural contributions of a class of marginalized > people. Kohn said that Lessovitz's \\"ability to address the drama's specific hook in measured terms enables this scrappy little movie to strike a quietly progressive note\\".

She is Co- Director of the Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research, Director of the Cancer Immune Therapy Program at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and a Professor at the University of Toronto.  Education  Ohashi obtained her BSc in Biology from York University in 1982. She received her PhD from the University of Toronto Department of Immunology in 1988. Her graduate supervisor was Tak Wah Mak.  Scientific career  In her undergraduate studies at York University, Ohashi did wet lab research in the laboratories of James Friesen, John Heddle, and Ron Pearlman. Following an interest in immunology, she pursued a PhD in Tak Mak‚Äôs lab at Princess Margaret Hospital, graduating in 1988. Ohashi conducted post-doctoral research with Rolf Zinkernagel and Hans Hengartner at the University of Zurich until 1991. In 1992, Ohashi established a research program at Princess Margaret Hospital, where she is now a Senior Scientist. Ohashi is a Professor in the Departments of Medical Biophysics and Immunology at the University of Toronto. At Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ohashi is Co-Director of the Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research, and Director of the Cancer Immune Therapy Program. Her achievements resulted in her appointment as Canada Research Chair in Autoimmunity and Tumour Immunity.  Research  Ohashi undertook a fourth year undergraduate research project with Dr Ron Pearlman on genomic analysis of Tetrahymena repetitive sequences. In her PhD research on T Cell Receptors (TCR), Ohashi found that expression of beta chain cDNA was essential for the expression of a functional TCR/CD3 complex on the cell surface. This complex was shown to be responsible for mediating signal transduction via specific stimulation of the TCR of Jurkat cells. She created mouse lines with transgenic T cells expressing rearranged TCR genes and showed evidence supporting the model that commitment to certain T cell lineages occurs prior to the rearrangement of the composite receptor genes. Ohashi‚Äôs early work focused on understanding basic mechanisms of T cell tolerance versus activation. She was a pioneer in showing conclusively that thymocyte selection is based on an affinity/avidity model. She was also the first to demonstrate that self-reactive peripheral T cells can remain in a na√Øve state in the T cell repertoire; a concept that has become widely known as T cell ‚Äúignorance‚Äù. This has led to Ohashi‚Äôs current approach in understanding how to manipulate and improve cytotoxic T cells to enhance the immune response against cancer. She demonstrated that ignorant T cells could be activated against tumours and showed that altering the molecular programming of dendritic cells can alter the steady state and promote T cell activation in the absence of conventional dendritic cell maturation signals. This is a novel way to break T cell tolerance in vivo and provides important insights into potential mechanisms of autoimmunity. Ohashi directs the translational program of Princess Margaret Cancer Centre's Cancer Immune Therapy Program, designing and running clinical trials using novel immune therapeutic approaches to treat cancer patients. Ohashi was key investigator on the first Phase I clinical trial to use adoptive cell therapy for ovarian cancer.

It is located on the fifth floor of the Equitable Life Building at 3435 Wilshire Boulevard in the Koreatown neighborhood of central Los Angeles, a couple of blocks north of the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools. History The Philippine Consulate General in Los Angeles was opened in 1947 at 355 South Broadway in the city's historic core, initially as an extension office of the Philippine Consulate General in San Francisco. It was upgraded into its own mission in 1955 by President Ramon Magsaysay, becoming the city's 17th consulate general. In the run-up to the People Power Revolution in 1986, two dozen people stormed the Consulate, demanding the resignation of its employees, while marchers also protested outside. Two weeks later, the Consulate's staff called on President Ferdinand Marcos to resign following the seizure of Camps Aguinaldo and Crame by Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and General Fidel V. Ramos. When Marcos was ousted, supporters of his successor, Corazon Aquino, hung a large portrait of her in the Consulate's offices, in addition to holding a rally outside. It continued to be a place for demonstrations afterward: pro-Marcos demonstrators rallied outside a few months after the People Power Revolution against Aquino's nine- day state visit to the United States. The Consulate today remains a popular venue for demonstrations relating to issues in the Philippines: in 2016, a demonstration was held against Marcos's burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, while two years later, demonstrators protested outside the Consulate against the arrest of Senator Antonio Trillanes. During the 1989 Philippine coup attempt, a confrontation took place at the Consulate between supporters of the Aquino administration and those supportive of the coup. Coup supporters also organized a candlelight vigil outside, subsequently leaving the premises after they were shouted out by supporters of the government. The Consulate moved to its current location on March 2, 2015, relocating from its previous offices located four blocks west at 3600 Wilshire Boulevard. It first moved to the Wilshire corridor in 1967, when it moved from Downtown to 3075 Wilshire Boulevard, across from Bullocks Wilshire, and since then has been based out of different buildings along the corridor. Staff and activities The Philippine Consulate General in Los Angeles is headed by Consul General Adelio Angelito S. Cruz. Prior to becoming Consul General, he served in various posts, including as vice-consul at the Philippine Consulate General in Chicago, and consul general at the Philippine Embassy in Abu Dhabi. Currently, the Consulate's jurisdiction covers southern California, southern Nevada and Arizona. In California, the Consulate also exercises jurisdiction over the honorary consulate in San Diego, and likewise maintained an extension office in Ventura at one point in its history. It also previously exercised jurisdiction over New Mexico and Texas until March 22, 2019, when both states were placed under the newly-reopened Philippine Consulate General in Houston. The Consulate has provided assistance to several high-profile Filipinos throughout its history, including former First Lady Imelda Marcos, actress Nora Aunor, former Agriculture Undersecretary Jocelyn Bolante, and Charlie \\"Atong\\" Ang, one of the co-accused in the plunder trial of Joseph Estrada. Aside from providing consular services, the Consulate has also experimented with various ways of reaching out to and supporting Filipinos within its jurisdiction. In 2005, the Consulate launched a series of fundraisers to help pay for the expenses of Filipino American athletes participating in that year's Southeast Asian Games, while it has also supported Filipino cultural endeavors both in the Philippines and by the large Filipino American community in the Los Angeles area, such as hosting exclusive screenings for Ploning as part of its bid to win Best Foreign Language Film at the 81st Academy Awards. In 2018, the Consulate confirmed that it does not and would not report undocumented Filipinos applying for Philippine passports to the Department of Homeland Security.

The film serves as a loose sequel to Havoc in Heaven, and adapts later episodes in the 16th century Chinese novel Journey to the West.  Plot  As a punishment for rebelling against the heavens, Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, has been trapped under a mountain for 500 years, until he is helped by the monk Tang Sanzang. The two come to respect each other and the Monkey King decides to help him on his pilgrimage to the West and to become his disciple. They are joined along the way by Pigsy and Sandy. Meanwhile, a group of demons plot to attack Monk Tang and eat his flesh, as they believe that it will give them immortality. The White Bone Demon, Baigujing, arrives and warns them that the Monkey King is the monk's disciple, and that he is a very powerful opponent. Though this causes all the other demons to lose hope, Baigujing devises a scheme to subdue the Monkey King by disguising herself as an innocent beautiful woman. When the group encounters Baigujing in disguise, she tells them that she would like to travel with them. However, the Monkey King sees through her illusions and attacks her, resulting in her apparent death. This leads Monk Tang to become angry at the monkey for attacking the ostensibly innocent woman. The group travels on and discovers a young child claiming to have lost his mother. Once again, the Monkey King sees through the demon‚Äôs disguise and attacks her. After a battle between the two, the demon tricks him and manages to escape, so that she can disguise herself as an elderly man in front of Monk Tang. When the Monkey King once again attacks this seemingly innocent person, Monk Tang defends the old man, allowing the demon to escape. The monk decides to rejects the Monkey King as his disciple and the two part ways. The Monkey King flies away and returns to his home where he is greeted by his people. He learns that they have been ravaged by the heaven for the past 500 years while he was trapped beneath the mountain. The Monkey King calls upon the gods in heaven to help him rebuild his home. Monk Tang, Pigsy, and Sandy travel onward into a buddhist temple, where they are attacked by Baigujing. While the monk and Sandy are captured, Pigsy manages to escape to go warn the Monkey King. Realizing the demons might have followed Pigsy, the Monkey King refuses to come back with him, and instead chooses to follow him in secret. He tricks Baigujing into thinking he is her mother and manages to defeat her and free Monk Tang. Having seen that the Monkey King was telling the truth, the monk asks for his forgiveness, which he accepts.  Cast  * Li Yang as Sun Wukong (The Monkey King) * Tan Pengfei as Monk Tang * Zhan Che as Pigsy * Zhao Bing as Sandy * Hong Rong as Baigujing  Production  Te Wei was the producer of Havoc in Heaven and director of the Shanghai Animation Film Studio at that time. During this period, he expressed interest in directing his own film, with fellow director Ding Xian Yan reminiscing years later that \\"It was obvious that Te Wei wanted to make an animated feature film. He asked me to accomplish his long-cherished wish.\\" Production for the film began in 1982, and completed in 1985. It was originally created as a 5-episode series, but was condensed into a single film. Much of the artistic style stayed true to what was established by Havoc in Heaven, but its \\"animation had more delicate depictions of the details of the character actions and psychology\\"  Release  The film was screened as part of the official competition for the 1987 Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

He was the fourth-oldest child among ten children of Gabriel and Ethel Troumbly. Troumbly was one of seven hockey-playing sons, all of whom played for the hometown Taconite Hornets, a senior amateur squad in northeastern Minnesota. Troumbly also played for Team USA in the 1950 Men's World Championship, in which Team USA placed 2nd overall.  Amateur Hockey Career  Troumbly, nicknamed ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù for his slight stature, started playing senior amateur hockey in 1941 at the age of 14 while working hard physically during the day on his burgeoning construction business. Troumbly attended the local school through 9th grade but did not enter or graduate from Greenway High School in Coleraine, Minnesota, despite other family members graduating. In 1941, Troumbly competed in his first outside competition when his older brother, Ken, to him along to play in a senior amateur game with the Taconite Hornets. Troumbly played well against his older competitors. His brother Ken would go on to play for the University of Minnesota. Troumbly continued to play senior amateur hockey as a teenager. Troumbly played with the Taconite Hornets until 1945. Subsequently, for four seasons, Troumbly played for the Eagle River Falcons, a leading amateur team in the Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario Hockey League, where he was the leading scorer each season. In 1949, he was given a two-week tryout with the Detroit Reg Wings, at the time a notable achievement in itself for an American player. In 1950 and 1952, Troumbly was invited to try out for both the Men's World Championship and U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. In the 1950s, Troumbly played for the Hibbing Flyers hockey team of the Northern Amateur League, where he was the top scorer and helped lead the team to the 1953 National Senior ‚ÄúA‚Äù Amateur title. In 1955, he led the Taconite Hornets to their first state Amateur title. Troumbly also captured the tourney scoring title (breaking the state record at the time), was named to the all-tourney team, and won the Most Valuable Player award. Troumbly continued to be among the scoring leaders of the Taconite Hornets and were contenders in the Arrowhead League. At one point, the team won seven- straight league championships, where Troumbly was a captain on those teams, eventually helping those teams win the 1962 and 1965 Minnesota State Amateur Titles. At age 39, Troumbly helped the Hornets with the its fourth state title and second-place in the National Senior Tourney in 1968. In the following year, Taconite won the National Senior Intermediate Championship in Troumbly's last year of competitive plan.  International Play  Troumbly received an invitation to compete on the United States National team and flew to London to compete in the 1950 World / European Ice Hockey Championships in Wembley, England. A forward on that team, Troumbly would help his team to a runner-up finish to the Canadian Hockey team. Troumbly led in scoring as a centerman for not one but two lines. Troumbly scored three goals and four assists against the Netherlands (USA 17-Netherlands 1). In a following game with Switzerland, Troumbly scored six goals within nine minutes (USA 10-Switzerland 5). For the championship, Troumbly scored 12 goals with four assists in 7 games played. At the request of Connie Pleban, Troumbly was invited to try out for the 1952 U.S. Olympic team that competed in Helsinki, Finland. At the time, Troumbly was formally starting his construction business with his brothers, known as the Troumbly Brothers Construction. Troumbly would not play again internationally.  Playing Style  Troumbly played at 5‚Äô8‚Äù and about 150 pounds. Despite his relatively small size, Troumbly was a tough player and a solid all-around performer. He was known as an unselfish player with imaginative play-making skills He was noted for pinpoint passing accuracy and his clever, deft stickhandling. He was an ‚Äúassist‚Äù man as his ability to set up teammates for goals was ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù. Most prominent was his ability to anticipate the play and be in the right position at the right time. A left- handed shot, Troumbly was known to pass up prime scoring opportunities in order to give another player a better chance to score. Troumbly was extremely strong on his skates and could handle rough play. Never a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù player, he did know how to protect himself and was the object of a lot of attention from opposition defenders. Troumbly developed a unique shooting style called the ‚Äúkick-shot‚Äù and was his specialty. At the time is was notorious in that it was a strong shot that had little control for placement, however Troumbly was able to implement the shot to much success. The Kick-shot was later declared illegal by USA Hockey's predecessor.  Coaching Career  While playing for the Taconite Hornets, Troumbly also found time to be a coach to the youth of Taconite and to the Greenway Raiders youth program. He coached the Greenway Bantam ‚ÄúA‚Äù team from 1971-1979 and was name the ‚ÄúCoach of the Year‚Äù in 1973 for his services by MAHA. In 1975, his team was the Minnesota State Runner-up. Over the years, he was a source of advice and Council for many who grew from the Greenway Hockey program who have went to college, professional, and international competition. Troumbly often worked with long time Greenway High School Coach and Arena Manager Bob Gernander. Bob was quoted as saying Troumbly ‚Äúwas an excellent student of the game and demanded a ‚Äòteam-first‚Äô effort as a captain, a teammate, and a coach‚Äù.  Contributions to Area Hockey  In the late 1950s there was momentum to build an indoor hockey facility to house both the Greenway Raiders Hockey Program and the local Taconite Hornets team. Due to the proximity of the High School's location to available properties, it was decided that the arena would be built in Coleraine, Minnesota. Construction began in 1960 with Troumbly's company Troumbley Brothers Construction providing a bulk of the construction services, completing the project in 1962. Troumbly Brothers Construction not only was the prime contractor, but also donate significant time and money back to the project. In fact, witnesses at the time attested to the fact that the Troumbly and his brothers could be seen working on the facility prior to their Hornets games in Taconite.  Influence on the Community  Over the course of his playing career, Troumbly coached and played with many individuals who would later contribute greatly to game of Hockey regionally, nationally and internationally. Rube Bjorkman ‚Äì a well-respected teammate with Troumbly on the Taconite Hornets, spoke of Troumbly in the following letter ‚ÄúI played with (Troumbly) on the Taconite Hornets from 1955 to 1963. There was not a better Senior A hockey player in Minnesota during that period of time‚Ä¶Youth hockey players in the Greenway School area were motivated by all who came in contact with him through hockey‚Ä¶and I rank Slimmy with the best of the complete hockey players I have known.\\" Bob Gernander ‚Äì a well respected hockey coach and NHL scout, in 2007 spoke of Troumbly‚Äôs athleticism and style of play with the following ‚ÄúAt a time prior to strong television coverage, Troumbly was a player that all could emulate. His create and unselfish style of play was a model for all at an important transitional period of the game. I was personally influenced by Troumbly and credit him with developing many of the tactics and philosophies that I used as a High School, Junior and Pro coach. I still find his influence important in my present job evaluating talent for the NHL.‚Äù Chuck Grillo ‚Äì a former amateur player and teammate of Troumbly's during his time with the Hibbing Flyers, spoke of Troumbly in comparison with Igor Larionov in style of play. Chuck wrote in an online article, ‚ÄúIgor Larionov could thread a puck through bodies and sticks to the weak side of the net for a tap-in goal‚Ä¶ Actually, I learned as much about this from an old iron-ranger named Slim Troumbly, who played the game like Larionov. This guy could have played in the NHL when there were only six teams. Troumbly said, ‚ÄòChuck, most players are worried about catching the puck and handling it. That should be a given if they‚Äôve practiced it over and over. Why, when they can make the game simple, wouldn‚Äôt they think about giving it to someone else before it hits their stick, go to a hole and get it back? That‚Äôs how simple the game is.‚Äô ‚Äù‚Äù Mike Antonovich ‚Äì a former professional hockey player, grew up idolizing Troumbly ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù Troumbly. Mike was quoted in reference to Troumbly, ‚ÄúHe could pass, he could score, he could skate. I want to be just like him.‚Äù  References  Category:American ice hockey players Category:1928 births Category:Possibly living people ","title":"James Floyd &quot;Slim&quot; Troumbly"},{"id":"64241037","text":"The Denmark Mound Group or Denmark Site (40MD85) is a Mississippian culture archaeological site on a low bluff overlooking Big Black Creek, a tributary of the Hatchie River near Denmark in Madison County, Tennessee.

Her healing ministry attracted large numbers of followers and her church grew to have 3,000 members. She was the first woman to be the founding pastor of a church in Chicago. Upon her death in 1952, her funeral was attended by 60,000 people, and is considered to be the largest funeral held in Chicago up to that date.  Biography  Lucinda Madden was born in Woodstock, Georgia, on January 14, 1875. She was one of six children, and was raised by her mother alone. Lucy married William Smith in 1896, and together they had nine children. The family moved to Athens, Georgia, in 1908. Shortly thereafter, her husband left, and Lucy began to earn a living by taking in sewing. She moved to Atlanta, and then to Chicago, where she arrived in 1910. William Smith rejoined the family in Chicago. Lucy Smith had joined the Baptist Church when she was 12 years old. In Chicago she discovered Pentecostalism, and by 1912 was attending Stone Church, a Pentecostal assembly. She believed she had a gift for faith healing, and in 1916, she started prayer meetings in her home with two other women. As the meetings grew, Elder Smith established the Langley Avenue All Nations Pentecostal Church in 1920. At first the church did not have a permanent building, but was modeled as a \\"tent meeting.\\" In the mid-twenties, Elder Smith decided to build a new church building on Langley Avenue, and construction was completed in December 1926. This would be the first church in Chicago ever established by a woman pastor. In addition to her faith healing ministry, Elder Smith was a dynamic preacher. She developed an active community outreach program, feeding thousands during the Great Depression. She also developed a robust gospel music ministry. All Nations was one of the first African American churches to broadcast worship services on the radio. Her granddaughter, \\"Little Lucy\\" Smith Collier was a classically trained pianist and organist, and a highly regarded gospel accompanist and singer. \\"Little Lucy\\" began to lead the music ministry in the church at age 12 . Elder Smith sold the Langley Avenue church building in 1938, and built a new church building. At the height of its popularity, All Nations had a membership of 3,000. By the end of her ministry, Elder Smith estimated that she had healed more than 200,000 people, during her weekly faith healing sessions. She died on June 18, 1952. Over 60,000 people attended her funeral, which was the largest ever held in Chicago to that date. Her casket was carried to Lincoln Cemetery in a horse and wagon.

Richardson, the former owner of the National Football League's Carolina Panthers, was involved in a controversy involving allegedly sexist behavior prior to selling the team. The statue was removed from Bank of America Stadium in June 2020 for fear it would be destroyed by protestors. Background The statue was a gift to Richardson, the founding owner of the Carolina Panthers, during his 80th birthday, given by the team's minority ownership partners. It stood 13 feet tall outside the north entrance of Bank of America Stadium, depicting Richardson in a suit holding a football and flanked by two life-sized black panthers with green eyes. When the U.S. National Anthem protests started back in 2016 in response to police brutality, it was reported by numerous Panthers players such as Tre Boston that Richardson prohibited his players from joining the protests. After Richardson was forced to sell the team after the 2017 season following racist and sexist remarks made to team employees in light of the Me Too movement, David Tepper, the new owner, was forced to keep the statue up as a \\"contractual obligation\\" of purchasing the Panthers, much to the chagrin of many fans. However, it was taken down and stored in a hidden place by Panthers management in 2020 in light of the George Floyd protests. Despite no language indicating the fate of the statue, it has been reported that the Panthers organization does not intend on restoring it. Richardson himself has also reportedly \\"moved on\\" and that the statue \\"is not his focus\\", according to his spokesperson. Boston later commented that the removal of the statue was \\"best for the community\\".

Williams, who was nine years old and weighed 35 pounds, died of malnutrition. Davontae's mother, Marcella L. Williams, and his mother's partner, Lisa Ann Coleman, were arrested, accused of depriving Davontae of food, and charged with capital murder. Marcella Williams entered a guilty plea in exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment, while Coleman refused a plea deal and received a death sentence. To support the charges of capital murder against Marcella Williams and Coleman, prosecutors cited kidnapping as an aggravating circumstance. When Coleman appealed her death sentence, her attorneys argued that no kidnapping had occurred because Davontae had been in his own home and had been seen walking around his apartment complex days before he died. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected that argument, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intercede, and Coleman was executed in 2014. The death of Davontae Williams was one of several child deaths that placed Child Protective Services (CPS) under scrutiny; his home had been investigated by CPS several times before Davontae died. Some of those investigations involved allegations of neglect, and Davontae and his sister had been removed from the home for a year in 1999 because of physical abuse allegations against Coleman. Background=Lisa Ann Coleman Coleman in 2006 Coleman was born in 1975 in Tarrant County, Texas, and she grew up in adverse circumstances. She was conceived when her mother was raped by Coleman's step-grandfather. She was beaten with extension cords by an uncle and was sent from one foster home to another as a child. Coleman's mother, who nicknamed her \\"Pig\\", rarely saw Coleman while she was in foster care. A cousin stabbed Coleman in the back when she was eleven years old. A relative provided Coleman with drugs and alcohol when she was in her teens. Coleman had a tenth-grade education. She had a child when she was 16 years old. As a young adult, Coleman went to prison twice, for burglary and for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Marcella and Davontae Williams Marcella L. Williams was born in February 1981. She was 14 when her son Davontae was born prematurely; he had developmental disabilities. Before Marcella Williams lived with Coleman, she became the subject of a CPS investigation; the complaint alleged that Marcella was not watching two-month-old Davontae. CPS caseworkers monitored the home for six months. In 1999, Davontae and his one-year-old sister were removed from the home due to concerns for physical abuse. When CPS investigated, Davontae had thinning hair, bruises on his back, and swelling on his lip and his penis. Marcella regained custody of the children after a year when she met the requirements set by CPS; as part of this arrangement, Williams was ordered to stay away from Coleman. In October 2002, when Davontae was in the first grade, CPS received allegations that he was being physically and medically neglected. CPS caseworkers visited with Davontae and his siblings, who denied being abused. Around that time, Coleman and Marcella Williams began hiding Davontae, failing to send him to school or to take him to doctors. They led school officials to believe that they had moved out of the district. CPS investigators went to the Williams home nine times between November 13 and December 30, 2002, to follow up on the October allegations, but Davontae and his family did not appear to be home during any of those visits. July 26, 2004 On July 26, 2004, Marcella Williams called 9-1-1 and told a dispatcher that Davontae had stopped breathing. When the dispatcher attempted to provide Marcella Williams with instructions for performing CPR, the call disconnected. When emergency medical personnel arrived, Coleman told them that Davontae had stopped breathing a few minutes earlier. However, they noted rigor mortis and determined that Davontae had been dead for at least several hours. The nine- year-old weighed 35 pounds and had 250 scars on his body when he died. There were infected wounds on his wrists and legs where he had been bound with plastic extension cords. There was a fresh tear in the child's lip and a healing tear where the ear meets the side of the head. A blood stain was found on a golf club in the home. Coleman and Marcella Williams were arrested, charged with injury to a child, and each held in jail in Arlington on $200,000 bond. Those charges were later upgraded to capital murder. Davontae's sisters, ages three and six, were placed in foster care after his death. A CPS spokesperson said that the girls appeared to be healthy. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office said that malnutrition caused Davontae's death; they said that pneumonia also contributed to his demise. During the ensuing investigation, Coleman told authorities that she sometimes struck Davontae with a belt and that sometimes, with Marcella Williams' help, she tied Davontae up. Legal proceedings Coleman rejected a plea deal and went to trial for capital murder. To sustain a capital murder charge, the State of Texas needed to prove the existence of an aggravating circumstance such as a second crime that Coleman committed in relation to the murder. Citing evidence that Davontae had been bound and locked in a pantry, prosecutors advanced kidnapping as the aggravating circumstance in Coleman's case. Opening statements in the Coleman trial commenced before Judge Everett Young on June 7, 2006. The prosecution said that Davontae's home was filled with food and that while the rest of the household ate well, the family withheld food from Davontae. Prosecutors highlighted the presence of scars and bruises on Davontae's body, which they said pointed to Davontae being beaten and tied up frequently. His ear appeared to have been partially torn away by the golf club found in the home, the prosecution said. Coleman's defense attorney, Michael Heiskell, accused prosecutors of rushing to blame Coleman for a death that resulted from poor parenting, not murder. Heiskell said that Coleman did not actually live with Marcella and Davontae Williams. He said that Davontae was small because he was born prematurely and that he sometimes had to be restrained because of his hyperactive behavior. Dr. Daniel Konzelmann, a medical examiner for Tarrant County, testified for the prosecution. He said that Davontae's body was so bruised and scarred that he initially suspected blunt trauma as the cause of death. He stated that Davontae was not fed adequately and that his diet was so deficient in protein that his body had begun to break down fat and muscle; he testified that the lack of protein also made it difficult for Davontae's wounds to heal. Konzelmann said that Davontae had very little fat around his heart, which he said was a highly unusual feature in a child. One of Davontae's sisters, who had been adopted by the time of the trial, testified that Coleman had lived with the family and sometimes tied Davontae up. Defense witnesses included a physician who testified that Davontae died from aspirating his own vomit, not from malnutrition. A psychological associate who had evaluated Davontae in 1999 said that he had developmental delays which included speech problems, and that he needed to have grown up in a stable environment to develop properly. Addressing the prosecution's opening statement claims, a forensic consultant said that the blood on the golf club represented transfer, not spatter, indicating that Davontae was not hit with the club. Davontae's first grade teacher at Webb Elementary School in Arlington testified about his behavior. She said that he had seemed capable of learning but that he was highly distractible. She said that because of behavioral issues, it was often necessary to have him sit next to her in the classroom. At the end of the trial, the jury deliberated for an hour before Coleman was convicted of capital murder. In the punishment phase of the trial, Coleman's attorneys raised several potential mitigating circumstances in an attempt to spare Coleman a death sentence, including the illicit nature of her conception, her early exposure to alcohol and drugs, and the abuse that caused her to end up in foster care. A child abuse expert testified for the defense about the intergenerational effects of abuse. Coleman's lawyers also said that Coleman had bipolar disorder. The jury rejected the mitigating circumstances and sentenced Coleman to the death penalty. Marcella Williams did not go to trial. She agreed to plead guilty to murder in exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment. She will not be eligible for parole until 2044. Coleman's appeals and execution Coleman was represented during her appeals by John Stickels of Arlington. She also received assistance from Brad Levenson, the lead attorney at the Office of Capital Writs (OCW), the agency responsible for representing Texas death row inmates during their appeals. Stickels felt that Coleman was being unfairly targeted as a black lesbian. In subsequent motions, Stickels argued that the capital murder charge was inappropriate, saying that Davontae could not have been kidnapped in his own home. Levenson said that Coleman's original attorneys had failed to investigate evidence that would have disproven the kidnapping allegation, such as the claims of neighbors that Davontae had appeared happy and unrestrained at functions within his apartment complex in the days before he died. On September 16, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the argument against the kidnapping charge, and the U.S. Supreme Court elected not to issue a ruling in the case. The next day, Coleman was executed by lethal injection using the drug pentobarbital. While she was the 1389th person executed in the U.S. since executions resumed in 1976, she was only the 15th woman executed during that time. Aftermath at CPS After the deaths of Davontae and several other children in Texas, the governor's office opened an inquiry into CPS child maltreatment investigations. A spokesperson for CPS acknowledged that the Williams home had been the subject of CPS involvement for several years; she said that the family moved frequently in an attempt to avoid CPS investigations. Caseworkers had lost track of the family in 2002. In 2005, a Texas Senate bill sponsored by Jane Nelson gave $200 million to CPS to hire and train additional staff members.

Personal life Shuster is the son of Bennett and Lori Shuster, and is Jewish. He has a sister, Alexa. His hometown is New Bedford, Massachusetts. He is 6‚Äô 3\\", and 210 pounds, and is considered athletic, as he runs a 6.5 second 60-yard dash. High school Shuster attended New Bedford High School before transferring to Tabor Academy in Marion, Massachusetts, graduating in 2017. He was 6-0 with an 0.45 ERA as a freshman at New Bedford High School, throwing in the mid-80s and touching the high-80s. Then at Tabor Academy he was 2-1 with a 1.88 ERA as a sophomore, 3-2 with a 2.40 ERA as a junior, and 4-3 with a 1.26 ERA and 64 strikeouts in 39 innings as a senior while he was captain of the team. As a junior he batted .506 with nine doubles and six home runs in 25 games, and as a senior both pitching and playing outfield he batted .347 with four home runs. He also played basketball. College Shuster played college baseball at Wake Forest University for the Demon Deacons. As a freshman he was 0-3 with a 7.41 ERA, and as a sophomore he was 4-4 with a 6.49 ERA while striking out 94 batters in 68 innings (12.4 K/9IP, the third-highest ratio in school history) and was twice named Atlantic Coast Conference Pitcher of the Week. As a junior in 2020 in a season shortened by Covid he was 2-1 with a 3.76 ERA, as in four starts he struck out 43 batters (tied for third in the ACC) and walked 4 in 26.1 innings (14.7 K/9IP), holding batters to a .221 batting average. After the 2018 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the New Bedford Bay Sox of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, and was 2-4 with a 2.76 ERA and a league-leading 62 strikeouts in 49 innings. After the 2019 season, Shuster played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was 4-0 with a 1.36 ERA with 36 strikeouts and 5 walks in 33.0 innings, and was named a league All-Star. His sinking two-seam and riding four-seam fastball was 92-94 mph and hit 97 mph, and Shuster's best pitch was his 80 mph changeup (that he throws over 10 miles per hour slower than his fastball, and which he throws in any count), which produced a 60% whiff rate. He also has an improving slider. Major league draft Shuster was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the first round (25th pick) of the 2020 Major League Baseball Draft. He was the seventh first-round draft pick in Wake Forest history. He signed for a signing bonus of $2,197,500; because the 2020 season is uncertain, 2020 draft picks will receive a maximum of $100,000 up front, and the rest of their bonus will be deferred over the following two years. Braves vice president of scouting Dana Brown said: \\"We think ... there‚Äôs a chance this guy could be a three-pitch mix with above-average-to-plus stuff.\\" ESPN's Karl Ravech said: \\"Talk about somebody who checks a lot of the boxes, Jared Shuster is one of those. His whiff rate on his changeup, it‚Äôs even as good as that guy, Luis Castillo, who has one of the best in the world.\\" Former major leaguer Eduardo Perez said: \\"You have to look at the release point of where he lets it go... it‚Äôs the same release point as the fastball, way over the top, and it‚Äôs hard to pick up. You‚Äôre sitting changeup, and all of a sudden here comes fastball. You‚Äôre sitting fastball, and here comes the changeup. He has the ability to do it in any count.\\" Plans to resume the 2020 season were announced in late June.

The shortest approach not requiring extensive cross-country travel is 23 miles long, beginning at the South Lake trailhead. Charybdis and its sister peak Scylla flank the Enchanted Gorge at its upper end, rising from the east and west sides of the gorge, respectively. Theodore Solomons gave Charybdis its name in 1895 on an expedition through the area. Its name, together with Scylla's, is a reference to the ancient Greek legend of Scylla and Charybdis. In this legend, Scylla and Charybdis are two sea monsters located very close to each other in the narrow Strait of Messina.

These colonies included New South Wales, Van Diemen's Land, Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Queensland. Many of these were initially formed as penal settlements and all were built on land occupied by Indigenous Australians. In order to keep the large number of transported convicts under control, enforce colonial law and to secure the expansion of the colonies from Aboriginal resistance, British armed forces, including the British Army, were deployed and garrisoned in Australia. From 1790 to 1870 over 30 different regiments of the British Army consisting of a combined total of around 20,000 soldiers were based in the Australian British colonies. The New South Wales Corps (1790‚Äì1810) An 1804 watercolour depicting the Castle Hill convict rebellion and its aftermath The first British settlement in Australia of Sydney was formed in 1788 with the protection of four companies of the British marine corps. In 1790 these were mostly replaced with soldiers of the New South Wales Corps, a British Army regiment raised specifically for service in Australia. This regiment was based in Australia until 1810. During this time they were deployed to fight against Aboriginal people, suppress convict uprisings and be garrisoned in further remote places such as Norfolk Island and Van Diemen's Land. The officers of this corps, such as Francis Grose and John Macarthur, are remembered mostly for their corruption and their overthrow of Governor William Bligh during the 1808 Rum Rebellion. The New South Wales Corps is also known as the Rum Corps for their monopolisation on the trade of rum which was the common currency of much of the time of their deployment. In 1795, British settlers were at open war with the Aboriginal inhabitants they were displacing along the Deerubbin (Hawkesbury) River. Lieutenant Governor William Paterson of the NSW Corps ordered 62 soldiers into the area \\"to destroy as many as they could of the wood tribe and...to erect gibbets...whereupon the bodies of all they might kill were to be hung.\\" Several punitive expeditions were conducted resulting in the deaths of over a dozen Darug people. Two years later, soldiers based at Parramatta were involved in a skirmish with a group of Bidjigal warriors led by Pemulwuy. The soldiers captured Pemulwuy and killed five of his associates during this Battle of Parramatta. Further conflict in the Hawkesbury region in 1805 resulted in Governor Philip Gidley King deploying detachments of soldiers to protect the British against the \\"uncivilised insurgents\\". Again a number of armed patrols were organised which ended in more Aboriginal deaths and the capture of the Indigenous resistance leader Musquito. In March 1804, over 200 mostly Irish convicts stationed on a prison farm at Castle Hill near Sydney rebelled and organised themselves into a makeshift armed force. Major George Johnston of the NSW Corps led a detachment of soldiers and loyalist civilians which quickly defeated the rebellion at the Battle of Vinegar Hill. Over 15 convicts were killed, nine were later hanged or gibbeted. Later that month, ten soldiers of the NSW Corps with thirty prisoners from the rebellion and a number of skilled workers were sent by Governor Philip Gidley King to establish a convict colony at the mouth of the Hunter River. This settlement came to be known as Newcastle. 1810s Soldiers of the 46th and 48th Regiments were involved in the capture of bushrangers such as Michael Howe in Van Dieman's Land during this period. In April 1816, three detachments of the 46th were involved in a campaign to suppress Aboriginal resistance along the Nepean River west of Sydney which brought an end to what is now known as the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars. 1820s In March 1821, Captain Francis Allman of the 48th Regiment led a party of forty soldiers and sixty prisoners to form a convict settlement at the mouth of the Hastings River. The settlement was named Port Macquarie. Later that year, during a patrol to locate runaway convicts, ten Irish soldiers in a detachment of the 48th mutinied. A skirmish, dubbed the Battle of Croppy's Hill, ensued which resulted in the suppression of the mutiny and the death of one of the rebels. Soldiers were also involved in the shootings of Aboriginal people along the Wilson River to the west of Port Macquarie during the establishment of agricultural outposts. Multiple soldier fatalities committed by local Aboriginal people and convicts occurred during the nine year period of Port Macquarie being a prison colony. In September 1824, fourteen soldiers of the 40th Regiment led by Lieutenant Henry Miller established the Moreton Bay penal colony. Initially located on the Redcliffe Peninsula, the settlement had to be moved in May 1825 to the north bank of the Brisbane River due to crop failure and conflict with the local Aboriginal people. This new site for the convict prison was called Edenglassie, but soon became known as Brisbane. During a period of martial law in 1824, re-inforcements from the 40th were used against the Wiradjuri people in the Bathurst region of New South Wales. This deployment rapidly concluded the Bathurst War. The British Army lacked a mounted division in the Australian colonies and in 1825 after the war with the Wiradjuri people, it was deemed necessary to form one. The New South Wales Mounted Police was thereby created which consisted of soldiers from various army regiments who volunteered to join the force. This mounted infantry was eventually disbanded in 1850 when it became a civilian policing unit. Colonial propaganda produced during the Black War In Tasmania, from 1824 until 1831, British Army regiments were involved in a sustained and bloody type of guerilla warfare against the local Aboriginal people. Known as the Black War, this conflict claimed the lives of over 200 Britishers while also nearly exterminating the entire remaining population of around 900 Indigenous Tasmanians. Soldiers of the 40th, 63rd, 57th and 39th regiments participated in this conflict. The combat strategy of the British Army during the Black War consisted of three broad methods; pursuit parties, roving parties and the Black Line. Pursuit parties were small garrisons in various frontier localities who would pursue Aboriginal raiders when they attacked, while roving parties were search and destroy patrols. The Black Line was a 300 km long line of soldiers and armed civilians that attempted to sweep the remaining Aboriginal population out of the settled districts and corner them into the Tasman Peninsula. The Black Line strategy was employed toward the end of the war and although it was poorly implemented, it was still able to eliminate the remaining Aboriginal resistance. In September 1824, a contingent of British armed forces including 27 marines and 34 men of the 3rd Regiment established a military outpost on Melville Island in the far north of Australia. The outpost was named Fort Dundas and was the first attempt by the British to colonise the tropical regions of the continent. The settlement was abandoned in 1828 due mostly to the persistent raids by the local Tiwi people. A second attempt by the British to set up an outpost in the area occurred in 1827 at a location on the nearby Cobourg Peninsula. Captain Henry Smyth led 30 soldiers of the 39th Regiment and 14 marines in the construction of this settlement which was given the name of Fort Wellington. Smyth enacted aggressive tactics against the local Iwaidja people including the use of artillery and the proclamation of bounties. After a massacre of Aboriginal people on a beach close to the fort, Smyth was recalled and replaced by Captain Collet Barker who markedly improved relations with the Iwaidja. However, despite Barker's efforts, Fort Wellington was also abandoned in August 1829. In 1826, two privates of the 57th Regiment, Joseph Sudds and Patrick Thompson, concluded that the life of a soldier was worse than that of a prisoner and decided to rob a Sydney shop in order to become convicts. Their scheme incensed Ralph Darling, the then Governor of New South Wales, who ordered them to 7 years hard labour, strapped in irons, chains and spiked collars. Sudds soon died and the resultant controversy saw Governor Darling labelled a tyrant in the colonial press. Darling then instigated a widespread crack down on journalism, which included the jailing of a newspaper editor. 1830s During the early years of the Moreton Bay penal settlement, the 17th Regiment was involved in two documented massacres of Aboriginal Australians. The first was on Moreton Island where, on 1 July 1831, Captain James Clunie with a detachment of soldiers attacked a camp of Ngugi people killing up to twenty of them. George Watkins recorded: \\"nearly all were shot down...a young boy...escaped with a few others by hiding in a clump of bushes\\" The second occurred in December 1832 on the neighbouring island of Minjerribah. Six members of the local Nunukul tribe were killed at the hands of Captain Clunie and the 17th Regiment in a reprisal raid. In January 1834, soldiers of the 4th Regiment garrisoned at Norfolk Island and led by Captain Foster Fyans, were required to quash a major convict uprising. In the conflict that followed, five convicts and a soldier were killed. The superintendent of the penal colony, Colonel James Morisset, allowed Fyans to torture and subject the surviving ringleaders to harsh punishment which earned him the name of \\"Flogger Fyans\\". Fourteen convicts were later sentenced to death and hanged. In October 1834, after several years of ongoing conflict between the British and the Pinjarup people along the Murray River in south-western Western Australia, soldiers of the 21st Regiment were called upon to establish a military outpost in the region. Led by Governor James Sterling, the soldiers with members of mounted police, were soon involved in a skirmish with the Pinjarup that has become known as the Battle of Pinjarra. Probably around forty Pinjarup as well as Captain Theophilus Ellis of the mounted police were killed in this encounter. In the mid 1830s, the Gringai people who lived in the valleys and hills to the north of Newcastle, were at war with the British. In 1835, in response to the murder of four men and two shepherds Richard Bourke, Governor of New South Wales, ordered 50 soldiers from the 17th Regiment to proceed to the scene of the disturbance. This military operation was commanded by Major William Croker, and his directive was to vigorously suppress the resistance. Croker's men returned after a month in the disputed area. 1840s In 1842 a detachment of the 96th Regiment was ordered to proceed to the Port Lincoln settlement where strong Aboriginal resistance had caused the widespread abandonment of land-holdings around that town. Despite having to retreat during a battle with the Battara people near Koppio, the soldiers gained the upper hand after conducting several punitive expeditions. The Governor of Western Australia, Charles Fitzgerald, led a mineral exploration surveying party to Champion Bay and the Murchison River in 1848. Augustus Charles Gregory accompanied the Governor and they were protected by soldiers of the 96th Regiment. Near the Bowes River, the party was surrounded by over 50 local Aboriginal people who threw spears and stones, with one grabbing a man by the arm and threatening to hit him with a dowak. The Governor, fearing the party would be cut off, shot dead one man and was subsequently speared in the leg. As the surveying party retreated, the soldiers gave regular fire and another two people were shot. A lead mining venture was soon functioning in the region and a large detachment of 30 soldiers of the 99th Regiment under Lieutenant L.R. Elliot was garrisoned at Champion Bay to guard the operations. In 1850, Lieutenant Elliot took 15 of these soldiers to construct a fort at Quoin Bluff in Shark Bay to protect guano mining activities there. In 1849 British soldiers of the 11th Regiment based at Brisbane conducted a night-time dispersal of Aboriginal people camped at \\"York's Hollow\\". Led by Lieutenant George Cameron, the detachment split into two groups, surrounded the sleeping members of the camp and fired into it. Several Aboriginal people were wounded.Tom Petrie's Reminiscences of Early Queensland. St Lucia, Queensland: University of Queensland Press. 1992. p. 35. . 1850s British Army troops storming the Eureka Stockade In December of 1854, soldiers of the 12th and 40th Regiments led by Captain John Wellesley Thomas were involved in the suppression of gold-miners associated with the Eureka Rebellion near Ballarat in Victoria. Several soldiers were killed during the conflict at the Eureka Stockade including Captain Wise of the 40th. Around 34 fatalities of the miners occurred. 1860 to 1870 In 1861, a series of anti-Chinese riots perpetrated by European gold-miners at Lambing Flat in New South Wales resulted in the military being deployed to restore order. In February white miners \\"rolled up\\" and violently expelled Chinese miners from the goldfields. The local police force arrested 15 of the rioters but the presence of thousands more subsequently intimidated them into releasing the prisoners. A request for military support was issued and a force of 130 soldiers of the 12th Regiment, supported by around 100 mounted police and artillery, was sent from Sydney under the command of Captain Atkinson. The presence of the soldiers restored calm but after they left in early June, the disturbances rapidly re-ignited. On 30 June, thousands of European miners again attacked the Chinese quarters, with widespread assaulting and pillaging. Two weeks later, when the local police arrested several of the rioters, the miners attacked the police. In the skirmish several miners were killed and the police abandoned Lambing Flat fearing massive reprisals. Assistance from the military was again requested and a force of 225 men was led by Colonel John Kempt was dispatched from Sydney. This force included 110 men of the 12th Regiment with support of dozens of marines and members of the Royal Artillery.

Biography  Ibrahim Emin was born on 18 May 1963 in Sumgayit. In 1970, he started the school ‚Ññ 17 in Sumgayit. He served in the military in 1981-1983. In addition to his musical career, Ibrahim was also involved in painting. He died of esophageal cancer on 2 July 2019.  Career = Yukhu  Ibrahim Emin could play the guitar since his childhood. He started his musical career in the early 1980s. He formed the group \\"Yukhu\\" in 1988. In addition to writing the lyrics and composing music of the songs performed by the group, he also played bass guitar in the band. In 1989, Yuxu won the music festival called \\"Golden Autumn\\" with the song \\"X…ôz…ôrin Sahilind…ô\\" (). After a while, French manager Pascal invited to perform in France. At that time, it was not possible to go directly to France, so they decided to go through Turkey. However, due to unknown reasons, they were unable to travel to France and had to stay and perform in Turkey. Shortly after performing in Turkey, the group began to be recognized. He released three albums in Turkey: \\"X…ôz…ôrin Sahilind…ô\\" (; 1993), \\"Sumgayit\\" (1994), \\"√ñl√ºm…ô √ßar…ô yox\\" (; 2001).

Sirr  Later, Ibrahim Emin returned to Baku in 2003 and formed the band \\"Sirr\\" in Sumgayit in 2004. The album called \\"Yoruldum\\" () was released by the group in 2014.  Quotations  \\"As teenagers, we listened to Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin on BBC radio, and then they became a school for us. We were inspired by their music, and we started playing rock. Then, we formed our group. We recorded the song \\"X…ôz…ôrin Sahilind…ô\\" (). The lyrics belonged to my father, I changed some words and we sang the song.

The genus comprises thirteen species, six of which were described in whole or part by Karl Jordan between 1906‚Äì1942. Two of the species in Hectopsylla, H. psittaci and H. pulex, go under common names, with H. psittaci identified as the sticktight flea and H. pulex identified as the chiggerflea. Hastritter and M√©ndez (2000) consider the genus Rhynchopsyllus a junior system of the genus. Taxonomy Hastritter and M√©ndez (2000) state that Rhynchopsyllus is a junior system of Hectopsylla. The type species, by monotypy, is H. psittaci. Species alt=Map of Argentina with provinces labeled There are thirteen species in the genus Hectopsylla. *Hectopsylla broscus (Jordan & Rothschild, 1906) H. broscus is described as similar to H. coniger, but the bristles of the head are longer, with the proportion of the second segment of the maxillary palpus to the fourth segment being 7:11 in H. broscus and 8:10 in H. coniger. The angle of its frons were described as strongly rounded. In the thorax, the metasternite and pro- processes are narrower, with the meta-thoracic epimerum having three bristles, but rarely four or two. The tarsi of the legs are longer than in H. coniger, with the fifth segment especially being longer. Separate from a vertical row of bristles near the eighth tergite were three or four additional bristles, with the additional bristles not present in H. coniger. A series of twelve female specimen of H. broscus were found on Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk Conepatus humboldtii in Central Pampa, Argentina, in or prior to 1906. *Hectopsylla coniger (Jordan & Rothschild, 1906) The species can be recognized by the fifth tarsal segment over both sexes, the sexual organs of the male, and the metathoracical epimerum of the female, which is curved. On the head, the frons of the female is \\"strongly angulate\\", with the male frons rounded strongly. The metathorax's episternum produces into a triangular process in both sexes. In number, the bristles on its legs are fewer than that of H. psittaci, and its hind femur is shorter than H. psittaci. One male specimen and fourteen female specimen were collected from the hog-nosed skunk Conepatus arequipae in Pampa Olliga, Bolivia, in October 1901. *Hectopsylla cypha (Jordan, 1942) H. cypha was first described by Karl Jordan in 1942. *Hectopsylla eskeyi (Jordan, 1933) H. eskeyi was first described by Jordan in 1933. *Hectopsylla gemina (Jordan, 1939) H. gemina was first described by Jordan in 1939. *Hectopsylla gracilis (Mahnert, 1982) H. gracilis was first described based on a collection of specimen from Eligmodontia typus as well as collection from unidentified rodents from Puerto Madryn, Chubut Province, Argentina; its name derives from the slender process of its metepimeron. The species can be identified by a short, broadly triangular maxillary, with a short genal lobe and, normally, four bristles on its metepimeron. H. gracilis keys near H. ekeyi, H. suarezi, and H. cypha. It is differentiated from those species by its metepimeron, the shorter process of its lateral metanotal area, and the number of bristles on its abdominal terga. The species has been observed on Akodon caenosus. *Hectopsylla knighti (Traub & Gammons, 1950) Its description was based on a sole female specimen taken from an unknown species of swift in Michoac√°n, Mexico. H. knighti was the first species in Hectopsylla to be described outside of South America. *Hectopsylla narium (Blank et al., 2007) The species was found on 204 of 308 nestlings of the burrowing parrot Cyanoliseus patagonus patagonus observed near , R√≠o Negro Province, Patagonia. \\"Freshly-emerged\\" H. narium adults can jump up to horizontally, and vivaciously crawl. Once anchored on skin of the host, females of the species become sessile. Males of the species were observed in the nostrils of the burrowing parrot, but never feeding on nestlings; males and females mated in nasal cavities. The presence of the species in nasal cavities effectuated breathing difficulties in the parrot. Females stuck on nestlings until their death. *Hectopsylla pascuali (Beaucournu and Alcover, 1990) H. pascuali was first described in a 1989 paper that examined 973 fleas from Neuqu√©n Province, Argentina. One male and four females were recorded, with three females taken from the Andean long-clawed mouse Chelemys macronyx in Arroyo Chapelco. *Hectopsylla psittaci (von Frauenfeld, 1860) alt=Labelled map of counties in Arizona H. psittaci is also referred to by the common name \\"stick-tight flea\\" or \\"sticktight flea\\". The flea has been observed from northern Chile on Markham's storm petrel Oceanodroma markhami to Marin County, California on the American cliff swallow Petrochelidon pyrrhonota; based on their age, the American cliff swallows on which the fleas were found had migrated at least once from their winter range in Uruguay, central Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, which lead the authors to state their presence might have been a natural introduction of the flea to California. H. psittaci was found on shama and dhyal birds in the London Zoological Gardens, an apparent result of introduction from an American bird, and on various live pigeons that used zoos as a source for food and shelter. Its maxilla is curved slightly forward and short, compared to the long maxilla in H. pulex. The female frons is longer than the male frons. In the thorax, its epimerum is round above, and narrows ventrally; in the abdomen, segments two to seven of the sternites lack bristles. Its claw has a \\"distinct basal projection.\\" *Hectopsylla pulex (Haller, 1880) In the United States, H. pulex has been found on the lesser long-nosed bat Leptonycteris yerbabuenae in Cochise County, Arizona. H. pulex is also referred to by the common name \\"chiggerflea\\" or \\"chigger flea\\". *Hectopsylla stomis (Jordan, 1925) H. stomis was first described by Jordan in 1925. *Hectopsylla suarezi (C. Fox, 1929) H. suarezi, also known as H. suarez, was first described by Fox in 1929.

The mountain is located in the backcountry of Sequoia National Park. The mountain sits immediately to the south of Kaweah Gap along the main crest of the Great Western Divide. The east face of Eagle Scout Peak is relatively gentle and offers the easiest routes to the summit. The north face drops to Precipice Lake in a series of sheer cliffs. This scene was the backdrop for the Ansel Adams photo \\"Frozen Lake and Cliffs\\". The main route to the summit is a YDS Class 2 scramble up the east face from the Big Arroyo.

On July 15, 1926 Francis Farquhar and three Eagle Scouts (Frederick Armstrong, Eugene Howell, and Coe Swift) made the first recorded ascent of Eagle Scout Peak, hence its name. Eagle Scout Peak does not have particularly high topographic prominence due to a high-elevation ridge connecting it to several higher peaks to the south. However, the sheer vertical drop on the north face makes the mountain visually prominent.

The public prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz, who conducted the investigation of the Berkin Elvan case, was taken hostage by the members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP-C). After the incident, the building was evacuated and security measures were taken by the police. Members of the organization gave a list of requests to the police while threatening to kill the prosecutor. In the incident that lasted about nine hours, Prosecutor Kiraz was killed by DHKP-C militants. The two attackers were also killed.  Background  Berkin Elvan was seriously injured when hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer on the morning of 16 June 2013 during the Gezi Park protests. He remained in a coma until 11 March 2014 when he died. Several protests began in Turkey and in other cities around the world following this incident. Further polarization occurred when Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan catcalled at Berkin Elvan's mother during a meeting and called Berkin Elvan a terrorist. The public's sensitivity towards the Berkin Elvan case increased. Although two and a half years passed from the incident, no result was achieved in the Berkin Elvan case. On 7 March, during a commemoration ceremony for Berkin, his father Sami Elvan said, \\"We still don't see Berkin's murderers around. Still Berkin's murderers continue their lives. But our child is not here. I want everyone to be following this case.\\" Kiraz, the prosecutor appointed in September 2014, was the 5th prosecutor appointed to the investigation. The forensic report was included in the case file during Kiraz's term. It was written in the report that Berkin Elvan was injured as a result of a hard object hitting his head and died while he was being treated at the hospital. In another report sent by the National Criminal Bureau, it was stated that there could be 3 suspect police officers based on the result of the photo examinations. The prosecutor asked for the information of the police officers working at the scene for the purpose of identification. The 3 suspects could not be identified, even after sending the IDs and photographs of the 21 police officers by the security forces. When the suspects could not be fully identified, the prosecutor sent the images to the Gendarmerie Criminelle. Kiraz had also been dealing with some other Gezi Park protest cases since October 2014.  Perpetrators  * ≈ûafak Yayla (born 8 May 1991 in Zonguldak):http://www.haberler.com/safak- yayla-ve-bahtiyar-dogruyol- kimdir-7141590-haberi/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK33cXBO9LU Yayla, who came to the Akyazƒ± district of Sakarya by passing high school entrance exams, studied at Akyazƒ± Anatolian High School for 4 years. Yayla studied for a year in a private school in Akyazƒ± in the last year of high school and finished first in his class, winning a seat in the Istanbul University School of Law. Yayla, who was detained while protesting the participation of the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan at the opening of the academic year in Istanbul University in 2011, stated that he was tortured in custody. He was arrested in 2013 with the claim that he was carrying a bomb. He had met the other suspect Bahtiyar Doƒüruyol while serving his sentence in the Tekirdaƒü F-type prison. He was released in December 2014. * Bahtiyar Doƒüruyol  The prosecutor taken hostage  Mehmet Selim Kiraz, who was born in Siirt in 1969, studied at Mersin ƒ∞mam Hatip School and completed his higher education in Istanbul University School of Law. Kiraz was appointed to Gaziosmanpa≈üa Public Prosecutor's Office from Osmaniye in 2010 with the Decree of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK). After working there for 4 years, Kiraz was appointed as the Istanbul Public Prosecutor with the decree of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors dated 11 June 2014. As part of the division of labor organized by the Chief Public Prosecutor of Istanbul, he was given charge of the Office of Investigations. His wife was also a judge at the Istanbul Justice Palace, with whom he had two children.  Hostage-taking  DHKP-C militants ≈ûafak Yayla and Bahtiyar Doƒüruyol came to the Istanbul Justice Palace with their lawyer robes and fake lawyer IDs and went inside without getting searched. The two militants entered the prosecutor's room and disabled the prosecutor who pressed the panic button. They locked the room from the inside. Security guards could not get into the locked room. The attackers who took the prosecutor hostage at 12:30 announced this at 12:36 via social media. Police teams, who came to the scene, began to negotiate with the attackers. There was a blockage in the talks when the militants asked for the police officers responsible for the murder of Berkin Elvan to be brought there. Temporary broadcasting ban was ordered by the Prime Minister's office around 4:00 pm on the grounds of enforcing national security and public order. The Special Operation Teams started an operation around 8:30 pm. After the operation organized by the Special Operation Teams, the two DHKP-C militants died and the prosecutor was seriously injured. According to another claim, the prosecutor had died by the time the operation ended. Later events Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to Florence Nightingale Hospital. The bullets had hit his head from 3 angles. When he was brought in, he had a heart attack and stopped breathing. Despite an hour of intervention, he could not be saved. According to the forensic report of Florence Nightingale Hospital, a total of 10 bullet wounds, 3 of which were in the head, 6 in the chest and 1 in the leg region, were detected. The necessity to reconsider the security measures implemented by the government in courthouses was discussed following this incident. On 2 April 2015, the General Directorate of Security announced that the bullets that killed Mehmet Selim Kiraz came out of the gun used by the militants not the police. According to the judicial report on 3 April 2015, it was announced that the prosecutor was the target of not 5 but 10 bullets from the front and back. As explained earlier in the report, no statements about a possible 'adjacent shot' was provided.  Judicial process  It was reported in the press that Erdal √únal, nicknamed Zeki, was caught in Italy about 1 week after the incident, as it was determined that had given orders for the prosecutor's death from abroad as an instigator. The preliminary autopsy report for Prosecutor Kiraz was published in the press on April 16, 2015. The cause of death in the report is specified as \\"Internal bleeding due to brain hemorrhage, brain tissue damage, and visceral injury with a skull, rib and scapula bone (scapula) fracture caused by firearm bullets.\\" In addition, it was found out that two bullets of 7.65 mm diameter were removed from Kiraz's body.  Medical reports  Information were given about the process that started within the first minutes of the operation and ended with the prosecutor's arrival in the hospital. President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan stated that 5 bullets hit the Prosecutor and that he was hospitalized with serious injuries, while a spokesman for the police stated that these bullets belonged to the attackers. According to the report of Florance Nightingale Hospital, it was stated in the forensic report that 10 bullets hit the prosecutor. 3 of these bullets hit the head, 6 the chest and 1 the leg. They added to the report that 1 bullet was detected on the front side of the right shoulder and 2 on the backside of the right shoulder. As a result of this report, it was determined that the prosecutor was hit from both the front and back directions. Reactions The chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party Devlet Bah√ßeli reacted to the news by saying \\"Those who organize insulting sessions to Berkin Elvan and inflame polarization should pay the price of innocent lives that disappear.\\" Leader of the Republican People's Party Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu also reacted to the incident and said \\"I would like to ask the government and the intelligence about the prosecutor being taken hostage in front of their eyes; How was it possible to enter the courthouse with tools such as flag, streamer, gun, and plastic clamp? Was a power cut experienced during the introduction of these materials to the courthouse? Or is electricity deliberately cut for this purpose? If the courthouse's existing generator is in operation, who has helped to get these materials in? Does the government's statement of \\"Terrorist attack\\" after the interruption indicate that it had a finger in the hostage-taking incident? Do you have a job description to ensure the country's security and integrity? If a country's National Intelligence Service is dealing with things out of the scope of its job, then everyone can easily enter the office of a prosecutor.\\" Journalist Mirg√ºn Cabas said on Twitter, \\"No matter how this situation ends, there is only one lesson to be learned: do not shoot the children, do not catcall at their mothers.\\"https://twitter.com/MirgunCabas/status/582872054153760768 However, the next day, he apologized following a wave of reactions. People reacted to ≈ûafak Yayla's body being taken to his home in Giresun. Esat Berberoƒülu, uncle of the attacker, commented on these reactions and said, \\"He was a child studying in the law school. What are the reasons for these children to become like this? These children are also our precious. Aren't we human? They will describe him as a terrorist. Curse be upon the real terrorists in this country. Terrorists are those who rob this country.

While a small hamlet today, Shelfield was its own manor throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. Containing about a dozen cottages, Shelfield today is best known for its culture of equestrianism, its handful of Grade II listed buildings, and until 2013 it was also a home to the Baron Kilmaine. The name Shelfield is has its linquistic roots in Old English words scylf and hyll, which translate as 'shelf' and 'hill' respectively, and so the name could be translated as 'shelf hill' or 'hill with a plateau.' While this Shelfield in Warwickshire is not listed in Domesday, another Shelfield in Staffordshire is mentioned as containing a hide of waste belonging to the Manor of Walsall. Transliterating the Domesday Latin the entry reads: In Scelfeld est hida vasta pertinens eidem Manerio. In English: In Shelfield there is one hide of waste appertaining to the said Manor. Although the grammar would mandate that Scelfeld is in the ablative (being the place in which the hide of waste exists), that fact that there is no proper justification for an ablative noun to end in -d. Although uncommon, it should be taken as a third-declension noun with a consonant stem. It would be safe to conclude Scelfeld is the nominative singular of Shelfield despite the fact it is not transcribed as \\"Scelfelde.\\" This interpretation is further justified by a 1469 quietclaim in Walsall which records a witness named Richard Scelfelde; implying 'Scelfelde' is the ablative form of Scelfeld denoting \\"Richard of Shelfield.\\" As such, we see the name Shelfield not only in Old English, but also now in Latin. alt=  History of Shelfield  Shelfield had constituted a part of the larger manor of Aston in its earliest history, but it was regarded as its own manor throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. It is not a manor listed in Domesday, however historians believe it was originally the woodland referred to in the Domesday entry for Aston. It would seem, however, that Shelfield had at one point also contained what is now Shelfield Park. There was some land in Shelfield which \\"was already imparked by the middle of the 13th century, when the second William de Cantilupe granted to Studley Priory all his assarts without the park there as bounded by the road from Spernall to Aston.\\" Today, several historic buildings remain standing. Shelfield Lodge is said to be the old manor house, likely built by the Skinner family circa 1600. Then there is Shelfield House which was likely also built by the Skinner family, although it was build circa 1700.  Lordship of Shelfield  268x268pxThe Manor of Shelfield has a more obscure history than most. Although, few records survive that explicitly document the descent of the manor and the lordship of Shelfield, it is clear that it initially devolved from the chief manor of Alston sometime around 2 July 1314 when William le Walsse is first recorded as holding a plot called \\"Shelfhull.\\" It's these Inquisitions which record that \\"Shelfhull\\" (i.e. Shelfield) comprised a sixth of a knight's fee, held by William le Walsse (alius le Walsh) in 1314 and 1325, and again by a William Walsh in 1376. William held Shelfield from John de Hastings, who would be John Hastings, 2nd Baron Hastings. As such, the de Hastings family owned the manor of Shelfield, and by 1376 it was eventually passed to the 2nd Earl of Pembroke's widow, Anne. Anne's only son was John de Hasings, the 3rd Earl of Pembroke, who died childless. As such, he was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny, in 1390. Then the last official public record documenting the manor of Shelfield was upon the death of Joan Beauchamp, (the wife of William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny, and the daughter of Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel) Lady Bergavenny, on 14 November 1435. She was recorded as holding the manor of Shelfield. Yet, according to Thomas Horsfield, Shelfield seems to have then passed to Edward Neville, the 3rd Baron Bergavenny. Unofficial private records suggest the last Lord of the Manor was a Robert Skinner, who died in 1530. Robert‚Äôs daughter, Katherine, married a Sir Nicholas (appointed Keeper of the Park of Malwyke in 1537), and this is recorded in the Fortescue family history, noting that Robert was \\"Lord of the Manor of Shelfield.\\" Robert's age is unknown so we cannot know for sure when he came to acquire the title. But as the manorial lands remained in the Neville family until the 19th century, if Robert Skinner was in fact the Lord of Shelfield, then this would suggest that the lordship title itself had been detached from the manor when it passed to Robert; where Robert kept the title, and Lord Bergavenny kept the land. Although only extent in Thomas Fortescue's book, this was the last time the title had been used. The historical Arms of the Skinner Lords of Shelfield. Further evidence that the lordship of Shelfield was detached from the manor of Shelfield is found in the fact that Lord Bergavenny was the Lord of Great Wilmcote, while part of the Shelfield lands then passed to George Gibbs of Wilmcote and Adam Palmer of Aston Cantlow, who jointly held the manor of Great Wilmcote since 1561. Then in 1742 the open fields of Shelfield were inclosed by an Act of Parliament ‚Äì creating a legal right to private ownership of once common lands. However, the title to the Lordship of Shelfield has since been successfully restored to a descendant of the aforementioned Gibbs family, who is also an 18th great- nephew of the 3rd Baron Bergavenny.

Reynolds is a career parks administrator who is a former acting director of the United States National Park Service in the Trump administration.  Early life and education  Reynolds is a third-generation National Park Service employee. He spent much of his childhood at Yosemite National Park. His mother's family worked concessions at Yosemite. His father was a planner at the park. His grandfather was a forest ranger at Yellowstone National Park. Reynolds received a bachelor of arts degree in environmental studies at University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1985. He got a master‚Äôs in business administration at Regis University in Denver, Colorado. He was a senior executive fellow at Harvard University in the spring of 2011.  Career  After college, Reynolds worked as a ranger, firefighter and biologist. He served for six years as a natural resource planner for the Parks Service in Denver. He held jobs at the Curecanti National Recreation Area in Colorado, Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts in 1994, and the Mojave National Preserve in California. He was a resource manager, planner and division chief at Yosemite National Park. He became superintendent of Fire Island National Seashore in New York in 2004, deputy Northeast regional director of the National Park Service, and Midwest regional director of the National Park Service. He moved to the National Park Service‚Äôs Washington headquarters in 2014, first as a director of workforce and inclusion and then as director of operations. In 2016, he testified before a House committee to acknowledge sexual harassment at many park sites and pledged to protect workers better.  National Park Service acting director  Reynolds became acting director of the Park Service in January 2017 when Jonathan Jarvis retired. Reynolds had a awkward start with President Donald Trump when the Park Service tweeted aerial photos of Trump's inauguration ceremony showing a crowd much smaller than the record-breaking crowd that Trump claimed. Trump reportedly phoned Reynolds and asked him to find new pictures. Reynolds helped announce new national historical landmarks including the New York State Canal System and the Eldean Covered Bridge. In June 2017, Reynolds reversed an Obama administration policy that had discouraged sales of bottled water at the parks.  Later parks jobs  On January 24, 2018, Reynolds was moved out of the top parks job to lead Yosemite National Park in California. He led a staff of 800 there. On October 23, 2019, Reynolds was appointed as the National Park Service's regional director of the Department of the Interior Lower Colorado Basin, Upper Colorado Basin, and Arkansas-Rio Grande-Texas-Gulf regions.

She began a career in business at age 12, opening a restaurant before entering into the tourism, transportation, food, medical and education sectors. Foning became president of CPDM's women's division in 1992 and was appointed the party's leader in Douala and the national committee five years later. In 2002, she was elected deputy mayor of Douala II and began serving in the National Assembly that same year. Foning led the African Network and Cameroonian Businesswomen and consulted The World Bank, the African Development Bank along with several international agencies. She was founding president of the Association of Cameroonian Businesswomen and the NGO World Female Company Managers. A street in Douala was named in her memory. Biography Foning was born in 1949 to a modest Bamileke family in Cameroon's western region of Menoua. She did not have a proper background, and did not enroll at university but learnt English and French. After encouragement from her family to work, she went into tourism at age 12 in Douala, the Southern Cameroonian port city. In 1966, Foning began a business career by establishing the restaurant New Style to earn extra money. She diversified into the transportation industry by purchasing 2 taxis from the Japanese car manufacturer Toyota, expanding to 150 by 2005. Foning added the gravel company Les Graviers Unis, and the Socamac food and Ovicam export-import companies and the Anflo furniture company to export to Europe and the United States. She joined the Cameroonian Ministry of Tourism as a civil servant in the 1970s before deciding to focus on her business career. Foning brought a medical clinic in Dschang and established the school Coll√©ge de la Faternit√© in the city. This led the government of Cameroon and the local authorities of Foning's home region to award her with honours for her activities. The kingdom of Bamun granted her the title of Nijh and Menoua's Bafou community crowned her as its queen. Foning also received the Grand Officer Order of Merit. At Douala in 1992, she was appointed president of the women's wing of the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM). Foning became president of the CPDM in Douala and its national central committee in 1997, following a 1996 reform by the political party to allow women to lead sections of the party. She was close to Chantal Biya, the wife of Paul Biya, the president of Cameroon, and the two worked at the Foundation Chantal Biya. In 2002, Foning was elected the deputy mayor of Douala II, and began serving in the National Assembly that year. She focused on helping the young, building power lines, health centres, roads, schools, eliminating illness and organising funeral services. In June 2003, she was involved in the signing of a \\"partnership convention\\" to train Douala's \\"bendskin drivers\\" at professional driving schools. Foning was involved in a car accident a month later. which fractured both her legs on the Douala-Bafoussam road in Nomayos I in Cameroon's Centre region, and caused her to be flown to France for medical attention on the orders of Paul Biya. The accident meant she walked with a limp. She was named African manager of the year in 2004. In 2005, Foning was elected president of the World Association of Women Entrepreneurs, having been its vice-president since 1996. Later that year in October, she became the first black woman president of the NGO World Female Company Managers (WFCL). Foning lost her seat in the 2007 Cameroonian parliamentary election by securing 41 per cent of the vote over the winning candidate's who garnered 48 per cent of votes. Although she was accused of embezzling money from the municipal government, she was re-elected to the National Assembly in 2009. Foning left her role as president of the WFCL in 2012. She was the Association of Cameroonian Businesswomen's founding president, led the African Network for the Support for Female Entrepreneurship and consulted The World Bank, the African Development Bank and several international agencies. Foning took part in several international conferences and meetings, including the USA/Africa summit in Washington, D.C. She was also international vice-president of the Francophone Business Forum, permanent secretary Africa of the AGOA training center (African Growth Opportunity Act), and was president of the Chamber of Commerce's Industry Department. Personal life and death  Foning praised the Cameroonian presidential couple at official ceremonies and her fellow citizens called her \\"national leader\\" as a result. She had been married three times, and had six children. On 18 January 2015, Foning attended a meeting of the 4th assembly of the United Cities and Councils of Cameroon in the Cameroonian capital of Yaound√©. After leaving the meeting, the driver of her car carrying her and her bodyguard lost control on the Yaound√© Bafoussam road in Ebebda after attempting to avoid a motorcycle passing a lorry holding sand in the opposite direction at high speed, causing the car to roll several times. Foning broke her legs and ribs, and was immediately transported to the emergency unit at Central Hospital of Yaound√©. Foning died from a sudden spike of blood pressure and hypertension on the morning of 23 January, with the news made public by hospital officials about midday. Funeral On 18 March, Paul Biya signed an decree instituting the official funeral service for Foning to be held five days later. A vigil and masses were held in her honor before the funeral. Work on the burial site by companies in Douala was completed on 20 March. The brief ecumenical service service was held in the palace of Johny Baleng in Menoua with members of her family and government officials in attendance on 21 March. Foning was interned at the family home afterwards. Legacy She was posthumously conferred the Grand Condor of the Order of Merit by Phil√©mon Yang, the Prime Minister, and the foundation of the Francoise Foning Foundation to help retain the memory of her work in the public was announced by her son. Foning was replaced as president of Association of Cameroonian Businesswomen by Agn√®s Ntube Ndode, and the contest to take her place as mayor of Douala 5 ended with Carlos Ngoualem winning the election on 5 August. At the request of her family, a street in the Douala 5 district linking the Akwa-Nord Pharmacy to the Makepe Roundabout bearing the name Rue Fran√ßoise Foning was renamed from No 5.508 to honour her in late 2016. An accompanying plague was installed at both ends of the street and a monograph on the life and works of Foning was published in 2017.

It was first isolated as a component of an extract of Iceland moss in 1813, along with lichenin. After further analysis and characterization of the individual components of the extract, isolichenan was named in 1881. It is the first Œ±-glucan to be described from lichens. The presence of isolichenan in the cell walls is a defining characteristic in several genera of the lichen family Parmeliaceae. Although most prevalent in that family, it has also been isolated from members of the families Ramalinaceae, Stereocaulaceae, Roccellaceae, and Lobariaceae. Experimental studies have shown that isolichenan is produced only when the two lichen components ‚Äì fungus and alga ‚Äì are growing together, not when grown separately. The biological function of isolichenan in the lichen thallus is unknown. Early studies Cetraria islandica, seen here growing in a Swedish forest, is the lichen species from which isolichenan was first isolated. Isolichenan was first isolated from Cetraria islandica in 1813 by Swedish chemist J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius, who also at the same time isolated the cellulose-like hot-water soluble glucan lichenan. Because in these experiments the isolichenan component of the lichen extract had a positive reaction with iodine staining (i.e. production of a blue colour), Berzelius thought it to be similar in nature to starch, and he called it \\"lichen starch\\". It was thought to function as a reserve food source for the organism. Later studies showed it to be a mixture of polysaccharides. In 1838, Gerardus Johannes Mulder isolated the blue-staining component of the C. islandica extract, believing it to be starch. Friedrich Konrad Beilstein gave the name \\"isolichenan\\" to this substance in 1881. Isolichenan was the first Œ±-glucan described from lichens. Structure Isolichenan is a polymer of glucose units joined by a mixture of Œ±-(1‚Üí3) and Œ±-(1‚Üí4) linkages. Using the technique of partial acid hydrolysis, Stanley Peat and colleagues determined that the linkages are of the Œ±-configuration. The ratio of these linkages has been reported differently by various authors in the scientific literature: 11:9, 3:2, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1. Fleming and Manners found the ratio to be 56.5:43.5 and 57:43 in two separate procedures. The distribution of linkages was found to be somewhat irregular, with both types occurring in groups of two or more in at least some areas; another study suggests that isolichenan has mostly groups of one or two Œ±-(1‚Üí3) bonds surrounded by Œ±-(1‚Üí4) bonds. The relatively weak intensity of the iodine-staining reaction of isolichenan, compared with for example amylose (a linear Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-linked glucan and the major component of starch), is thought to be a result of its preponderance of (1‚Üí3) linkages. This reduces the formation of the polyiodide-complex that gives the positive reaction its blue colour. The chain length of isolichenan was estimated at 42‚Äì44 glucose units. The reported molecular weight of isolichenan also varies, from 26 kD to 2000 kD. The relatively short chain length of isolichenan may explain why it is soluble in cold water after it has been extracted from the lichen thallus. Purified isolichenan has a high positive specific rotation in water. It has been reported as high as +272, although different sources give differing values. The term \\"isolichenan-type\\" has been used as a general term for Œ±-D- glucans having (1‚Üí3)-(1‚Üí4) linkages in their main chain. Similar to isolichenan, the Œ±-D-glucan known as Ci-3 consists of 1‚Üí3 and 1‚Üí4 linked Œ±-D- glucose residues in ratio of 2:1, but with a much higher degree of polymerization and a molecular weight of about 2000 kD. It is also found in Cetraria islandica. As the discrepancies in reported values demonstrate, lichens produce isolichenan-type polysaccharides with considerable variation in linkage ratios as well as molecular weight, even within the same species. The carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of isolichenan was reported by Yokota and colleagues in 1979 and also by Gorin and Iacomini in 1984. Occurrence Since its discovery in Cetraria islandica, isolichenan has been isolated from many other lichen species. It is predominant in the Parmeliaceae, a large and diverse family of the class Lecanoromycetes. Parmeliaceae genera and species containing isolichenan include: Alectoria (A. sulcata, A. sarmentosa); Cetraria (Cetraria cucullata, C. islandica, C. nivaris, C. richardsonii; Evernia (E. prunastri); Letharia (L. vulpina); Neuropogon (N. aurantiaco-ater); Parmelia (P. caperata, P. cetrarioides, P. conspersa, P. hypotrypella, P. laevior, P. nikkoensis, P. saxatilis, P. tinctorum); Parmotrema (P. cetrarum, P. araucaria, P. sulcata); and Usnea (U. barbata, U. baylei, U. faciata, U. longissima, U. meridionalis, U. rubescens). A few members of the family Ramalinaceae have been shown to contain isolichenan, including Ramalina celastri, R. ecklonii, R. scopulorum, and R. usnea. In the family Stereocaulaceae, isolichenan has been isolated from S. excutum, S. japonicum, and S. sorediiferum. It is also known to occur in single species in the Roccellaceae (Roccella montagnei) and the Lobariaceae (Pilophoron ocicularis). Uses A blister pack with cough lozenges containing Cetraria islandica extract Although isolichenan is not nearly as constant at the genus level as lichenan, the presence of isolichenan in the cell walls is a defining character in several genera of the lichen family Parmeliaceae, including Asahinea, Cetrelia, Flavoparmelia, and Psiloparmelia. In contrast, the absence of isolichenan is a character of genus Xanthoparmelia. Isolichenan is used as an active ingredient in cough lozenges as a component of Cetraria islandica extract. Research Isolichenan was shown to enhance hippocampal plasticity and behavioural performance in rats. When administered orally, isolichenan was also shown to improve memory acquisition in mice impaired by ethanol, as well as in rats in which memory impairment had been induced by beta-amyloid peptide. In more recent research, isolichenan was shown to improve cognitive function in healthy adults. The main Œ±-glucan synthesized by lichens of the genus Ramalina in the symbiotic state is isolichenan. A series of experiments have shown, however, that it is not produced by either individual symbiont when cultivated apart from each other. Its absence in this circumstance suggests that it may not have an importance as a structural part of the fungal cell wall; this contrasts with lichenan, where the (1‚Üí3)(1‚Üí4)-Œ≤-glucan has been shown to be involved in cell wall structure. Isolichenan is synthesized by the mycobiont only in the presence of its symbiotic partner (the green alga Trebouxia) in a special microenvironment ‚Äì the lichen thallus. The triggering of this phenomenon and the biological function of isolichenan in the symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae is still unknown.

Similarly, although developed for detecting aircraft, it saw extensive service in anti-submarine and maritime patrol roles and was one of the first radars to be used in researching extreme weather like hurricanes by agencies like the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA). As well as the United States, the radar was used by a large number of services in other countries, including the French Navy, Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF), Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Early versions of the radar could see a low-flying aircraft at and a ship at . This was improved, so that later versions had a range against aerial targets of . Background From the early days of its development, radar had been used to detect aircraft. Early apparatus was large and required substantial power, and so was limited to fixed locations. However, during World War II, increasingly smaller radar sets were developed that could be more installed in smaller platforms like aircraft. At the same time, the United States Navy (USN) was aware that attacks from the aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy were the largest threat to their warships and protecting these ships became more dependent on aircraft carriers and their squadrons. Shipborne radar did not have sufficient range to identify attacking bombers in time to launch defensive [interceptor aircraft due to the radar horizon. The solution lay in placing a radar in an aircraft. Night fighter radars proved inadequate for the task. Optimised for aerial combat, they were too short ranged to fulfil the necessary long-range aerial surveillance role. Design and development General Motors TBM-3W The radar in a TBM-3W The solution to the problem of detecting objects beyond the horizon lay in developing a dedicated airborne early warning radar. On 2 February 1942, the USN commissioned the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to explore an airborne radar design dedicated to seeking aircraft under Project Cadillac, named after the Cadillac Mountain in Maine. The team grew rapidly from thirty seven, including ten officers, in May 1943 to one hundred thirty eight at the end of the War. The outcome of the development was an S-Band radar designated AN/APS-20. Development continued in two guises. Cadillac I, the initial platform, was to be carrier-based and the first radar was to be fitted to converted General Motors TBM-3 Avenger torpedo bombers. Simultaneously, the need for a version for larger land-based aircraft was recognised. Under the guise of Cadillac II, it was decided that the Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress heavy bomber was to be fitted with the radar. The production radar was manufactured by General Electric and Hazeltine. The first version, the AN/APS-20A, had, initially, an antenna and operated on a frequency of 2850 MHz in the S band. Later a slightly smaller antenna was used. The scanner was two speed, 3 and 6 revolutions per minute. The radar worked at a Pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 300 Hz, a pulse length of . Peak power was . The AN/APS-20B, designed to be carried by larger aircraft, differed in size and capability. It had a peak power of and a horizontal beam width of 1.5¬∞ and vertical of 6¬∞. Pulse width remained 2 Œºs. Range was extended to against low flying aircraft and against shipping. Later versions expanded the capability. The AN/APS-20F extended the range against aircraft to , while the larger AN/APS-20E could detect an aerial target at . Initially deployed in 1953, the E model operated in the L band, S band and X band, with a wide selection of PRFs and pulse widths in each band. It also included automatic target indication, three choices of heading reference and stabilization, selectable azimuth and elevation beam widths, selectable output and receiver radiated gain and automatic gain control amongst other features. Service=Trials and initial use The first aircraft equipped with the AN/APS-20 was a converted TBM-3 Avenger, designated XTBM-3W, which first flew on 5 August 1944. The radar was mounted in a radome under the forward fuselage. A series of aircraft were converted from existing TBM-3 airframes by the Naval Aircraft Modification Unit and designated TBM-3W, with initial training aboard the aircraft carrier starting in May 1945. At the same time, thirty one large Boeing PB-1W aircraft were converted from B-17G Flying Fortresses to become the first land-based aircraft equipped with the radar. They were especially designed to combat the increasing threat of Japanese Kamikaze attacks. The crew of the Avenger consisted of, as well as the pilot, a single Radar Operator (RO). The larger size of the PB-1W allowed for two ROs, an Electronics Technician and, critically, a Combat Information Center (CIC) Officer supported by two radio operators. The latter team was able to direct aircraft to the target, adding the ability of the aircraft to control fighter aircraft and enabling operation independent of shipboard or ground- based control. This capability was later developed into the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS). The War ended before either aircraft became operational. Post-war, the USN quickly accelerated a program to get the radar into service. The AN/APS-20 was installed in the Douglas AD3-W Skyraider, which replaced the Avenger, and the Lockheed PO-2W Warning Star, a specialised platform developed from the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation airliner. Both also saw service outside the USN. The latter, which could carry up to 32 servicemen for long trips, so impressed the newly formed United States Air Force (USAF) that it ordered it into service as the Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star. Following a test between 24 February and 23 March 1953, the USAF used their aircraft to mount a near-continuous monitor of potential incursion by the Soviet Air Forces of American continental airspace. At the same time, the Royal Navy procured fifty examples of the AD3-W as the Skyraider AEW.1. This was the first use of the radar the a non-US operator. Meanwhile, in an attempt to extend endurance, in 1954 the USN ordered the installation of the radar in a blimp, the ZP2N-1W, later redesigned ZPG-2W and then, in 1962, EZ-1B. This was superseded by the even larger ZPG-3W. Expanding capabilities Alongside these developments, new uses of the radar were explored. One arena where the radar broke new ground was in weather research, particularly with the hurricane hunters that flew into tropical cyclones. The first trials of the radar took place in 1946 with a PB-1W and in 1955 the USN redesignated squadron AEW-4, which was equipped with the radar, to VW-4 to recognise its change in emphasis from simply Airborne Early Warning to include Weather Reconnaissance. The aircraft frequently flew up to three times a week on tropical cyclone observation. At the same time, VW-1 was providing a similar service tracking typhoons in the Pacific. Other users of the radar included the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) and its successor the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Aircraft operated by these agencies were also made available to universities, and therefore the radar was also used as a tool for academic research where its attributes proved invaluable in the study of precipitation. It was used in a wide range of airframes, including converted Douglas DC-6 airliners and the dedicated Lockheed WP-3A Orion which served into the 1970s. AN/APS-20E radome on a Japanese P2V-7 Meanwhile, in 1948, the UK evaluated a PB-1W equipped with AN/APS-20 against a Vickers Warwick V fitted with ASV.13 to see if the radar could also be used to identify surface ships, but the peak power was deemed too high and the pulse length too long for the application. Nonetheless, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) used the radar in their maritime surveillance Canadair Argus Mk.1. The USN also looked to mount the radar on its carrier- borne anti-submarine aircraft, commissioning Grumman to use it in the design which eventually became the Grumman S2F Tracker. Of greater impact, however, was the improved AN/APS-20E subsequently used in the role in the Lockheed P2V Neptune. The radar first flew in the third airframe, designated P2V-2S, which was the first developed for the anti-submarine role. It proved effective at identifying large surface ships up to away but was ineffectual when tracking periscopes. AN/APS-20 was also briefly used as part of the Space Race, with Project Mercury. Its long range enabled it to be used in tracking and other tasks. Of particular use was finding the returning space capsule after splashdown. For example, the radar was installed aboard aircraft of VP-5 that were involved in the recovery of Commander Alan Shepard from Mercury-Redstone 3, Captain Gus Grissom from Mercury-Redstone 4 and Commander Wally Schirra from Mercury-Atlas 8. Replacement for the radar took many decades. The USAF trialled the more advanced AN/APS-82, which provided target height data, in 1956 but waited until after 1962 before replacing the radar with the AN/APS-95 aboard their Warning Stars. In the meantime, the USN introduced the AN/APS-82 on board carriers in the airborne early warning role in 1959. The AN/APS-80, which offered similar capabilities to the AN/APS-20 but added continuous 360¬∞ area search coverage, replaced the radar in the anti-submarine role from 1961. The Canadians finally replaced their AN/APS-20 with AN/APS-115 in 1981. The last operator of the radar was the Royal Air Force (RAF), which had previously used it between 1952 and 1957. When the Royal Navy retired their last AN/APS-20, they were refurbished and fitted to retiring Avro Shackleton MR.2 maritime patrol aircraft. Re-entering service in 1972 with the RAF, the aircraft continued to operate until July 1991.

Coal mining Dehing-Patkai landscape has been a site for legal and illegal coal mining. In April 2020, a coal mining project in the Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve was approved by the National Board for Wildlife of India. Nearly a hundred hectares of land from reserve forest land was approved for a coal mining project by North-Easter Coal Field (NECF), a unit of Coal India Limited. This decision was challenged by environmental groups from Assam and other parts of the country, which highlighted the rich biodiversity harboured in the Dehing Patkai landscape. As a result of these awareness campaigns and protests, the North Eastern Coalfields (NEC), temporarily halted all of its operations in the region from June 3, 2020.

The phablets were announced on 5 August 2020 alongside the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2, Galaxy Watch 3, Galaxy Buds Live and Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 during Samsung's Unpacked Event. Due to restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic on public and social gatherings, the Note 20 range were unveiled digitally at Samsung's newsroom in South Korea. At the event, Samsung announced that the smartphones include support for 5G connectivity, which allows for higher-bandwidth and lower-latency mobile connections where 5G network coverage is available. The Note 20's S-Pen has up to 4√ó better latency than that of previous generations. Grey, Green, and Mystic Bronze are colour options for the Note 20; Black and White are colour options for the Note 20 Ultra. Unlike its predecessor, the Note 20 range does not feature a \\"+\\" model. The Galaxy Note 20 series also include a number of new software features, which include performance optimization for mobile gaming, wireless sync with desktop and laptop PCs, and improved DeX features for remotely connected to compatible devices.  Design  The Galaxy Note 20 series maintains a similar design with the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy S20, with an Infinity-O display (first introduced on the Galaxy S10) containing a circular punch hole in the top center for the frontal selfie camera. The rear camera array is located in the corner with a rectangular protrusion like the Galaxy S20, housing three cameras. Both use anodized aluminum for the frame like their predecessors. The Note 20 uses Gorilla Glass 5 for the screen; the back panel is reinforced polycarbonate, which has not been seen on a Note series phone since the Note 4 and Note Edge. The Note 20 Ultra has Gorilla Glass Victus for the screen. Global color options are, Mystic Bronze, Mystic Grey, Mystic Green, Mystic Black, Mystic White, and Mystic Green. Moreover, the Mystic Green, Mystic Bronze and Mystic Grey color options on the Note 20, have a matte finish, whereas, only the Mystic Bronze on the Note 20 Ultra, has a matte finish. Mystic Bronze is available on both models, whereas Mystic Grey and Mystic Green, are limited to the Note 20; Mystic Black and Mystic Crush White are limited to the Note 20 Ultra. For the Note 20, Aura Red is exclusive to SK Telecom with 256 GB of storage, replacing Mystic Green in South Korea; Prism Blue will be sold in India.  Specifications = Hardware  Chipsets = The Galaxy Note 20 line comprises two models with various hardware specifications; international models of the Note 20 utilize the Exynos 990 system-on-chip, while the U.S. models utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+. Both of the SoCs are based on a 7 nm+ processing technology node. The Exynos chipset comes the Mali-G77 MP11 GPU, whereas the Snapdragon chipset comes with the Adreno 650 GPU. = Display = The Galaxy Note 20 does not feature a curved display like the one found on the Note 20 Ultra. The Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra feature a 6.7-inch 1080p and 6.9-inch 1440p display, respectively. Both use an AMOLED with HDR10+ support and \\"dynamic tone mapping\\" technology, marketed as Super AMOLED Plus for the Note 20 and Dynamic AMOLED 2X for the Note 20 Ultra. The Note 20 has a fixed 60 Hz refresh rate, however, the Note 20 Ultra offers a variable 120 Hz refresh rate. The settings have two options, 60 Hz and Adaptive, the latter of which uses a variable refresh rate that can adjust based on the content being displayed, enabled by a more energy efficient LTPO backplane. Unlike the S20 series, the display will remain at 120 Hz regardless of the device's battery level, and can handle slightly higher temperatures before switching to 60 Hz. Adaptive mode is limited to an FHD resolution, requiring users to switch to 60 Hz mode to enable QHD resolution. Both models utilize an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint sensor. = Storage = The base amount of RAM is 8 GB, paired with 128 or 256 GB of internal storage standard. The Note 20 Ultra has 12 GB RAM and 512 GB UFS options, and has up to 1 TB of expandable storage via the microSD card slot. = Batteries = The Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra use non- removable Li-Ion batteries, rated at 4300 mAh and 4500 mAh respectively. Qi inductive charging is supported as well as the ability to charge other Qi- compatible device from the Note 20's own battery power, which is branded as \\"Samsung PowerShare\\"; wired charging is supported over USB-C at up to 25 W. = Connectivity = The duo come with 5G standard connectivity, though some regions may have special LTE or sub-6GHz only variants, and both omit the audio jack. It has NFC, eSIM, and Ultra-wideband technology. = Cameras = The Note 20 features similar camera specifications to that of the Samsung Galaxy S20, which include a 12 MP wide sensor with 1.8 aperture, a 64 MP telephoto sensor with 2.0 aperture, and a 12 MP ultrawide sensor with 12mm equivalent focal length. The telephoto camera supports 3√ó hybrid optical zoom and 10√ó digital zoom, which combined enables 30√ó hybrid zoom. The Note 20 Ultra has a more advanced camera setup than its counterpart, which include a 108 MP wide sensor, a 12 MP \\"periscope\\" telephoto sensor, and a 12 MP ultrawide sensor. The telephoto camera has a focal length of 120mm (35mm equivalent), which equals 5√ó optical zoom, and allows for 50√ó hybrid zoom (assisted by digital zoom). Laser autofocus is used in favor of the S20 Ultra's time-of-flight camera. The Note 20's telephoto sensor and the Note 20 Ultra's wide sensor use pixel binning to output higher quality images at a standard resolution, with the wide-angle sensor using Nonacell technology which groups 3x3 pixels to capture more light. The front camera uses a 10 MP sensor, and can record 4K video. Single Take, introduced on the S20 series, allows users to capture photos or videos simultaneously with different sensors automatically. Both models can record 8K video at 24fps. On the Note 20, this is enabled by the 64 MP telephoto sensor, whereas the Note 20 Ultra's 108 MP wide sensor natively supports 8K video. = S-Pen = The S-Pen has better latency at 26ms on the Note 20 and 9ms on the Note 20 Ultra, reduced from 42ms on the Note 10 and Note 10+. Additionally, it gains five new Air gestures that work across the UI by utilizing the accelerometers and gyroscope, as well as 'AI-based point prediction'. Battery life has also been improved from 10 hours to 24 hours. =Accessories= Earbuds are included in some countries such as the UK, but are not bundled in others such as the US.  Software  The devices will ship with Android 10 and One UI 2.5. A beta test for Android 11 is expected to be released later on in the year. = Xbox Game Pass = Samsung has partnered with Xbox to offer Xbox games on the Note 20. In certain markets, the Galaxy Note 20 will be offered with three months of free Xbox game pass along with an Xbox game pad; Xbox games will be playable from the phone to the TV. More than 90 Xbox games are playable on the Note 20.  Reception  Preliminary reviews from various technology review websites, such as TechRadar and The Verge, praised the Note 20 series for its redesigned S-Pen and camera performance. However, the baseline Note 20 was criticized for its lower quality display and plastic build despite the high starting price point. Writing for TechRadar, James Peckham said in his verdict, \\"the Galaxy Note 20 is Samsung's new entry-level stylus-included smartphone for 2020, but it's one that doesn't seem particularly exciting for the usual Note-loving crowd. It highlights some more affordable features compared to its more exciting Ultra sibling but it may well be just as good for those who don‚Äôt want to spend top dollar.\\" There was a pronounced difference in the performance of the two processors available, which caused concern that Exynos models were an inferior product, as the differentials were not as large in previous models.

The Mysore forces under King Chikka Devaraja defeated the Maratha forces and their allies under Sambhaji, forcing him to retreat temporarily.  Background  Sambhaji's grandfather Shahaji had conquered territories in the states of Karnatka. Mohammed Adil Shah, Sultan of Bijapur granted him the Jagir of Bangalore. This was the entry of the Marathas in the Southern India. Shivaji had established Maratha territories in the Southern India in his 2 year long campaign of 1676-78. The Maratha Empire and the Kingdom Mysore were the main contenders to dominate the region. The relationship between the two kingdoms was hostile. Marathas attacked Srirangapatna in 1681, but they were defeated. The Maratha Sardar Harji Raje Mahadik also defeated the Mysore general Kumaraiya. Both forces had tried to subdue each other resulting in a stalemate. Sambhaji also tried to form a Deccan alliance against the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Chikkadevaraya allied himself with Aurangzeb and executed the Maratha generals Dadaji Kakade, Jaitaji Katkar and Santaji Nimbalkar. This enraged Sambhaji and he attacked the Kingdom of Mysore in June 1682 with his allies Qutb Shahi dynasty and the Nayakas of Hukkeri. Allied forces reached Banavar in June 1682. Lingappa, the Mysore officer at Banavar told this news to Chikkadevaraya.  Battle  Chikkadevaraya hearing the news. Immediately left Mysore his strong contingent of 15,000 expert archers. He wanted to attack before the allies settled in the region. Both sides prepared for the battle. And the Battle began with small skirmishes. Soon, Chikkadevaraya realised that the allied forces did not have archers. He arranged his archers in a semicircular formation and started showering arrows on the allied army. The Marathas did not expect this and the arrows started mounting casualties In the allied army. Maratha commanders tried but were unable to stop the rout. Some more reinforcements joined the Marathas during the battle, but they suffered heavy casualties in the battle. The Mysore archers took a break for dinner in the night. Sambhaji decided to retreat to avoid more casualties and he retreated towards Thanjavur.  Aftermath  This was a significant victory for Mysore forces and Chikkadevaraya marked it with an inscription. Sambhaji defeated Chikkadevaraya in the ensuing battles. Sambhaji captured several fortresses in northern Madhurai region. He also held all the province of Dharmapuri and other neighbouring territories. Chikkadevaraya then paid tribute to the Marathas.

Born in Uslar, Deichmann was orphaned at an early age and went to work in a cigar factory at the age of 11. He moved to Bremen in 1884, and soon joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the German Tobacco Workers' Union. He became associated with the right wing of the trade union movement, and worked closely with Friedrich Ebert. In 1900, he was elected as the president of the union, and from 1910 until 1918, he additionally served as General Secretary of the International Federation of Tobacco Workers. In 1912, he was elected to the Reichstag. Deichmann was a supporter of the November Revolution and joined the Bremen Workers' and Soldiers' Council, but he opposed the idea of a workers' republic. In 1919, he joined the provisional B√ºrgerschaft of Bremen, where he took on responsibility for the police. He was then elected to the regularly constituted B√ºrgerschaft, which appointed him to the Senate of Bremen. From 1919 until 1920, he served as President and Mayor of the Senate. He was again appointed to the Senate in 1928, with responsibility for policing, and became the Mayor of the Senate again. In 1931, Deichmann retired, due to poor health. He died in 1940.

It was a result of a 2015 international symposium of representatives of academics, religious authorities, inter- governmental organisations, and civil society across a broad cross section of Muslim communities ahead of the Paris Climate Change Conference in 2015-2016. Event of Declaration The Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change was launched in Istanbul as part of a two-day International Islamic Climate Change Symposium in Istanbul in 17-18 August 2015. Hosted jointly by Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, ISESCO and International Islamic Fiqh Academy, the symposium was co-organised by Islamic relief worldwide, alongside the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Science (IFEES), and supported by climate-based civil society network Climate Action Network (CAN). The declaration was endorsed by the grand mufti‚Äôs of Lebanon and Uganda, along with prominent Islamic scholars and teachers hailing from 20 countries all over the Muslim world. Message of the Declaration The declaration is based on an environmental framework present within the principles of Islam, and is part of faith-based climate activism. Its core stems from the essence of a body of ethics known as the Knowledge of Creation (Ilm ul khalq), which is based on the Holy Qur‚Äôan. It is part of a spiritual fight against climate change, alongside similar calls by the Catholic Pope and other religious figures. The Islamic Climate Change Declaration iterates a call to reject human greed for natural resources, have respect for ‚Äúperfect equilibrium‚Äù of nature, and focused on the need for recognition of the ‚Äúmoral obligation‚Äù towards conservation. Contents of the Declaration The focus of the title is on climate change, and sidelines other ecological concerns. The preamble of the declaration begins with doctrinal affirmation that God created the world. This is connected to the concept of oneness and tied to the unity of creation, giving credence to the idea that the planet is shared by all humanity. The role of human beings as God's Khalifah on earth, or stewards of God's creation, forms a central tenet of the Islamic declaration on climate change, since human beings have failed to lived to their duty of stewardship, and have corrupted and abused the earth instead. The example of the Prophet Muhammad and his lifestyle is brought forward to highlight practical manifestations of Islamic principles of conservation and eco-friendliness.

The Maratha forces and their allies under Sambhaji besieged and captured the city of Tiruchirappalli.  Background  Shahaji had conquered territories in the states of Karnatka. Mohammed Adil Shah, Sultan of Bijapur granted him the Jagir of Bangalore. This was the entry of the Marathas in the Southern India. The Maratha Empire and the Kingdom of Mysore had rivalry in South India. Chikkadevaraya, the king of Mysore had challenged the Marathas in the South. Several battles were fought between them. Both sides won and lost some battles. As a result Sambhaji and his allies invaded Mysore in June 1682. Chikka Devaraja soundly defeated them at the Battle of Banavar. Sambhaji and his forces retreated near Thanjavur.  Tactics and Plans  Sambhaji rested near Thanjavur for 20 days. He received more reinforcements from Hukkeri and Golconda. His uncle Ekoji I also joined forces with him. Sambhaji had realised the strength of Mysore forces near their heartland. He decided to draw them away from their stronghold to flat plains near Madurai. He decided to attack and besiege the city of Tiruchirapalli. The weakened Nayaka of Madurai, Chokkanatha Nayak lived on the fort. He was a vassal of the Kingdom of Mysore. Still, the city had strong defences and a formidable Mysore garrison in the city and on the fort. Sambhaji wanted to negate the superiority of Mysore archers. During their rest time Sambhaji ordered all the cobblers from neighbouring villages and made leather arrow-proof jackets for his entire army. These leather jackets were coated with a layer of oil to avoid arrows from getting stuck in the jackets. Sambhaji also collected the abundantly available war elephants from the surrounding region. He ordered all the boatmen from the nearby villages to assemble with his army. 300 archers of the Maratha army were prepared to fire lit arrows during the attack.  Battle  Tiruchirapalli lied on the opposite bank of the Kaveri river. At the dawn, the Maratha forces crossed the river using the boats collected from nearby villages. The sudden attack of the Marathas surprised the Mysore defenders, they started showering arrows on the Maratha Army. The Maratha leather jackets provided effective protection and negated arrows from the Mysore bowmen. Elephants broke through the main doors in the meanwhile and fierce battle ensued on the streets of Tiruchirappalli. Marathas captured the city by the evening but the Tiruchirapalli Rock Fort was still controlled by the Mysore army. Meanwhile Chokkanatha Nayak died on the fort. Sambhaji with a force of 10,000 laid siege to the fort after 10 days. The Marathas again adopted similar tactics to negate Mysore archers. The Maratha archers accurately struck lit arrows on the ammunitions depot within the fort resulting in a huge explosion, and collapse of the wall. The Marathas soon entered and captured the fort. The Marathas sacked Tiruchirapalli. Historian Sadashiv Shivde has mentioned that, this victory was a success point of Sambhaji's military intelligence.  Aftermath  The defeat at Tiruchirapalli dealt a severe blow to Chikkadevaraya. Several of his allies joined Sambhaji. Sambhaji captured several fortresses in the northern provinces of Madurai. He also held all the province of Dharmapuri and other neighbouring territories. Chikkadevaraya entered negotiations with Sambhaji and brought an end to the war by paying the tribute. According to Maratha sources a treaty was signed at Srirangapatna in which he paid 1 Crore Honas as a war tribute to Sambhaji. However this was a temporary surrender and the conflicts continued in the following years.

The series follows a new group of idols working alongside the idols of 765 Productions with a producer at the 765 Theater Agency. The original game is a Japanese idol raising simulation video game developed and managed by Bandai Namco Entertainment released on the GREE social network platform February 27, 2013 for Android and iOS platforms and for feature phones. A rhythm game titled Idolmaster Million Live! Theater Days was released on June 29, 2017. The original game ended service on March 18, 2018, leaving Theater Days as the main game centered on Million Live. Overview Million Live! introduces 37 idols, working alongside the 13 idols of 765 Production; Theater Days adds two more idols and a secretary. Compared to other spin-offs in the Idolmaster series, the new idols work with and interact with the idols of 765. The general design and much of the visual elements are done by A-1 Pictures, the same animation studio responsible for animating several of the Idolmaster anime series. Gameplay=GREE game The game was a free-to-play idol raising simulator in which the player, as the producer, trained idols and sent them to work in various locations while also making the idols 765 Production Theater bigger. The idols were obtained through collecting cards ranked by rarity and divided into three categories, Vocal, Dance, and Visual, with a fourth category, Ex, reserved for special cards. Leveling up the cards made the idols stronger, with the higher rarities being able to reach higher levels. The feature phone version was discontinued on February 2, 2016; a desktop client was released within the same month. The GREE game was shut down on March 19, 2018. Theater Days A second game titled Idolmaster Million Live! Theater Days was released June 29, 2017 for Android and iOS platforms. It is a rhythm game and simulation game, with 3D models, periodically released story missions, and multiple choice 'communication' events with the idols in the vein of the original Idolmaster games. Many of the cards from the original game are reused in Theater Days. Media=Animations Seven of the idols from Million Live are featured in the anime film The Idolmaster Movie: Beyond the Brilliant Future!. Special animation videos for Million Live have been created as anniversary celebrations. The first animation, a video featuring Mirai Kasuga, was created for the first anniversary and streamed in-game. A 10-minute animation was created for its fourth anniversary. Both were animated by A-1 Pictures. TV Anime A planned anime adaptation for Million Live! was announced during the Theater Days 3rd anniversary livestream. It will be animated by Shirogumi, directed by Shinya Watada, and with series composition and script by Youichi Katou. Comics Aside from comics available alongside the games themselves, Million Live! has several published manga. A manga titled Idolm@ster Million Live! was published in Monthly Sh≈çnen Sunday from August 2014 to October 2016, created by author Yuki Monji and Bandai Namco Entertainment. The collected volume editions came with original CDs. Music Million Live has image songs published by Lantis (later a label for Bandai Namco's Bandai Namco Arts). The music was integrated into the gameplay of Theater Days. Sales of the CDs and concert Blu-rays had surpassed a combined one million units by 2017; the CD The@ter Generation 01 Brand New Theater! received a Gold certification from the RIAJ.

Causes of the alleged bias range from it being attributed to the fact that the AFL evolved from the Victorian Football League (VFL) resulting in a majority of the AFL's teams being located in the state of Victoria, to it being the result of intentional favouritism by the competitions administration towards Victorian clubs. Background In 1982 the VFL relocated the South Melbourne Football Club to Sydney in New South Wales with the following decade seeing the competition established clubs in all Australian mainland states. By 1997 there were 10 clubs located in Victoria and 6 clubs located outside of that the state. After a further series of expansion clubs being introduced the AFL consists of 8 clubs outside Victoria whilst retaining 10 clubs inside it. This imbalance of clubs inside and outside Victoria is often cited as the main, or even only, cause of any bias. Commonly cited examples of bias Assertions of bias towards Victorian based clubs in the AFL are multifaceted. Grand Final location The location of the AFL Grand Final is often the subject of allegations of Victorian bias in the AFL due to it being indefinitely being hosted at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  Travel burden  Due to the unequal distribution of teams based inside and outside Victoria, non-Victorian based players are required to travel far greater distances during their careers. This travel burden discrepancy is highlighted by comparing the distance travelled by West Coast Eagles players Darren Glass, Daniel Kerr, Mark LeCras, Quinten Lynch and Chris Masten all travelling over 515,000km in their first 200 games compared to Collingwood players Ben Johnson, Alan Didak, Dane Swan, Josh Fraser and Travis Cloke all travelling less than 96,000km for their first 200 appearances in the AFL. Fixturing As a result of the majority of the 18 AFL clubs being based in Victoria the competitions fixture provides an unequal distribution of the required travel burden to carry out a season. = Friday night broadcasts = Friday nights are regarded as the premier time slot for AFL fixtures as they are broadcast nationally on free to air subsequently generating the largest TV audiences of the week for the competition. Victorian clubs often dominate the Friday night fixture and this it is largely asserted that this is the result of broadcasters preference for those matches to involve Melbourne teams as that city is the largest market for the competition. =Public Holiday games= The AFL fixture has a heavy bias towards providing Victorian clubs with stand alone public holiday fixtures.  ANZAC Day  The ANZAC Day fixture has been perpetually held in Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground since 1995 between Collingwood and Essendon and is often cited as example of a Victorian centric approach to commemorating the national public holiday. = Season opener = The AFL fixture in recent times has opened with Victorian based clubs Richmond and Carlton regardless of their finishing position the year prior. It has been argued that this fixture should be awarded to the premier of the year before to allow them to unfurl their pennant to usher in the next season.  Media  Player appraisals = As a result of both the AFL administrative headquarters (AFL House) and the majority of the leagues teams being located in Victoria the majority of the competitions associated media is based in Victoria. As a result it is asserted that the media that covers the game has a bias towards Victorian clubs and particularly Victorian based players with critics suggesting that players of Victorian clubs garner a higher profile compared to their non-Victorian counterparts.  Clash Uniform Policy  Supporters of non-Victorian clubs often complain about the AFL's clash uniform policy which is lenient on Victorian based clubs but strongly upheld for non- Victorian clubs. Richmond, Carlton and Collingwood are often singled out as almost never adhering to the AFL's 'Clash Uniform Policy'. However in more recent times Richmond have been more accepting of the policy, wearing a full clash uniform for the 2017 AFL Grand Final.  Subsidisation  There have been claims that supporters of non-Victorian clubs pay higher ticket prices than those in Melbourne with the former effectively subsiding the latter.  Draft compromises  The AFL uses a draft to ensure the competition is balanced in order for close competition. However the draft is often compromised to provide assistance to clubs in weaker positions or to maintain the father-son policy. The most common compromise of the draft is priority picks to assist fledgling clubs, which have been more commonly granted for Victorian based clubs. Additionally the father son rule is set at 100 games for VFL clubs whereas the non‚ÄìVFL clubs are set at 150 or 200 depending on the state.

Retrieved 7 October 2011. Claims of non-Victorian advantages It is often argued by Victorian football commentators that the non-Victorian teams have the only real home ground advantages in the competition as they host travelling sides every second week whereas Victorian clubs are often hosting games against other Victorian clubs resulting in neutral fixtures in regards to home ground advantage. Melbourne bias in the AFL It is sometimes argued by supporters of that instead of there being a Victorian bias in the AFL it is actually a Melbourne bias with the club often being forced to play home games in the neighbouring city instead of in Geelong.

It promotes Romantic literature, introducing that term to readers in France and other parts of Europe. The book was published in 1813, after the first edition of 10,000 copies, printed in 1810, had been destroyed by order from Napoleon. The book had a major impact on Romanticism in France and elsewhere. Summary The book is divided into four parts: \\"On Germany and German Customs\\", \\"On Literature and the Arts\\", \\"On Philosophy and Morals\\" and \\"Religion and Enthusiasm\\". It surveys modern German literature and philosophy, praising writers like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Jean Paul and Friedrich Schiller. It introduces French readers to the German concept of Romantic literature, a term derived from the chivalric romances of medieval Europe. Like Friedrich Schlegel, Sta√´l views Romantic literature as modern, because its roots are in the chivalric culture of the Middle Ages, and not in the classical models of ancient Greece and Rome. Sta√´l writes in favour of literature rooted in Christian culture, which is defined by its preference for the internal life, as practised in the confession. She opposes neoclassicism, which focuses more on action and is prone to use external rules, like those in Aristotle's Poetics and Horace's Ars Poetica. She places Christian belief in opposition to the pagan notion of fate, which she rejects. Romantic poetry, she says, is more relatable than classical imitations, because Christian culture is native to the French people, whereas classical culture is not. She also promotes the use of native French subjects to ensure that literature is relatable. Publication A first edition of 10,000 copies was printed in Paris in 1810. Napoleon, however, ordered the entire edition to be destroyed; the preferences for Christian and medieval culture over the neoclassicism of the Napoleonic era, and for German thinkers like Schlegel over French philosophers like Voltaire, were seen as politically subversive, and a possible threat to the established order. A new edition had to be printed in London and was published there in 1813. A commercial success throughout the 19th century, the book was published in 25 French editions alone. An English translation was published by John Murray in 1813 under the title Germany. Segments have been translated by Vivian Folkenflik and published by Columbia University Press in An Extraordinary Woman: Selected Writings of Germaine de Sta√´l (1987), where the English title is On Germany. Legacy On Germany had a greater influence than any of Sta√´l's other works. Along with The Genius of Christianity (1802) by Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand, it pointed out the direction that French Romanticism would follow. The recommendation to express the inner life, like in the Christian confession, led the way for a tradition of French confessional literature. The book also had significant impact elsewhere, including the United Kingdom and the United States, where it was the work that introduced the term Romanticism. The scholar John Claiborne Isbell compares its impact to that of Victor Hugo's Hernani (1830), which was seen as a \\"triumph of Romantic art\\", writing: \\"Romanticism outside Germany dates its conscious existence from De l'Allemagne: recognising its pivotal role will give France back twenty stolen years of literary history, and restore the missing origin of this Europe-wide transformation of art and society. Hugo, Leopardi, Emerson do not come before, they come after: they are a second generation.\\" See also * 19th-century French literature References=CitationsSources : : : Further reading : : External links * * Germany (1813) at the Internet Archive: Vol. I, Vol. II, Vol. III Category:1810 non-fiction books Category:1813 books Category:French non-fiction books Category:Romanticism Category:Christian literature Category:Books about Germany Category:Books of literary criticism ","title":"On Germany"},{"id":"64243827","text":"The Banankoni River in Mali[ Banankoni] in [ Geonames.org (cc-by)]; post updated 2012-11-08; database download sa 2016-10-22 is located in the Sikasso Region, in the southern part of the country, 280 km east of Bamako.

The Italian wars had a great influence on Parisian architecture and urban planning, during which the court of Louis XII became acquainted with the ideas of the Italian Renaissance. Invited Italian architects began to turn the medieval castles of French kings and court nobles into elegant palace residences with representative facades and richly decorated halls. It was under Francis I, who waged protracted wars with the Habsburgs for hegemony in the Mediterranea, that the French Renaissance flourished. The transformation of the Louvre into a royal palace was associated with the further development of Renaissance architecture in France, which dominated the entire 16th and early 17th centuries. During this time, under the influence of various factors, Parisian architecture underwent significant changes, which affected the development and appearance of the capital. The construction of the Luxembourg Palace in the first third of the 17th century ended the era of the French Renaissance in Paris, and the end of the colonnade of the eastern facade of the Louvre in the second half of the 17th century marked the formation of the classicist style. After the sunset of the Renaissance in Paris, classicism for a long time coexisted with another stylistic trend - Baroque. The construction of Les Invalides at the end of the 17th century completed the monumental Baroque style, which in the first quarter of the 18th century actually turned into decoration of the mansions and palaces of the Paris aristocracy (this style of interiors was called Rococo). At the same time, classicism reigned supreme in the architecture of the city throughout the eighteenth century (its sign was √âglise Sainte- Genevi√®ve, and the most grandiose urban ensemble was the Place Louis XV at the tip of the Tuileries Garden). The architecture of the interiors of the absolutism era was most clearly expressed in the royal palaces of Paris - the Louvre, the Tuileries, the Palais Royal and Luxembourg, as well as in the suburban residences of the kings - Versailles, Grand and Small Trianon, Marly, Saint Germain, Saint-Cloud, Medon, Boulogne, Muette, Vincennes, Choisy-le-Roi, Rambouillet and Fontainebleau. In the architecture of Paris of the era of absolutism, one can trace the evolution of urban compositions (palace and park ensembles and squares) from the early Renaissance to the heyday of classicism (with elements of an emerging Empire style) and Baroque. The era of absolutism ended with the Great French Revolution and the overthrow of Louis XVI. During the revolution, the symbol of tyranny was demolished - the medieval fortress- prison of the Bastille, on the site of which today is the Place de la Bastille. In addition, the revolutionary element removed royal statues from the metropolitan areas, partially destroyed or converted some churches and tax outposts.  Historical background  By the beginning of the Renaissance, medieval Paris was a controversial sight. The city had outstanding works of Romanesque and Gothic architecture, however, Parisian buildings were dominated not by stone temples and palaces, but by wooden residential buildings that crowded along narrow and winding streets with open gutters. On both sides of the bridges across the Seine were benches with workshops and living quarters of the owners. New waves of visitors sought to settle within the old fortress walls, so the streets and courtyards were given a minimum of space. By the end of the 15th - beginning of the 16th centuries, more than 300 thousand citizens lived in Paris; it was one of the largest cities in Europe. Often Paris of that era was called the \\"urban colossus in an agricultural country\\". In the XVI century, Paris entered a new phase for itself, associated with the gradual strengthening of absolute monarchy, the expansion of feudalism and the emergence of capitalism, which radically influenced the architecture and urban planning of the capital. Over three centuries, the architecture of the city has undergone significant changes and went through several stylistic stages. All this happened against the backdrop of the growing social role of the merchants, the separation from the feudal estate of the urban bourgeoisie and the elimination of the feudal fragmentation of France. During the unsuccessful for France Italian Wars, the French aristocracy became closely acquainted with Italy, where at that time a new worldview and Renaissance art were rapidly developing. French kings drew attention to secular nature and humanism of Italian art. The increased wealth and desire to emphasize the greatness of the royal court prompted the monarchs to begin large-scale palace construction on the basis of principles borrowed from the architecture of the Italian Renaissance. Louis XII and his son-in-law Francis I began to actively invite architects and artists from Italy to rebuild their heavy castles. In the second half of the 16th century, the protracted Religious Wars between Catholics and Protestants, whose apotheosis in Paris became St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, as well as the peasant wars of the 1590s led to the devastation of the treasury and reduced funding for the new construction. Economic difficulties, in turn, led to a simplification of architecture. Even in relatively prosperous Paris, they began to build mainly of brick, only occasionally using stone, and reduced the use of decorative details to a minimum. This desire for minimalism in architecture found an echo in one of the first Parisian ensembles - Place des Vosges. The eradication of feudal fragmentation and the victory of absolutism contributed to the growth of national feeling among French architects, who sought to independently comprehend the ancient heritage and develop a national architectural style. National trends in architecture found their expression in the rejection of the project of the eastern facade of the Louvre, proposed by Bernini, the greatest representative of the Italian Baroque. The result of the controversy surrounding the competition projects for the new facade of the Louvre was the creation in 1671 of the Royal Academy of Architecture (today it is a branch of the French Academy of Fine Arts). It was intended to acquaint the public with the basic laws of architecture, the teachings of the great theorists of the past and the experience of ancient builders. As part of these tasks, the architect Claude Perrault translated into French and published in Paris a treatise by his Roman colleague of the 1st century BC Vitruvius \\"Ten Books on Architecture\\". The sources of inspiration for French architects were the most important discoveries of ancient architecture - Herculaneum (1711) and Pompeii (1748). In addition, the temples of Paestum, Segesta and Agrigentum became widely known in the 18th century. Since 1752, the \\"Collection of Antiques\\" by the French antiquarian Count de Caylus began to be published in Paris. During one of the grand tours, architects Charles-Louis Clerisso and Robert Adam reopened Diocletian's Palace in Dalmatia (later travel sketches and Clerisso's drawings formed the basis of neoclassicism). Architect Julien-David Leroy visited Ottoman Greece, which for a long time was inaccessible to European travelers. In 1758 he published the results of his research in the book Ruins of the Most Beautiful Monuments of Greece. The \\"History of Ancient Art\\" and \\"Notes on the History of Art\\" by the German theorist Johann Joachim Winckelmann had a huge impact on the establishment of the aesthetics of classicism in France. On the eve of Great French Revolution philosophical views of Voltaire, Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Denis Diderot defined classicism as the most an acceptable architectural system, as opposed to the Baroque and Rococo styles of the outgoing era. The stronghold of classicism and the center for the development of new subjects in architecture was the progressive Royal Academy of Architecture. In 1808, the famous book \\"Description of Paris and its buildings\\" was published, in which Charles Paul Landon and Jacques-Guillaume Legrand assessed the architecture of the capital of the era of absolutism.  Palaces, castles and mansions  House of Francis I in Moret-sur-Louin The earliest example of French Renaissance architecture is the so-called \\"House of Francis I.\\" It was originally built in 1523 as a hunting lodge near the Fontainebleau Palace, which was the royal residence. In 1824, the building was dismantled and moved to Paris in stone, today it is located in the town of Moret-sur-Louin (department Seine-et-Marne) and its original appearance has been restored. With its appearance, ‚Äúthe house of Francis I‚Äù boldly opposed itself to medieval architecture with its closedness, asceticism and asymmetry. Innovations were floor divisions, including a beautifully dissected second floor, and three wide arches on the first floor, as well as graceful reliefs by the great sculptor Jean Goujon, which enriched the facade (portrait bas-reliefs appeared on the facade later).

History St Mary's Church, Reigate In 1918, Godfrey Searle, a Reigate stockbroker, established a fund to provide choral scholarships at Reigate Grammar School for the boy choristers of St Mary's Church. This arrangement came to an end as the result of the school becoming a non-fee-paying selective grammar school under the Education Act 1944, for boys who passed the Eleven-plus, with no provision for teaching junior boys.Alan Mould, The English Chorister: A History (Hambledon Continuum, 2007), pp. 220‚Äì221 Reigate St Mary's School was founded in 1949 as a prep school for boys only, with the initial purpose of educating the junior St Mary's choristers and recruiting new ones.

Originating around the early 2010s, the meaning has changed over time. History Thirst trap culture was derived from selfie culture. The term thirst trap emerged on Twitter and Urban Dictionary in 2011, around the same time as the rise of Snapchat, Instagram, and online dating apps such as Tinder. In 2011, it was defined by Urban Dictionary as \\"any statement used to intentionally create attention or 'thirst'.\\" In 2018, it was reported to have entered common usage, as media sources including The New York Times and GQ started using the expression without definition. Usage of the term Often, the term thirst trap describes an attractive picture of an individual that they post online. Thirst trap can also describe a digital heartthrob. For instance, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has been described as a political thirst trap.; It has also been described as a modern form of \\"fishing for compliments\\". Motivation There can be several motivations behind thirst trapping. People can seek \\"likes\\" and comments on social media which can provide a temporary boost in self-esteem and validation. Posting a thirst trap can also be a way to express sexuality. Thirst traps can contribute to personal branding as well. Sometimes, there can be a financial benefit for sharing thirst traps. Some post thirst traps as a way to cope with emotional distress, such as after a breakup. Furthermore, these images can be used to spite a former lover. Sharing a thirst trap has also been used as a way to connect in times of social isolation (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic). From a physiologic standpoint, endorphins and neurotransmitters like oxytocin and dopamine can be released with the process of sharing thirst traps, leading to a sense of pleasure and an alternative for physical sexual contact. Methodology Methodologies have developed to take an optimal thirst trap photo.; Reporting for Vice magazine, Graham Isador found several of his social network contacts spent a lot of time considering how to take the best photo and what text they should use. They considered angles and lighting. Sometimes they made use of the self-timer feature available on some cameras. Often, body parts are put on display without being too explicit (e.g. bulges of male genitalia, breast cleavage, abdominal muscles, pectoral muscles, backs, buttocks). Often, the thirst trap is accompanied by a caption. For instance, in October 2019, Tracee Ellis Ross posted bikini pictures on Instagram with a caption that included the message: \\"I've worked so hard to feel good in my skin and to build a life that truly matches me and I'm in it and it feels good. ... No filter, no retouch 47 year old [sic] thirst trap! Boom!\\" On Instagram, #ThirstTrapThursdays is a popular tag. Followers reply in turn after a posting.  Variations  \\"Gatsbying\\" is a variation of the thirst trap, where one puts posts on social media to attract the attention of a particular individual. The term alludes to the novel The Great Gatsby where the character Jay Gatsby would throw extravagant parties to attract the attention of his love interest, Daisy. \\"Instagrandstanding\\" is an alternative name for this.; \\"Wholesome trapping\\" has developed, where one posts pictures of more meaningful aspects of life, such as spending time with friends or doing outdoor activities. Criticisms Some have criticized thirst traps as being an unhealthy method of receiving external validation. This desire for external validation can be addictive. Thirst traps can cause pressure to maintain a good physical appearance, and therefore cause self-esteem issues. Additionally, the thirst traps are often highly choreographed and thus present a distorted perception of reality. The manufacturing of thirst traps can be limited when one enters a relationship and/or with time as the body ages. In some cases, thirst traps can lead to harassment and online bullying. In April 2020, Chrissy Teigen posted a video of her wearing a black one-piece swimsuit, and she received a multitude of negative comments that constituted bullying and body shaming (e.g. \\"Narcissistic much? Cover up, you're not that hot.\\"). Notability in culture Numerous celebrities have been recognized for their thirst traps, notably Kim Kardashian, Amber Rose, and Rihanna. The Jonas Brothers have also been noted for their thirst traps created over an extended duration. Publications such as Buzzfeed and Vibe have created compilations of best celebrity thirst traps. Vine was also used as a platform to share thirst trap videos, used by the queer women community in particular. Thirst traps are also prolific in the gay community. It has been argued that Instagram itself is a representation of a giant thirst trap. In 2018, Jeffree Star featured a shade of lipstick called \\"thirst trap\\". In 2019, Four Loko commissioned a study where 60,000 Instagram images from 50 U.S. cities and 10 international cities were analyzed to see the prevalence rate of thirst traps. Miami was found to have the highest prevalence rate in the United States, with 36 out of 1,000 photos being thirst traps.; During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, there has reportedly been an increase in the frequency and intensity of thirst traps.

He was deeply engaged with the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry which he chaired from 1986 to 1993. He was the 2001 recipient of the Dexter Award, given to historians of science by the American Chemical Society. Chemical career From 1942, Smeaton studied chemistry at Imperial College London reading for a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1945. He became a lecturer and later a senior lecturer in inorganic chemistry at Northern Polytechnic (later London Metropolitan University), working there from 1946 to 1958. Historical career Smeaton also studied history of science part-time at University College London. He obtained his master's degree with a thesis on Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau in 1953 and received his doctorate in 1958 with a dissertation on Antoine Fran√ßois, comte de Fourcroy. In the same year he was a fellow of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) at the Institut d‚ÄôHistoire des Sciences of Sorbonne Universit√©. In 1959 Smeaton became a lecturer in the history of science at University College London under Douglas McKie. In 1963 he became a reader and in 1968 he received a D.Sc. from London University in recognition of his published works. In 1982 he retired. Smeaton worked with Douglas McKie and and amassed an important book collection in his research area. His research focus was French history of chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, in particular chemists of the French Revolution. These included Antoine Lavoisier, Fourcroy, Guyton de Morveau and the Dijon Academy). Smeaton's work on Fourcroy was considered the standard work on that scientist. He wrote a number of biographies in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography. He headed the Society for the Study of Alchemy and Early Chemistry (now the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry) as chairman from 1986 to 1993, as well as serving as treasurer from 1957 to 1982, and as book review editor for the journal Ambix from 1971 to 1986. At the time of his death he was the longest-serving officer of the organization, having become treasurer while still a graduate student. Retirement Smeaton was active outdoors throughout his life, particularly enjoying mountain hiking and cross-country skiing. During his retirement, he became involved in archaeology, taking university classes, joining the Ely Archeological Society, volunteering on archaeological digs, and conducting a survey of masons‚Äô marks used in building Ely Cathedral.

Anna Leszkiewicz, for the New Statesman, said it was \\"charming: absurdly silly in a quiet, understated way\\". Rupert Hawksley, in the i, described it as \\"compelling 'lockdown' television\\". Gabriel Tate, reviewing Staged for Metro, said \\"Sheen and Tennant shared a warmth and willingness to take the mickey out of each other that felt entirely unforced.\\" Fergus Morgan, writing in The Stage, gave the production five stars and said: \\"Tennant and Sheen are excellent, perennially, even when performing as themselves to their own laptops.

She was a member of the German Bundestag parliament from 1961 to 1979, serving as its vice president from 1969. She then was appointed state Minister of Economy in North Rhine-Westphalia, the first woman in the position. Funcke is remembered for her engagements to integrate foreigners in German society, as the Federal Commissioner for Foreigners (Ausl√§nderbeauftragte) from 1981 to 1991, and afterwards.  Life  Funcke was born in Hagen to a liberal-leaning family, the fourth child of a factory owner. Her father was member of the board and president of the Reichsverbandes der Deutschen Industrie from 1919 to 1933, and became a member of the Bundestag for the FDP in the 1950s. Her mother came from the Osthaus family of bankers. She attended the Realgymnasium, where she achieved the Abitur in 1937. She served in the Arbeitsdienst and attended the Kaufmannsschule Dortmund. She then studied Betriebswirtschaftslehre (business administration) in Berlin, where she earned her diploma in 1941. Funcke worked for three years for a Wirtschaftspr√ºfer (statutory auditor) in Wuppertal; from 1944 she was responsible for balance, taxes, and finance in the company Schraubenfabrik und Gesenkeschmiede Funcke & Hueck, which her great- grandfather had founded in Hagen. Funcke's political career began after World War II, joining the FDP in 1946. She was a member of the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia state parliament from 1950 to 1961, when she was elected to the German Bundestag. Funcke was the parliament's vice-president from 1969 to 1979. From 1972 to 1979 she was chairman of the Bundestag's Finance Committee, having already been its deputy chairman from 1965 to 1969. Funcke served as state (Wirtschaft, Mittelstand und Verkehr) in North Rhine-Westphalia from 1979, the first woman in the position. She had to leave the post a year later because her party was no longer part of the Landtag. She was the (Federal Commissioner for Foreigners) from 1981 to 1991, working for the federal government for the integration of foreigners and their families, again the first woman to hold the position. She understood the position as \\"interpreter\\" of the problems of the foreigners, especially the large group of Turkish workers who brought their families with them; it earned her the respectful name Mutter der T√ºrken (Mother of the Turks), and she continued to serve their interests in public after her official term. Funcke died in Hagen at the age of 94.
