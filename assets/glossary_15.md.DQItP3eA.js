There are many Vegetation Indices (VIs), with many being functionally equivalent. Many of the indices make use of the inverse relationship between red and near-infrared reflectance associated with healthy green vegetation. Since the 1960s scientists have used satellite remote sensing to monitor fluctuation in vegetation at the Earth's surface. Measurements of vegetation attributes include leaf area index (LAI), percent green cover, chlorophyll content, green biomass and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). Vegetation Indices (VIs) have been historically classified based on a range of attributes, including the number of spectral bands (2 or greater than 2); the method of calculations (ratio or orthogonal), depending on the required objective; or by their historical development (classified as first generation VIs or second generation VIs). For the sake of comparison of the effectiveness of different VIs, Lyon, Yuan et al. (1998) classified 7 VIs based on their computation methods (Subtraction, Division or Rational Transform). Due to advances in hyperspectral remote sensing technology, high-resolution reflectance spectrums are now available, which can be used with traditional multispectral VIs. In addition, VIs have been developed to be used specifically with hyperspectral data, such as the use of Narrow Band Vegetation Indices.

The hotel was built in 1865 to 1866. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 March 2009.  History  The Range Hotel, Burial Ground and Camping Reserve includes a section of the original route of the Hervey Range Road to Thorntons Gap, archaeological artefacts and a small burial ground associated with the former Range Hotel which was built in 1866, but is no longer extant. The Hervey Range Road was established c.1865-6 and extended from present day Townsville to Hervey Range at Thorntons Gap. At the base of the Hervey Range, at least one hotel was established in 1866 to service the increasing number of people and stock travelling along this early inland transportation route, and as a result a small community developed. In 1872, a camping reserve was also gazetted around the Range Hotel site to provide additional accommodation options. By the early 1880s, the introduction of the Great Northern railway to Charters Towers resulted in a reduction in traffic along the road. The Range Hotel closed in 1884 and the adjacent sections of the Hervey Range Road became obsolete and fell into disrepair following construction of a deviation to the south in the 1970s. Settlement in north Queensland occurred comparatively late in the history of European occupation of Australia. The Kennedy District was the first region opened for settlement in north Queensland, and was officially proclaimed from 1 January 1861. The district comprised 51,000 square miles, extending to the north beyond present day Cardwell, west to the Great Dividing Range, and south beyond Mackay. The year 1861 witnessed a rush of settlers and squatters to the new district to secure pastoral runs. By the end of the year, the best runs were selected with 454 applications lodged for over 31,000 square miles of land. The rapid expansion west into inland Queensland necessitated the development of suitable transportation routes. The first inland road was surveyed by John Melton Black and built by employees of Black and Co. (later Towns and Co.) under the supervision of Andrew Ball, with a subsidy of £500 from the Queensland Government. The road was blazed in 1865 and ran due west from the present day Townsville across the Bohle and Alice Rivers and up what was then known as the Dalrymple Range (later Hervey Range) at Thorntons Gap to places further west and to the gulf. It was the only access to inland areas during the early years of settlement in the region. The road was just a track, with the only steep part being the pull up to Thorntons Gap. Despite the steepness of this part of the route, it was still the easiest road from the northern parts of Kennedy District to the sea then blazed. The roads in this period were hazardous, rough, potholed and boggy during the wet season. Hervey's Range Hotel, circa 1930 Men and wagons at Harveys Range Hotel, circa 1912 Hotels and wayside inns appeared along the major routes, and licensed hotels were established along the Hervey Range Road. As it could take up to four days for a bullock team and wagon to travel from Townsville to the foot of the Hervey Range, and then a further day to climb the range to Thorntons Gap to the Eureka Hotel, a market for accommodations was identified. At least one hotel and inn was established at the foot of the range, the Range Hotel, which was erected in 1865-6. There may have also been another at the foot of the range, called The Gate Hotel, possibly built close to The Range Hotel, although little is known about this second hotel. Another hotel, the Eureka Hotel, was built at the summit of Thorntons Gap in 1865 at the time of the road construction. The Range Hotel was built by James Edward Mead in c.1866. He is believed to have been the same person who tendered for the Heidelberg run on the Bowen River at Rockhampton in 1861, but never stocked it. Mead had originally applied for a licence for the Royal Oak, from Cleveland Bay, but the hotel was named the Range when it was advertised in 1866 as being from Townsville with two sitting rooms and six bedrooms. The Range Hotel was a long single storey timber structure with a gable roof and front rooms opening onto the verandah. The hotel was \\"very pleasantly situated\\" and \\"the proprietor has added to the natural beauty by planting some Leichhardt trees around the house which looked very graceful\\". The second proprietor, Robert Williamson, was also a carrier and is said to have been the first person, along with John Melton Black, to have taken wagons through Thorntons Gap. A small community grew up around the hotel, which is known to have included a blacksmith shop owned by John McNeill, and a small burial ground. In March 1866, a government gang started improving the road, although nothing was done to lessen the steepness of the ascent to Thorntons Gap. By December 1866, the road was being heavily used by carriers and travellers, and at times there could be 100 or more wagons strung out along the length of the road. In an attempt to recoup some of the cost of the road, the Department of Public Works installed a toll gate at the foot of the Range in 1867, adjacent to the Range Hotel. The cost to carriers regularly using the road was high - 3 shillings for a two-wheeled dray or wagon, drawn by three or four horses, or four bullocks - prompting teamsters to find an alternate route inland. By the following year, the toll on Hervey Range Road had been removed altogether, and it was again being used by carriers, teamsters and travellers journeying inland and on to the Gulf of Carpentaria. It became known as the Georgetown Road, and it remained the main road from Townsville to Georgetown into the 20th century. Gold was discovered near Charters Towers in late 1871 and in August 1872 the Charters Towers Goldfield was officially proclaimed. Following these discoveries, the Hervey Range Road also became an important transportation route for people journeying to and from these goldfields. In 1872, the area of land surrounding the Range Hotel and the road was also gazetted as a camping reserve. The camp is marked on Robert L. Jack's Geological Sketch Map of the District between Charters Towers Goldfields & the Coast produced in 1878 as \\"Camp III\\" and it shown situated adjacent One Mile Creek, a branch of the Black River. Although the introduction of the railway from Townsville to Charters Towers reduced traffic on the Hervey Range Road in the 1880s, it remained a vital link with cattle stations in the inland and northern regions of the district. The Range hotel finally closed in about 1884. In the 1930s, the road up the Hervey Range was upgraded using funds under a major unemployment relief scheme, allowing motor vehicle access to the top of the range for the first time since its construction in the 1860s. Thuringowa Shire Council regularly maintained the Hervey Range Road from the 1930s until it became obsolete with the construction of the Hervey Range Developmental Road in the 1970s. During the construction of the Greenvale Railway Line in the 1970s, the camping reserve was used as a camp site for Thiess Brothers workers employed on the line.  Description  The camping reserve comprises some 464 hectares in the Hervey Range, approximately southwest of Townsville. The topography of the reserve is relatively flat. However, to the west of the reserve the gradient increases dramatically immediately to ascending the Hervey Range. The reserve is bisected by the former Hervey Range Road (now renamed Page Road), the Hervey Range Developmental Road, and more recently by high voltage electricity transmission lines. Native and introduced vegetation dominates the area, with Moreton Bay ash (Corymbia tesselaris), Poplar gum (Eucalyptus alba), Blue gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis) and narrow leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra) being the most common species. There is a thick cover of grasses in the woodland understorey, comprising Black spear grass (Heteropogon sp.) and kangaroo grass (Themeda spp.). Cocky apple (Planchonia careya) and native Gardenia (Kailarsenia ochreata) are common woodland species in the area. Introduced species include Lantana sp., mango trees (Mangifera sp.) and Agave sp. The former Hervey Range Road cuts through the reserve and continues to the top of the Hervey Range to Thorntons Gap. The route of the road is still clearly visible, particularly in the largely intact steep sections. There are some washed out sections on the climb up the range. The course of the road has changed little since its construction. The Range Hotel is no longer extant. Archaeological artefacts, including late 19th century bottle glass and ceramics indicate the likely location of the hotel. Agave plants at this site may have been part of the hotel garden. A small burial ground is located some south of the former Hervey Range Road and Range Hotel site. The graves are overgrown with lantana and spear grass. There are three ornate sandstone headstones of a type often found in North Queensland burials dating before c.1880. No maker's names are present although it is likely the headstones were imported from Brisbane with the inscriptions added locally. The lettering on the headstones has weathered and one is lying horizontal on the ground. Each grave is encircled by white-painted stones. The graves have been identified as follows: 1\\\\. Francis Earl, a local squatter who died of fever at the Range Hotel on 12 March 1866. The inscription reads: > Sacred to the Memory of Francis John Earl Died at the Range Hotel On the > 12th March 1866 Aged 25 years In the midst of life we are in death (verse > illegible) 2\\\\. Mary Langton, a mother of three small children under 4 years old, who committed suicide by taking poison at the age of 28 years. Her husband, John Langton, carried goods from Townsville to Dalrymple Township. The inscription reads: > Sacred to the Memory of Mary Langton Who departed this life 6th December > 1873 Aged 28 years The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away Blessed by the > name of the Lord 3\\\\. John Henry Bell, a child of 4 years, who died of inflammation of the lungs in May 1879. His father, Charles, was a carrier and lived at Bellgrove on the Hervey Range Road. The inscription reads: > In loving memory of John Henry Second son of Charles & Mark Ann Bell Born > 14th January Died 11th May 1875 The Langton and Earl headstones are aligned north-south about apart, with the Bell headstone between them, about northwest of the Langton headstone. The layout of the graves suggests that there may have been as many as five plots between the Langton and Earl burials and three rows of grave plots. The positions of the graves imply a possible original layout of at least 21 grave plots in three rows of seven. The graves were likely marked with wooden grave markers which have since been destroyed by fire, termites or fungal decay. A dense concentration of archaeological material is located south of the former Hervey Range Road and the power transmission lines on the high bank of a creek. Some material is eroding into the creek bed. The surface artefacts are visible in a area, although low visibility due to vegetation cover obscures the full extent of the site. Artefacts include glass bottle fragments and patterned ceramic fragments datable to the 19th century. This may be associated with a potential second hotel situated at the site. An old softwood tree (possibly Terminalia sp.) situated in the middle of this area bears a rectangular-shaped blaze on its trunk, measuring . The remains of the Thiess Brothers camp in this area comprise wooden stumps, posts, concrete slabs, an old telephone line and a concrete explosives magazine. These remains represent another phase in the history and development of the camping reserve.  Heritage listing  The Range Hotel site was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 March 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The site have potential to reveal important information on aspects of Queensland's history, including early road construction techniques, early transport and communications, the development of a small, isolated community, and the earliest residents of the region. Features identified within the place include a section of the original Hervey Range Road to Thorntons Gap, the remains of the former Range Hotel, one of the earliest hotels and inns established in the region (c.1866), and an historical burial ground. The old Hervey Range Road is important in demonstrating early communication patterns in the Townsville region. The road is one of the few surviving examples of a roadway dating from early European settlement in the region and was the initial route inland from the port of Townsville to the hinterland areas. The camping reserve provided a resting place for travelers and livestock using the road between 1864 and the 1970s. The route of the road remains clearly identifiable within the camping reserve and beyond where it climbs up the Hervey Range. Archaeological surveys of the section of the old Hervey Range Road (now known as Page Road) have the potential to reveal important information about early road construction techniques. The remains of the original route comprises one of only a few surviving examples of a roadway from the earliest European settlement period in north Queensland. The route of the road is still clearly identifiable in parts though additional archaeological investigations will aid the documentation of previously poorly understood changes to this once important transportation route. The site has potential to reveal important information relating to the development and survival of a small community during the period of early settlement in north Queensland. There is archaeological potential for substantial remains of the former Range Hotel and an associated settlement to be located near the site of the identified bottle dump and burial grounds. Little is known of the composition of this small, ad-hoc settlement, other than that it also included a blacksmith. Archaeological investigations of the former hotel sites within the camping reserve have potential to reveal important information relating to the operation of, and custom of, early frontier hotels and lodgings. Analysis of materials from the former Range Hotel, and the speculated existence of a second hotel called The Gate Hotel, will help comparative analysis with other early frontier hotels situated along this and other important transport and communications corridors. Analysis of archaeological artefacts will help inform on the Eureka Hotel, which is situated at the top of Hervey Range and linked to this place by the old Hervey Range Road, and provide important comparative data for the artefacts recovered from other early hotel sites across Queensland. The burial ground adjacent to the former Range Hotel features one of the oldest extant headstones in the region, the grave of 24-year-old Francis Earl, a local squatter who died of fever at the Range Hotel on 12 March 1866. The Range Hotel burial ground contains sandstone headstones that are highly characteristic of nineteenth century cemeteries in this region, with relatively ornate decoration typically found on graves dating from before c.1880. There is potential that the recorded burial ground contains additional graves (possibly as many as 21) which also date to the earliest European settlement of the Townsville region. Consequently, there is potential to provide new and important information that will contribute to our understanding of the early history and demography of settlement in the region, including but not limited to why burial grounds are found associated with hotels, why people were buried there and not in formal cemeteries, the patterning of burial grounds in the region. The site have potential for archaeological deposits associated with travellers journeying to and from the Charters Towers Goldfields and inland pastoral properties. Analysis of these archaeological remains will provide important insights into the materials being transported and used by the diverse range of peoples transiting to and from the area since 1865, but especially to the Charters Towers Goldfields from 1872.

Other oil and gas fields are shown in gray. The La Goleta Gas Field (also known as the Goleta Gas Field and La Goleta Storage Field) is a natural gas field in unincorporated Santa Barbara County, California, adjacent to the city of Goleta. Discovered in 1929, and first put into production in 1932, it has been in continuous use ever since, producing approximately 12 billion cubic feet of gas. With production declining, the field was converted into a gas storage reservoir in 1941. As of 2016 it remains one of the four gas storage facilities maintained by Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), a division of Sempra Energy, with the others being Aliso Canyon, Honor Rancho and Playa del Rey. It is the oldest storage facility of the four and the third largest, with a maximum capacity of 21.5 billion cubic feet. The storage facilities are necessary to balance load for the over ten million customers of SoCalGas: during summer months, when gas usage is at a minimum, gas is pumped into the reservoirs; and in the winter when usage is high, gas is withdrawn. The La Goleta field serves the northern portion of SoCalGas's geographic range. In 2013 the field had 19 active gas wells and two observation wells. SoCalGas installed four new production wells in 2014-2015 after filing an Environmental Impact Report and obtaining a Land Use Permit from Santa Barbara County. The new wells pull gas from geologic units deeper than the existing storage reservoir, which is about 4,000 feet below ground surface. Geographic setting La Goleta Gas Field, from the west. Goleta Beach County Park is to the right; the processing area is in the left center, next to the trees. The field is on the coast near the city of Goleta. The westernmost part of the field is within the property of the University of California, Santa Barbara; a cluster of gas wells operates just north of the east entrance roundabout. The field extends east from there under the narrow neck of the Goleta Slough where it drains to the Pacific Ocean; under Mescalitan Island, where a cluster of wells shares the remnant island with the Goleta Sewage Treatment Plant; under Goleta Beach County Park; and finally to a blufftop at the western end of the range of low hills that extends along the shore eastward through More Mesa to Hope Ranch. The main gas processing facility for the field, and all recent development, are on this blufftop, on a single 147.4-acre parcel owned by SoCalGas, hidden from view by the elevated terrain and a dense grove of trees on the north. From the beach, operations are hidden by the steep coastal bluff.La Goleta EIR, p. 3-6, 3-7 Land uses in the vicinity of the gas field are primarily agricultural and recreational, with a major transportation corridor cutting through (California Highway 217 from UCSB to US Highway 101). In addition, the Goleta Slough and Atascadero Creek include protected wetlands, and important wildlife habitats occur throughout the area occupied by the gas field.La Goleta EIR, 3-7, 4.4-2,4.4-3 A mobile home park is adjacent to the field on the north, at the southern end of Ward Drive. Climate in the area is Mediterranean, with warm summers and mild, rainy winters. Rain does not ordinarily occur between April and October in any significant amount. Site drainage is to the Pacific Ocean, either directly down the bluff, or into Atascadero Creek and Goleta Slough. Stormwater from the processing plant and adjacent areas on the blufftop runs through a treatment system before being channeled north into Atascadero Creek.La Goleta EIR, 4.3-1, 4.16-2 Geology La Goleta Gas Field Structure Map and Geologic Cross Section The gas field is within an anticlinal structure cut and bounded on the north by the More Ranch Fault.La Goleta EIR, 3-4 The geologic unit on the surface is the Monterey Formation. Beneath the Monterey is the Rincon Formation, a shale unit which forms an impermeable cap on the gas reservoir below. The main productive zone, directly under the Rincon, is in the Vaqueros Formation, a sandstone unit found about 4,000 feet below ground surface, familiar from its outcrops on the lower slopes of the Santa Ynez Mountains, right at the line where chaparral replaces grassland. Below the Vaqueros is either the red sandstone and conglomerate Sespe Formation, which was found to contain pockets of gas, none of commercially producible quantity in the early history of the field,Swayze, 385 or the \\"Eocene-age\\" unit, as it is known in the 2013 Environmental Impact Report. This is the unit being targeted by drilling in the 2014 field enhancement project.La Goleta EIR, 3-3,3-4 History and operations Detail of La Goleta Gas Field and surrounding area, showing location of active wells. The 1920s was a period of intense oil exploration in California, with increasing interest in natural gas as its use came to replace manufactured gas. During this time, the large Ellwood Oil Field several miles west of the site was discovered and developed, as well as the small Mesa Oil Field near downtown Santa Barbara. Drillers prospecting for oil or gas drilled an exploratory well into the La Goleta field in 1929, but the well hit a high-pressure gas reservoir around 4,500 feet deep and blew out spectacularly, spewing gas at a rate of 60 million cubic feet of gas per day. The operator, General Petroleum Corp. of California, redrilled the well in 1932, bringing it into production.DOGGR, 213 Peak production was in 1934, and the reservoir declined rapidly after that, being exhausted by the late 1930s. Total production through 1937 was 14 billion cubic feet of gas.Swayze, p. 384 While the petroleum industry had largely lost interest in the field in the late 1930s, the need for natural gas increased during the Second World War. Pacific Lighting Gas, the predecessor of the SoCalGas, needed a way to balance load between winter and summer use of gas, so began repressurizing the La Goleta Gas Field with natural gas, converting it into storage, and building a compressor station. In the early 2000s, recognizing the need to expand the capacity of their system and better level the load between summer and winter gas usage, SoCalGas proposed a project to upgrade the field. Four new gas wells would be drilled into a deeper, previously untapped gas reservoir believed to exist in an Eocene-age sandstone formation under the Vaqueros Formation. After this gas was exhausted, this reservoir could be used to expand the field's storage capacity.

The memorial bears the names of many prominent figures in the South Australian trade union movement and Labor Party, as well as workers and left- wing political activists.  History  After the death in 1916 of Hugh Garland, a prominent Port Adelaide trade unionist and founder of the Daily Herald, a committee was formed by the local branch of the Australian Labor Party and representatives of the United Trades and Labour Council to organise for the creation of a memorial to honour the contribution of labour activists in the Port. The Port Adelaide city council granted permission for the statue to be erected in 1917, and funding for the project was raised through donations from a carnival and a social held by the Ladies Committee of the Labor Party. Affiliated unions of the Trades and Labour Council each nominated past members for the 41 names included in the initial inscription. Of these, 8 had recently been killed during World War I. The granite base of the memorial was officially unveiled on 6 December 1918. At the ceremony John Gunn MP, the leader of the State Labor Party, declared that the men whose names appeared on the memorial had \\"done great things for the trade union movement - when it was not respectable as it is today, when it was almost a crime to be a unionist, when men had to hold union meetings secretly, and when to be known as a unionist meant victimisation\\". The marble statue of Justice was installed in 1921 after being commissioned in Italy and donated by Mr and Mrs Winter, local merchants.  Modern use  The Port Adelaide Workers Memorial, after the wreath-laying ceremony on 6 May 2018 The memorial is currently owned by the City of Port Adelaide Enfield and managed by a committee made up of the Mayor and representatives of SA Unions and the Port Adelaide Federal Electoral Council of the Australian Labor Party. Each year the Committee nominates a single name to be inscribed on the monument, which is traditionally done during a ceremony on International Workers Memorial Day or as part of May Day celebrations.

The team's first home game in Los Angeles was at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against the San Diego Chargers on November 22, 1982 after a 57-day player strike. They played their last game as a Los Angeles-based club on December 24, 1994 at the Coliseum against the Kansas City Chiefs, a game which they lost 19–9 to eliminate them from playoff contention. History=Start= Prior to the 1980 season, Raiders owner Al Davis attempted unsuccessfully to have improvements made to the Oakland Coliseum, specifically the addition of luxury boxes. On March 1, 1980, he signed a Memorandum of Agreement to move the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. The move, which required three-fourths approval by league owners, was defeated 22–0 (with five owners abstaining). When Davis tried to move the team anyway, he was blocked by an injunction. In response, the Raiders not only became an active partner in an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (who had recently lost the Los Angeles Rams to Anaheim), but filed an antitrust lawsuit of their own.Dickey, Just Win, Baby. p. 168. After the first case was declared a mistrial, in May 1982 a second jury ruled in favor of Davis and the Los Angeles Coliseum, clearing the way for the move.Dickey, Just Win, Baby. p. 172. The Raiders finally relocated to Los Angeles for the 1982 season, playing their home games at the Los Angeles Coliseum. =1982–1985= In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the team finished first in the AFC with an 8-1 record. They defeated the Cleveland Browns in the first round of the playoffs before losing to the New York Jets in the second round. The following season, the team compiled a 12-4 record and a first-place finish in the AFC West. in the playoffs, they convincingly defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional Playoffs and Seattle Seahawks in the AFC Championship Game to advance to Super Bowl XVIII against the Washington Redskins. The Raiders built a 21–3 halftime lead over Washington en route to a 38–9 victory and their third NFL championship. The Raiders had another successful regular season in 1984, finishing 11–5, but a three-game losing streak in late October and early November forced them to enter the playoffs as the second wild card team. They were defeated by the Seahawks in the Wild Card Playoffs, 13-7. The 1985 campaign saw 12 wins and another division title, but the first-seeded Raiders suffered a humiliating 27-20 defeat at the hands of the New England Patriots in the Divisional Playoffs. =1986–1989: Struggles, beginning of the end= Allen (center) led the Raiders to a championship in Super Bowl XVIII and earned MVP honors as he rushed for a record of 191 yards, including a memorable 74-yard touchdown run. The Raiders' fortunes declined after the loss to the Patriots in the 1985 playoffs. From 1986 through 1989, they finished no better than 8–8 and posted consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 1961–62. Also, 1986 saw Al Davis get into a widely publicized argument with running back Marcus Allen, whom he accused of faking injuries. The feud continued into 1987, and Davis retaliating by signing Bo Jackson to take Allen's place. However, Jackson was also a left fielder for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals, and could not play full-time until the baseball season ended in October. Even worse, another strike cost the NFL one game and prompted them to use substitute players. The Raiders fill-ins achieved a 1–2 record before the regular team returned. After a weak 5–10 finish, head coach Tom Flores moved to the front office and was replaced by Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan. Shanahan led the team to a 7–9 mark in 1988, and Allen and Jackson continued to trade places as the starting running back. Low game attendance and fan apathy were evident by this point, and in the summer of 1988, rumors of a Raiders return to Oakland intensified when a preseason game against the Houston Oilers was scheduled at Oakland Coliseum.Dickey, Just Win, Baby. p. 234. As early as 1986, Davis began to seek a new, more modern stadium away from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the dangerous neighborhood that surrounded it at the time (which caused the NFL to schedule the Raiders' Monday Night Football appearances as away games). In addition to the team having to share the venue with the USC Trojans, the Coliseum was aging and still lacked the luxury suites and other amenities that Davis was promised when he moved the Raiders to Los Angeles.Dickey, Just Win, Baby. p. 230. Finally, the Coliseum had 100,000 seats and was rarely able to fill all of them, and so most Raiders home games were blacked out on television. In August 1987, it was announced that the city of Irwindale paid Davis $10 million as a good-faith deposit for a prospective stadium site.Dickey, Just Win, Baby. p. 232. When the bid failed, Davis kept the non-refundable deposit. During this time Davis also almost moved the team to Sacramento in a deal that would have included Davis becoming the managing partner of the Sacramento Kings. =1989–1994: Final years=Negotiations with Oakland Negotiations between Davis and Oakland commenced in January 1989, and on March 11, 1990, Davis announced his intention to bring the Raiders back to Oakland.Dickey, Just Win, Baby. pp. 234–239. By September 1990, however, numerous delays had prevented the completion of the deal between Davis and Oakland. On September 11, Davis announced a new deal to stay in Los Angeles, leading many fans in Oakland to burn Raiders paraphernalia in disgust.Dickey, Just Win, Baby. pp. 240–244. New coach After starting the 1989 season with a 1–3 record, Shanahan was fired by Davis, which began a long-standing feud between the two. He was replaced by former Raider offensive lineman Art Shell, who had been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame earlier in the year. With the hiring, Shell became the first African American head coach in the modern NFL era, but the team still finished a middling 8–8. In 1990, Shell led Los Angeles to a 12–4 record. They beat the Bengals in the divisional round of the playoffs, but Bo Jackson had his left femur ripped from the socket after a tackle. Without him, the Raiders were crushed in the AFC Championship by the Buffalo Bills. Jackson was forced to quit football as a result, although surgery allowed him to continue playing baseball until he retired in 1994. Postseason losses The team's fortunes faded after the loss. They made two other playoff appearances during the 1990s, and finished higher than third place only three times. In 1991, they got into the postseason as a wild card after a 9–7 regular season, but fell to Kansas City. 1992 saw them drop to 7–9. This period was marked by the injury of Jackson in 1991, the failure of troubled quarterback Todd Marinovich, the acrimonious departure of Marcus Allen in 1993, and the retirement of Hall of Fame defensive end Howie Long after the 1993 season, where the Raiders went 10–6 and lost to Buffalo in the divisional round of the playoffs. The Todd Marinovich fiasco overshadowed the Raiders' 1991 and 1992 efforts. Marinovich was groomed from childhood to play football; his strict upbringing led to him being called \\"Robo QB\\" in the sports press. He attended USC and was the 24th overall pick in the 1991 draft. However, he struggled on field and was cut after the 1992 season due to repeated substance abuse problems. Shell's five-plus-year tenure as head coach in Los Angeles was marked particularly by a bitter dispute between star running back Marcus Allen and Al Davis. The exact source of the friction is completely unknown but a contract dispute led Davis to refer to Allen as \\"a cancer on the team.\\" By the late 1980s, injuries began to reduce Allen's role in the offense. This role was reduced further in 1987, when the Raiders drafted Bo Jackson—even though he originally decided to not play professional football in 1986 (when drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first round). By 1990, Allen had dropped to fourth on the team's depth chart, leading to resentment on the part of his teammates. In late 1992 Allen lashed out publicly at Davis, and accused him of trying to ruin his career. In 1993, Allen left to play for the rival Kansas City Chiefs. Shell was fired after posting a 9–7 record in the 1994 season. End of the Los Angeles Raiders In May 1995 after the departure of the Rams' for St. Louis, the owners of the National Football League teams approved with a 27–1 vote with two abstentions, a resolution supporting a plan to build a $200 million, privately financed stadium on property owned by Hollywood Park in Inglewood for the Raiders. The stadium would have also been the home of the UCLA Bruins football team, opened in 1997, and been guaranteed at least two Super Bowls. Al Davis balked and refused the deal over a stipulation that he would have had to accept a second NFL team at the stadium as soon as 1998. On June 23, 1995, Davis signed a letter of intent to move the Raiders back to Oakland. The move was approved by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors the next month, as well as by the NFL. The move was greeted with much fanfare, and under new head coach Mike White. Hollywood Park would later become the site of an NFL Stadium for their former rivals, the Los Angeles Rams and a divison rival, the Los Angeles Chargers. Attempted return to Los Angeles On February 19, 2015, the Raiders and the Chargers announced that they would build a privately financed $1.78 billion stadium in Carson, California if they were to move to the Los Angeles market. Both teams stated that they would continue to attempt to get stadiums built in their respective cities. On April 22, 2015, the Carson City Council bypassed the option to put the stadium to public vote and approved the plan 3–0. The council voted without having clarified several issues, including who would finance the stadium, how the required three-way land swap would be performed, and how it would raise enough revenue if only one team moved in as tenant. On May 19, 2015, the Chargers and Raiders announced that they had finalized a deal to secure land in Carson which was transferred to a joint powers authority in Carson after the 157-acre site was purchased by Carson Holdings a company set up by the two teams. The League was skeptical of the site and seemed to prefer the Rams' stadium plan on a site at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, the same place rejected by the Raiders in 1995. In response, Jerry Richardson, then owner of the Carolina Panthers, who supported the plan, convinced Chargers owner Dean Spanos to recruit Bob Iger, the then CEO of The Walt Disney Company. Iger was appointed non-executive chairman of the Carson stadium project. On January 4, 2016, the Raiders filed for relocation alongside the Chargers and Rams. Despite the sales pitch from Bob Iger, many owners held reservations about the Carson site, with Jerry Jones even making a wise crack about Bob Iger. The Committee set up by the league initially recommended the Carson Site, but the Chargers and Raiders were unable to secure the votes they needed to move. After hours of debate, the NFL owners voted to allow the St. Louis Rams to move back to Los Angeles after a two decade long absence on January 12, 2016 with the San Diego Chargers having the option to join them within a year. It was still possible, however, for the Raiders to move as they could have moved into the Rams' new stadium in Inglewood with the Rams if the Chargers opted to stay in San Diego. On January 12, 2017 the Chargers opted to join the Rams in Los Angeles, thereby closing the door on the return of the Raiders to the city. Although with an AFC West rival playing in Los Angeles, the Raiders get at least one game in Los Angeles each season playing the Los Angeles Chargers. Cultural impact and legacy The Raiders’ time in Los Angeles had a large cultural impact on both the Raiders brand and Los Angeles. During this time, there was an explosion of popularity in both the team and the Raiders brand, as L.A. was America's second-largest media market. The team's early success was coupled with brand exposure by way of Hollywood celebrities, most notably the gangsta rap group N.W.A., wearing Raiders gear. This period is chronicled by the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary Straight Outta L.A.. This period is also considered by many to have been the beginnings of Raider Nation. Today Los Angeles and Southern California continue to have a very large number of Raider fans. After the Raiders left Los Angeles, many fans began to travel to Oakland to see the Raiders play. The Southern California fans were considered essential to the success of the Raiders' relocation to Las Vegas.

De Jager received her training with Rotterdam's Scapino Ballet, and was then hired by the Dutch National Ballet. She achieved national fame when she began dancing and doing choreography for the jazz ballet of the popular television show TopPop (1970–1985). TopPop was a very popular music show in which artists mimed their hits in the television studio; if the artists were unavailable, one of the options was to have de Jager and her ballet perform while the hit was played. A reporter described her choreography 40 years later as striking, though somewhat monotonous, characterized by fluttering costumes and hair. She founded the Penney de Jager Ballet (later called \\"Holland Show Ballet\\", with production assistance from Frank Wentink) and ran a dance school in Utrecht. In 1971 she got married (for a short period) to Rick van der Linden, keyboard player for Ekseption, with whom she had a son, Rick Jr. De Jager had another son, David, who was adopted by a couple from the United States; later she followed him there. In the US she did choreography for TV ads and music videos. Having returned home for a vacation, she was not allowed to reenter the US and stayed in the Netherlands. In 2008 she moved to Stichtse Vecht, where she continued teaching dance, now also for senior citizens. For these efforts she was invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 2014.

According to one of the legends, the area of Lomnica was a hunting ground of the Serbian King Dragutin Nemanjić, and it was he who built this monastery. The region of Donji Birač contains many medieval necropoleis with the characteristic stećak tombstones and other archaeological artifacts. Lomnica was founded around 1570, after the Ottoman Empire sanctioned the restoration of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć. It was first mentioned in 1578 in an inscription in a liturgical book. Its founders and ktetors were monks Genadije and Akakije, who were probably merchants, craftsmen, or landowners before embracing monastic life. The iconostasis in the church was painted by Longin, who also painted icons in other Serbian monasteries of that time. The frescoes on the church's walls were finished in 1608, and one of the painters recorded that event on a wall. This inscription also relates that the painters were much harassed by Turks and softas, Islamic theological students known for their religious fanaticism and violence against Christians. Metropolitan of Dabar-Bosna Visarion visited Lovnica in 1693, which was also recorded on a wall. Fresco in the Lomnica church The final stages and aftermath of the Great Turkish War (1683–1699) were detrimental to many monasteries in Bosnia, but Lomnica came out of it without significant damages. However, its monastic community left it and never returned. In 1705, it was repurposed as a parish church serving surrounding villages. During the 18th century it was often visited by monks, priests, and other people from Bosnia, Herzegovina, central Serbia, Kosovo, and Montenegro. Many of the visitors wrote inscriptions on the walls and other surfaces inside the church, recording their names and dates of visits. This practice continued into the 19th century, and the latest such inscription was written by a monk from Visoki Dečani in 1852. A rather long 18th-century inscription ends with the statement, \\"It is wrong to write here, but I saw it from [someone] older, so I erred too.\\" There was a house by the church, in which the visitors could rest. Church services were held at Lomnica only on religious holidays. The region of Donji Birač had a committee consisting of priests and prominent villagers, whose duties included the care about the Lomnica church. It was guarded by an armed man, paid by the committee; nevertheless, it was robbed in 1880. In the mid-19th century, a landslide half-covered its northern wall. Wet soil remained there for years, and the moisture caused significant damage to the frescoes on that wall. Supporting walls were built east and south of the church to prevent its sliding toward the stream. The church was re-roofed in 1823 and 1884. In World War II, Yugoslav Partisans created a large field hospital next to the church. It came out of the war without significant damages. The conservation-restoration of the frescoes and the iconostasis began in 1952. The dormitory was rebuilt, and a monastic community was re-established at Lomnica in 1979. The monastery was designated as a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2005.

In it, Abdulin recounts his service in the 293rd Rifle Division, which became the 66th Guards Rifle Division, in 1942-43. Abdulin joined the division while it was rebuilding in Buzuluk in the late summer of 1942, and he served for about a year, until he was severely wounded in action in November, 1943, during the Battle of the Dnieper. Abdulin's book is one of the first of many memoirs of ordinary Red Army soldiers (enlisted men and junior officers) that have been published in English since the end of the Cold War, giving English readers a deeper understanding of the Soviet-German War from the Soviet side.  Creation and inspiration  Abdulin was severely wounded by a shell fragment in his left thigh on Nov. 28, 1943. This wound would eventually lead to his being invalided from the Red Army in 1944,Abdulin, pp 146-47 but while in hospital he encountered another wounded comrade, Vasili Shamrai. The two had fought together on what they called the \\"Island of Death\\" during the Dnieper crossing. Over the following few years, Abdulin worked to complete his memoir while at least some of his comrades, such as Shamrai, were still alive to read it. Some years after its Russian publication in 1991, Artem Drabkin, a Russian popular historian of the Soviet-German War, found a copy and realized it could find an English-speaking audience. He tracked Abdulin down in the town of Novotroitsk, and suggested an English edition. Abdulin's reply was \\"Why not? Let's give it a try...\\" The English edition was published in 2004.Drabkin's preface to Abdulin, pp vii-viii  Synopsis  The memoir begins in early November, 1942, as Abdulin arrives at the front for the first time, in the Kletskaya bridgehead on the west bank of the Don River to the north-west of Stalingrad. He is serving as the gun-layer of an 82mm mortar crew in the 1034th Rifle Regiment. After introducing the other men of his crew, he recounts his early life in Siberia. His parents were both members of the Communist Party, educated, and somewhat outsiders in the village of Sukhoi, but valued for their literacy. In his late teens, in 1940, Abdulin left school to join his father in the Miasski gold mines. As a miner he was exempt from military service, but soon after the German invasion he and three of his friends managed to persuade local officials to allow them to enlist. Of the four, only Abdulin would survive the war. After being sent to a military academy for officer candidates and getting very good grades, he had to use several stratagems to get sent to the front as a regular soldier with his comrades, where he also served as the komsorg (leader of the Komsomols of his company). He then recounts his first \\"kill\\" of a German soldier, while acting as a sniper, on Nov. 6. In recognition of this, he was invited to join the Communist Party, to serve as the partorg (leader of the Communists of his company), and also received the \\"For Courage\\" medal.Abdulin, pp 1-13 Abdulin next describes the reconnaissance-in-force staged by the 1034th Rifle Regiment on Nov. 14 against the German and Romanian lines; at a cost of 106 dead and 277 wounded or shell-shocked, this attack uncovered the entire enemy fire plan in preparation for the main offensive and made a marked impression on the author. The main offensive began on the 19th, and the following two chapters give his impressions of the breakthrough, exploitation and encirclement of the enemy forces, including a serious friendly-fire incident as the encirclement closed.Abdulin, ch 2-3 In the following three chapters the author recounts various incidents during Operation Koltso, the campaign to reduce the encircled enemy forces. During this time, the 293rd was operating under command of Don Front. In January, the division first liberates Pitomnik and then Gumrak airfield on the night of Jan. 21-22, which brought the German airlift to an end, abandoning thousands of wounded men. Abdulin summarizes the accomplishments of his division in this operation on page 69, and then celebrates the order that raised the division to Guards status on the 21st.Abdulin, ch 4-6 With his regiment now renumbered as the 193rd Guards Rifle Reg't., Abdulin writes of the German surrender in Stalingrad and the mopping-up operations before he and his comrades are railed northwest to become part of the 32nd Guards Rifle Corps of 5th Guards Army to the east of Kursk in Steppe Front. After the spring offensive comes to a halt, he describes the preparations for the German summer offensive. Steppe Front is in deep reserve, but has to be committed to back up Voronezh Front during the Battle of Kursk. In chapter 8 he recounts the regiment's actions in that battle, and in the next chapter the following offensive through Belgorod and into Ukraine (the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive). Chapter 10 gives Abdulin's first-hand impressions of the storming of a bridge over the Vorskla River and the subsequent liberation of Poltava on Sept. 23.Abdulin, ch 8-10 In the following chapter Abdulin tells of the remaining stages of the race to the Dniepr. His division entered Kremenchug on Sept. 29, and soon after reached the river near the village of Vlasovka, and began crossing to a sandspit island in the river on Oct. 5. This island, partly occupied by German forces, is later referred to as the \\"Island of Death\\" in the memoir. A mixed Soviet force manages to hold their positions in the face of heavy losses until the Germans evacuate on Oct. 12. Following this, the survivors recross to the east bank to find that the entire operation had been a successful feint attack as part of the overall offensive plan.Abdulin, ch 11 The final chapter has Abdulin finally crossing the Dniepr with his unit in November. On the 28th he is severely wounded in action after killing a German officer, as with his first \\"kill\\" using an SVT-40 semi-automatic rifle. Coming under enemy shellfire, he is hit by a fragment in his left thigh, cutting the sciatic nerve. This crippling injury leads to his evacuation from the battlefield, long stays in hospitals, and his eventual discharge from the Red Army. In an epilogue he recounts his post-war life, mainly his work back in the gold mines, marriage, and family.Abdulin, ch 12, Epilogue The book ends with three appendices, written by other writers, as they refer to Abdulin in the third person. The first is a brief recounting of the structure and the history of the 293rd and later 66th Guards Rifle Divisions. The second is a set of brief historical notes on the major battlefields Abdulin fought over. The third is a timeline of major events of the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War. The book also has an index.Abdulin, pp 166-195 References Category:1991 non-fiction books Category:World War II memoirs Category:Russian memoirs ","title":"Red Road from Stalingrad"},{"id":"49105753","text":"is a Japanese billionaire businessman, and art collector. Okada was formerly an executive at Wynn Resorts, and co-founder and former chairman of the Universal Entertainment Corporation, until his ousting in 2017 after allegations of financial mismanagement. Early life Kazuo Okada was born in 1942. Having lost his father at a young age, he became independent and supported his family. He studied at an engineering vocational school to take advantage of his interest and passion for mechanics. In an interview with the Financial Times, Okada claimed that \\"vacuum tubes are so much fun.\\" Career In 1969, Okada founded Universal Lease, which manufactured coin-operated arcade games for children. In late 1969, Okada's first visit to Las Vegas led to his decision to enter the business of slot machine manufacturing. He invented the \\"near-miss\\" feature in his slot machines, an innovation that helped expand the Japanese market of \\"pachislot\\" (a hybrid of Japan’s pachinko and Las Vegas slot machines) and also made Okada's slot machines popular in Las Vegas. Throughout the 1990s, Universal served as a major supplier of machines to the bustling Japanese pachinko industry. In 2000 Okada was introduced to Las Vegas-based casino magnate Steve Wynn, eventually investing $380 million in Wynn’s then-new company, Wynn Resorts. Wynn Resorts opened its first casino in 2005 in Las Vegas and a second one in 2006 in Macau. In 2008, Steve Wynn declined to join Okada in a major investment to build a casino in Entertainment City in Manila. Okada proceeded alone with the investment, forming a local company, Tiger Resort, Leisure and Entertainment, Inc., to handle the development of the Manila property. In July 2016, the property was unveiled as the Okada Manila, a $2.4 billion integrated hotel, resort and casino that represents Okada’s biggest investment to date. In 2017 Okada was accused of \\"misappropriating millions of dollars\\" from his holding company Okada Holdings. Universal Entertainment Corporation subsequently removed him from his chairman position by convincing his family members to vote him out of his Okada Holdings leadership role. Charges of misappropriating funds filed against Okada with Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption and Paranaque City Regional Court in Manila by Universal Entertainment Corporation have since been dismissed. In a statement released in September, 2018, Okada said \\"These trumped-up charges were merely meant to harass me and justify my illegal ouster. Far from being valid cases, their baseless accusations only serve to demonstrate the grand conspiracy perpetrated by my detractors who betrayed my trust\\", and vows to continue fighting for reinstatement as director, chairman and chief executive officer of the company.「Kazuo Okada released from Hong Kong bail conditions」Inside Asian Gaming Monday 25 February 2019 In 2019, Parañaque court issues warrant of arrest vs Japanese tycoon Kazuo Okada in connection w/ 3 estafa cases filed against him over his receipt of US$3.1 million alleged unauthorized compensation as CEO of Tiger Resort Leisure & Entertainment, Inc., operator of Okada Manila.「Court orders Japanese tycoon Okada's arrest」ABS-CBN News 06 January 2019 Art collection Okada is a collector of Japanese, Chinese and Korean art.

Career Prior to founding Clue, Tin ran a motorcycle tour company based in Denmark with her father. She was with the company for five years and toured locations like Vietnam, the United States, Cuba, Chile, and Mongolia. She later released a book about her experiences called Direktøs which became a Danish bestseller. In 2013, Tin co- founded the Clue app with Hans Raffauf, Moritz von Buttlar, and Mike LaVigne in Berlin, Germany. Tin began formulating an idea for the app in 2009 as a way to track her own menstrual and fertility cycle. In mid-2015, the app had around 1 million active users. In October 2015, the company raised $7 million in a funding round led by Union Square Ventures and Mosaic Ventures, bringing the total amount of funding up to $10 million. By November of that year, the number of active users had risen to 2 million representing over 180 countries. In late 2015, Tin worked with Apple to help them develop their own period tracking software for their HealthKit platform. Also in 2015, Tin was named the Female Web Entrepreneur of the Year at the Slush Conference. In 2016, Tin was credited for coining the term \\"femtech\\" to refer to technology designed for women's health. The term to referred to technology that addressed needs related to fertility, period-tracking, pregnancy, menopause and more. In September 2016, Tin spoke at the TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco on the topic of analytics in women's health. Two months later, Clue raised an additional $20 million in a funding round led by Nokia Growth Partners. In 2016 and 2017, Tin helped introduce new features to the app, including cycle- sharing and pill-tracking. In 2017, Tin announced that Clue was working on adding features to serve app users going through menopause. By 2018, Clue had 10 million users in 190 countries.

Also some extra original compositions would be added by hired writers or people that worked for the label.Canehdian.com Blues Train Biography One example of how an exploito album imitates a genuine release is the Mark, Don & Terry album which has the layout and cover art and design copies a recent release of a legitimate album.Ithsmus April 22, 2012 Vinyl Cave: \\"Monumental Funk\\" by Mark Farner and Don Brewer by Bob Koch They often ended up being put into stores by rack jobbers.

It is a small shrub with serrated leaves, broad serrated sepals and pink, purple or mauve flowers. Description Eremophila flabellata is a shrub, usually growing to less than tall with branches and leaves which are sticky and shiny due to resin and densely covered with simple hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately, mostly long, wide, egg-shaped to almost circular and with serrated edges. The flowers are borne singly on a hairy stalk which is long. There are 5 overlapping hairy, green to purple sepals which are mostly long, egg-shaped to fan-shaped with distinctly serrated edges. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petals are pink to mauve or purple on the outside and white inside the tube. The outer surface of the petal tube is hairy, but the inner surface of the petal lobes is glabrous while the inside of the tube is full of woolly hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from May to September and is followed by fruits which are dry, woody and hairy, a narrow oval shape to almost spherical, have a papery covering and are long.Meekatharra E. flabellata floral tube Taxonomy and naming Eremophila flabellata was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock in 1986, about south-west of Wiluna. The specific epithet is from the Latin flabellata, 'fan-shaped', referring to the shape of the sepals of this species. Distribution and habitat This eremophila often occurs in mulga woodland, growing in red-brown clay loam in the Meekatharra and Wiluna districts of the Murchison biogeographic region. Conservation status Eremophila flabellata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila has not often been grown in gardens but has interesting, serrated leaves and colourful flowers. It is difficult to propagate from seed or from cuttings and is one of the few of its genus that will not graft onto Myoporum rootstock. It prefers well-drained soil in a sunny location and tolerates light frosts.

It was built in 1943. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The fort complex was constructed in 1943 during World War II to protect the harbour and town from a feared Japanese invasion of Australia as Japanese forces moved south through the Pacific islands. Townsville was the major supply depot for Allied troops in the southeast Pacific and a staging post for troops moving north into the war zone. The fortifications were armed with French M3 guns on Panama carriage mounts which were commonly used on a number of Pacific islands as coastal defence weapons. The four guns on Magnetic Island had been en route to Bataan until it fell to the Japanese. They were redirected to Townsville to protect its vital port against the expected rapid advance of the Japanese. History shows that they were not needed and after the war the guns were returned to the American forces. At this time the fort was stripped of its fittings and left to return to nature. With the establishment of the Magnetic Island National Park, the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service assumed control of the complex, installed information signs and pathways and now administers the area.  Description  The fort complex was built during 1943 on the eastern side of Magnetic Island between Horseshoe Bay and Arcadia Bay. It was anchored into granite boulders on a heavily timbered, mountainous point overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The site contains derelict concrete structures with some timber and concrete remnants of the fabric such as the water pipeline, command post, searchlight tower, ammunition store, radar station, signal station, gun sites and direction finder. The remainder of the accommodation area can be seen in the form of concrete slabs on flat land near the pathway to the fort complex proper.  Heritage listing  The Fort Complex on Magnetic Island was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. This is a significant site which highlights the role of Townsville and the region in the Allied struggle to protect Australia from the advancing Japanese forces during the crucial war years of 1942-43. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Its significance is further highlighted because this site, together with those at Kissing Point, Townsville and on Cape Marlow at Pallarenda, are rare wartime fortifications of unique value. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. Its construction on a rugged headland and the installation of the hugh guns were wartime engineering achievements of some magnitude.

The nominal load capacity at launch was 1.5 (metric) tons. The vehicle was offered as a light van, a minibus (with seats in the back and more windows) or as a platform truck (Pritschenwagen), though various other body variants were available either directly from the manufacturer or from appropriately specialist vehicle body manufacturers. The van was launched in 1957 with the name Borgward B 1500 F. The \\"F\\" suffix stood for \\"Frontlenker-Transporter\\", and referred a design feature that was a first for Borgward, whereby the driver was positioned right at the front of the vehicle rather than behind a bonnet/hood with an engine underneath it. The engine was installed in a large pod between the driver and his passenger. Where three seats were used in the driver's area the central passenger sat on top of the engine pod. According to most sources it was only in 1959 that the vehicle received the name by which it is more commonly remembered today, Borgward B 611. Engine and running gear The front wheels were set back from the front of the car, and set between and above them, installed between the driver and his passenger, was a four cylinder four stoke water-cooled engine. B 611 buyers could choose between a petrol/gasoline fueled 1493 cc power unit delivering up to 60 hp (45 kW) and a diesel fueled 1758 cc unit with a maximum power output of just 42 hp (31 kW), but combining this with vastly superior fuel economy. The petrol/gasoline unit was shared with the Borgward Isabella that had been introduced a couple of years earlier. The gear ratios were not, however. The B 611 was delivered with a four-speed all-synchromesh manual gear change, controlled with a column mounted lever. Claimed top speed was 92 km/h (58 mph) for a petrol/gasoline powered van and a more leisurely 75 km/h (47 mph) for buyers selecting the diesel motor. Chassis The B 611 sat on a ladder-frame steel chassis with transverse reinforcement bars. At the front independent suspension used laterally mounted wishbones with coil springs. At the back a rigid \\"swing\\" axle was suspended with longitudinally mounted leaf springs. The engine, clutch, transmission, radiator and front suspension were all supported by an additional subframe.Peter Kurze: Borgward Typenkunde. Delius Klasing, Bielefeld 2009, , p. 118–120. Body Light van designs placing the driver and the engine together at the front of a relatively flat fronted cab had been pioneered in France by Citroën in 1939 with a design that incorporated front wheel drive. Eleven years and one world war later Volkswagen had launched a flat fronted rear wheel drive light van with the engine at the back. By placing the engine at the same end of the vehicle as the driving wheels, both the Citroen and Volkswagen approaches avoided having to locate a drive shaft along the length of the load area. But the front-wheel drive solution required the front wheels to be attached using a type of universal joint that was difficult to mass-produce at an acceptable cost without sacrificing strength, while with the rear engined Volkswagen design it was difficult to load goods over the engine from the back of the vehicle. In 1955 Mercedes-Benz had addressed the competing challenges with the L319 which combined a driving position (shared with the engine) right at the front with rear wheel drive, using a driveshaft lifted from a passenger car design. With this design the drive shaft ran not through the load deck but below it. That necessitated a far higher load deck than on the Volkswagen van or the comparable contemporary Citroën design, and the entire structure of the Mercedes-Benz light van was taller than the Volkswagen. It was also significantly wider which meant that the driver's cabin, with an engine in the middle of it, was more specious than on the British light vans of the period. With the B 611 Borgward followed the Mercedes-Benz lay-out. The engine was at the front and the driving wheels were at the back. The load-floor was high enough to accommodate the drive shaft that connected them. With a width of the Borgward van was actually slightly wider than the wide Mercedes equivalent. Both of them were much wider than the Volkswagen van which by the late 1950s had grown to a width of . The width of the Borgward van enabled the manufacture to offer customers the possibility of a third seat, mounted on top of the engine, in the driver's cabin. The van was also fractionally longer than the Mercedes-Benz which Borgward had apparently benchmarked for the design. The B 611 nevertheless had long overhangs at each end, and while the wheelbase was identical to that found on the Borgward Isabella passenger car, it was a full shorter than that of the Mercedes-Benz L 319. Borgward publicity material of the time explained that this gave the vehicle a conveniently tight turning circle. Commercial With a wide comfortable cabin offering space for three people and using uncomplicated technology the Borgward 611 won friends in the press and in the market place. By the time of Borgward's controversial bankruptcy in 1961 the manufacturer had produced 14,748 of them.

This school also runs Chandrodaya Multiple College, also known as CMC, affiliated with Tribhuvan University offering a 4-year BBS and 4-years B.Ed. This school successfully passed it glorious 50 years in 2066 B.S. This school is around 85 km far from Kathmandu near Prithvi Highway. It is also near to Trishuli River (about half a kilometre). It is one of the oldest schools of Dhading District.  Establishment, History and Development  The Shree Chandrodaya Higher Secondary School was established in 1960 A.D. in Benighat VDC of Dhading District by the effort of local youth when The Education Department from Nuwakot District gave permission to operate a primary school and contributed NRs. 600 per annum. That NRs. 600 was the main source of school operation and in addition local people also used to contribute some money. At the time of its establishment, it was located in the Benighat Bazar. The Sanskrit, English, Mathematics and Nepali were the subjects of study. At the very beginning, the school didn't have a proper building and the learning activity was started in a shrine like house and there used to be merely 15-18 students. Even after a decade of its establishment, it has to wander here and there in order to get a proper land. It was like a mobile school. In 1965AD, the school was shifted from Benighat Bazar to Bishaltar, just above the current location of the school where the school has got its own premises. When the construction of Prithvi Highway started, the location was inaccessible for the students and people again started thinking to shift it nearby Prithvi Highway where the access is easy. In 1969, all the villagers came to a conclusion that the school should be shifted to the village of Bishaltar centering all the local dwellers where there is now the primary wing of Shree Chandrodaya Higher Secondary School. In 1977, it became a Lower Secondary School. In 1979, the Management Committee felt that the location was insufficient. So, they built a building and shifted the Lower Secondary School to the western part of the Bishaltar village called Baltar. The villagers from Benighat VDC, Dhusa VDC of Dhading District and Ghyalchok VDC of Gorkha District also contributed to make a building and other required infrastructures. Then slowly it became a Secondary School. As the infrastructure was not durable, its condition became miserable. At that time, an INGO Hanuman Onlus made first visit in the school and decided to help the school by building a new building. They buillt a 12-room cemented building along with toilet in association with another INGO C.O.Y.O.N. In 2009, the school became a Higher Secondary School. Today, this school has developed a lot. Chandrodaya Multiple Campus was also established where BBS and B.Ed are taught. Its one of the main attraction of the passengers passing by during their journey to Kathmandu. This school is one of the richest schools of Dhading District. Every single room is decorated with a white board, well painted desks and benches, fans, and lights.

Many believe Ramanuja was born into the Harita Gothra, and to the writings of the some, few believe that Ramanujacharya was born into the Shatamarshana Gothra. Natha Munigal,Korukonda, Srimath Tirumala Venkata are some of the important names of shatamarshana gothras.  Rishis  The Shatamarshana gothra originated from three rishis - Angirasa, Purukutsa and Trasadasyu. The first is almost the most famous of rishis of the vedic age. Purukutsa was in the company of kings and he was responsible for financing the marriages of a large number of girls. The third name means \\"who is dreaded by thieves\\" He was a minister with a king to strike terror in the hearts of the thieves.  Rishi Pravaram  Angirasa Pourukutsa Trasadasyu Threyarusheya Pravaranvita Shatamarshana Gothrasya (Gothrobhavasya) or Angirasa Vishnuvardhana Pourukutsava Threyarusheya Pravaranvita Shatamarnshana Gothraysa (Gothrobhavasya)  Heritage  Coming to much later times, we have a galaxy of names of those belonging to this gothra. Nathamunigal, the compiler of the Naalayira Divya Prabhandham was one. But for him, we would not have the hymn's of the Alwars. His grandson was Yamunacharya or Alavandar who ruled a principality in the then Tamil Nadu. He was the manaseeka guru of Ramanuja Charya - the founder of Visishta dvaita system of philosophy. Tirumalai Nambigal for whom a shrine exists in the outer prakara of the Tirumala temple. He was the maternal uncle of Ramanuja. Nambigal did theertha-pushpa kainkaryam to Lord Venkateswara. His descendants to this day continue the practice devotedly. Nambigal also taught Srimad Ramaynam to his nephew Ramanuja and hence was one of the five gurus of Ramanuja. These people are the descendants of Tirumalai Nambigal for whom a shrine exists in Tirupathi temple of Govindaraja, on the foothills of the Tirumala temple.  History  Coming to historical times. there was Lakshmi Kumara Thathachariar who was a minister under the Vijayanagar kings. The name Thathachariar came because the Lord himself addressed him as \\"thatha, give me some water\\" which he was carrying to the Lord Venkateswara- so goes the legend. Lakshmi Kumara was divinely blessed and he was responsible for helping poor people to perform marriages of their daughters. Followed the path laid by his ancestral rishi! He was also called as Kottikannikadhana Thathachariar. He lived in 15th century. One of his descendants travelled further down to Tamil Nadu and near Vandavasi came to a village. As he was about to perform his Sandhyavandanam, he saw a soldier - his horse was nearby sleeping and a cobra spreading its hood over his head to protect him from the sun. He was wonder struck and talked to the soldier after he woke up. He could perceive that the ordinary soldier has a special future and might one day become king. He told him so and the soldier went on his way down to Thanjavur. He did become a chieftain and remembered his guru. He founded the village Navalpakkam and built a Srinivasa Perumal temple there for his guru. Even to this day, that village consists of a number of learned scholars and pundits - whose fame has spread far and wide. One of them was called Ayya Kumara Tata Desikan (Ayya Kumara Thathachariar). His descendants who came to Kumbakonam called themselves Patracharis (patta in Tamil means tata in Sanskrit). Some family traces its lineage from this saint for whom a niche sannidhi is provided in the famous Sarangapani Temple of Kumbakonam.  Thatha Origination  The word Thatha/Tata originates from Tirumalai Nambi or Srisaila Purna. On LakshmiKumara - Sri Lakshmi Kumara Tata Desikan. He was born at Kumbakonam in the Tamil year of Prajotpathi, in the month of Karthikai, Anusha nakshatram in 1575 A.D A day after Sri Rama Navami, in 1632 A.D. Prajotpathi Samvatsaram, in the month of Panguni, this great Acharya attained moksha on the way to Chandagiri from Tirumalai hills.  Abhivadaye  Abhivadaye is a religious practice among Hindu men to introduce themselves to others especially the elders. It is practiced even today widely among the Brahmin. The importance of giving respect to elders, in whole means it is an introduction of self with lineage. It consists of a set of lines which is essentially used to introduce one's * Pravara * Gothra * Sutrakaara or the author one has been following * Branch of Veda one is versed * One's own name It varies based on one's Gothra.

The work was jointly commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the NDR Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Orchestre National de France. It was first performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles on May 14, 2015, by the baritone Gerald Finley and Los Angeles Philharmonic under the conductor Gustavo Dudamel. The piece is dedicated to Gerald Finley. Composition True Fire has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in six movements: #Proposition I #River #Proposition II #Lullaby #Farewell #Proposition III The first movement \\"Proposition I\\" is based on a reflection by the essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. The second movement \\"River\\" is based on a text by the poet Seamus Heaney. \\"Proposition II\\" is also based on a text by Emerson and was described by the composer as \\"the heart of the piece.\\" The fourth movement \\"Lullaby\\" is based on a traditional Native American song. \\"Farewell\\" draws the piece into a darker mood before the final movement \\"Proposition III\\" concludes the piece with a \\"sensation of weightless energy\\". Additional text in the piece is taken from the poetry of Mahmoud Darwish. Saariaho described her intent for piece in the score program note, writing, \\"My preliminary idea was to explore the baritone voice in the context of various texts, finding an organic way to access the different colors of the voice through the texts.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo baritone and an orchestra comprising three flutes (doubling piccolo and alto flute), two oboes, three clarinets (doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons (doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, harp, and strings. Reception True Fire has been praised by music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"The performance was strong. Dudamel remained constantly attuned to Saariaho's vastly changeable instrumental colors, a cosmic sonic background for Finley, who handled each song with operatic intensity, part of a grand psychodrama of searching for meaning, for words that can obtain meaning through music but can also become emptied of meaning when sung.\\" He added, \\"This is a profound, important work.\\" Henry Schlinger of Culture Spot LA observed, \\"...the orchestral writing was superb, plumbing the depths of the color and timbre, and the LA Phil pulled it off splendidly. Compositions like True Fire have to be heard and seen in person; it is almost like performance art.\\" Conversely, Donna Perlmutter of LA Observed gave the piece a negative review, remarking, \\"True Fire [...] was overly long at 30 minutes, considering its unrelieved, dirge-like stretches of doom and gloom. Singer Gerald Finley has had more grateful opportunities and the merely respectful audience buzzed with conspicuous naysayers afterward in the lobby.\\" References Category:Compositions by Kaija Saariaho Category:2014 compositions Category:Classical song cycles in English Category:Compositions for symphony orchestra Category:Music commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic ","title":"True Fire"},{"id":"49106569","text":"This is a list of years in Somalia.

It was situated just north of the summit of the company's main line and served the scattered community of Moresby Parks in Cumbria, England. History The line was one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, being specifically born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. The station was on the line from to . Both line and station opened to passengers on 1 October 1879. All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the new line to Workington, which earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". General goods and passenger services were provided, but were very small beer compared with mineral traffic. The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. Services Passenger trains consisted of antiquated Furness stock hauled largely by elderly Furness engines referred to as \\"rolling ruins\\" by one author after a footplate ride in 1949. No Sunday passenger service was ever provided on the line. The initial passenger service in 1879 consisted of *two Up (northbound) trains a day, leaving at 09:20 and 13:45, calling at , Moresby Parks, , and terminating at Workington, taking 30 minutes in all. *they returned as Down trains, leaving Workington at 10:30 and 16:00 In 1880 the extension northwards to was opened. The service was extended to run to and from Siddick and an extra train was added, with * three up trains a day, leaving Moor Row at 07:40, 10:12 and 14:45, taking 30 minutes to Workington and an extra four to proceed to Siddick, where connections were made with the MCR. * Down trains left Siddick at 08:45, 12:22 and 17:00 By 1922 the service reached its high water mark, with: * five up trains a day from Moor Row through to Siddick, leaving Moor Row at 07:20, 09:50, 13:15, 16:50 and 1820. * one train Mondays to Fridays Only from Moor Row to Workington, leaving at 13:45 and also calling at , making that halt qualify as a publicly advertised passenger station * one Saturdays Only train leaving Cleator Moor (NB not from Moor Row) at 12:50 for Workington * one Saturdays Only train leaving Moor Row at 19:35 for Workington There was one fewer Down train, as the 09:50 Up was provided to give a connection at Siddick with a fast MCR train to with connections beyond. Although not serving Cleator Moor, two Saturdays Only trains left at 16:05 and 21:35 for Workington, calling at Distington and High Harrington, with balancing workings leaving Workington at 15:30 and 21:00. There were also trains using the Lowca Light Railway plying between and Workington, but they served no \\"pure\\" C&WJR; stations other than Workington Central. As with advertised passenger trains, in 1920 workmen's trains ran on the company's three southern routes: * between Workington Central and Lowca using the Lowca Light Railway * between (Rowrah's \\"other station\\") and on the single track \\"Baird's Line\\", and * on the \\"main line\\" between Siddick Junction and Moor Row ** from Siddick Junction to Moor Row, calling at all passenger stations except Moresby Parks, calling at instead ** from Moor Row to , calling at Cleator Moor and The situation in 1922 was similar. The 1920 Working Time Table shows relatively few Goods trains, with just one a day in each direction booked to call at Moresby Parks. Mineral traffic was an altogether different matter, dwarfing all other traffic in volume, receipts and profits. The key source summarises it \\"...the 'Track of the Ironmasters' ran like a main traffic artery through an area honeycombed with mines, quarries and ironworks.\\" The associated drama was all the greater because all the company's lines abounded with steep inclines and sharp curves, frequently requiring banking. The saving grace was that south of Workington at least, most gradients favoured loaded trains. During the First World War especially, the company ran \\"Double Trains\\", akin to North American practice, with two mineral trains coupled together and a banking engine behind, i.e. locomotive-wagons-guards van- locomotive-wagons-guards van-banker. Such trains worked regularly between and , passing through Moresby Parks. The practice was discontinued after dark from 1 April 1918. Most stations on the company's lines had heavy industrial neighbours, such as ironworks next to Cleator Moor West, or served primarily industrial workforces, such as Keekle Colliers' Platform. Throughout its working life Moresby Parks was more rural, though by 2013 the station site was surrounded by a substantial housing estate. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the railway was at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when 1,644,514 tons of freight were handled. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of £83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling £6,570. Rundown and closure The high water mark for tonnage was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by- step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected in 1919 and the Admiralty saving the northern extension in 1937 by establishing an armaments depot at Broughton. Moresby Parks station closed on 13 April 1931 when normal passenger traffic ended along the line. Diversions and specials, for example to football matches, made use of the line, but it was not easy to use as a through north–south route because all such trains would have to reverse at Moor Row or . An enthusiasts' special ran through on 6 September 1954, the only one to do so using main line passenger stock. The next such train to traverse any C&WJR; metals did so in 1966 at the north end of the line, three years after the line through Moresby Parks closed. Afterlife By 2013 aerial images clearly show the line of route and that the area around the station site had been transformed by housing. The station site itself appeared to be a scrapyard.

The work was jointly commissioned by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre national de Lyon, Southbank Centre, and the Philharmonia Orchestra. It was first performed in Montreal on May 29, 2014, by the organist Olivier Latry and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under the conductor Kent Nagano. Composition Maan varjot has a duration of approximately 15 minutes and is composed in three numbered movements. Saariaho described the work in the score program notes, writing: The title of the piece comes from Percy Bysshe Shelley's 1821 poem Adonaïs (an elegy to John Keats) and was chosen in memory of the composer's father. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo organ and an orchestra comprising piccolo, two flutes (2nd doubling alto flute), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, E-flat clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, harp, and strings. Reception Maan varjot has received a positive response from music critics. Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"This may not be exactly a return on her part to her organ roots, but the electric energy she brings to the timbre of the organ as well as to the orchestra is a reminder not just of where she came from but also how far she has come.\\" He added, \\"The central movement held the most earthly colors, the grays and browns of the metallic elements and of the soil. Lush melody found a voice. But radiance again rose in the final section, a mirage of sound effects.\\" Hannah Nepil of the Financial Times also lauded the piece, writing, \\"Maan varjot is a sophisticated example of Saariaho's work; its shimmering textures and gliding harmonies seem to come from a galaxy far beyond our own, evoking a reel of cinematic images. For large sections, we could be at the bottom of an ocean, in a world of rippling, mysterious shapes and shadows. Then we come up for air to hear what sounds like parts of Messiaen's Turangalîla Symphony put through a blender. Only at this point does the organ let out a real roar, a moment savoured by Latry.\\" Jim Farber of the San Francisco Classical Voice declared it a \\"superb example\\" of Saariaho's music, opining, \\"At times the organ blends into the orchestral fabric as a rumbling, pulsing, growling presence. Then like a magma pool no longer under restraint, it bursts forth in eruptive crescendos of full-voiced magnitude causing tectonic shifts in the orchestral landscape.\\" Conversely, Andrew Clements of The Guardian called the work \\"a curious piece\\" and remarked, \\"The three movements flit in and out of focus, and the solo writing seems to reference a century's worth of the organ repertoire from Franck, through Reger, to Messiaen and Langlais. Even the Festival Hall's clinical acoustic couldn't really resolve the shifting sonorities of the opening section, and the ambiguities between the microtonal writing for the orchestra and the well- tempered pitches of the organ don't really register as they should.\\" References Category:Compositions by Kaija Saariaho Category:2013 compositions Category:Music for orchestra and organ Category:Music commissioned by the Philharmonia Orchestra ","title":"Maan varjot"},{"id":"49106811","title":"1936–37 Gauliga"},{"id":"49106816","text":"Mumbai-Pune Mail (started as Bombay-Poona Mail) or Poona Mail was a luxurious train on Mumbai-Pune section by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway.

Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies (2nd ed.) p. 233 Retranslation of classic literature and religious texts is common. Retranslation may happen for many reasons, e.g., in order to update obsolete language, in order to improve the quality of translation, in order to account for a revised edition of the source text, or because a translator wishes to present a new interpretation or creative response to a text.Isabelle Vanderschelden, 'Re-Translation' in Olive Classe (ed.) Routledge Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English (2000, vol.2) p. 1155 This is most common in poetry and drama. The translation scholar Lawrence Venuti has argued that texts with very great cultural authority, including \\"the Bible, [...] the Homeric epics, Dante's Divine Comedy, Shakespeare's plays, or the Miguel de Cervantes novel Don Quixote, are likely to prompt retranslation because different readerships in the receiving culture may have different interpretations, and may want to apply their own values to the text.\\"Lawrence Venuti, 'Retranslations: The creation of value' in Bucknell Review 47(1) (2004), pp. 25-38 Retranslation is common in subtitling. It is less common in dubbing and the response from viewers is not always positive.Campagna anti- ridoppiaggio Different ways of using the term The term 'retranslation' has been used to means various things, including indirect translation, also known as relay translation, where a text is translated into one language and then that translation is translated into a further language. In translation studies, the accepted meaning is now as a new translation into the same target language of a previously translated work.Kaisa Koskinen and Outi Paloposki, \\"Retranslation\\" in Luc van Doorslaer & Yves Gambier (eds.) Handbook of Translation Studies, vol.1. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 2010, pp. 294-298 The traditional conceptualization holds that the process is linear or chronological, with retranslation always taking place after the first translation. Modern usage, however, does not always imply this and may be demonstrated in the following examples: * Retranslations occurring simultaneously or near-simultaneously so that it is difficult to determine the first from succeeding translations. * Retranslations produced in the same language but different markets such as French and French Canadian. * Retranslations made on the assumption that previous translations are not acceptable.  Retranslation hypothesis  In a 1990 issue of the translation journal Palimpsestes, Paul Bensimon and Antoine Berman posited what is known as the \\"retranslation hypothesis\\". They argued that the first translation of a text into a given language tends to adapt the text to the norms and conventions of the target language and culture, while later translations tend to stay closer to the original, because if a text is translated again it is because its status in the new culture has prompted a second (or further) translation.Şehnaz Tahir Gürçağlar, 'Retranslation' in Mona Baker & Gabriela Saldanha (eds.)

Claims, Changes and Challenges in Translation Studies: Selected Contributions from the EST Congress, Copenhagen 2001. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 2004, pp. 27-38 The hypothesis has been tested by a number of subsequent scholars who have suggested that it is too simplistic. In an article on retranslation in Finland, Paloposki and Koskinen argue that although many retranslations do conform to Berman and Bensimon's model, \\"there are no inherent qualities in the process of retranslating that would dictate a move from domesticating strategies towards more foreignising strategies.\\"Outi Paloposki and Kaisa Koskinen, 'A thousand and one translations: Revisiting retranslation' in Gyde Hansen, Kirsten Malmkjaer, Daniel Gile (eds.)

Parshley in 1953 of Simone de Beauvoir's 1949 book The Second Sex (Le Deuxième Sexe), has been much criticised.Moi, Toril, \\"While we wait: The English translation of The Second Sex\\" in Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society vol. 27, no. 4 (2002), pp. 1005–1035. A new translation by Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany- Chevalier appeared in 2009 and was felt by many critics to be a more accurate representation of de Beauvoir's text.Smith, Joan, \\"The Second Sex\\", in The Independent (London). As some commentators have pointed out, however, when a translation has been enormously influential it can be hard to argue that it is somehow a failure.Crowe, Catriona, \\"Second can be the best\\". The Irish Times Many classic Russian novels have been translated a number of times; in recent years Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have produced well-received retranslations of works including Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov and The Idiot, and Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace and Anna Karenina.Abramovich, Alex. \\"Russian-to-English translators turned Oprah stars\\", Newsday article, July 31, 2004, reproduced in EIZIE.

The division took part in the Soviet invasion of Poland and the Winter War. After Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, the 50th fought in the Battle of Moscow, the Battles of Rzhev, the Donbass Strategic Offensive, the Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive, the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, Vistula–Oder Offensive and the Berlin Offensive.  History  In May 1936, the division was formed from Construction Headquarters No. 27 as the Urovskaya Division of the Polotsk Fortified Region. It took part in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939. On 17 September, it was part of the 3rd Army's 4th Rifle Corps. On 2 October, it was transferred to the 10th Rifle Corps of the same army. The 50th Rifle Division then fought in the Winter War. On 28 December, it was stationed in the region near Lake Sukhodolskoye. On 18 January 1940, it was subordinated to the 13th Army. The division became part of the 30th Rifle Corps on 30 January. On 21 January, the division went to the front lines. From 1–2 February, it fought in the Pasuri village on the Karelian Isthmus. On 11 February, it again attacked Finnish positions at Pasuri. It broke through the Finnish positions at Salmenkayta due to its artillery support, which damaged the morale of the defenders. On 23 February, it was stationed near the Salmenkayta River. Between 1–7 April, the division was transported by train back to Belarus. The division was then based in Lida and was part of the 21st Rifle Corps. In January 1941, it returned to Polotsk. On 22 June, Germany attacked the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. According to the Western Front order of 24 June, the 21st Rifle Corps, including the division, became part of the 13th Army. It defended the line of the Viliya River northwest of Molodechno. The division received orders to advance on Ashmyany. However, divisional intelligence discovered that German armored and motorized forces were present in the town. The division was forced to retreat towards Molodechno under pressure from the German motorized troops. After the German capture of Minsk on 26 June, 13th Army was split into several groups. Molodechno was captured by German troops the next day. The 50th Rifle Division then retreated along the northern flank towards the Berezina River north of Barysaw. On the morning of 30 June, the division was in region of Lahoysk and Pleshchenitsy. The remnants of the 64th Rifle Division and the 100th Rifle Division's 331st Rifle Regiment were attached to the division there. On 1 July, the division withdrew from Pleshchenitsy. On 2 July, the division was attacked by German troops of the 20th Motorized Division advancing down the Logoysky road and was forced to retreat from Begoml. However, the division was able to hold the German advance for three days during fighting north of Barysaw. On 5 July, the division began the retreat to Syanno and was fighting near Vitebsk from 7 July. On 11 July, it was sent to Velizh to be rebuilt due to heavy losses. On 14 July, German troops attacked Velizh and the division had to retreat to the east. On 23 July, remnants of the division were withdrawn from the fighting with the intention of reinforcing positions 12 kilometers east of Vyazma. The division became part of 19th Army's reserve on 2 August. On 6 August, the division was sent back into combat during the Battle of Smolensk. The division advanced 17 kilometers from Yartsevo and then held defensive positions on the line of Ryadnyi, Osipova and Chistaya. The division was still holding the positions on 3 October, southeast of Dukhovshchina, but on 4 October, it withdrew to the line of the Vop River and defend the east bank at Kurganova, Podylische and Ozerische, repulsing German attempts at crossing the river. On 5 October, army commander Ivan Konev ordered the division to move to Vyazma. Due to various motor transport delays, the division didn't arrive at Vyazma until 7 October. Upon its arrival, the division was ordered by Rokossovsky to defend the northern approaches to the city. Due to the German advance, the division was then forced to retreat to the east. It was able to escape being encircled in the Vyazma Pocket. On 19 October, the division fought in the battle for Vereya but was immediately removed and transferred to the area of Dorokhovo and Shchalikovo, covering the Mozhaysk approaches. Having made a night march, the division arrived at the Shchalikovo area by the morning of 20 October and fought in combat with advancing German troops. By the evening of 20 October, the division moved across the Protva River near Alexino and Petrischeva. It then withdrew to Dorokhov, where it organized a defence. The division was assisted by the remnants of the 19th and 103rd Rifle Divisions. On 23 October, the division came under heavy attack along with the 22nd Tank Brigade and was forced to retreat eastwards. On 25 October, more than 800 personnel of the 230th Reserve Training Rifle Regiment, attached to the division, were killed in the village of . By 31 October, the division had stopped its retreat at Tuchkovo. From 16 November to 11 December, it held the line at Polushkino, Hertz and Agafonov.

On 11 December, it went on the offensive, crossing the Moskva River on 13 December and capturing several villages. The division continued to advance and by 20 December had captured Krasotinom, Kozhin and the village of Kagonovich on the south bank of the Moskva. On 21 December, German troops launched a heavy counterattack and the division was forced to withdraw across the river. On 11 January 1942, the division began a renewed offensive and recaptured Tuchkovo. On 12 January, it continued to advance in towards Mozhaisk and surrounded German troops in Beloborodova. On 13 January, it captured Dubrovka. Continuing to pursue the German troops from Dorokhovo, the division by 16 January was at the line of Kostino, Krasny Stan, Alexandrovo, Mikhailovsky, and Bugaylovo. By the morning of 17 January, the division had captured the village of Pervomaisk. On 19 January, the division, in conjunction with the 20th Tank Brigade, bunkered down in the area of Makarovo and Teterino. From then until April, it was fighting west of Gzhatsk, where the division met resistance from German troops and fought there until the beginning of 1943. At the beginning of 1943, the division was transferred to the line of the Siversky Donets, where the Voroshilovgrad Offensive had recently failed. The division took up positions at the bend of the Siversky Donets but upon arrival attacked and captured a bridgehead across the river at the village of Tatyanovka. However, the division was forced to retreat to the other bank and was relocated downstream to the Sidorovka area. On 17 July, the division crossed the Donets during the Izyum-Barvenkovo Offensive and was able to capture a small bridgehead. The division participated in the Donbass Strategic Offensive from 13 August. It advanced through Pavlogradsky District. During the Zaporizhia Offensive, the division participated in the capture of Zaporizhia on 14 October.

The division resumed the offensive on 5 January 1944 during the Kirovograd Offensive. By 7 January, it had captured Kirovograd and was awarded the honorific of that name two days later. From 9 to 12 January, it led the advance on Alt Danzig. Advancing on the right flank of the 9th Guards Airborne Division, the division began the drive on Pervomaisk during the Uman–Botoșani Offensive on 3 March. On 29 March, it received the Order of the Red Banner for its actions during the offensive. At the beginning of April, the division became part of the front reserve. By May, it had been transferred to the bridgehead on the Prut north of Iași. During May and June, it led the defence of the bridgehead at the key position of Ollarilor. On 19 August, the division began to advance and led fighting 13 kilometers north of Jassy. The division was one of the units fighting in the capture of Jassy on 21 August. On 5 September, the division was placed in reserve and transferred to the Volodymyr-Volynskyi. From there it was sent to the area of Gmina Jeżowe, Rozvaduv and Rudnik. The division became part of the 52nd Army's 73rd Rifle Corps from January 1945. On 17 January 1945, the division resumed the offensive in the Sandomierz–Silesian Offensive. It advanced toward Staszów, Radomsko, and Gmina Rychtal. On 25 January, it fought in the capture of Oleśnica and by the end of the month was at Breslau. The division fought in the siege of Breslau. On the night of 30 January, the division crossed the Oder 10 kilometers northwest of Breslau. From February onwards, it fought in the Lower Silesian Offensive. It received the Order of Suvorov 2nd class on 19 February 1945 for its actions. During fierce fighting at the end of March, it advanced to Bunzlau. It then fought in the Berlin Offensive from 16 April. On that day, it led the fighting for Gross Krausha, 9 kilometers north of Görlitz. In May, the division fought in the Prague Offensive. It advanced on Prague from the north through Mladá Boleslav. The division ended the war in Prague. It was still subordinated to the 52nd Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front at the end of the war.Poirer and Connor, Red Army Order of Battle On 26 May, the division was awarded the Order of Kutuzov 2nd class. Postwar, the division transferred to Sambir in the Carpathian Military District with the corps.

This acclaimed Nashville modern rock quartet went on to have their music appear on the 2004 seasons of MTV's popular Road Rules X-Treme and The Real World. After gaining notoriety and being approached by a number of record labels, Krieger and Harsh formed their own independent record label, Tabula Rasa, to release their eponymous debut album in May, 2005. While this self- titled album was released by Tabula Rasa Records, it was distributed by Sony Music Entertainment/RED Distribution. In August 2005, Harsh Krieger's single \\"Home\\" hit #1 Independent Rock Song on MediaGuide’s charts. Shortly after hitting #1, Krieger decided to shift focuses and founded Krieger Consulting Group, providing business development and strategic consulting for a number of musicians and notable sports clients including four-time Super Bowl Champion, Bill Romanowski's Nutrition53 sports supplement line.

The adjectives such as \\"pseudo-\\" and \\"lax-\\" are used to refer to the fact equalities are weakened in coherent ways; e.g., pseudo-functor, pseudoalgebra.  Coherent isomorphism  In some situations, isomorphisms need to be chosen in a coherent way. Often, this can be achieved by choosing canonical isomorphisms. But in some cases, such as prestacks, there can be several canonical isomorphisms and there might not be an obvious choice among them. In practice, coherent isomorphisms arise by weakening equalities; e.g., strict associativity may be replaced by associativity via coherent isomorphisms. For example, via this process, one gets the notion of a weak 2-category from that of a strict 2-category. Replacing coherent isomorphisms by equalities is usually called strictification or rectification.  Coherence theorem  The Mac Lane coherence theorem states, roughly, that if diagrams of certain types commute, then diagrams of all types commute. There are several generalizations (see for instance ). But each such a theorem has the rough form that “every weak structure of some sort is equivalent to a stricter one”.

He graduated in 1997 after passing the first state examination in Law. In 2000 he passed the second state examination and since 2009 has worked as a lawyer for the Nachmann Vilgertshofer Scharf Barfuß Rechtsanwalts GmbH in Munich. Political career From 1994 to 2003, Mayer was chairman of the Regional Association of the youth organisation Junge Union in Altötting. Since 1997 he has been a deputy chairman of the CSU district association Altötting and to the council of the CSU Upper Bavaria district, led by Ilse Aigner. Since 2006, Mayer has been a Deputy Regional Chairman of the Union of Expellees (Union der Vertriebenen (UdV)), and since 2009 a member of the CSU leadership under party chairman Horst Seehofer. =Member of Parliament, 2002–present= Since the 2002 elections, Mayer has been a member of the Bundestag. In the 2009 elections, he received 60.7 percent of the primary votes and thus achieved the third best result in Germany. In the Bundestag, Mayer was a full member of the Committee on Internal Affairs and of the Sports Committee. In that capacity, he was his parliamentary group's rapporteur on privacy law. He was a member of the Parliamentary Oversight Panel (PKGr) that provides parliamentary oversight of Germany's intelligence services. He chairs the so-called G10 Commission, which takes decisions on the necessity and admissibility of restrictions on the privacy of correspondence, posts and telecommunications pursuant to Article 10 of the Basic Law. He was an alternate member of the Committee on Transport, Building and Urban Development and of the NSA Investigation Committee. Within the group of CSU parliamentarians, Mayer chaired the Working Group for Internal Affairs, law, sport, voluntary work, culture and media of the CSU. In addition to his committee assignments, Mayer served as chairman of the German- British Parliamentary Friendship Group. In the negotiations to form a coalition government of the Christian Democrats (CDU together with the Bavarian CSU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) following the 2009 federal elections, Mayer was part of the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on internal and legal affairs, led by Wolfgang Schäuble and Sabine Leutheusser- Schnarrenberger. Later, in the negotiations to form a Grand Coalition of the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats (SPD) following the 2013 federal elections, he was part of the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on integration and migration, led by Maria Böhmer and Aydan Özoğuz. In February 2016, Mayer accompanied the president of the German Bundestag Norbert Lammert on a visit to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan to learn more about the plight of Syrians fleeing the Syrian civil war.Bundestagspräsident Lammert besucht deutsche Truppen in Incirlik und reist zu Gesprächen nach Jordanien und Kuwait Deutscher Bundestag, press release of February 5, 2016. =State Secretary = In the fourth government under Chancellor Angela Merkel, Mayer served as Parliamentary State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of the Interior under Horst Seehofer.Christian Deutschländer (March 8, 2018), Dieser Oberbayer wird Innen-Staatssekretär von Seehofer in Berlin Münchner Merkur.

He sometimes published his work using his real name James S. Holmes, and other times the pen names Jim Holmes and Jacob Lowland. In 1956 he was the first non-Dutch translator to receive the prestigious Martinus Nijhoff Award, the most important recognition given to translators of creative texts from or into Dutch.  Childhood and education  The youngest of four siblings, Holmes was born and raised in a small American farm in Collins, Iowa. In 1941, after finishing high school, he enrolled in the Quaker College of Oskaloosa, Iowa. After a study journey of two years, he did a middle school teaching internship in Barnesville, Ohio. Some years later, after refusing to go on military service for the American Army or, alternatively, civil service, Holmes was sentenced to a 6-month jail term. Upon his release, he went back to studying: first at William Penn College, and later at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. In 1948, after obtaining two degrees, one in English and one in History, he continued his studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, one of the well-known Ivy League Schools, where the following year he became a research doctor. In the meantime he had written and published his first poems and had carried out some occasional editorial work. From there, in no time, poetry became his great passion.  1949: The Netherlands  In 1949 Holmes interrupted his studies to work as a Fulbright exchange teacher in a Quaker school in the Eerde Castle, near Ommen, in the Netherlands. At the end of the school year he decided not to return to the United States, but to stay and visit the country. It was in this way that, in 1950, he met Hans van Marle. To Holmes, the relationship with Van Marle soon became something highly important that brought him to making the choice never to go back to the United States, and to move permanently to Amsterdam. For the next two years, Holmes attended Nico Donkersloot's Dutch language course at the Universiteit van Amsterdam, and published in 1951 his first poetry translation.  1952: Passion becomes profession  Translating poetry became Holmes' main occupation, and, after his appointment as an associate professor in the Literary Science faculty at the Universiteit van Amsterdam, translation was his main source of income. Together with his partner Hans van Marle, he translated not only poetry, but also documents about Indonesia and Indonesian poetry in English. His reputation as a translator grew, and in 1956 he was granted the Martinus Nijhoff Award for his translations into English, becoming the first foreigner to receive it. In 1958, when the legendary English magazine Delta was founded, exclusively devoted to the culture of the Netherlands and Belgium, James Holmes became its poetry editor and often took care of the translations of contemporary Dutch poetry in English. It was a time in which Holmes particularly devoted himself to the poetry of the \\"Vijftigers\\" [an important group of Dutch poets of the 50s – 'vijftig' in Dutch] and of the \\"post- Vijftigers\\", poetry of complex comprehension, and therefore, hard to translate.  Translation Studies  When the Literary Science faculty of the Universiteit van Amsterdam decided in 1964 to create a Department of Translation Studies, Holmes was invited to contribute as an associate professor. He not only had the needed scholarly background, but over time he had acquired many theoretical notions as well, as well as considerable practical experience as a translator. He created courses for the Institute of Interpreters and Translators, which was later integrated into the Institute of Translation Studies of the Universiteit van Amsterdam. Holmes' paper \\"The Name and Nature of Translation Studies\\" (1972)Holmes, James S. (1972/1988). The Name and Nature of Translation Studies. In Holmes, Translated! Papers on Literary Translation and Translation Studies, Amsterdam: Rodopi, pp. 67–80. is widely recognized as founding Translation Studies as a coordinated research program. Holmes' many articles on translation made him one of the key members of Descriptive Translation Studies, and still today he is frequently cited in the bibliographies in this field.  Appreciation for \\"Awater\\" by Nijhoff and the Nobel Prize  One of the most extraordinary examples of Holmes' bravery was his translation of the very long poetic piece \\"\\" by Martinus Nijhoff, a work that gained attention both in the Netherlands and abroad. The English translation of this piece contributed to the fame of both the poet and the translator. After having read \\"Awater,\\" Nobel laureates in Literature T.S. Eliot and Iosif Aleksandrovič Brodskij expressed their appreciation. Eliot said that if Nijhoff had written his works in English instead of Dutch, he would have become a global success, while Brodskij bluntly stated that \\"Awater\\" was one of the most beautiful poetry works he had ever read.  Columbia University establishes the James S. Holmes Award  Holmes went on to translate dozens of works from Dutch and Belgian poets, and in 1984 he received the Flemish Community Translation Award (Vertaalprijs van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap), once more the first foreigner to receive it. His masterpiece was, undoubtedly, the translation of the impressive collection Dutch Interior, a considerable anthology of post-war poetry, published in 1984 in New York by the Columbia University Press. Holmes was one of the most important editors of this classic text, and also translated many of the poetry works present in that collection. His contribution into raising awareness of Dutch poetry into the Anglo-Saxon world was recognised by the Translation Center of Columbia University when it decided to establish a new award for Dutch translators called the James S. Holmes Award.  Associations, committees, orders and editions  In the Netherlands, Holmes always felt welcome, not only because of the vast array of acquaintances that had come from his works as a poet and translator, but especially from the many friendships born in the gay spheres of Amsterdam. His American accent and the fact that he continued making mistakes with the Dutch definite article was no reason for him to be considered a foreigner or treated as such. Therefore, he began taking part in many varied committees and orders, he joined the editorial offices of the Dutch-Belgian youth magazine Gard Sivi and contributed to literary magazines such as Literair Paspoort, De Gids, De Nieuwe Stem, Maatstaf and De Revisor. He was an active member of the Dutch and the International PEN Club, the Writers' Association, the Dutch Literature Association and the UNESCO National Commission. He also became a participant in the committee of the Foundation for the Promotion of the Translation of Dutch Literary Works abroad, the Dutch Association of Translators, the Writers' Organization, School and Society, and was an honorary member of the Association of Flemish Scholars.  Workshops, festivals and demonstrations  In 1967 Holmes organized the \\"Poetry for Now\\" demonstration, at the famous Concertgebouw Theater in Amsterdam. During that event, the organizers covered the city with thousands of posters with translated poetry. After many years it was still possible to find posters stuck on bus stops, near the entrances of apartment blocks, in streetlights, on gates or level crossings. In the 70s Holmes began managing a workshop on poetry translation which attracted many students of various university faculties. Some of those students eventually became, in turn, famous poetry translators. Holmes participated in every poetry demonstration, such as for example the Poetry International in Rotterdam and the One World Poetry in Amsterdam. Sometimes he recited poetry, sometimes he was a coordinator or gave conferences on translation, but he always made himself actively present. As soon as he had a chance, he organized conferences abroad on the topic of translated Dutch poetry, as for example at the Library of Congress in Washington.  Poetry Gone Gay  In 1984, in the midst of the One World Poetry demonstration, he organized an evening called \\"Poetry Gone Gay\\", in which he read some of his works dealing with homosexuality and eroticism. He found it extremely liberating to be able to show that part of his personality to the audience, and especially to obtain recognition and approval from it. Holmes loved to display his sexual orientation, not only in his poetry, but especially in his outfits and accessory choice. In the last years of his life he created the character that we see in the picture on this page: a middle- aged man with short white-as-snow hair, jeans with a studded waist, studded bracelets, a pink triangle on the flap of his jacket, a large handful of keys attached to the jeans, and the tip of a pink handkerchief sticking out of the back pocket. This same sexual freedom was, probably, the cause of his premature death caused by AIDS. However, Holmes was aware of the dangers linked to his extravagant lifestyle, and openly declared that they had never, in any way, influenced his choices in life. During his memorial, which was crowded, his life partner and great love Hans van Marle concluded his farewell speech with a short excerpt of the famous \\"Meditation XVII\\" of Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, a metaphysical piece written in 1624 by John Donne, of which Ernest Hemingway, in 1940, extracted the title of his famous novel For Whom The Bell Tolls: 'No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; (...) any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. '  Selected bibliography = Poetry = * Jim Holmes, Nine Hidebound Rimes.

It was first detected on June 14, 2015, located within a faint galaxy in the southern constellation Indus, and was the most luminous supernova-like object ever observed. At its peak, ASASSN-15lh was 570 billion times brighter than the Sun, and 20 times brighter than the combined light emitted by the Milky Way Galaxy. The emitted energy was exceeded by PS1-10adi. The nature of ASASSN-15lh is disputed. The most popular explanations are that it is the most luminous type I supernova (hypernova) ever observed, or a tidal disruption event around a supermassive black hole. Other hypotheses include: gravitational lensing; a quark nova inside a Wolf–Rayet star; or a rapid magnetar spindown. Discovery A possible supernova was first noticed during an observation in June 2015 by ASAS-SN's twin 14-cm telescopes in Chile; the team gave it the designation ASASSN-15lh. It appeared as a transient dot of light on an image and was confirmed with additional observations from other telescopes. The spectrum of ASASSN-15lh was provided by the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope in Chile. The Southern African Large Telescope was used to determine the redshift, and hence the distance and luminosity. The Swift space telescope also contributed observations. On July 24, the event formally received the supernova designation SN 2015L from the Central Bureau of Astronomical Telegrams. Later, other images were found to have been made of ASASSN-15lh as early as May 8, 2015. At this stage the visual magnitude was 17.4. From May 8 the possible supernova brightened until it reached a peak brightness of magnitude 16.9 on June 5. By September the brightness had dropped to magnitude 18.2. There was an unusual \\"rebrightening\\" of up to 1.75 magnitudes at blue and ultraviolet wavelengths, starting about 90 days after the maximum. This coincided with a plateau in the bolometric luminosity that lasted for 120 days. Properties Based on its redshift and location projected on the nucleus of a large galaxy, the distance of ASASSN-15lh is calculated at 1,171 Mpc, in a large luminous galaxy. At its peak, the absolute magnitude of ASASSN-15lh in the AB magnitude system u band was −23.5. Its bolometric luminosity is twice that of the previous brightest type-I superluminous supernova, iPTF13ajg. At its brightest, it was approximately 50 times more luminous than the whole Milky Way galaxy, with an energy flux 570 billion times greater than the Sun. The total energy radiated in the first 50 days exceeded joules. According to Krzysztof Stanek of Ohio State University, one of the principal investigators at ASAS-SN, \\"If it was in our own galaxy, it would shine brighter than the full moon; there would be no night, and it would be easily seen during the day.\\" The spectrum of ASASSN-15lh was relatively featureless, with no hydrogen or helium lines, but two very broad absorption bands. Ionised magnesium absorption doublets were detected and used to confirm the redshift at 0.2326. The temperature of ASASSN-15lh at the time of maximum luminosity was 20,000 K, although it was hotter earlier in the outburst. By 50 days after the peak, the temperature had declined to 11,000 K and then remained relatively constant. The radius of ASASSN-15lh at peak brightness was over . Host galaxy The host galaxy for ASASSN-15lh is APMUKS(BJ) B215839.70−615403.9, much larger and more luminous than the Milky Way. The host galaxy has visual magnitude 18.5 and is red in color with a low rate of star formation. It maintained a steady brightness until the supernova lit up. The strongest parts of the galaxy's spectrum have wavelengths around 1 μm in the near infrared. Suggested mechanisms The precise mechanism underlying the very large ASASSN-15lh explosion is still unknown, with speculation ranging from the presence of very large quantities of decaying nickel-56 to the amplifying effects of a magnetar. Its unusual location in a relatively quiescent galaxy may offer clues for scientists to discover and observe similar events. =Superluminous supernova= The initial hypothesis was that ASASSN-15lh was the most extreme superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) so far seen, but it was recognized as being unusual in several respects. The spectrum did not closely match other type I SLSNe and previous SLSNe have been discovered in relatively small active star-producing galaxies, not in the central regions of large galaxies. The double-peaked light curve is not expected from a SLSN and the total energy output approaches theoretical limits. The lack of hydrogen and helium features in the spectrum suggest an explosion originating in an object lacking both hydrogen and helium, which would imply a highly stripped star such as a massive Wolf–Rayet star. The energetics of the explosion would require a massive star. =Magnetar= One model for unusually luminous supernovae involves the conversion of rotational energy from a rapidly-spinning neutron star into polar jets that heat surrounding material. Again, the energy produced by ASASSN-15lh strains the theoretical limits of this type of explosion and the detailed properties are difficult to reproduce with a magnetar model. =Quark nova= One unusual explanation for ASASSN-15lh is a quark-nova within the supernova explosion from a WO-type Wolf-Rayet star. The quark nova is produced by the neutron star remnant of the supernova and occurs a few days after the core collapse of the Wolf-Rayet star. This can reproduce many of the unusual features of the observed event but is somewhat speculative and not widely accepted. =Tidal disruption event (TDE)= One known method for producing extremely large amounts of energy is the tidal disruption of objects such as stars by a supermassive black hole. ASASSN-15lh occurred in the nucleus of a large passive galaxy where a supermassive black hole is likely. A black hole of the mass expected in the host galaxy of ASASSN-15lh would normally swallow stars without a visible flare. The conditions for the production of a highly luminous flare from a TDE around a black hole of the expected mass are unusual, but a rapidly-spinning Kerr black hole might be able to disrupt a star with a mass similar to the sun outside the event horizon and produce a hot accretion disc and luminous transient. It could also account for the temperature changes, rebrightening, and unusual spectral evolution. However, lack of hydrogen and/or helium lines in the spectra of ASASSN-15lh poses a major problem for the TDE scenario. =Gravitational lensing= Unexpectedly bright visible objects can be produced by gravitational lensing of very distant objects by extremely massive objects closer to Earth. However, this usually occurs with objects much more distant than ASASSN-15lh, and there are no observations indicating the presence of a galaxy cluster suitable to produce a lensing effect.

Early life Dhuhulow came to Norway from Mogadishu, Somalia as a refugee in 1999, settling with what were claimed to be relatives in Larvik. Later, several of the claimed family relations have been exposed as false, including an alleged sister who has been prosecuted for false testimony in connection with the Westgate attack. Dhuhulow and the alleged sister were granted Norwegian citizenship in 2003 on grounds of their family relations. His parents and several other relatives reportedly died or were killed in Somalia. While described as hot-headed and as having anger issues during his first school years, he had reportedly become a kind and hard-working model student by tenth grade. Although well-liked, he was described by himself and by others as being lonely, and he became very religious as a practicing Muslim who prayed five times a day and started bringing a prayer rug with him during upper secondary school. He regularly attended the Larvik Mosque, where he became acquainted with Mohyeldeen Mohammad. He was a prolific user on web forums, at times displaying clear jihadist sympathies, including on a site hosted by the Islamic Association with 2,500 comments from 2006 to 2008. His activities, including contacts with central members of Profetens Ummah led him to be brought in for talks with the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST). Westgate shopping mall attack Dhuhulow returned to Somalia in 2009, where he got married, staying there except for a brief trip back to Norway in 2010. In 2012 he was arrested, suspected of the murder of radio journalist Hassan Yusuf Absuge in Mogadishu. He was eventually acquitted from the charges, while another member of Al-Shabaab was sentenced to death. Dhuhulow reportedly attended an Al-Shabaab training camp in El Buur, and was involved in operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo, eventually becoming part of a 'martyrdom brigade'. After the Westgate shopping mall attack in September 2013, it was reported that what appeared to be Dhuhulow was seen firing an AK-47 in CCTV footage, as one of four terrorists affiliated with Al-Shabaab who took part in the attack in which 67 people were killed (including all four terrorists), and almost 200 wounded. Dhuhulow's cell phone traffic suggests he may have been the leader of the terror cell during the attack. His presence at the scene was later confirmed through forensic dentistry. An estimated 20 to 30 Norwegians have reportedly travelled to fight for Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab commander Ikrima lived for several years as an asylum seeker in Norway, and is believed by Kenyan intelligence to have masterminded the Westgate attack. The perpetrators of the attack were publicly hailed by Ubaydullah Hussain, spokesperson of the Norwegian Islamist group Profetens Ummah. Dhuhulow is the subject of the 2015 book En norsk terrorist. Portrett av den nye ekstremismen (A Norwegian terrorist. Portrait of the new extremism) by journalist Lars Akerhaug, who has directed strong criticism towards Norwegian authorities for their failed handling of Dhuhulow and \\"cowardice\\" prior to the attack, requesting a fact- finding commission similar to the one after the 2011 Norway attacks, believing that the victims of the Westgate attack deserve an explanation from Norwegian authorities. Researcher Stig Jarle Hansen has voiced similar concerns, holding that the issue of Norwegian Al-Shabaab-fighters is taken too lightly in Norway (the number of fighters is the same as the United Kingdom despite many more Somalis living there). Dhuhulow was the subject of a BBC Newsnight report that aired on 17 October 2013, and of the NRK Brennpunkt documentary Terroristen fra Larvik (The terrorist from Larvik) aired on 21 October 2014. He is considered Norway's worst terrorist after Anders Behring Breivik.

Built by Siemens and it was introduced in 1999, and it currently serves the Bannan line. History Siemens won a contract to build the second batch of 216 cars for the Taipei Metro in 1993. Siemens in turn subcontracted part of the contract to Union Carriage & Wagon of South Africa, which became a focal point of controversy for the Union Rail Car partnership (the builder of the earlier C301 trains) and the United States government, the latter which accused the South African government of subsidising the Siemens bid; Union Carriage & Wagon in return denied any government involvement in the bid. The United States government sought to convince Taipei to reverse the contract award to Siemens but was presumably unsuccessful.Yonkers Fighting To Save Rail-Car Jobs, The New York Times, Elsa Brenner, 25 July 1993 Exterior The train design was based on the Modular Metro, while the exterior and interior dimensions and configurations are the same as the C301. However, a key distinguishing feature of the C321 is the use of a white flat FRP front as opposed to the grey rounded front of the C301. The general shape of the C321 can also be described as more squarish than the C301 trains. The Singapore MRT C651 bears a similar design to the C321 and like the C321, was also built by Siemens. Interior A significant change of the C321 interior design as compared to the C301 was the ceiling design, where the air-conditioning vents were more exposed and demarcated with blue stripes while the ceiling at each end of the car was lowered to accommodate space for the air-conditioning evaporator. Likewise, the grab pole configuration was also significantly different from the C301 as it was now two side handrails instead of a single central handrail. Like the C301, the seats are arranged in a mix of transverse and longitudinal arrangements. Most seats are turquoise, while the priority seats are navy blue. The priority seats are at the sides, and 8 seats are between doors, while 3 seats are next to the end of the car and doors. As with the C301 trains, the Passenger Information Display did not show the doors opening and closing or the time prior to the refurbishment of the sets. Before the refurbishment, it showed the station design and the terminal. Bicycle racks are available at the end cars. Deployments The C321 was built in a few different batches: CC361 (8 trainsets) for the Zhonghe line, CH321 (11 trainsets) for the Xindian line and CN331 (17 trainsets) for the Nangang line. When initially introduced, the trains initially served the Tamsui, Xindian, Xiaonanmen, Zhonghe, Banqiao, and Nangang lines and the Xiaobitan branch line. In the case of the Xiaobitan branch line selective door operation had to be used and one half of the trainset used had to be sealed off from public. The C321 was withdrawn from the Xiaobitan branch line on 21 July 2006 with the introduction of a three-car C371 trainset; on 4 March 2009 almost all C321 trainsets were consolidated to the Bannan Line to facilitate the maintenance regime and train dispatching. Use of the C321 on the Xiaonanmen Line was also discontinued in 2012. Train formation A Siemens builder's plate and a fleet number plate on a C321 train. This car is the trailer car of trainset 140 in the formation 139/140. A complete six-car trainset consists of an identical twin set of one driving motor car (DM1), one trailer car (T) and one intermediate motor car (M2) permanently coupled together. The configuration of a C301 trainset in revenue service is DM1–T–M2–M2–T–DM1. Each car is assigned its own four-digit serial number, which ranges from x101 to x172. * The first digit (the 'x' above) indicates the position of the car. Hence, DM1 cars use the number x=1, T cars x=2, and M2 cars x=3 * The other three digits are the identification number of the train the car is part of. A full-length train of six cars consists of two identification numbers, one for the first three cars, and another for the second three. The bigger number is always equal to the smaller number plus one, and the smaller number is always an odd number. For example, a train of six cars would have serial numbers 1101, 2101, 3101, 3102, 2102, and 1102, respectively. *Trainset number 117/118 was temporarily withdrawn from service following the 2014 Taipei Metro attack and underwent disinfection and change of seats. It was then renumbered 175/176 (173/174 was avoided as the number \\"一七三, 一七四\\" sounded like \\"一起殺、一起死\\", which literally means \\"kill together, die together\\") and returned to service in 2015. Modifications The original gangway connection were easily prone to damage and were hence replaced by a newer design similar to that on the C341. In 2009, the some seats were modified from transverse to longitudinal arrangements to increase the capacity of the C321. In 2014, the LED train information displays were updated to full-colour LED displays. Derivatives A Siemens-built Kaohsiung MRT train The Taipei Metro C341 was developed directly from the C321, using the IGBT-VVVF inverters, for the Tucheng extension of the Bannan Line. The Kaohsiung MRT also uses the Siemens trains derived from the Taipei Metro.

Queensland Nickel owns and operates the Palmer Nickel and Cobalt Refinery at Yabulu in North Queensland, Australia. The refinery was established in July 1971 Palmer acquired the refinery in 2009 from BHP Billiton. On 19 January 2016 the company entered into voluntary administration. In April, 2016 the company's creditors voted for liquidation.  Operations  The refinery carries out two operations: ore processing and refining. By design, the front-end of the refinery is where the ore is processed whereas the back-end is where it is refined and prepared for sale to the international market. The ore used in these two operations is received via rail from a facility at the Port of Townsville. When operating at full capacity, the Palmer Nickel and Cobalt Refinery is responsible for over $1 billion of output in the North Queensland economy and is the largest employer helping to generate over 3,000 direct and indirect jobs in Queensland.  History  The company was established in July 1971. The Yabulu Nickel Refinery was completed in 1974, after geologists commenced exploration of the Greenvale deposit, an area originally mapped by officers of the Bureau of Mineral Resources in 1957. In 1986, the first test shipments of Nickel ore from Indonesia and New Caledonia were processed at the refinery with regular shipments starting in 1988 and 1989. It was in 1989 that the refinery's internationally patented ammoniac AL solvent extraction technology was introduced to the refining process to significantly improve the separation of nickel and cobalt. Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, asked Clive Palmer to purchase the refinery and save jobs in North Queensland. Palmer acquired the refinery in 2009 from BHP Billiton. As part of the purchase, Palmer had to personally guarantee over $3 billion to ensure workers' jobs were safe. The impact on the local economy was immense as the refinery's operations were responsible for 1970 full-time equivalent jobs in North Queensland, $150 million in income and salaries in addition to $1.1 billion in output for the local economy. When the operation was first acquired by Palmer in 2009, the cost of production was over $8 per pound. During the course of the next five years, the manager and director Clive Mensink (Palmer's nephew) was responsible for the reduction in the cost of production to $4.40 per pound. The reduction in production costs ensured that the QN Group of companies was still able to continue operations and employ people, despite the falling price of nickel on the world market. = Environmental issues = A freedom of information request by the Northern Queensland Conservation Council in 2014 showed that Queensland Nickel discharged nitrate-laden water into the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 and 2011—releasing of toxic waste water on the latter occasion. In June 2012, Queensland Nickel stated it intended to release waste water, continuously for three months, \\"at least 100 times the allowed maximum level as well as heavy metals and other contaminants\\". A Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) briefing stated the company had \\"threatened a compensation claim of $6.4bn should the GBRMPA intend to exert authority over the company's operations\\". In response to the publicisation of the dumping incidents, the GBRMPA stated: > We have strongly encouraged the company to investigate options that do not > entail releasing the material to the environment and to develop a management > plan to eliminate this potential hazard; however, GBRMPA does not have > legislative control over how the Yabulu tailings dam is managed. =Financial troubles= Despite having previously ruled-out requesting government funding, Palmer requested taxpayer-funded assistance from the Queensland Government in late 2015 to guarantee a loan of for the redundancies. However the government rejected the request, citing the refusal of the company to share full details with the government and its large donations to Palmer's Palmer United Party. Despite its financial troubles, Queensland Nickel donated more than $20 million to the Palmer United Party in two years including a donation of $288,516 days before the workers were terminated. On 15 January 2016 the company Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd terminated 237 workers. The company blamed poor nickel prices, which were at a twelve-year low and the refusal of the Queensland Government to support industry and jobs in North Queensland. In March 2016 it was proposed by Palmer to transfer the employment of hundreds of employees, including their entitlements, to a new company Queensland Nickel Sales, a joint venture between two of Clive Palmer's companies, QNI Resources Pty Ltd and QNI Metals Pty Ltd, with Mensink as director. The plan was that the new company would continue to operate the refinery and would pay the outstanding expenses incurred during the administration, but required the administrator to agree transfer the cash held in the Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd bank account. In a sworn affidavit, Kelly-Anne Trenfield explained why the administrators would not agree to this transfer of cash. After the report by the administrators on Clive Palmer and Queensland Nickel on 11 April 2016, politicians and media from around the country criticised Palmer. In early April 2016 the administrators, FTI Consulting, found that the company had \\"incurred debts of $771 million after going insolvent in November\\". On 22 April 2016 the company's creditors voted to liquidate it. On April 2018 Palmer claimed the attacks were politically motivated and launched a counter claim and is suing the liquidators for $1.8 billion in damages.  Future  On 29 June 2018, Palmer held a press conference in Townsville to address the claims against him and announced his intention to re-open the refinery and create hundreds of jobs. Due to high cobalt prices in 2018, there is also an estimated $6 billion worth of cobalt in the tailings dams onsite at the refinery operations in Yabulu. At the same time Palmer began his return to Australian politics.

The group is formed by about four well preserved scoria cones (between high and wide at the basis, subcircular to elliptic) with lava fields and one isolated lava field, constructed on Ordovician marine sediments and dacitic lavas from the adjacent Cerro Bayo de Archibarca (7.2 million years old) volcano. These cones are aligned submeridionally with a fault system in the ground. The lavas and associated dykes have porphyritic appearance and variable morphology. The lavas show no evidence of ponding in crustal magma chambers, suggesting that the large volatile content of the magma was sufficient to quickly transport it through the crust. Magma temperatures have been estimated at higher than . The cones are constructed by reddish lapilli and lava bombs up to wide with subordinate amounts of ash-like material, concentrated in the talus deposits that have been formed by erosion at the basis of the cones. Arenite of sedimentary origin and dacite are found as xenoliths. The cones were presumably built by Strombolian activity with occasional Hawaiian episodes. Usually less than thick folded lava flows of gray colour are found in the field, containing xenoliths and scoriaceous material from the cones. In two of the cones were erupted at the base of the cones by dykes. In the northernmost cone, two northeastern lava flows were erupted above each other. The lower flow ( wide and long) is thinner and contains pyroxene phenocrysts, the upper one has a smaller extent ( long) and is dominated by olivine. On its western margin, it borders a lineament that cuts through the cones. The eastern cone has no less than four lava flows dominated by olivine, one of which is long. Two other lava fields are also present. Two lava flows at Cerro El Chileno extend southeastward and are associated with pyroclastic mounds (), suggesting some explosive activity, but no cone. The cone may be buried beneath the lava or might have been eroded away. north of Cerro El Chileno lies an isolated lava flow with a circular shape () that may be linked to a cone north. The volcanic field is located in the Puna-Altiplano highland, a region with strong tectonic and volcanic activity since the Oligocene. Changes in subduction style of the Nazca plate have produced changes in the nature and amount of volcanic activity, with the latest change being a westward shift of volcanic activity to the main belt of the Central Volcanic Zone. In the region, mafic volcanism has been active since the Oligocene. Most volcanism in the area is of silicic nature however.

He went to Elgin Grammar School and then studied Medicine at King's College, Aberdeen graduating MA in 1803. Having sat the relevant medical exams in London, in 1804 he received a commission as Assistant Surgeon (aged only 19) in the army and travelled to India to work there, aiding in the Second Anglo-Maratha War. He served first with the 22nd Light Dragoons then the 59th Foot.British Medical Journal, 1871: obituaries He returned to Britain around 1812 and received his MD degree from Aberdeen University in 1813. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1814. He then joined the Scots Greys. This resulted in his being shipped with them to the Continent, and being with them at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. Whilst not on the front line, his position as Surgeon to the regiment would have rendered him an unenviable task, in this, one of history’s bloodiest battles. Thereafter he joined the occupying army in Paris following Napoleon’s defeat. He thereafter resigned from the Scots Greys and returned to India in 1820 staying there until 1825. On return, he adopted a more sedate life, lecturing on both mathematics and theology. His great experience in the treatment of cholera led to him being employed as Deputy Inspector-General of Army Hospitals in Britain. In the cholera epidemic of 1831-2 he was sent to Sunderland to make studies and reports.

Today the synagogue is administered by the Jewish Museum in Prague. The Klausen Synagogue neighbouring with the Old Jewish Cemetery  History = Beginnings = The interior today In 1570s a renowned businessman and benefactor of the ghetto, Mordechai Maisel, decided to build in the area of the present Klausen Synagogue a complex of buildings, probably including synagogues and a private Talmudic school. The famous Prague rabbi and scholar Maharal taught at this school. The complex was called Klausen (German term originating from Latin claustrum, closed space). In 1689, the great fire of the ghetto burned down all the Klausen and the synagogue is named after them. Shelomo Khalish Cohen, a rabbi of the burned down synagogue, which had been part of the complex, then initiated construction of a new synagogue in early baroque style at the site. In 1694, the building was finished and two years later monumental three-tiered aron ha-kodesh, the Torah Ark, was added, thanks to the endowment of Samuel Oppenheimer, an affluent and influential personality of the Austrian monarchy, part of which Prague was at the time. Many important rabbis, for example Elazar Fleckeles, are also connected with the synagogue. The Interior of the Klausen Synagogue in the 19th century = Modern times = In 1883–84, the synagogue was reconstructed by an architect Bedřich Münzberger, who also partook in decorating the Spanish Synagogue. Massive urban renewal of the ghetto at the turn of the 20th century left the Klausen Synagogue intact, while other baroque synagogues such as the Zigeuner, Great Court and New Synagogue were demolished. Nowadays, the Klausen Synagogue is thus the only example of a baroque synagogue in the former ghetto. During the World War II a depository as well as an exposition was located in the synagogue. As soon as one year after the war, an exposition about Jewish festivals and customs was opened there. The synagogue was reconstructed in years 1960, 1979–81 and 1983 (aron ha-kodesh only). One year after the last mentioned reconstruction, a new permanent exhibition of Hebrew manuscripts and early prints was opened.  Recent History and Exposition  About a decade later, during years 1995–96, the synagogue was restored again and the topic of Jewish festivals and customs returned to the exposition. Visitors are invited to get acquainted with the foundational texts of Judaism (Torah and Talmud), sacral space of Judaism (traditional components of the synagogue interior, order of synagogue prayer service and texts and objects used during it, etc.). Introduction of Jewish Festivals and Jewish family life in its dailiness as well as in its important milestones, for instance birth, circumcision, wedding, etc. follows. The exposition continues in the Ceremonial Hall with the topic of the end of life.

It has a spicy soup stock the colour of a flaming sunset, flavoured with coconut milk and dried shrimp, and topped with ingredients like cockles, prawns and fishcake. The noodles are normally cut up into smaller pieces so that the entire dish can be eaten with a spoon alone, without chopsticks or a fork. Origin The term \\"laksa\\" may derive from the Chinese word 辣沙 (Cantonese: [làːt.sáː]), meaning \\"spicy sand\\" due to the ground dried prawns which gives a sandy or gritty texture to the sauce. The name \\"Katong\\" was used to refer to an exotic species of sea turtle that has since gone extinct. It can also mean the rippling effect of a sea mirage when looking at a shoreline. Katong is a residential precinct located in the estate of Marine Parade in central Singapore. Katong Laksa was so named due to its origins in the area. The dish was first popularised by brothers Ng Juat Swee and Ng Chwee Seng, who started selling the noodles in a coffee shop in East Coast Road in 1963.

Interactive Entertainment. The company was established in 2005 through the merger of developer Traveller's Tales and publisher Giant Interactive (now TT Games Publishing). Its other branches include developer TT Fusion, animation studio TT Animation and mobile game studios Playdemic and TT Odyssey. The company is best known for its video games based on the Lego construction toy.  History  In 2003, The Lego Group's video game division, Lego Interactive, commenced plans to develop Lego Star Wars: The Video Game, based on the company's licensed Lego Star Wars toy sets. They contracted Traveller's Tales to develop the game, though Lego soon stepped out of the video game industry. Tom Stone and Jonathan Smith of Lego Interactive's senior management formed Giant Interactive, gaining the exclusive licence for Lego video games. As work progressed, Traveller's Tales manager Jon Burton recognised the potential of the game and the Lego licence, and how effectively the two companies worked together. Lego Star Wars was released in 2005 to positive reviews and strong sales, wherefore Traveller's Tales acquired Giant Interactive in April, forming TT Games. TT Games continued to produce Lego games to considerable success; Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy received several awards and nominations in 2006, including the Best Gameplay Award at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts' 3rd British Academy Games Awards. In 2007, under advise from Farleys Solicitors, TT Games acquired developer Embryonic Studios and motion capture studio Centroid, which became TT Fusion and TT Centroid, respectively. On 8 November 2007, TT Games was acquired by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and became part of its video game division, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. For Burton's share, which amounted to an ownership of 80% in TT Games, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment paid roughly (). TT Games expanded into mobile games with the acquisition of Playdemic in February 2017 and the opening of TT Odyssey (originally named TT Games Brighton) in January 2018.

Since the 1970s, ExxonMobil engaged in climate research, and later began lobbying, advertising, and grant making, some of which were conducted with the purpose of delaying widespread acceptance and action on global warming. From the late 1970s and through the 1980s, Exxon funded internal and university collaborations, broadly in line with the developing public scientific approach. From the 1980s to mid 2000s, the company was a leader in climate change denial, opposing regulations to curtail global warming. ExxonMobil funded organizations critical of the Kyoto Protocol and sought to undermine public opinion about the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Exxon helped to found and lead the Global Climate Coalition of businesses opposed to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. More recently it has expressed support for a carbon tax and the Paris agreement.  Early research  From the late 1970s and through the 1980s, Exxon, one of predecessors of ExxonMobil, had a public reputation as a pioneer in climate change research. Exxon funded internal and university collaborations, broadly in line with the developing public scientific approach, and developed a reputation for expertise in atmospheric carbon dioxide ().: Since the late 1970s and into the 1980s, Exxon had been at the forefront of climate change research, funding its own internal science as well as research from outside experts at Columbia University and MIT. Between the 1970s and 2015, Exxon and ExxonMobil researchers and academic collaborators published dozens of research papers.: From the time the scientific community first began worrying about the climate issue in the 1970s, the company financed research on the topic, with its scientists generally supporting an emerging consensus that fossil fuel emissions could pose risks for society. Company scientists have contributed to dozens of scientific papers that supported this view and explored the extent of the risks. ExxonMobil provided a list of over 50 article citations from that period.: \\"ExxonMobil scientists have been involved in climate research and related policy analysis for more than 30 years, yielding more than 50 papers in peer-reviewed publications.\\" In July 1977, a senior scientist of Exxon James Black reported to the company's executives that there was a general scientific agreement at that time that the burning of fossil fuels was the most likely manner in which mankind was influencing global climate change.: \\"By 1977... he made a presentation to the company's leading executives warning that carbon dioxide accumulating in the upper atmosphere would warm the planet and if the concentration continued to rise, it could harm the environment and humankind.\\" What is considered the best presently available climate model for treating the Greenhouse Effect predicts that a doubling of the C02 concentration in the atmosphere would produce a mean temperature increase of about 2°C to 3°C over most of the earth.: ...the company's knowledge of climate change dates back to July 1977, when its senior scientist James Black delivered a sobering message on the topic. \\"In the first place, there is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels,\\" Black told Exxon's management committee. A year later he warned Exxon that doubling gases in the atmosphere would increase average global temperatures by two or three degrees—a number that is consistent with the scientific consensus today. He continued to warn that \\"present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.\\" In 1979–1982, Exxon conducted a research program of climate change and climate modeling, including a research project of equipping their largest supertanker Esso Atlantic with a laboratory and sensors to measure the absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans.: Exxon budgeted more than $1 million over three years for the tanker project to measure how quickly the oceans were taking in . In 1980, Exxon analyzed in one of their documents that if instead of synthetic fuels such as coal liquefaction, oil shale, and oil sands the demand for fuels to be met by petroleum, it delays the atmospheric doubling time by about five years to 2065. Exxon also studied ways of avoiding emissions if the East Natuna gas field (Natuna D-Alpha block) off Indonesia was to be developed. In 1981, Exxon shifted its research focus to climate modelling. In 1982, Exxon's environmental affairs office circulated an internal report to Exxon's management which said that the consequences of climate change could be catastrophic, and that a significant reduction in fossil fuel consumption would be necessary to curtail future climate change. It also said that \\"there is concern among some scientific groups that once the effects are measurable, they might not be reversible.\\" In 1992, the senior ice researcher, leading a research team in Exxon's Canadian subsidiary Imperial Oil, assessed how global warming could affect Exxon's Arctic operations, and reported that exploration and development costs in the Beaufort Sea might be lower, while higher sea levels and rougher seas could threaten the company's coastal and offshore infrastructure.: An extended open water season, Croasdale said in 1992, could potentially reduce exploratory drilling and construction costs by 30% to 50%...he advised the company to consider and incorporate potential \\"negative outcomes,\\" including a rise in the sea level, which could threaten onshore infrastructure; bigger waves, which could damage offshore drilling structures; and thawing permafrost, which could make the earth buckle and slide under buildings and pipelines.: Croasdale said global warming could lower the costs but increase the length of time it would be possible to explore for oil in the Beaufort Sea, north of Alaska and Canada's Yukon Territory. He and his team of researchers had developed models that showed with climate change, drilling in the Beaufort Sea could grow from two months per year to as many as five, with costs cut by as much as half. At the same time, rising sea level due to climate change could hurt infrastructure Imperial included these forecasts into its facility planning in the Mackenzie River Delta in the Northwest Territories. In 1996, Mobil, another predecessor of ExxonMobil, calculated the climate changes effect to the Sable gas field project. An ExxonMobil spokesperson said that standard practice in major project planning is to consider a range of factors, and that ExxonMobil's consideration of environmental risks was not inconsistent with their public policy advocacy. In 2016, the Center for International Environmental Law, a public interest, not- for-profit environmental law firm, claimed that from 1957 onward Humble Oil, one of predecessors of nowadays ExxonMobil, was aware of rising in the atmosphere and the prospect that it was likely to cause global warming. ExxonMobil responded to this claim that \\"to suggest that we had definitive knowledge about human-induced climate change before the world's scientists is not a credible thesis.\\"  Funding of climate change denial  Of the major oil corporations, ExxonMobil has been the most active in the debate surrounding climate change.: Ever since climate change became a subject of public and policy concern, ExxonMobil has been the most active major oil corporation in the debate. In 2005, as competing major oil companies diversified into alternative energy and renewable fuels, ExxonMobil re- affirmed its mission as an oil and gas company. According to a 2007 analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists, the company used many of the same strategies, tactics, organizations, and personnel the tobacco industry used in its denials of the link between lung cancer and smoking.: In its campaign to sow uncertainty about the scientific evidence on global warming, ExxonMobil has followed a corporate strategy pioneered by the tobacco industry. Because ExxonMobil's strategy, tactics, and even some personnel draw heavily from the tobacco industry's playbook, it is useful to look briefly at this earlier campaign ExxonMobil denied similarity to the tobacco industry.: ExxonMobil rejected the comparison to the tobacco industry In 1989, shortly after the presentation by the Exxon's manager of science and strategy development Duane LeVine to the board of directors which reiterated that introducing public policy to combat climate change \\"can lead to irreversible and costly Draconian steps,\\" the company shifted its position on the climate change to publicly questioning it.: \\"After a decade of frank internal discussions on global warming and conducting unbiased studies on it, Exxon changed direction in 1989 and spent more than 20 years discrediting the research its own scientists had once confirmed.\\" This shift was caused by concerns about the potential impact of the climate policy measures to the oil industry. A study published in Nature Climate Change in 2015 found that ExxonMobil \\"may have played a particularly important role as corporate benefactors\\" in the production and diffusion of contrarian information. During the 1990s and 2000s Exxon helped advance climate change denial internationally. ExxonMobil was a significant influence in preventing ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the United States.: ExxonMobil—together with its partners in US lobby groups—has been instrumental to the hindrance of US ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. I ExxonMobil funded organizations critical of the Kyoto Protocol and seeking to undermine public opinion about the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Exxon was a founding member of the board of directors of the Global Climate Coalition, composed of businesses opposed to greenhouse gas emission regulation.: The company, which in 1999 became ExxonMobil, helped found the Global Climate Coalition, which from 1989 to 2002 argued the role \\"of greenhouse gases in climate change is not well understood,\\" the New York Times reported Friday.: \\"Exxon helped to found and lead the Global Climate Coalition, an alliance of some of the world's largest companies seeking to halt government efforts to curb fossil fuel emissions.\\": Instrumental to the implementation of Exxon's strategy was its participation in industry and lobby groups. Exxon is a prominent member of the American Petroleum Institute (API), the major US petroleum industry trade association, and was, from the date of its creation in 1989, a board member of the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), one of the most influential US lobbying front group on the climate issue. According to Mother Jones magazine, between 2000 and 2003 ExxonMobil channelled at least $8,678,450 to forty organizations that employed disinformation campaigns including \\"skeptic propaganda masquerading as journalism\\" to influence the opinion of the public and political leaders about global warming. ExxonMobil has funded, among other groups, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, George C. Marshall Institute, Heartland Institute, the American Legislative Exchange Council and the International Policy Network.: \\"in recent years, the Heartland Institute, a group that has been funded by... fossil fuel (Exxon, Koch, Scaife) interests, has financed a series of one-sided conferences on climate change, featuring a slate of climate change deniers\\" Since the Kyoto Protocol, Exxon has given more than $20 million to organizations supporting climate change denial. Between 1998 and 2004, ExxonMobil granted $16 million to advocacy organizations which disputed the impact of global warming. Of 2005 grantees of ExxonMobil, 54 were found to have statements regarding climate change on their websites, of which 25 were consistent with the scientific consensus on climate change, while 39 \\"misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence,\\" according to a 2006 letter from the Royal Society to ExxonMobil. The Royal Society said ExxonMobil granted $2.9 million to US organizations which \\"misinformed the public about climate change through their websites.\\" According to Drexel University environmental sociologist Robert Brulle, ExxonMobil contributed about 4% of the total funding of what Brulle identifies as the \\"climate change counter-movement.\\" The Drexel research found that much of the funding that direct sourcing from companies like ExxonMobil and Koch Industries was later diverted through third-party foundations like Donors Trust and Donors Capital to avoid traceability. In 2006, the Brussels-based watchdog organization Corporate Europe Observatory said \\"ExxonMobil invests significant amounts in letting think-tanks, seemingly respectable sources, sow doubts about the need for [European Union] governments to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Covert funding for climate sceptics is deeply hypocritical because ExxonMobil spends major sums on advertising to present itself as an environmentally responsible company.\\" In 2006, the Royal Society expressed \\"concerns about ExxonMobil's funding of lobby groups that seek to misrepresent the scientific evidence relating to climate change.\\" Between 2007 and 2015, ExxonMobil gave $1.87 million to Congressional climate change deniers and $454,000 to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). ExxonMobil denied funding climate denial. ExxonMobil is a member of ALEC's \\"Enterprise Council\\", its corporate leadership board. In January 2007, ExxonMobil vice president for public affairs Kenneth Cohen said that, as of 2006, ExxonMobil had ceased funding of the Competitive Enterprise Institute and \\"'five or six' similar groups\\". While ExxonMobil did not identify the other similar groups, a May 2007 report by Greenpeace listed five groups \\"at the heart of the climate change denial industry\\" ExxonMobil had stopped funding, as well as 41 similar groups which were still receiving ExxonMobil funds. In May 2008, ExxonMobil pledged in its annual corporate citizenship report that it would cut funding to \\"several public policy research groups whose position on climate change could divert attention\\" from the need to address climate change. In 2008, ExxonMobil funded such organizations and was named one of the most prominent promoters of climate change denial. According to Brulle in a 2012 Frontline interview, ExxonMobil had ceased funding the climate change counter-movement by 2009. According to the environmental advocacy group Greenpeace, ExxonMobil granted $1 million to climate denial groups in 2014. ExxonMobil granted $10,000 to the Science & Environmental Policy Project founded by climate denial advocate, physicist, and environmental scientist Fred Singer: \\"ABC News's Nightline [noted] that Singer had admitted to receiving \\"funding from Exxon, Shell, ARCO, Unocal, and Sun Oil.\\" In a separate piece... ABC News noted that Singer \\"admits he once accepted an unsolicited check from Exxon for $10,000.\\"\\" and earlier funded the work of solar physicist Wei-Hock \\"Willie\\" Soon, who said that most global warming is caused by solar variation. In the fall of 2015, InsideClimate News published a series of reports on an eight-month investigation based on decades of internal Exxon Mobil files and interviews with former Exxon employees, which stated \\"Exxon conducted cutting-edge climate research decades ago and then, without revealing all that it had learned, worked at the forefront of climate denial, manufacturing doubt about the scientific consensus that its own scientists had confirmed.\\" Exxon responded to the article by saying the allegations were based on cherry-picked statements from ExxonMobil employees and noting the ongoing climate research the company engaged in during the time in question. The company also denied claims made by InsideClimate News that it had curtailed carbon dioxide research in favor of climate denial. Exxon's statement said the drop in oil prices hurt oil companies in the 1980s and caused research cut backs. The statement also claimed that it was uncertain if increases in greenhouse gas emissions caused significant warming, or if immediate action on climate change was necessary. From 1989 till April 2010, ExxonMobil and its predecessor Mobil purchased regular Thursday advertorials in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal that said that the science of climate change was unsettled.: Over the next 15 years, it took out prominent ads in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, contending climate change science was murky and uncertain. In 2000, responding to the 2000 US First National Assessment of Climate Change, an ExxonMobil advertorial said \\"The report's language and logic appear designed to emphasize selective results to convince people that climate change will adversely impact their lives. The report is written as a political document, not an objective summary of the underlying science.\\" Another 2000 advertorial published in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal entitled \\"Unsettled Science\\" said \\"it is impossible for scientists to attribute the recent small surface temperature increase to human activity.\\" The content analysis of Exxon Mobil's and its precessors' internal reports, peer-reviewed research papers, and advertorials Exxon placed in the op-ed section of The New York Times between 1972 and 2001, by Harvard University researchers Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes found that \\"83% of peer-reviewed papers and 80% of internal documents [from Exxon] acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12% of advertorials do so, with 81% instead expressing doubt\\". The research concluded that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. August 23, 2017 PBS NewsHour The report was criticized by ExxonMobil and the Independent Petroleum Association of America because of the incomplete sampling of data collected by Greenpeace, authors' involvement in the #ExxonKnew campaign, and partial financing by the Rockefeller Family Fund. The IPAA also pointed out that Exxon and Mobil were separate companies during much of the period in question, noting that \\"[t]he climate research was done primarily by Exxon and the advertorials were primarily done by Mobil.\\"  Lobbying against emissions regulations  Lee Raymond, Exxon and ExxonMobil chief executive officer from 1993 to 2006, was one of the most outspoken executives in the United States against regulation to curtail global warming, In February 2001, the early days of the administration of US President George W. Bush, ExxonMobil's head lobbyist in Washington wrote to the White House urging that \\"Clinton/Gore carry-overs with aggressive agendas\\" be kept out of \\"any decisional activities\\" on the US delegation to the working committees of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and recommending their replacement by scientists critical of the prevailing scientific consensus on climate change. The chairman of the IPCC, climate scientist Robert Watson, was replaced by Rajendra K. Pachauri, who was seen as more industry-friendly. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said the company did not have a position on the chairmanship of the IPCC. On June 14, 2005 ExxonMobil announced they would hire Philip Cooney, four days after Cooney resigned as chief of staff of the Council on Environmental Quality in the Bush White House, two days after the non-profit Government Accountability Project release documents which showed that Cooney had edited government scientific reports so as to downplay the certainty of the science behind the greenhouse effect. Thomas Friedman wrote in The New York Times, \\"Of all the people the Bush team would let edit its climate reports, we have a guy who first worked for the oil lobby denying climate change, with no science background, then went back to work for Exxon. Does it get any more intellectually corrupt than that?\\" Some researches say that ExxonMobil's strategy succeeded to delay the world's response to climate change,: In terms of delaying international and national actions on climate change, there is no doubt that ExxonMobil's strategy succeeded. others are not sure if company's different behavior would brought a different outcome.  Acknowledgement of climate change  In 2007, ExxonMobil for the first time disclosed to stockholders the financial risks to profitability of climate change. Even that, however, came only in the form of boilerplate language in their Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K citing the threat to operations and earnings posed by \\"laws and regulations related to environmental or energy security matters, including those addressing alternative energy sources and the risks of global climate change\\" rather than acknowledging the risks posed by climate change itself or by the company's contribution to it. In January 2007, ExxonMobil vice president for public affairs Kenneth Cohen said \\"we know enough now—or, society knows enough now—that the risk is serious and action should be taken\\". On February 13, ExxonMobil CEO Rex W. Tillerson acknowledged that the planet was warming while carbon dioxide levels were increasing, \\"but in the same speech gave an unalloyed defense of the oil industry and predicted that hydrocarbons would dominate the world’s transportation as energy demand grows by an expected 40 percent by 2030. [Tillerson] stated that there is no significant alternative to oil in coming decades, and that ExxonMobil would continue to make petroleum and natural gas its primary products.\\" In April 2014, ExxonMobil released a report publicly acknowledging climate change risk for the first time. ExxonMobil predicted that a rising global population, increasing living standards and increasing energy access would result in lower greenhouse gas emissions. ExxonMobil is dismissive of the fossil fuel divestment movement, writing on ExxonMobil's blog in October, 2014 that fossil fuel divestment was \\"out of step with reality\\" and that \\"to not use fossil fuels is tantamount to not using energy at all.\\" Exxon routinely uses an internal shadow price on in its business planning. In December 2015, following similar earlier announcements, Exxon noted that if carbon regulations became a requirement, the best approach would be a carbon tax.  State and federal investigations  As early as 2012 the idea of using RICO laws against the fossil fuel industry, on the model of their use against Big Tobacco, was being considered by some environmental groups. In May 2015 Sheldon Whitehouse put forward the suggestion in The Washington Post. Later the same year, on October 14, Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier wrote to the United States Attorney General (US AG) requesting an investigation into whether ExxonMobil violated any federal laws by \\"failing to disclose truthful information\\" about climate change. Asked about the letter by The Guardian, an Exxon spokesperson said \\"This is complete bullshit. We have a 30 year continuous uninterrupted history of researching climate change...\\" On October 30, 2015, more than 40 leading US environmental and social justice organizations also wrote to the US AG requesting a federal investigation into ExxonMobil deceiving the public about climate change.: More than 40 of the nation's leading environmental and social justice groups demanded a federal investigation of ExxonMobil on Friday, accusing the huge oil and gas company of deceiving the American public about the risks of climate change to protect its profits. Former Vice President Al Gore and all three Democratic primary candidates for President of the United States called for a Department of Justice investigation. On October 29, Whitehouse, Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey issued a letter to Exxon questioning their donations to Donors Trust, a group which funds climate change denial. Subsequently, in January of 2016, Marjorie Cohn, law professor at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, California, called for the revocation of ExxonMobil's articles of incorporation. Still in 2015, the New York Attorney General launched an investigation whether ExxonMobil's statements to investors were consistent with the company's decades of extensive scientific research. In October 2018, based on this investigation, ExxonMobil was sued by the State of New York, which claimed the company defrauded shareholders by downplaying the risks of climate change for its businesses. Following published reports, based on internal Exxon documents, suggesting that during the 1980s and 1990s Exxon used climate research in its business planning but simultaneously argued publicly that the science was unsettled, the California Attorney General began investigating whether ExxonMobil lied to the public or shareholders about the risk to its business from climate change, possible securities fraud, and violations of environmental laws. ExxonMobil denied wrongdoing. On March 29, 2016, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and the United States Virgin Islands announced investigations. Seventeen attorneys general were cooperating on investigations. Exxon said the investigations were \\"politically motivated.\\" In June, the attorney general of the United States Virgin Islands agreed to withdraw the subpoena, and ExxonMobil began an action suing the Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. In 2019 the U.S.Supreme Court found in favor of the Massachusetts attorney general and allowed their case against Exxon to move forward. As a result of that decision, Exxon can no longer withhold records that the AG needs for their investigation into whether Exxon concealed that they were cognizant of the fossil fuels contributing to climate change and knowingly misled both the public and their own investors. Relations with the Rockefeller family Beginning in 2004, the descendants of John D. Rockefeller Sr., led mainly by his great-grandchildren, through letters, meetings, and shareholder resolutions, attempted to get ExxonMobil to acknowledge climate change, to abandon climate denial, and to shift towards clean energy. In 2013, responding to a shareholder resolution calling for emissions reductions, CEO Rex Tillerson asked, \\"What good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers?\\" In March 2016 the Rockefeller Family Fund announced plans to \\"eliminate holdings\\" of ExxonMobil. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Family Fund both backed reports suggesting that ExxonMobil knew more about the threat of global warming than it had disclosed. David Kaiser, grandson of David Rockefeller Sr. and president of the Rockefeller Family Fund, said that the \\"...company seems to be morally bankrupt.\\" Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, daughter of former Senator Jay Rockefeller, said, \\"What we would hope from Exxon is that they would admit what they've done -- these decades of denial...\\" In November 2016 ExxonMobil accused the Rockefeller family of masterminding a conspiracy against the company. Kaiser wrote in December 2016, \\"Our criticism carries a certain historical irony. John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil, and ExxonMobil is Standard Oil’s largest direct descendant. In a sense we were turning against the company where most of the Rockefeller family’s wealth was created.\\"  Other climate change activities  Beginning in 2002, ExxonMobil has invested up to US$100m over a ten-year period to establish the Global Climate and Energy Project at Stanford University, which \\"would focus on technologies that could provide energy without adding to a buildup of greenhouse gases\\".Stanford GCEP project homepage.

Built in 1799, it was the largest and most elaborate house in the area at the time. It was built for George Ulmer, who oversaw the rise and fall of a small business empire on the adjacent Ducktrap River between 1784 and 1812. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The Ulmer House stands at the northeast corner of South Cobbtown Road and United States Route 1, just east of the Ducktrap River north of the village of Lincolnville. Sited on a rise above and back from US 1, it is an imposing presence, with views down the river to Penobscot Bay. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a five bay facade, hip roof, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. The main entrance is at the center of the south-facing facade, sheltered by a hip- roofed porch that extends across the two flanking bays. A secondary entrance is located in a projecting vestibule on the west side. The interior retains original plaster and woodwork, including a high quality central hall staircase. The interior was divided into two units for many years, resulting in some loss of historic integrity. The house was built in 1799 for George Ulmer, who was then one of the wealthiest men in Hancock County (the area was separated to form Waldo County in 1827). Ulmer was politically well connected, serving as land agent for Henry Knox, and was able to leverage connections to financiers in Boston, Massachusetts to build a small lumber-driven empire on land he acquired from Knox at a discount in exchange for his services. Ulmer used the power he held as land agent (Knox was in the 1790s the area's largest landowner) to his own benefit, but was also seen with disfavor by the area's smaller landholders, who took offense at his and Knox's business practices. In several instances acts of vandalism against his business premises resulted in direct financial losses, and his first mansion, built in 1796, was destroyed by fire whose origin is uncertain. Ulmer's finances began to collapse when his mills were destroyed by spring flooding in 1807, with the replacement mills also destroyed the following December. Ulmer lost his house, to foreclosure in 1812. Ulmer's house was converted into two family not long after he lost it, and remained that way until 1999, when a new owner reintegrated the two sides. It is unclear whether differences in the styling of some of the upstairs rooms are the result of changes made by later owners, or if they were left unfinished by Ulmer due to his growing financial problems.

Floyd George Steele (June 28, 1918 – September 23, 1995) was an American physicist, engineer, and computer designer who grew up in Boulder, Colorado. He is known for leading the design team at Northrup that developed the MADIDDA, an early digital computer.  Early life  Floyd Steele grew up in Boulder, Colorado. He was named after his uncle, Floyd Odlum, a businessman known for coming out on top of the depression. Steele received his BA in physics from the University of Colorado, Boulder, a BS in electrical engineering and a MS in aeronautical engineering from Caltech. Before joining Northrop he worked for Douglas Aircraft from 1941 to 1944 and while in the Navy attended Captain Eddie's Radar School.  MADDIDA  Steele was the conceptual leader of the MADDIDA design group at Northrop Corporation.Reilly 2003, p. 164. Development of the MADDIDA began in 1946 with the goal of producing the first DIgital Data Analyzer (DIDA).Reilly 2003, p. 163. When the decision was made to use MAgnetic Drum memory (MAD) for the DIDA, the name was lengthened to MADDIDA (pronounced \\"Mad Ida\\"). Steele drew influence from the analog computer invented in 1927 by Vannevar Bush, which had digital components. Another influence to the MADDIDA's design was Lord Kelvin's Tide Predicting Machine, an analog computer completed in 1873. Steele hired Donald Eckdahl, Hrant (Harold) Sarkinssian, and Richard Sprague to work on the MADIDDA's germanium diode logic circuits and also to do magnetic recording. In contrast to the ENIAC and UNIVAC I, which used electrical pulses to represent bits, the MADDIDA was the first computer to represent bits using voltage levels. It was also the first computer whose entire logic was specified in Boolean algebra. These features were an advancement from earlier digital computers which still had analog circuitry components.\\"Annals of the History of Computing\\" 1988, p. 358 Soon after the MADIDDA's completion, Steele and his team realized that a general-purpose digital computer could also be used to as a differential analyzer through the use of an appropriate simulation language.  The Computer Research Corporation  A year after the first MADIDDA was demonstrated, Steele and the MADDIDA design team left Northrop, and was joined by Irving S. Reed On July 16, 1950 they formed the Computer Research Corporation (CRC) in order to develop general-purpose computers. After developing the Cadac, an early minicomputer, CRC was sold to National Cash Register (NCR) in February 1953.  Notes  References  *Reilly, Edwin D.

Heat is removed from the system by circulating liquid into direct contact with hot components, then through cool heat exchangers. Fluids suitable for immersion cooling have very good insulating properties to ensure that they can safely come into contact with energized electronic components. An immersion-cooled system Example of server immersion cooling of one server  Dielectric liquids  In general, there are two main liquid categories, Hydrocarbons (i.e. mineral, synthetic or bio oils) and fluorocarbons (i.e. fully engineered liquids). Dielectric liquids are divided into single- and two-phase applications. * Single-phase uses a circulation method for the dielectric liquid across hot electronic components and to a heat exchanging approach. * Two-phase immersion uses a low- temperature evaporation process to cool hot electronics and transfer the heat out of the liquid. The gas is cooled again by a heat exchanging method to allow return flow into the larger liquid volume.  Shapes and forms  \\"Enclosed chassis\\" require dripless connectors to interface to the individual chassis. These chassis are usually based on traditional rack style implementations. The dripless connectors usually require a small closed circuit cooling loop with a coolant to protect the flow integrity through relatively small pipes and connectors. The closed circuit is facilitated by a CDU or Coolant Distribution Unit, which usually can facilitate multiple racks at once. “Open bath” refers to the “open” liquid-air interface and thus surface tension between the liquid and the air being a distinctive element. Open bath systems are usually tanks which contain a larger body of dielectric liquid where electronics are immersed into the bath. Multiple electronic assemblies are sharing the same liquid. This liquid can be based on single- or two-phase technology. Regardless of the term, open bath systems can be fully sealed, but are always opened from the top to service IT equipment. The water circuit for open bath immersion systems is either connected to a CDU which circulates the dielectric liquid, or to an integrated heat exchanging device which is part of the tank. For a facility interface, CDU's are usually designed for 100 kW or more, whereas an integrated heat exchanging device is usually designed for 10-100 kW cooling capacity. \\"Hybrid\\" refers to combinations of the forementioned shapes and forms. There are numerous solutions in the industry already with unique and diverse approaches. These may not always fit in any designated definition. Depending on which aspect is relevant, these strategies may be positioned as any overlapping definition.  Evolution  Immersion cooling has the potential of becoming a popular server cooling solution, in particular for green data centers, as it allows operators to drastically reduce their energy usage through the elimination of the expensive air cooling infrastructure including on-board server fans, CRACs, A/C compressors, air-circulation fans, necessary duct work, air handlers, and other active ancillary systems such as dehumidifiers. These systems are replaced with efficient low speed liquid circulation pumps and heat exchanger and/or dry cooler systems. The power reduction that can be achieved through the use of immersion cooling is often measured in terms of Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE). However, It is important to note that the definitions of PUE for air-cooled devices and liquid immersion cooled devices differs in one important aspect, which makes such direct comparisons misleading in favor of air cooling. * PUE for air-cooled data centers, as defined by the Green Grid, includes the power used by the fans and other active cooling components found on-board the servers as part of the IT Equipment Energy, * PUE for liquid immersion cooling excludes these values from the IT Equipment Energy component because these system elements (in particular on board fans) are generally removed from the IT equipment as they are not necessary to circulate the dielectric coolants, and often actually impede the circulation of the dielectric coolant. This discrepancy in the definition of PUE for the different cooling methods results in the PUE of air-cooled data centers generally being overstated by anywhere from 10-20% when compared against the PUE of a liquid immersion cooled facility of the same power usage. Servers and other IT hardware cooled by immersion cooling do not require fans to circulate the dielectric liquid, thus they are removed from the system prior to immersion. Thermal pastes which are typically used on heat spreaders for CPUs and other chips may require replacement with a different compound in order to avoid the thermal degradation within the dielectric liquid. Depending on the type of application, solder, Indium foil and thermally conductive epoxies may be used as a replacement materials. Network router and smart-phone immersed in synthetic single-phase, liquid immersion coolant The temperatures used in immersion cooling are determined by the highest temperature at which the devices being immersed can reliably operate. For servers this temperature range is typically between , however in ASIC based crypto mining devices this range is often extended up to 75C. This increase in the high end of the temperature range allows data centers operators to use entirely passive dry coolers, or much more efficient evaporative or adiabatic cooling towers instead of chiller-based air cooling or water chillers. This increase in the temperature range also allows operators using Single-phase Immersion Coolants to more effectively use the change in outdoor temperatures to get more efficient cooling from their systems because the single-phase systems are not limited in their effectiveness by the boiling point of the coolant as is the case with two-phase coolants. Multiple relevant brands like Intel and Facebook have already validated the advantages of submerging servers. Current commercial applications for immersion cooling range from datacenter oriented solutions for commodity server cooling, server clusters, HPCC applications and Cryptocurrency mining. and mainstream cloud-based and web hosting architectures. Electric vehicle and battery manufacturers also employ liquid immersion cooling in batteries, drive-train, Kinetic energy recovery systems, electric motors, electric motor controllers, and other on-board electronic sub systems. Liquid immersion cooling is also used in the thermal management of LEDs, Lasers, X-Ray machines, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging devices. A different industry where immersion cooling is applied to electronic components is deep sea research where Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles with electronic equipment are filled with Single-phase Liquid Dielectrics to both protect them from corrosion in seawater and as a pressure compensating fluid to avoid being crushed by the extreme pressure exerted on the ROV while working in the deep sea. This application also includes the cooling of the electric motors used for under sea propulsion. Until about 2014, the technology was typically only utilized in special very intensive supercomputing projects, similar to the Cray Computer Applications. However, since the dramatic increase in global energy consumption by data centers, there is now a focus on energy efficiency which has driven the utilizing of liquid immersion cooling in both data centers and crypto mining operations to reevaluate its application. In addition the advent of new very high density CPUs and GPUs for use in real-time processing, Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data mining operations is pressuring users and data center operators to evaluate liquid immersion cooling for ability to cool high density racks as well as reduce the total mechanical footprint of data centers. Since 2005, several companies tried to claim patents based on the open bath approach with external pump installations. Most, if not all of these claims have been denied on the basis that IBM had already patented the technology.  History  19th and 20th century immersion milestones: * Immersing electric systems (specifically transformers) in dielectric fluids for thermal management was used before 1887. * The first patent to explicitly mention the use of oil as a coolant and insulator is in the patent submitted for a Constant Current Transformer in 1899 by Richard Fleming of Lynn, Massachusetts, assignor to the General Electric Company of New York * The first reference to the specific use of dielectric fluids being used to cool \\"computers\\" is in 1966 by Oktay Sevgin of IBM. * In 1968, Richard C. Chu and John H. Seely, working for IBM patented an \\"Immersion cooling system for modularly packaged components.\\" * Seymour R. Cray Jr. founder of Cray Research, LLC patented a \\"Immersion cooled high density electronic assembly\\" in 1982. * The Cray T90 (released in 1995) used large liquid-to-chilled liquid heat exchangers and single or two-phase immersion cooling liquids for heat removal * Due to the arrival of CMOS, significant energy savings were achieved in CPU's which rapidly reduced the cooling challenges of HPC systems. It was not until the second decade that immersion regained traction due to increasing thermal properties of chips. 21st century immersion milestones: * In 2006, Hardcore Computer Inc was founded on the concept of introducing enclosed chassis style PC's for gaming. * In 2009, Green Revolution Cooling rebooted the open bath immersion cooling concept by bringing a commercial open bath immersion system to the HPC industry * In 2011, Iceotope launched the first commercial rack-style enclosed chassis based technology, specifically designed for datacenter deployments. * In 2016, Asperitas created the first pumpless natural convection circulated high density, single phase open bath immersion system. * Starting in 2016, the rise of crypto currency becomes a main and significant driving force behind immersion. This is due to the high TCO advantages which are highly valued in crypto mining. This period has allowed many immersion technologies to gain essential experience and mature their technologies. * 2017 shows a large volume of start-ups in the immersion cooling domain. Mostly related to cryptocurrency and the increasing power and cooling challenges in the datacenter industry. * In 2018, the Open Compute Project officially embraces immersion in a new project under Rack & Power as part of ACS (Advanced Cooling Solutions). * In 2019, the first documented industry standards for immersion are presented at the OCP summit in San Jose.  Server immersion cooling techniques = Open bath immersion cooling = Open bath immersion cooling is a data center cooling technique that implies fully submerging IT equipment in dielectric liquid. The “open” aspect does not refer to an open or sealed system, but refers to the “open” liquid-air interface and thus surface tension between the liquid and the air being a distinctive element. These baths allow the coolant fluid to be moved through the hardware components or servers submerged in it.600x600px Single phase immersion requires circulation of the dielectric liquids by pumps or by natural convection flow. These liquids always remain in liquid state while operating. They never boil or freeze. The dielectric coolant is either pumped through an external heat exchanger where it is cooled with any facility coolant, or the facility coolant is pumped through an immersed heat exchanger, which facilitates heat transfer within the dielectric liquid. border In two- phase systems, fluorocarbons are used as heat transfer fluids. Heat is removed in a two-phase system, where the liquid literally boils when it comes in contact with hot components, due to its low boiling point. The system takes advantage of a concept known as “latent heat” which is the heat (thermal energy) required to change the phase of a fluid, this occurs when the two- phase coolant comes in contact with the heated electronics in the bath that are above the coolants boiling point. Once the two-phase coolant enters its gas phase it must be cooled or condensed, typically through the use of water cooled coils placed in the top of the tank. Once condensed the two-phase coolant drips back into the primary cooling tank. The two-phase coolant in the tank generally remains at it “saturation temperature”. Energy transferred from the servers into the two-phase coolant will cause a portion of it to boil off into a gas. The gas rises above the liquid level where it contacts a condenser which is cooler than the saturation temperature. This causes the gaseous state coolant to condense back into a liquid form and fall back into the bath. = Enclosed chassis immersion cooling = A different approach to open bath immersion cooling are sealed server immersion cooling solutions, where servers are specially built in a liquid-tight casing. The dielectric coolant is circulated inside or pumped through each server to collect heat from the components. The heat is then taken to a manifold or backplane in the rack where it is either circulated directly outside the building to a cooling tower or heat exchanger or cooled directly at the rack with a facility coolant infrastructure. The main advantage of this approach is that servers are mounted in self contained vessels that can be easily replaced in the rack and are not required to be placed in horizontal baths. The most common disadvantage is that not all hardware can be used as the vendor defines the hardware specs of the sealed servers.

According to ' (French-Québécois Commission for Common Sites of Memory) a lieu de mémoire signifies the cultural landmarks, places, practices and expressions stemming from a shared past, whether material (monuments) or intangible (language and traditions).Commission franco-québécoise sur les lieux de mémoire communs, \\"Lieux de mémoire,\\" http://cfqlmc.org/lieux-de-memoire (French-language link) As sites of memory became better known and made official by governments, they can tend to homogenize varied local memories.

Today, there is one national memory, but its unity stems from a divided patrimonial demand that is constantly expanding and in search of coherence.”Nora, “The Era of Commemoration” in Realms of Memory: The Construction of the French Past, vol. 3 Thus sites of memory may risk becoming \\"invented traditions\\".

He is also a research fellow at the Centre for Comparative Studies of the same university.  Biography  João Ferreira Duarte graduated in Germanic Philology from the School of Arts and Humanities of the University of Lisbon in 1971. In the same year he was offered a position as teaching assistant at this institution. In 1986 he completed his PhD in English Literature with a thesis on W. H. Auden. He has taught Literary Theory, English Literature, Comparative Literature, African Post-colonial Literature, and Translation Studies. Ferreira Duarte was founding member of the Portuguese Association for Anglo-American Studies (APEAA), which was created in 1979, as well as the Centre for Comparative Studies, of which he is a member since 1998. Between 1991 and 2010, he directed the post-graduate programme in Comparative Studies, initially under the name of Comparative Literature, offered at the same School of Arts and Humanities. He was also President of the Portuguese Association for Comparative Literature between 2002 and 2007.  Ferreira Duarte and Translation Studies in Portugal  He has played a decisive role in the institutionalization of Translation Studies in the Portuguese academia. In 1989, following the growth of Comparative Studies in Portugal, he set up the first interdepartmental course on Translation Studies at the University of Lisbon, as part of the newly created MA in Comparative Literature. In 2001 he created TradBase, an online database which collects Translation Studies works published both in Portugal and by Portuguese scholars. The aim of this online bibliography was to promote the dialogue between scholars working on translation; in Ferreira Duarte’s words: “I wanted to contribute to the construction of a kind of ‘scientific community’, that is, to help to foster among those who were working on translation a sense of taking part in a collective project which was both national and international”.Rita Bueno Maia; Marta Pacheco Pinto; Sara Ramos Pinto, eds (2015).

It was presumably finished in 1938, for its performance at the National Aquatic Show in Los Angeles. Even though the score of the composition is lost and has never been published nor performed after its premiere, some of Cage's fellow musicians have loosely reconstructed it.  Composition  This composition was commissioned by the Physical Education Department of the University of California, Los Angeles to celebrate the National Aquatic Show at the Olympic Swim Stadium in Los Angeles, which was held on July 2, 1938. Since the score is lost, there is debate over the duration and the instrumentation of the original composition. However, the event was played and directed by John Cage himself, and the performance involved both synchronized swimming and live music. It was at this time when John Cage started experimenting with submerged tom-toms and gongs, so that the swimmers could follow the music even when they were completely submerged. The work was never published nor performed again, but the idea of submerging instruments became increasingly interesting to Cage, as he experimented with it further in later works, such as First Construction in Metal. The composition's title is still unknown, since no specific details about it are mentioned in Cage's notes. However, it is commonly referred to as Music for an Aquatic Ballet, which is the description provided in Cage's book Silence: Lectures and Writings.  Reconstruction  Since the composition is lost and has not been mentioned many times in John Cage's papers, there is little information about instrumentation, duration and structure. The composition was first reconstructed by Roberto Fabbriciani and Jonathan Faralli in 2011, in a version for flute, percussion and tape. Here, the musicians attempted not only to reconstruct the original composition but also the event in which it took place. For this reason, they used sounds of a stadium audience cheering, water splashes and typical underwater sounds. While there might not be much resemblance to the original 1938 composition, both musicians were Cage's friends and had worked together with him in the past. The recording of this piece was released in 2012 by Brilliant Classics.

A Democrat, she is a member of the New York State Senate, representing New York's 7th State Senate district, which runs from the North Shore to roughly the central part of Western Nassau County on Long Island. She is a member of the so-called \\"Long Island Six,\\" a group of six Democrats who represent Long Island in the New York State Senate and often vote as a block. She was elected in 2018 as part of a wave of Democrats who defeated Republican incumbents and brought control of the New York Senate to the Democrats for only the third time since World War II. Kaplan is the first Iranian-American to be elected to either of New York state's legislative chambers and she is the first former political refugee to serve in the New York Senate. Early life and education Kaplan was born to an Iranian Jewish family in Tabriz, Iran and raised in Tehran, where her father was a carpet dealer. When the Islamic Revolution swept the country, Anna's parents sent her to the United States for safety at age 13. Arriving as an unaccompanied child refugee in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Anna was sent to live with a foster family in Chicago, Illinois until her parents were able to legally enter the United States. After her family reunited in Chicago, they moved to Queens, New York, and then to Great Neck, New York. Kaplan attended the Stern College at Yeshiva University, and received her J.D. from Cardozo School of Law in New York City. Early political career Kaplan started her political career as a member of the North Hempstead Town Board in 2011, and served until her election to the state senate.

Kaplan was defeated in the 2016 New York Congressional Democratic Primary by former Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi. Suozzi went on to win the general election. 2018 New York Senate Election On April 27, 2018, flanked by Nassau County Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Kaplan announced her candidacy for the New York State Senate's 7th District to a large gathering of supporters and state and local Democratic elected officials at the \\"Yes We Can Community Center\\" in Westbury, New York.

The book reframes the relationship between gender and technologies, and presents a feminist reading of the woman-machine relationship. It is considered a key contributor to the rise of feminist technoscience as a field.  Reception  According to a review in the American Journal of Sociology, Wajcman convincingly argues that \\"analyses of everything from transit systems to pap smears must include a technofeminist awareness of men’s and women’s often different positions as designers, manufacturing operatives, salespersons, purchasers, profiteers, and embodied users of such technologies.\\" In the journal Science, Technology and Human Values, Sally Wyatt notes that the \\"theoretical insights from feminist technoscience (can and should) be useful for empirical research as well as for political change and action\\" and that one way of moving towards this is \\"return to production and work as research sites because so much work in recent years has focused on consumption, identity, and representation.\\"  Editions  Adding to the print edition, which has been reprinted several times, E-book editions of TechnoFeminism were released in 2013.

Under the aegis of the organization, he provides employment to over 1800 women in the village. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2007, for his social commitment and his contributions to the art of weaving.  Biography  Gopinathan was born in a small village called Manjavilakom, in Neyyattinkara, in Thiruvananthapuram, in the southern tip of Kerala in a poor weaver's family as one of the ten children. The financial struggles of his family is reported to have forced him to abandon education at the age of 10 and move to Nagarcoil, a town in Tamil Nadu, known for handloom weaving, where he learnt weaving skills. Later, he moved to Madurai and Salem, larger cities in Tamil Nadu, for training on how to set up looms and returned to Kerala at the age of 30, with enough money to buy a piece of land. Back at his native village, he set up his own loom in a small shed. In 1972, Gopinathan organized 30 local women, under a Mahila Samajam (women's self-help groups), and trained them in weaving. He donated his land to the association for them to house their looms and, by 1978, the number of associations under his leadership grew to 26 with 300 looms working in an 80-cents plot. Later, he bought a 10-acre plot for the initiative and gathered the efforts of the association under one umbrella, Eco Tex Handloom Consortium. In 2006, with a 30 million loan-cum-grant from the Government of Kerala, he modernized the machinery, but it is reported that the consortium is still facing financial problems. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honor of the Padma Shri in 2007. Three years later, he was chosen as a Real Hero, by the Reliance Foundation and CNN-IBN, in the women's welfare section. Gopinathan is married and has three sons and a daughter. The family continues to live in Manjavilakom where he has also established Gandhi Smaraka Technical School, a vocational training school for girls from scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, and provides them with training in tailoring, embroidery and needlework.

She is professor of economics at the University of Manchester and a research director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Griffith was president of the European Economic Association for 2015, making her the first woman to hold the position. She was also joint managing editor of The Economic Journal between 2011 and 2017. Citizenship Griffith holds both UK and US citizenship.  Biography  Griffith earned her degree in economics from the University of Massachusetts, Boston (1985), her M.Sc. in econometrics and forecasting from City of London Polytechnic (1991), and her PhD from the University of Keele (1999). Griffith is currently the Research Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). She was elected President of the Royal Economic Society in 2018. She will be President from 2019-2020. She served as Deputy Chair of the Economics sub-Panel of the Research Excellence Framework. Griffith's main area of focus is now related to empirical industrial organization regarding the retail food sector and nutrition. Currently, she has her second ERC Advanced Grant to study behavior of consumers and firms to see how government policy will impact food markets. Research=Obesity= Griffith's presidential address to the European Economic Association at the University of Mannheim, Germany entitled \\"Gluttony and Sloth? Labour Market Nonseparabilities and the Rise in Obesity\\", reflected her recent research into the relationship between changes in relative food prices and the nutritional quality of households’ shopping baskets. via PDF =Corporation tax= In her Royal Economic Society Public Lecture 2015, \\"Does Starbucks Pay Enough Tax\\", Griffith argued that corporate tax should be charged like VAT. Griffith stated that the current system of corporate taxation is outdated and taxing corporate profits in the location where value is created is not very meaningful. She suggested taxing profits at the destination of sales rather than at the source of profits would be an improvement. Griffith cited two papers, one by Auerbach and Devereux (2012), Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation WP 13/11 PDF the other by Devereux and Vella (2014), PDF in support of her case. Griffith's previous research in this area considers how influential corporate income taxes are in determining where firms choose to legally own intellectual property, i.e. the way in which intellectual property accounts for firms' assets and if they can be used by firms to shift income offshore to reduce their corporate income tax liability.

BRIN indexes provide similar benefits to horizontal partitioning or sharding but without needing to explicitly declare partitions. A BRIN is applicable to an index on a table that is large and where the index key value is easily sorted and evaluated with a MinMax function. BRIN were originally proposed by Alvaro Herrera of 2ndQuadrant in 2013 as 'Minmax indexes'. Implementations thus far are tightly coupled to internal implementation and storage techniques for the database tables. This makes them efficient, but limits them to particular vendors. So far PostgreSQL is the only vendor to have announced a live product with this specific feature, in PostgreSQL 9.5. Other vendors have described some similar features, including Oracle, Netezza 'zone maps', Infobright 'data packs', MonetDB and Apache Hive with ORC/Parquet.  Design  B-tree index structure BRIN index structureBRIN operate by \\"summarising\\" large blocks of data into a compact form, which can be efficiently tested to exclude many of them from a database query, early on. These tests exclude a large block of data for each comparison. By reducing the data volume so early on, both by representing large blocks as small tuples, and by eliminating many blocks, BRIN substantially reduce the amount of detailed data that must be examined by the database node on a row-by-row basis. Data storage in large databases is layered and chunked, with the table storage arranged into 'blocks'. Each block contains perhaps 1MB in each chunk and they are retrieved by requesting specific blocks from a disk-based storage layer. BRIN are a lightweight in- memory summary layer above this: each tuple in the index summarises one block as to the range of the data contained therein: its minimum and maximum values, and if the block contains any non-null data for the column(s) of interest. Unlike a traditional index which locates the regions of the table containing values of interest, BRIN act as \\"negative indexes\\", showing the blocks that are definitely not of interest and thus do not need to be processed further. Some simple benchmarks suggest a five-fold improvement in search performance with an index scan, compared to the unindexed table. Compared to B-trees, they avoid their maintenance overhead. As BRIN are so lightweight, they may be held entirely in memory, thus avoiding disk overhead during the scan. The same may not be true of B-tree: B-tree requires a tree node for every approximately N rows in the table, where N is the capacity of a single node, thus the index size is large. As BRIN only requires a tuple for each block (of many rows), the index becomes sufficiently small to make the difference between disk and memory. For a 'narrow' table the B-tree index volume approaches that of the table itself; the BRIN may be only 5-15% of it.  Advantages = Search and index scan = A large database index would typically use B-tree algorithms. BRIN is not always a substitute for B-tree, it is an improvement on sequential scanning of an index, with particular (and potentially large) advantages when the index meets particular conditions for being ordered and for the search target to be a narrow set of these values. In the general case, with random data, B-tree may still be superior. A particular advantage of the BRIN technique, shared with Oracle Exadata's Smart Scanning, is in the use of this type of index with Big Data or data warehousing applications, where it is known that almost all of the table is irrelevant to the range of interest. BRIN allows the table to be queried in such cases by only retrieving blocks that may contain data of interest and excluding those which are clearly outside the range, or contain no data for this column. = Insert = A regular problem with the processing of large tables is that retrieval requires the use of an index, but maintaining this index slows down the addition of new records. Typical practices have been to group additions together and add them as a single bulk transaction, or to drop the index, add the batch of new records and then recreate the index. Both of these are disruptive to simultaneous read / write operations and may not be possible in some continuously-operating businesses. With BRIN, the slowdown from maintaining the index is much reduced compared to B-tree. Wong reports that B-tree slowed down additions to an unindexed 10GB table by 85%, but a comparable BRIN only had an overhead of 11%. = Index creation = BRIN may be created for extremely large data where B-tree would require horizontal partitioning. Creating the BRIN is also much faster than for a B-tree, by 80%. This would be a useful improvement to refactoring existing database applications that use the drop-add-reindex approach, without requiring code changes.  Implementation = Dependence on table ordering = Multiple BRIN may be defined for different columns on a single table. However, there are restrictions. BRIN are only efficient if the ordering of the key values follows the organisation of blocks in the storage layer. In the simplest case, this could require the physical ordering of the table, which is often the creation order of the rows within it, to match the key's order. Where this key is a creation date, that may be a trivial requirement. If the data is truly random, or if there is much churn of the key values in a 'hot' database, the assumptions underlying BRIN may break down. All blocks contain entries \\"of interest\\" and so few may be excluded early on by the BRIN range filter. In most cases, BRIN is restricted to a single index per table. Multiple BRIN may be defined, but only one is likely to have suitable ordering. If two (or more) indexes have similar ordering behaviour, it may be possible and useful to define multiple BRIN on the same table. An obvious example is where both a creation date and a record_id column both increase monotonically with the record creation sequence. In other cases, the key value may not be monotonic, but provided that there is still a strong grouping within the record's physical order, BRIN is effective. = Exadata Storage Indexes = BRIN have some similarities to Oracle Exadata \\"Storage Indexes\\". Exadata has the strong concept of a 'storage layer' in its architecture stack. Table data is held in blocks or 'storage cells' on the storage servers. These storage cells are opaque to the storage server and are returned to the database engine on request, by their identifier. Previously, the database nodes must request all the storage cells in order to scan them. Storage Indexes provides data pruning at this layer: efficiently indicating sections that are of no further interest. The Storage Index is loaded into memory on the storage server, so that when a request for cells is issued it may be predicated with search values. These are compared to the Storage Index and then only the relevant cells need be returned to the database node. Performance advantages with a Storage Index are most evident when the indexed column contains many nulls. Massive performance advantages are gained when scanning across sparse data.  Development  Development for PostgreSQL was carried out as part of the AXLE project (Advanced Analytics for Extremely Large European Databases) This work was partially funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013).  PostgreSQL  Implementation for PostgreSQL was first evident in 2013. BRIN appeared in release 9.5 of PostgreSQL at the start of 2016.

The film stars Claude Rains, Joan Bennett, Lionel Atwill, Juanita Quigley, Henry O'Neill and Henry Armetta. The film was released on December 24, 1934, by Universal Pictures.  Plot  Paul Verin walks through the streets of 1915 Paris carrying his small daughter Linette on one arm and a black satchel on the other. Arriving at the home of Paul’s boyhood friend, attorney Fernand De Marnay, Paul relates the events that led him there. Five years ago Paul and his wife Adele lived in Clichy. They lived off what Paul could make with his political writings. Adele loves Paul but she is unhappy living in Clichy. She wants to live in Paris. To make enough money to move to Paris, Paul accepts an offer to write political articles for aspiring politician Henri Dumont agreeing to let Dumont take credit as the author. Dumont has political aspirations and the anti-war editorials make Dumont popular. Paul and wife are able to live in Paris comfortably. Dumont’s rising popularity attracts the interest of a group of wealthy arms dealers who would like the editorials to move toward a pro-war viewpoint. Paul is an avowed pacifist and refuses to write such articles for Dumont. When war breaks out, Dumont uses his influence to see that Paul is sent to the front. Paul becomes a corporal and see action at Verdun. Paul is given leave to see Adele. At the railroad station, Paul finds his leave has been cancelled. He hears a rumor that not only is Dumont spending time with Adele but Dumont is also responsible for his leave being cancelled. On hearing this, Paul boards the train to Paris. He is arrives at his home and discovers Dumont attempting to force himself on Adele. Enraged, Paul uses his bayonet to kill Dumont. Paul reveals the contents of his satchel to de Mornay. While not graphically shown on screen, the implication of the scene is that the satchel contains the severed head of Dumont. Paul had 'lost his ‘head’ to Dumont and now he has it back. Adele arrives with the police. De Mornay will be able to get an acquittal for Paul.

Inspired by the Egyptian Revolution and Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh's nationalization of oil, the revolutionaries wanted to force Faisal II's abdication, transform the state into a republic, and assert Iraq's full independence from Britain by assuming control over its own foreign affairs. Port workers in Basra went on strike on 23 August 1952. Students at Iraq's College of Pharmacy followed suit on 26 October. The Iraqi Communist Party, which had been behind the 1948 riots, played a leading role in the disturbances. Though the protesters were emphatically anti-monarchical, they were positively disposed to the military, a symbol of national unity and Iraqi independence. Faisal II's uncle, ruling Regent 'Abd al-Ilah, replaced Mustafa Mahmud al-Umari with General Nureddin Mahmud on 23 November but he made no concessions to the protesters. Protesters denounced Mahmud and demanded his resignation in favor of the National Democratic Party's Kamil al-Chadirchi, who had briefly served as Bakr Sidqi's Economic Minister after the 1936 revolution. Mahmud cracked down, instituting martial law and a curfew, shutting down political parties and newspapers, and detaining leading protesters. In 1953, Jamil al-Midfai, a weak civilian politician, was elected to succeed Mahmud. In May, Faisal II became an adult and assumed the role and responsibilities of the king.

Though the company was largely unsuccessful in its goals due to legal, technical and financial problems, it set the stage for the modern recording industry in the mid 1890s.  Background  Thomas Edison successfully demonstrated sound recording and reproduction in late 1877 with the tinfoil phonograph. The invention caught the public's attention but its practical utility was limited due to low-fidelity and its single-use nature. Edison sold the rights to the phonograph to the Edison Speaking Phonograph Company in 1878 and shifted his focus to the development of electric light. Between 1880 and 1885, Alexander Graham Bell and his associates at the Volta Laboratory experimented with a variety of processes for improved sound recording. They eventually settled on a recording process based on cutting wax cylinders. On January 6, 1886, the associates formed the Volta Graphophone company and were awarded a patent on their wax cylinder process. Later in the year, Edison resumed research on the phonograph. On March 28, 1887, the Volta associates established the American Graphophone Company for the manufacturing and sale of graphophones, and Edison organized the Edison Phonograph Company in the following year to protect his new research in sound. = Incorporation = Jesse H. Lippincott, founder of the North American Phonograph Company. In 1888, a Pennsylvania businessman named Jesse Lippincott sought to market the budding technologies for business dictation. He licensed the graphophone patents in March, and the phonograph in June. In July, Lippincott chartered the North American Phonograph Company in Jersey City, NJ. Edison founded the Edison Phonograph Works for phonograph manufacture, and American Graphophone opened a factory in Bridgeport Connecticut for graphophone manufacture. Based on the model of the Bell Telephone Company, North American would buy phonographs and graphophones and lease them to regional sub-companies, who would in turn rent the machines to local businesses for dictation. = Patent challenges = Before Lippincott could establish these sub-companies, the Edison Speaking Phonograph Company, who held Edison's tinfoil phonograph patents, threatened legal action against North American, claiming rights to Edison's improvements to the phonograph until 1912. Lippincott settled with the company, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars that were intended for capital investment. In early 1889, thirty regional sub-companies were formed, and licensed exclusive territorial rights from North American. To fund manufacture, Lippincott also needed to sell stock in the parent company, but investors were wary due to the news of the Edison Speaking Phonograph Company's protests. Throughout 1889, manufacture of phonograph and graphophones was limited by North American's lack of capital. Local companies found that the few machines they leased were unreliable and hard to use. Some companies found that it was more profitable to publicly exhibit entertainment recordings (music, stories, jokes) than to rent the machines. Edison Exhibition Phonograph = The coin-slot business = The title page of North American Phonograph Company's first catalog, 1890 In February 1890, the Automatic Phonograph Exhibition Company formed, with a patent on a device that let companies exhibit phonographs with a coin-slot attachment, like a jukebox. Through 1890, companies began realizing that entertainment was better business than dictation, and the automatic machine was the most effective way to accomplish this. North American, realizing that this was the future, signed an agreement with Automatic in April allowing the local companies to do business with them. As the automatic exhibition model gained ground, American Graphophone's dictation-optimized format (colloquially 'Bell-Tainter cylinders' today) fell suddenly behind. Lippincott's initial agreement with American Graphophone committed North American to buy 5,000 graphophones each year, and pay a royalty of $20 on each. Realizing they wouldn't be able to sell these unpopular machines, North American's board of directors offered to pay American Graphophone $100,000 each year (the equivalent of royalties on 5,000 machines) to disclaim them of their previously committed order. By the end of 1890, North American was deeply in debt to the Edison Phonograph Works, and was missing the income generated by Automatic's coin-slot business. In December, North American instructed the local companies that they were expected to offer phonographs and graphophones for sale to the public. The Automatic Phonograph Exhibition Company filed an injunction on the same date, arguing that unrestricted sale would damage their business, and citing their April agreement allowing them to operate in this way. The temporary injunction was allowed in Dec. 1890, and made permanent Jan. 1891. In May 1891, North American was forced into assignment (an alternative to bankruptcy) for its inability to pay Edison Phonograph Works. In July, the Automatic company agreed to allow North American to sell 1,000 machines to pay off debts, with the agreement that they were not to be sold for automatic exhibition. Lippincott had taken leave from the company in late 1890 due to illness, and in late 1891, Samuel Insull became president and Edison joined the board of directors to help repair the company's finances. = Edison becomes president = In 1892, North American was still struggling to pay its debts when a series of financial measures were taken. In June, the company issued bonds to ease the liquidity crisis. In July, Edison was named president of North American. Automatic agreed to allow the unrestricted sale of phonographs, and North American offered a deal with the local companies to centralize sales, paying a 10% royalty to the locals for their territorial rights. Most of the local companies accepted this offer. Edison Dictation Phonograph, 1893 Through 1893, North American, under Edison, continued to sell phonographs, and offered the option to buy the machines on the installment plan. Edison planned to carry on with the business in this way for another year (from June 1893), then planned to consolidate his interests in manufacture and sales. = United injunction and receivership = In November 1893, the Edison United Phonograph Company, who held exclusive rights to market the phonograph in England, were granted an injunction against North American for allowing the local companies to sell the machines in England, in violation of their exclusive rights. Edison stepped down as president of North American in January 1894. In April, Jesse Lippincott, the founder of North American died. This allowed American Graphophone, who had licensed their manufacturing rights to Lippincott personally, to sell graphophones directly to the public. The Edison Phonograph Works demanded payment on North American's outstanding debts in June. In August, North American, unable to pay their debts to Edison or their bondholders, was forced into receivership. In October, American Graphophone issued a statement to the industry saying Edison's phonographs, which had incorporated American's patents while both parties were licensed by North American, infringed on their rights and could not be legally sold. Throughout 1895, Edison tried to buy North American's assets in order to recover his phonograph patents and resume manufacture and sale. Other creditors of North American blocked the purchase, worried that Edison would not have to pay their debts if the sale proceeded. In the same year, American Graphophone acquired the Columbia Phonograph Company, one of the strongest local subsidiaries of North American. They debuted the spring-motor powered 'Type N' phonograph, which gracefully resolved one of the most fundamental problems of previous phonographs. = National Phonograph Company = In 1896, the court in charge of the North American receivership let Edison buy North American's assets, with the condition that he also accept North American's liabilities. Edison formed the National Phonograph Company in January 1896, and transferred North American's patents and supplies to this company. Edison and National Phonograph fought American Graphophone and Columbia Phonograph in court over patents throughout 1896. When the judge in charge of this case died in December 1896, the warring parties agreed to cross-license each-others patents, and let the phonograph business begin in earnest in 1897. = Resolution = Beginning in 1897, Edison and Columbia sustained a thriving competition in spring-powered home phonographs and wax cylinder records. Edison continued with cylinder records, debuting the mass-producible Gold- Moulded cylinder in 1902, while Columbia transitioned to the disc format from 1901–1908 and entered into more direct competition with the Victor Talking Machine Company, which had inherited the disc business from Berliner's Gramophone. The North American Phonograph Company finally dissolved in June 1898 after Edison settled with the Edison United company. Some local phonograph companies filed suits against Edison over the years, even threatening a class-action suit in 1900 before their original contracts were to expire. Minor battles continued until April 1909, when National Phonograph acquired the New York Phonograph Company. The Columbia Phonograph Company, general (the portion of the business incorporated as a part of North American) voluntarily dissolved in June 1913.  See also  Charles A.

He represented more than 20% of the publishing market in Russia in the early 1910s and made a significant impact on development of the Russian book publishing industry.  Biography = Early Years and Education = Zinovii was born in Chuguev, in Ukraine at that time part of the Russian empire. As the son of a soldier who had served 25 years in the Russian Army, he was less constrained by the anti-semitic measures regulating Russian society at the time and was permitted to stay in either St. Petersburg and Moscow. He graduated from Kharkov art school in 1899, then studied at Simon Hollochi school in Munich, later in Paris at the studio of Anton Ažbe. = Beginning of the Career = His close friend Korney Chukovsky recalled, that in 1905 Grzhebin returned to Russia as poor as a church mouse and with no social connections, but with an incredible energy and desire to work. He had an idea to create a Russian version of Simplicissimus, a political satire magazine with antimonarchical incline. Zhupel In late 1905 Grzhebin established a satirical magazine Zhupel ( – Bugbear). Mstislav Dobuzhinsky said, that Grzhebin performed \\"a real miracle\\" as a manager, successfully uniting artists and writers from the opposite circles of Russian literature world in one enterprise. The Zhupel had only three issues: two in December 1905 and one in January 1906. Because of the very harsh caricatures and satire about the government, Grzhebin was arrested and imprisoned for a year for \\"disrespecting the Imperial authority\\". He spent 8 months in the Kresty Prison. The Zhupel was closed, but soon revived under the name \\"Adskaya pochta\\" with even bolder articles and pictures. File:Жупел. №1. (1905).pdf№ 1, complete issue File:Жупел. №2. (1905) — Обложка.jpg№ 2, cover only File:Жупел. №3. (1906) — Обложка.jpg№ 3, cover only =Shipovnik= In 1906 Grzhebin opened the Shipovnik ( – rosehip) publishing house at 31 Nikolaevskaya Street, St Petersburg, in partnership with Solomon Yuryevich Kopelman. In different years Alexander Blok, Leonid Andreyev, Fyodor Sologub, and Boris Zaytsev worked in the Shipovnik as editors-in-chief and art consultants. Many artists of the \\"Mir Iskusstva\\" created illustrations of Shipovnik's issues. Grzhebin was in charge of finances and also led negotiations with authors. The publishing house became one of the leaders on the contemporary book market, it printed scientific literature, school books, but mostly novels and poetry from both well-known mature writers to young aspiring authors. After the October revolution Shipovnik was moved to Moscow, and then shut down by censorship department in 1922. =Other Projects= From 1907 to 1912 Grzhebin headed the 'Pantheon' publishing house, that focused on translated classic literature, but in many ways anticipated and formed the future 'Shipovnik'. In 1914 Grzhebin created the 'Otechestvo' magazine, opposed to Maxim Gorky's \\"Letopis'\\". In 1916 he collaborated with Gorky in 'Parus' publishing house, then in 1917—1918 Grzhebin headed the editors office of the newspaper \\"Novaya zhizn'\\". = Family = With his wife Maria Constantinovna Doriomedova (1880-1967), born in Nertchinski Zavod in Siberia, Grzhebin had 5 children : Lya, Irina, Hélène, Alexis, Tovy. Tovy was a physicist also economist. Hélène Grjebine wrote her story of emigration Irina Grjebine, who trained as a dancer under Olga Preobrajenska and Lya Grjebine, also a dancer. = Emigration = The Russian revolution completely changed the situation on the book market: the equipment was destroyed, the typographic personnel was mostly called up into the Red Army, no paper of suitable quality was left in the whole country. Even though Zinovii Grzhebin sympathized the revolution, he found no place for his life's work in the RSFSR. =Vsemirnaya Literature= Grzhebin was closely associated with Maxim Gorky. He started working with Gorky in 1905, publishing the novels given to him by the author. He created the Grzhebin Publishing company in 1919, until 1921, when he was given permission to emigrate. He travelled in the same train as Gorky following the latter's unsuccessful bid to save the life of Nikolay Gumilev, shot for his monarchist views. He settled in Berlin at the end of 1921, where he published books under contract to the Soviet government, despite allegations of cheating. In Berlin, he published more than 220 books. However, when a series called Letopis revoluistii included workers by Fyodor Dan, Julius Martov, Viktor Chernov and Nikolai Sukhanov, the Bolsehviks were unhappy as they regards these fellow socialists as counter-revolutionaries. Lenin prohibited the import of Russian books published abroad thus signing the professional death of Grzhebin. A trial ensued in which Grzhebin's right to ask to be paid for the books that he published according to the contract signed with the soviet government was recognised. However the government offered to pay him in unconvertible roubles that were of no use abroad. Gorky signed an agreement in 1928 with the soviet government to publish several books the rights for which were claimed by Grzhebin, who was in desperate need for money. Grzhebin was employed by Vsemirnaya Literature (World Literature), a semi-official literary publishing house established by Maxim Gorky and Anatoly Lunacharsky, Peoples' Commissar for Education on 4 September 1918. Grzhebin owned paintings by Isaac Levitan, Albert Nikolayevitch Benois, Kustodiev, and Boris Grigoriev which were hung on the walls of the offices. He lost all his fortune that was taken back by the soviet government. He died prematurely in February 1929 in Vanves, a suburb of Paris.

Inconsolable with grief, 1204 refuses to take off his spacesuit; an X-ray shows him curled up in a fetal position in the torso. Eventually, medical staff saw his helmet off, but find the suit empty except for a photo of the two friends in their spacesuits. They then look up to see a hole shaped like 1204's body in the ceiling above his bed, and 1204 is shown drifting suitless through space, where the still-suited 1203 grabs him by the arm.

Tread nosing  The horizontal projection to the front of a tread where most foot traffic frequently occurs. The nosing is the protrusion beyond the riser when vertical risers are used, or beyond the back of the tread below, when angled risers or no risers are used. Anti-slip strips or nosings may be applied, these stair parts can be manufactured from a variety of materials including aluminium, vinyl and wood.  Landing nosing  The landing nosing will often travel into the landing area to border the bottom of the balusters. The projection over the landing face will be the same as for the treads in the staircase.  Nosing projection  In timber flights, The nosing traditionally projects forward of the riser, the same distance as the thickness of the tread material. Anti-slip rubber lines and small nose on the edge to broaden the steps  Safety  Stair nosing, especially in commercial and industrial settings, are typically fitted with a non-slip surface to increase traction and prevent injury or even death from slips, trips, and falls. The National Safety Council reports that there are over one million stair-related accidents every year. Installing anti-slip nosing is a proven method of accident prevention.  California Title 24 Compliance Many states have introduced laws and mandates that require new staircase construction to include an abrasive surface or stair tread to minimize the risk of stairway related incidents. One notable instance of this type of building regulation is 'Title 24, Part 2, Section 2-3326(b)' of the California Energy Commission's \\"Building Energy Efficiency Program\\". The regulation contains a detailed set of rules that must be followed when installing new steps in settings like municipal buildings, industrial plants, schools, etc. Perhaps the most recognizable standard in California's Title 24 building code is the need for a slip-resistant tread or nosing that is of contrasting color from the steps. This regulation affects not only future stair installations, but existing stairs as well. The purpose of this is to increase the discernibility of each step to prevent accidents for those who may be visually-impaired.

As a young man he participated in the Hamburg Uprising. He was born and died in Germany, but between 1933 and 1948 he made his life outside Germany, chiefly but by no means exclusively living and working in Paris. Jean Weidt is identified in several sources as a pioneer of expressionist choreography. Life=Hamburg: early years= Hans Weidt was born in Barmbek, at that time a village a short distance outside Hamburg on its east side. He grew up in conditions of poverty with a father described in one source as an \\"alcoholic social democrat\\". In the economic austerity and socio-political turbulence of post-war Germany he left home aged sixteen in order to pursue his passion to become a dancer. He took gardening jobs and for a time worked in the port as a coal trimmer in order to support himself and fund his dance lessons. He studied briefly with Sigurd Leeder in 1921, also taking lessons with Olga Brandt-Knack. Between 1925 and 1928 he performed with his first dance group, appearing at venues that included the Curiohaus and little Kammerspiele Theatre, both in Hamburg, presenting his pieces \\"Aufruf\\" (\\"The Call\\"), \\"Der Arbeiter\\" (\\"The Worker\\") and \\"Tanz mit der roten Fahne\\" (\\"Dancing with the Red Flag\\"). By the end of the decade he had been talent spotted by Olga Brandt- Knack and made his debut at the Hamburg State Opera, in 1928 taking the lead role in \\"Der Gaukler und das Klingelspiel\\" (\\"The Juggler and the Bell Game\\"), and coming to the attention of the youthful theatre impresario Gustaf Gründgens, the writer Klaus Mann and the dancer-choreographer Mary Wigman. In the wake of Germany's military defeat and the subsequent economic collapse, politics in the country had become increasingly polarised: Hans Weidt became an active member of an artistic left-wing movement. He was an active participants in the Hamburg Uprising which erupted in October 1923. He identified himself as a member of the working class and he wanted to dance on working class themes for working class audiences. His dancing was \\"not so much about expressionism or some such aesthetic movement, but a kind of \\"Agitprop art\\" - political propaganda - which still needed to be completely convincing artistically. [Their] purpose was to find an appropriate and contemporary format for content that had previously been denigrated.\\" =Berlin: success and more politics= With his company \\"The Red Dancers\\", in 1929 Weidt moved to Berlin where he took to presenting socio-political dance evenings. The theatre director Erwin Piscator engaged him at the Renaissance-Theater, after which, starting in 1931, he presented pieces at the Wallner Theatre organising a series of productions that included \\"Tai Yang erwacht\\" (\\"Tai Yang awakened\\") by Friedrich Wolf, for which the stage set was designed by the young John Heartfield. Weidt reacted to the growth of Fascism in Germany by joining the Communist Party in 1931. He developed a close co-operation with \\"Truppe 31\\" (\\"Troup 31\\"), a politically engaged group of performance artists around the actor-director Gustav von Wangenheim, and included Ludwig Renn, , John Heartfield and Arthur Pieck. The group promoted socio-critical productions including (but not restricted to) \\"Die Mausefalle\\" (\\"The Mousetrap\\"), \\"Passion eines Menschen\\" (\\"Passion of a People\\") and \\"Die Ehe\\" (\\"The Marriage\\"). Weidt became a leading protagonist of political theatre under what in retrospect has become known as the Weimar Republic, his choreographies dealing with working class topics. He warned early, loudly and frequently about the growth of Fascism in Germany and across Europe, and created the choreography for \\"Potsdam\\" (1932), in which the dancers perform with grotesque masks that symbolise Hitler and de facto accomplices such as Hugenberg, and von Papen. The message was clear. The Nazi Party took power in January 1933 and Hans Weidt was immediately arrested. His training room and apartment in southside Berlin were destroyed together with his dancing masks and sculptures, notably some by Richard Steffens. Weidt himself spent the next few weeks in Charlottenburg Jail where he was mistreated and beaten up. Eventually, however, the theatre director Karlheinz Martin was able to secure his release. =Paris: exile and more balletic success= In May 1933 Hans Weidt escaped to Moscow, from where he moved into Paris which was becoming the informal headquarters of the German Communist Party in exile. In Paris he got to know Jean Gabin, Maurice Chevalier, Pablo Picasso (for whom he on several occasion s sat as a model) and Josephine Baker. Paris now became the focus of his professional life, although he continued to undertake tours that included Prague and Moscow. It was around this time he took to using the French language version of his name, becoming known as \\"Jean Weidt\\". Later in 1933 he founded the \\"Weidt Group\\" ballet company, which performed at Communist party sponsored rallies. Works included \\"Unter den Brücken von Paris\\" (\\"Under the Paris bridges\\"), \\"L’été aux champs\\" (\\"Summer in the fields\\") and \\"Sur la grande route\\" (\\"On the highway\\"). Some of his programme sheets included contributions from Jean Cocteau. From a younger generation, Louis Armstrong had some of his first engagements from Jean Weidt, and toured with the company across Europe between 1933 and 1936. In 1938 Weidt established \\"Ballet 38\\" in Paris, becoming by now one of France's top dancers and choreographers, and heading up what he himself later identified, according to his son Andreas, as the country's \\"Undisputed Number 1\\" of the modern French dance scene. His choreography was responsible for the French cinema success of \\"Der Zauberlehrling\\" (\\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\") produced by the German Max Reichmann. =War= The French and British governments declared war on Germany in September 1939 in response to the implementation of a German-Soviet agreement to partition Poland. It was not immediately clear to the inhabitants of Paris and London what war with Germany would involve, but for Jean Weidt, and for thousands of others who had moved to France or Britain as refugees from political and / or race based persecution in Nazi Germany, the period of waiting was relatively short. Weidt was identified as an enemy alien, facing arrest and internment. He was able to avoid arrest in Paris by escaping to (French) North Africa and ended up in Casablanca, but after the invasion of May 1940 and the installation of a new government in France, Casablanca came under the control of the Vichy government, and Weidt spent several months in a concentration camp in Algeria. Later on, when a new camp commander took over, he was on at least one occasion let out and permitted to dance for soldiers at the Algiers Opera House. Further regime change followed in November 1942 following the Anglo-American military occupation of what was known at the time as French North Africa. Jean Weidt volunteered to join the British army, now taking an active role in the fighting against Nazi Germany in North Africa and, subsequently, in Italy. =Return to Paris= War ended in May 1945 and Weidt was discharged from the British army during the spring of 1946. He immediately returned to Paris, intending to settle there, and established the \\"Ballets des Arts\\". The theatre manager Charles Dullin arranged for him to use a studio at the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre. Coincidentally it was the same studio that the impresario Sergei Diaghilev had made available to Nijinsky back in 1909. By this time he was being supported in his dance activities by Dominique (1930-) and Françoise Dupuy. The Dupuys, respectively a dancer and a choreographer, and his youngest protegees who originally met one another in 1946 at a dance-class held by Jean Weidt, would later continue to present Wendt's choreography well into the twenty-first century. In Paris Weidt built up his company and despite lack of money and frequently dire living conditions, undertook various tours across a shattered continent, including one to occupied Germany and another, in 1947, to Copenhagen. The 1947 tour of Copenhagen, which involved the \\"International choreography concours\\" where Weidt one first prize with a revolutionary piece called \\"La Cellule/Die Zelle\\" (\\"The Cell\\"). Back home in Paris, however, critics were unimpressed by his triumph in Denmark, and Jean Weidt's choreography seemed to have fallen out of fashion since the end of the war. There was a further successful tour of the Netherlands and Belgium, and his reputation remained strong in what remained of Germany, but funding continued to be a challenge. In 1948 he finally relocated to the eastern part of Berlin, since 1945 administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone, where the prospect of relatively generous government financial support for ballet beckoned. =Return to Berlin= Still in 1948, Weidt was appointed to take charge of the newly established \\"Dramatische Ballett\\" at the Berlin Volksbühne (peoples' theatre). There followed assignments in Schwerin, Hamburg and Chemnitz along with the creation in 1954, in collaboration with Hanns Eisler, of the Störtebeker Festival. In 1966 Walter Felsenstein appointed Weidt to a position with the Komische Oper Berlin. At the same time, with 40 young amateur dancers, he created the \\"Young Dancers\\" group, which he headed till his death in 1988. In his extreme old age Jean Weidt developed the \\"Dance Hour\\" series, in which all the top dance companies of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) took part. It was by some criteria Jean Weidt's most successful post-war production. In 1988, the year of his death, Jean Weidt was made an honorary citizen of Rangsdorf, a district of Teltow-Fläming a short distance to the south of Berlin where by this time he lived. Personal Jean Weidst was married to the painter and graphic artist . Through the marriage he acquired as a step son the artist Andreas Weidt.

Lachine was of the diesel-powered version, being equipped with a 9-cylinder diesel engine driving two shafts that produced . This gave the ship a maximum speed of . The vessels carried of oil.

The ships were also fitted with a QF 2-pounder Mark VIII gun aft and were eventually fitted with single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns on the bridge wings.Macpherson (1997), p. 58 For those ships assigned to convoy duty, they were armed with two depth charge launchers and two chutes to deploy the 40 depth charges they carried. Service history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the 1940–41 building programme. Her keel was laid down by Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, Quebec on 27 December 1940, and launched on 20 June 1942.

Huon d'Auvergne has remained largely unedited, with only selected segments appearing in print. Far better known is the Tuscan prose version by Andrea da Barberino, dated to the early fifteenth century. One of the first, if not the first, work to incorporate Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy with direct quotes from Hell, the romance-epic's language has kept it from wide appreciation. The poetic form, language, and narrative content of the four extant witnesses demonstrate how a synoptic, or simultaneous, online edition of the multiple manuscripts can fulfill the need for reliable texts as well as research about the tradition and trajectory of its exemplars. An edition project is underway as of January 2013.http://www.huondauvergne.org  Manuscripts in the Franco-Italian tradition  The only surviving witnesses of the work are four manuscripts: * manuscript P (Padova, Biblioteca del Seminario Vescovile cod. 32), the only version with a lengthy prologue * manuscript Br (Bologna, Biblioteca dell’Archiginnasio B 3489), a short fragment of a few folios, known as the Barbieri fragment * manuscript B (Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett 78 D 8 / codice Hamilton 337), dated 1341 in the colophon, that belonged to the library of the Gonzaga; this the only parchment manuscript (the others are paper) * manuscript T (Torino, Biblioteca Nazionale Universitaria N.III.19), with a similar plot to B The manuscript texts are not all the same; they hold different and independent versions; these are usually divided into three parts: prologue, epilogue and central part.

It is approximately long and flows through Delaware Township. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The stream is impaired by sedimentation/siltation from agriculture and is a relatively small valley stream. Several bridges have been constructed across it. The stream is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Course Dry Run looking downstream Dry Run begins on a low hill in Delaware Township. It flows north-northeast for a few tenths of a mile before reaching the bottom of the hill and gradually turning west-northwest. After more than a mile, the stream receives an unnamed tributary from the right and enters the census-designated place of Dewart. In Dewart, it flows west-northwest for a few tenths of a mile before turning west-southwest for several tenths of a mile and crossing a railroad. The stream then turns south for several tenths of a mile, exiting Dewart and crossing Pennsylvania Route 44/Pennsylvania Route 405 before turning west. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with the West Branch Susquehanna River. Dry Run joins the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Dry Run is designated as an impaired waterbody. The cause of impairment is sedimentation/siltation. The likely source of impairment is agriculture.

The mouth of the stream is located within of Watsontown. A Conrail railroad crosses Dry Run at one point. The area of the stream's watershed at this point is . According to the Warrior Run Pathways Partnership, Dry Run could benefit from improved stream and watershed management practices, including the installation of riparian buffers, installing fencing, management of waste and nutrients, and reforestation. The designated use for the stream is aquatic life. History Dry Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1173546. A concrete tee beam bridge carrying State Route 1005 over Dry Run was built north of Watsontown in 1948 and is long. A concrete channel beam bridge carrying State Route 1003 over the stream was built in 1950 and repaired in 2009. This bridge is and is located north of Watsontown. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 44 across the stream was built north of Watsontown in 1962 and is long. A bridge rehabilitation of the bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 44 over Dry Run has been proposed for a cost of $945,000. In 2015, the Northumberland County Conservation District received a $200,000 Growing Greener grant to install animal fencing and implement streambank stabilization on Dry Run.

It is no longer in operation. History Albert Scholfield (1807–1901) In 1846, Albert Gallatin Scholfield (1807–1901) moved from Connecticut to Providence. He was a proponent of the double-entry bookkeeping system, but found that most merchants in town used the single-entry system. Sensing an opportunity, in June 1846 he opened Scholfield's Commercial College in downtown Providence. It was the first business school in the city. Eventually the double-entry method became the dominant accounting system in town. By 1867, the school boasted twelve faculty and an average daily attendance of 650 students. The school taught both men and women, as well as students \\"young and old.\\" Courses This 1890 advertisement for Scholfield's in the Fall River Daily Evening News promises \\"no classes ... each student is favored with separate instruction.\\" Bookkeeping was the main course of study at Scholfield's. The school promoted itself as teaching a superior and original method, which they called \\"Scholfield's Manuscript System of Book-Keeping.\\" This method dispensed with textbooks, and was simultaneously more thorough and faster to learn than other accounting methods. The school offered \\"special attention\\" to bookkeeping for the Jewellery industry, which was an important industry in Providence at the time. Further, the school boasted that Scholfield's System would \\"render the perpetration of fraud or embezzlement by workmen and employees nearly impossible.\\" A catalog from 1867 lists courses including surveying; civil engineering; navigation; and penmanship. Also offered was a course on \\"Common English Studies\\", which included arithmetic, grammar, geography and other studies. Students could study a basic level of Latin, Greek, French, and German. In 1892 the school offered courses in \\"shorthand, oil and watercolor painting, and mechanical drawing.\\" Women studying bookkeeping were allowed to study with the men in the Bookkeeping Department, while other women could enroll in the Ladies Department, which offered instruction in penmanship, Belles-lettres, drawing, and French. Location The school advertised for students from as far away as New York City, as in this advertisement from the New York Tribune from March 30, 1866.The school was located in the Howard Building, at the corner of Dorrance St. and Westminster St. in downtown Providence. In 1883, the address was given as Paris Hall, 193 Westminster Street. An 1892 listing gives the address as 174 Westminster Street. Although Bryant College occupied the Howard building in 1863, the two schools are not to be confused. Scholfield's was a competitor of Bryant, and by 1882 Bryant was located in the Hoppin Homestead Building down Westminster Street. There have been four Howard Buildings on the site. Twice it burned down. The third building, home of Scholfield's, was built 1857 and demolished in 1957 after Hurricane Carol flooded downtown. The main hall of the Howard building was a huge space, with a capacity to hold 1200 students. It measured 108 feet long by 62 feet wide, and 25 feet high from floor to ceiling; it was illuminated by the light of fourteen windows by day, and fourteen chandeliers by night. The school claimed in 1867 advertisements to be the \\"largest commercial college in the world.\\" Alumni In 1892, Scholfield's boasted of an alumni body which included \\"thousands of successful graduates, scattered all over the United States,\\" including governors, mayors, and \\"men in all responsible positions of life.\\" Some notable people who studied at Scholfield's include: * Henry Fletcher (mayor) (1859–1953), Mayor of Providence 1909-1913 * Albert H.

He lived in Norway from 2000 until being deported in 2014. Der Spiegel reported, in December 2016, that Abdul Rauf applied for political asylum in Germany. Taliban Minister Mohammad first moved from Afghanistan to Pakistan in 1978, where he took education in law with a focus on Islamic law. He claims to have joined the mujahideen in 1985 after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and to have served until 1991. He was reportedly present at the grand meeting in 1996 that elected Mullah Omar leader of the Taliban, after which he himself joined the movement. Mohammad thereafter served as acting Minister of Health intermittently between 1996 and 1999, and claims to have met Osama bin Laden several times during Taliban government meetings. Asylum in Norway Mohammad was granted asylum in Norway with his wife and children in 2000 after claiming his life was in danger to the UNHCR in Pakistan, and he subsequently became a valued informant to the intelligence services. In 2001 he had four additional extended family members, including a brother and sister granted family reunification in Norway after pressure from the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST), despite neither of them fulfilling the criteria for family reunification. He has eight children. Based in Drammen, Mohammad founded a mosque, while he had a job as a bus driver. In 2009 after growing concerns, PST went to action against 25 young Islamists who were part of a circle thought to have planned terror against Norway, and of which Mohammad was thought to have been the imam and mentor. Some of the Islamists were later involved in Profetens Ummah. Mohammad reportedly called for jihad in videos on the internet, and has stated that he is proud to be called an Islamist. The previous year, in 2008 he was sentenced to 120 days in jail for violence and death threats against his own daughter. Mohammad was formally expelled from Norway in 2011 with reference to \\"fundamental national interests\\", and he was secretly arrested and deported from Norway in July 2014. Plaintiff in trial in which supreme court upheld deportation In 2015 Mohammad sued the Norwegian state, demanding to be allowed back in Norway, but lost the case in the Oslo District Court. His family remains in Norway. In 2016 the Supreme Court of Norway upheld previous decisions of deporting Mohammad.http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/taliban-minister-fikk-avslag-pa-a- komme-inn-igjen-i-norge/60244883 Attempt to live in Germany Der Spiegel reported, on December 16, 2016, that, several weeks earlier, Abdul Rauf, and his family, had been intercepted by German border officials, for travelling on forged documents.

SA. It interacts with the human endocannabinoid system. The drug was in development for the treatment of a range of different medical conditions from anxiety disorder to Parkinson's disease, also for the treatment of chronic pain of multiple sclerosis, cancer, hypertension or the treatment of obesity. A clinical trial with this drug was underway in Rennes, France, in January 2016, in which serious adverse events occurred affecting five participants, including the death of one man. The underlying mechanism that caused the acute neurotoxicity of this molecule remains unknown. Structure and action The chemical name of BIA-10-2474 is 3-(1-(cyclohexyl(methyl)carbamoyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl)pyridine 1-oxide. BIA-10-2474 is a long-acting inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) that increases levels of the neurotransmitter anandamide in the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues (that is, the rest of the body other than the brain and spinal cord). In normal tissues, the enzyme FAAH degrades anandamide and other endocannabinoid neurotransmitters, which relieve pain and can affect eating and sleep patterns. FAAH inhibitors have been proposed for a range of nervous system disorders including anxiety disorders, alcoholism, pain and nausea. The Portuguese pharmaceutical company Bial holds several patents on FAAH enzyme inhibitors. The structure and synthesis of BIA 10-2474 is disclosed in a Bial patent as 'compound 362', part of a Bial patent family dating from December 2008. The patent discloses limited details about BIA 10-2474, mainly the screening assay results for each of the several hundred candidate compounds to evaluate the effect on FAAH activity. For compound 362 (that is, BIA 10-2474), an in vitro assay in rat brain showed only modest FAAH inhibition, however, mice given compound 362 at 3 mg/kg orally had less than 2% the normal level of FAAH activity in both brain and liver tissues after 8 hours. Inhibition of other enzymes affected by cannabinoids (monoacylglycerol lipase and liver carboxylesterase) was performed as a screen for biological selectivity for a small number of compounds, but compound 362 was not included. These results appear to be high-throughput screening data only, and no more definitive data are included (such as inhibitory concentration (IC50) or inhibition constant (Ki) values that characterise the potency of the molecule's inhibition of, or binding with, the target). The Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé (ANSM) reported that the compound has a rat IC50 of 1.1-1.7 micromolar, and that this is 200 times the concentration required for inhibition with a different FAAH inhibitor developed by Pfizer (that is, much weaker). As such, the ANSM described the molecule as \\"a compound with a relatively poor specificity for the endocannabinoid FAAH\\". In the same report, the ANSM also noted that the inhibitor is irreversible, not reversible as claimed by the manufacturer Bial. Publication of the chemical structure created considerable interest among chemists, with some sharing online their assessment of likely binding interactions between BIA 10-2474 and in vivo targets. At least one analysis using standard software modelling packages found that although FAAH emerged as the primary target for BIA 10-2474, a number of other proteins rated highly as well. These other targets included histone deacetylases, macrophage- stimulating protein receptor and hormone-sensitive lipase. Although the exact mechanism of action leading to BIA 10-2474 toxicity remains unknown, the final report by the ANSM Committee concluded it was likely one of two possible mechanisms: \\"inhibition of other serine hydrolases, or harmful effects from the imidazole‐pyridine leaving group\\". The report also theorised that this leaving group \\"may produce an isocyanate to which many brain proteins are likely to bind\\". A 2017 research article suggested the off-target activity of BIA 10-2474 may affect lipid metabolism in neurones. Preclinical studies According to a company statement, a project to develop FAAH inhibitors was initiated by Bial in 2005, and studies with this compound began in 2009 with pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and toxicological evaluation. The French medicines regulator (ANSM) released a version of the clinical trial protocol, after the newspaper Le Figaro leaked a (more recent) version. The protocol presents a summary of what appears to be a full package of pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies that might be expected to support a first-in-man study. The manufacturer Bial refused the regulator's request to release the Investigator's brochure and the product dossier (the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier; IMPD), citing French law on trade secrets. An expert committee, established by the French medicines regulator after the trial, requested clarification from Bial of a range of preclinical issues. =Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics= In terms of animal pharmacodynamics, the trial protocol reports that the biological activity of BIA 10-2474 was tested in models of predictive efficacy in treating pain. “BIA 10-2474 produced analgesic/anti-inflammatory activity in the mouse Formalin-Paw and Tail-Flick tests in a time-and dose-dependent manner. BIA 10-2474 also markedly potentiated the antinociceptive effects of exogenous anandamide in the mouse Formalin-Paw and Tail-Flick tests”. In other words, BIA 10-2474 worked as a pain-killer in mice using two different tests (the “analgesic/anti-inflammatory” effect); and, in mice that had been given a dose of the neurotransmitter anandamide, BIA 10-2474 also improved its effects in numbing pain (“antinociceptive” effect). The expert committee of the ANSM took the view that this was insufficient basis for commencing human trials, and that further evidence of BIA 10-2474 as an analgesic was warranted. The Committee's final report noted that in fact the original formalin paw study report presented additional data for the gabapentin comparator which was omitted in the Investigators Brochure. The final ANSM report stated that \\"doses used in these tests differ greatly (from 0.3 to 10 mg/Kg), without it being possible to trace a dose‐effect curve or to estimate an effective dose 50 (which is a surprising shortcoming)\\". In terms of animal pharmacokinetics, in rats and dogs given a radio-labelled dose of BIA 10-2474, the drug was detectable in the blood for up to a day afterwards (oral or i.v.). Oral bioavailability was not reported. Terminal half-life (persistence in the blood) of the BIA 10-2474 in rats was 45 hours (oral) or 4 hours (i.v.) and in dogs it was 104 hours (oral) or 52 hours (i.v.). The authors made no prediction of a likely half-life in humans. Around two-thirds of the total dose was eliminated in the urine, about one-fifth in the faeces and the remainder was heavily metabolized in all species studied (rat, mouse, dog, monkey). Metabolism of BIA 10-2474 was essentially complete by 72 hours. Main metabolites were not described. The studies used total detectable radioactivity to calculate half-life and did not assess what proportion of this was due to metabolites. The preliminary report by the French Inspector General for Social Affairs (IGAS), for the French Ministry of Health, remarked on the difference between the rat oral vs. I.V. half life, and, that in light of the adverse events seen in humans on repeated dosing, this may indicate \\"a mechanism of accumulation\\". Separately, accumulation of BIA 10-2474 given orally in humans was supported by pharmacokinetic data from the trial itself, reviewed by the ANSM expert committee. The molecule showed non-linear pharmacokinetics at doses between 40–100 mg, suggesting elimination pathways had become saturated, leading to accumulation. The final report by the ANSM Committee noted the drug had a very steep dose-effect curve in humans \\"going from absence of to almost complete inhibition\\" over a narrow concentration range. The report also found, based on clinical data from the Rennes trial, that complete inhibition by BIA 10-2474 was very long-acting, and persisted well beyond the point where it was no longer detectable in blood of the trial subjects. =Safety pharmacology and toxicology= The protocol presents a summary of safety pharmacology studies in two species (rat, dog) and repeated dose toxicity studies in four species (13-week sub-chronic studies in mouse, dog and monkey; a 26-week chronic study in the rat). Of note, few adverse events were observed in any of the studies, with the oral No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) varying between 10 mg/kg/day in rats to 75 mg/kg/day in monkeys. The authors suggest that these were the maximum doses tested in these studies, though it is not clear. The authors also report no effects of significance in the animal models used for the CNS safety pharmacology studies, which studied a dose of up to 300 mg/kg/day. The protocol nominates a human NOAEL of 100 mg as a human equivalent dose to the 26-week rat NOAEL, though with no description how this was calculated. The summary presented however includes no assessment of the relevance of the animal species selected for study (that is, in terms of physiological and genetic similarities with humans and the mechanism of action of the study drug). Early reports that the molecule had been studied in chimpanzees turned out to be incorrect. At a hearing convened by the ANSM in March 2016, Bial clarified that the apparently extensive animal toxicology studies (and number of species) was due to a delay in commencement of clinical development, thus some studies had already been completed that would not have been required for a Phase I study. The ANSM Committee found no evidence that the studies had been performed because the company had doubts as to the tolerance of the molecule. Notably absent from the protocol were calculations of receptor occupancy; predictions of in vivo ligand binding saturation levels; measures of target affinity or assessment of non-target binding interactions as suggested by the European guidance for Phase I studies (depending on whether BIA 10-2474 could be considered to require 'special consideration' as outlined in the guideline). On these issues, the French regulator's expert committee pointed out, based on the company's IC50 data, that complete FAAH inhibition should have been achieved with a dose of 1.25 mg in humans. In fact, the trial tested doses up to 80 times more (100 mg BIA 10-2474) than should have been required. The ANSM committee also requested data on non-target enzyme affinity from the manufacturer Bial. Although the protocol summary reports no animal deaths during the studies, the ANSM expert committee reported that in fact several monkeys died or had to be euthanised during the dose escalation studies and that an explanation from Bial was pending. Also, two animals had to be euthanised in the 13-week dog study due to lung lesions - both from the top dose group. None of these animal deaths were described in the trial protocol. It is not clear whether Bial disclosed these adverse animal findings either to Biotrial or to the ANSM in their application for clinical trial authorisation. The findings presented in the trial protocol provide no explanation for the type and severity of events that would be later observed in Rennes. The preliminary report from the IGAS investigation, released by the French Minister for Health in February 2016, found there was no legal requirement in France for the trial sponsor to disclose all pre-clinical data to the ANSM. The Minister described this as an opportunity for improvement. Nevertheless, the IGAS report commented that the investigation thus far had not found any reason to fault the ANSM's authorisation of the trial based on the preclinical data. The final report by the ANSM Committee concluded regarding the preclinical studies that \\"no aspects of the data that the TSSC has studied constituted a signal likely to contraindicate administration in humans.\\" The report went on however to criticise Bial's Investigator's Brochure: \\"the brochure contains many mistakes, inaccuracies, figure inversions or incorrect translation of source documents, making understanding difficult in several aspects. This is highly surprising given the regulatory importance of this document.\\" Phase I clinical trial=Overview= In 2015 Biotrial, a contract research organization, initiated a first-in-human trial of BIA 10-2474 in healthy volunteers, with secondary endpoints to investigate neuropathic pain. The study was approved by the French regulatory authority, the ANSM, on 26 June 2015, and by the Brest regional ethics committee on 3 July 2015. The trial protocol was leaked by Le Figaro before a different version was released by ANSM. The manufacturer Bial refused the regulator's request to release the Investigator's brochure and the product dossier (Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier), citing French law on trade secrets. =Trial details= The study was entitled \\"A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, combined single and multiple ascending dose study including food interaction, to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of BIA 10-2474, in healthy volunteers\\". The trial commenced on 9 July 2015 at a single centre in the city of Rennes, and commenced recruitment of 128 healthy volunteers, both men and women aged 18 to 55. Participants of the study were to receive €1,900 and, in turn, asked to stay at Biotrial's facility for two weeks during which time they would take the drug for ten days and undergo tests. The study drug was presented as capsules in three different strengths (0.25, 2.5 and 10 mg). The protocol describes four distinct parts to the study: * a single dose ascending part * a cross-over part to evaluate fed vs. fasting conditions (could be either single or multiple dose) * a multiple dose ascending part * a pharmacodynamics part to evaluate the effect of BIA 10-2474 vs placebo with different challenge agents The protocol specifies the first three parts would be double-blind but the pharmacodynamics part would be open label. According to the protocol, dose levels and numbers of groups could be increased, or were not yet defined, and would depend on what was observed with initial dosing, (an approach known as adaptive trial design). Thus many details of the key multi-dose part are not included in the trial protocol. The absence of these details was criticised by scientists and in the media, before the ANSM published further details of the dosing. The Royal Statistical Society was particularly critical, stating that it had \\"clear statistical reservations about the trial's study design\\", and that the protocol lacked features such as a risk assessment, recommended in the wake of the TGN1412 incident to prevent severe adverse events occurring in these circumstances. =Starting dose and subsequent doses= For the single dose part of the study, the protocol describes eight groups of eight volunteers (3:1 randomised) who were to receive single doses of BIA 10-2474 at 0.25, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, 40 and 100 mg, with the possibility of additional groups to be added if no maximum tolerated dose was reached. In describing the rationale for the starting dose, the authors of the protocol conclude that: No target organ was identified during toxicology studies and few adverse clinical findings were observed at the highest dose tested. For the single ascending dose part [of the clinical trial], a starting dose of 0.25 mg was judged to be safe for a first-in-human administration. The protocol provides for the first two subjects of the first single dose cohort to receive the first dose as a sentinel dose, that is, either 0.25 mg BIA 10-2474 or a placebo on the first day, then wait for 24h before treating the other 5:1 subjects. In the event no safety concerns had emerged in the foregoing, all other single- and multi-dose groups were to be dosed with a 10-minute interval between recipients. For the multiple ascending dose part of the study, the protocol planned four groups of eight volunteers (3:1 randomised) who were to receive a single dose orally, once daily for 10 days at different dose levels. However, the protocol defines no doses for these groups, stating that this will be based on the outcome of the single dose portion of the trial. Further dose groups up to a maximum of eight groups could be added depending on whether adverse events were observed. The authors note that nonetheless, the starting dose will not exceed 33% of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) identified in the single dose groups (or 33% of the maximum administered dose if the MTD is not reached). Further details of the study as it was actually conducted have been published by the French agency (ANSM). The dose groups for the single dose part were as described in the protocol, with no additional groups undertaken. In the crossover part, a single 40 mg dose was given to a group of 12 subjects. In the multiple dose ascending part, the doses were 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20 and 50 mg BIA 10-2474, each to be given once per day for 10 days to groups of 8 volunteers (3:1 randomised). The severe adverse events were observed in the 50 mg dose group. The ANSM expert committee reported that complete FAAH inhibition should have been achieved by a dose of 1.25 mg remarking that: It appears unjustified to plan to test a dose (100 mg) 80 times higher than that presumed to induce complete and prolonged FAAH inhibition. Further, the ANSM committee remarked that the gap between the 20 mg and 50 mg dose cohorts, in effect, skipped a dose based on extrapolation from the single dose part of the study, and that the progression to 50 mg was too large a jump. On reviewing the subject data from the trial itself, the committee noted that BIA 10-2474 showed non-linear pharmacokinetics at doses between 40–100 mg (that is, the molecule appeared to be accumulating at higher doses) and that most likely the elimination mechanism had become saturated. Thus dosing at 50 mg daily was - each day - 40 times more than required to achieve complete inhibition, and in practice this dose level resulted in accumulation. =Trial status at the time of serious adverse events= According to Bial and the Rennes University Hospital, by the time the serious adverse reactions emerged, 116 subjects had been recruited and 84 other volunteers had received the drug during the trial, with no serious adverse events being reported. The single dose part (up to 100 mg BIA 10-2474), the fed vs. fasting part, and the first four dose groups of the multi-dose part of the study had each been completed in 2015. Notably, the administration of 20 mg BIA 10-2474 once daily for 10 consecutive days elicited no serious adverse events in the six volunteers who received it. Dosing of eight volunteers in the highest multi-dose group in the BIA 10-2474 trial commenced on 6 January 2016. Six of the participants received 50 mg per day of the drug while two received placebo. The first subject became ill on the evening of the 5th day of dosing (10 January). On the following day, the other subjects received a 6th dose at 8:00am before the trial was suspended later that day (11 January). Death and serious adverse events The fifth dose level (50 mg per day for 10 days) of the multi-dose part of study had been underway for five days when the first volunteer became ill and was hospitalized at the Rennes University Hospital on the evening of 10 January 2016 with symptoms similar to a stroke. The following day, the man lapsed into a coma and was shortly thereafter declared brain dead. According to the hospital, the man died at midday on 17 January 2016. Four of the other five men in the same dosage group were also hospitalized between 10–13 January suffering injuries similar to the man who died, including deep haemorrhagic and necrotic lesions seen on brain MRI. All the MRI findings, though widely varying in severity, were of the same form and seen in the hippocampus and pons of the affected individuals. Biotrial stopped the study on 11 January and both the ANSM and regional ethics committee were notified on 14 January. The men who were hospitalised were all from the group which received the highest dose of the multiple ascending part of the trial. A neurologist at the University of Rennes Hospital Center, Professor Pierre-Gilles Edan, stated in a press conference with the French Minister for Health, that 3 of the 4 men who were displaying neurological symptoms \\"already have a severe enough clinical picture to fear that even in the best situation there will be an irreversible handicap\\" and were being given corticosteroids to control the inflammation. The sixth man from the group was not showing adverse effects but was hospitalized on 15 January 2016 for observation. Other study volunteers who had received doses with no ill effects were asked to return for further testing. The man who died was later named by local news media as Guillaume Molinet, 49, an artist and father of four from Guilliers, a town in the Breton department of Morbihan. According to the man's brother Laurent Molinet, Mr Molinet was recruited as a stand-by and went to Rennes not expecting to be dosed, only being given BIA 10-2474 because another volunteer dropped out. Molinet's family said they were originally told he had suffered a stroke that was unrelated to the clinical trial, though this quickly turned out not to be the case. Molinet's family objected that key information was hidden by Bial/Biotrial and is reported to have launched a manslaughter lawsuit. Reaction and investigations The events in Rennes were made public on 15 January 2016 and were reported widely in the media in France, internationally in mainstream news and scientific media. All these reports drew comparisons between this incident and the TGN1412 trial at Northwick Park, London in which six volunteers suffered life-threatening drug reactions during a Phase I study in 2006. The journal Nature quoted Bial spokeswoman Susana Vasconcelos as saying the trial had been conducted \\"in accordance with all the good international practices guidelines, with the completion of tests and preclinical trials\\" and that \\"the company is committed to determine thoroughly and exhaustively the causes which are at the origin of this situation”. Nature 529, 263–264 (21 January 2016) doi:10.1038/nature.2016.19189 Bial also denounced the unauthorised release of the trial protocol and was critical of the wide-ranging speculation by scientists and the media about the possible cause of the incident. In July 2016, Bial's Executive Director António Portela confirmed his company's decision to permanently abandon development of the molecule. The journal also sought comment from Jean-Marc Gandon, the president and chief executive of the CRO Biotrial, who said \\"he cannot immediately respond to queries from Nature, that he is focused on trying to save the patients and that the company will respond later\\". Biotrial stated its position that \\"The trial was conducted in full compliance with the international regulations and Biotrial’s procedures, in particular the emergency procedures\\". As of March 2016 it remained unclear whether Bial disclosed the adverse animal findings to Biotrial, including the deaths of monkeys and dogs in several studies. François Peaucelle, the director general of Biotrial, is reported to have told Le Figaro. “We received a 15-page summary of the tests that was based on data that would have filled a lorry. From that data, there was nothing worrying in view of the dosage we were administering to humans.” =French authorities= The Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament (ANSM) announced an investigation, and that an inspection of the trial site was already underway. and formation of a specialist committee of pharmacologists, toxicologists and neurologists to review all existing data on FAAH inhibitor drugs. The French health minister Marisol Touraine, who visited the trial site in Rennes and spoke with the victims' families, called the events “an accident of exceptional gravity\\" and promised to investigate the matter via the Inspector General for Social Affairs (IGAS), with a final report due end of March. A judicial investigation was also initiated after the Office of the Chief Prosecutor for Paris announced it would look into potential charges of involuntary injury through its public health enforcement section, seeking assistance from the Gendarmerie in Rennes and the Ministry of Justice's Office for the Environment and Public Health. The ONIAM (Office National d’Indemnisation des Accidents Médicaux), responsible for medical injury compensation, stated only 10 accidents had occurred during clinical trials over the past 15 years per its records, and that those cases had “consequences infinitely less serious” than the incident in Rennes. Initial reports from the authorities suggested that the causes of the brain injuries was likely to be due to the mechanism of BIA 10-2474 and the doses employed in the trial. ANSM Director General Dominique Martin said \\"It is clearly the molecule that is the cause”, following the publication of the ANSM expert committee's initial findings on 7 March 2016. In May 2016, the French Health Minister announced several new measures for clinical trials in France, including the establishment of an expert group within the ANSM for review of first in human and early phase studies. Inspection générale des affaires sociales reports The Inspection générale des affaires sociales (IGAS) released a preliminary report on 5 February 2016. The French Minister of Health indicated that the cause of the death of one of the subjects had not been identified; it claimed Biotrial failed three major issues: The study should have been stopped when the first subject was hospitalized so the drug would not have been given to five others; the incident should have been reported immediately, namely January 10, not four days later; all other subjects should have been notified right away asking them if they would like to continue in the study. The Health Minister noted further that a number of the trial protocol provisions had been too vague and not precise enough; that the eligibility criteria should have been more explicit regarding substance use habits of the volunteers and that there was no legal requirement for the sponsor to disclose all pre-clinical data to the ANSM. The Minister announced that all clinical trials in France in the event of a serious, unexpected adverse event such as this would be explicitly required to re-consent the remaining trial participants. The Comité de Protection des Personnes (CPP) in Brest, a research ethics committee, has asked Bial for the exclusion criteria on the consuming cannabis and other psychoactive substances. Biotrial published a detailed response on its website, expressing its disappointment to learn of the report via the media and not prior to its publication from the Health Ministry. It stated the trial was halted as soon as it became apparent that the first volunteer had a serious adverse event, and that the man's initial symptoms on 10 January had been mild enough that he was expected to return to the trial facility on 11 January which is why it did not re-consent all volunteers. CHU informed Biotrial at 10:00 am on 11 January that the man had likely had a stroke, at which point the trial was halted, though it was not known whether the stroke had anything to do with the study drug. This was after further doses had been given to the other volunteers (at 8:00 am that morning). Biotrial's statement offered no comment on the time taken between the trial halt at 10:00 am on the 11th and the notification of the authorities three days later on the 14th. ANSM Comité Scientifique Spécialisé Temporaire The final report from the ANSM Committee appointed to investigate the matter concluded in April 2016 that: [T]he most likely hypothesis to date is that of toxicity specific to the molecule via its binding to other brain cell structures, facilitated by (1) its low specificity for its target enzyme; (2) use of multiple doses a lot higher than those leading (at least in humans) to complete and lasting FAAH inhibition, and; (3) its probable gradual accumulation in the brain, undoubtedly related to the specific pharmacokinetic features of BIA 10‐2474. The Committee also criticised the clinical study design which \\"probably significantly contributed to the accident\\", noting that administration of the top multi-dose groups did not and could not take into account emerging pharmacokinetic data from latest dose groups and offered no chance to adjust the dose as adverse events emerged. The choice of dose escalation levels (20 to 50 to 100 mg) was based on pharmacokinetic data from the 10 mg group and data from the 50 mg dose group (that would have clearly shown non-proportional dose kinetics) were not yet available when administration to the 100 mg multi-dose group commenced. The Committee made six recommendations, which it invited European and International regulators to consider (reproduced here in brief): *Justification and demonstration of pharmacological activity predictive of efficacy in humans cannot be considered to be secondary. [P]harmacology studies [should be sufficient] to establish a dose‐effect curve (where appropriate) [and] to be reasonably predictive of real‐life, future therapeutic efficacy. *A neuropsychological assessment with clinical interview and cognitive tests should be a compulsory part of assessment during volunteer screening, inclusion and clinical monitoring in a Phase 1 trial for drugs with \\"central nervous system\\" tropism. *All first‐in‐human and Phase 1 protocols should, unless unnecessary, provide for the doses to be tested in volunteers to be adjusted according to the data collected in volunteers already having been exposed during the trial. *During first‐in‐human and Phase 1 trials, volunteer safety should take precedence over any practical, economic or regulatory considerations. *Dose escalation strategies in first‐in‐human and Phase 1 trials should take account of considerations based on common clinical and pharmacological sense. *The Committee would like to see a debate opened at European and international level, on access to data from ongoing or previous first‐in‐human and Phase 1 trials. =Agencies outside France= A European Medicines Agency (EMA) spokesperson said in January 2016 that \\"EU authorities will look carefully at the findings to determine if further measures are needed to protect health of clinical trial participants. Until EU authorities have the full picture, it is not possible to say whether any revisions to EU guidelines are required\\". Later, in July 2016, the agency proposed to revise its key first-in-human clinical trial guideline, the last significant revision having been published in response to the 2006 TGN1412 clinical trial that had had similarly dire effects in its trial volunteers. The EMA stated the proposal aimed to address risks posed by complex trials, such as the one undertaken in Rennes, having 'several steps of clinical development within a single clinical trial protocol'. The European Investment Bank, which provided 110 million euros in funding for Bial's FAAH inhibitor programme stated it had been in contact with the company about the incident, but that \\"it would be premature to consider recall of the EIB loan at this stage\\". The US Food and Drug Administration issued a statement that it was in contact with its counterparts the ANSM as well as the EMA and announced investigations into FAAH inhibitors as a drug class.\\"FDA is in the process of collecting and reviewing safety information pertinent to FAAH inhibitors under investigation in the US. FDA will work with sponsors to ensure the safety of participants in clinical studies and take regulatory action as appropriate.\\" Later, in August 2016, the Agency issued a further statement: \\"The Agency has found, based on the available information, that BIA 10-2474 exhibits a unique toxicity that does not extend to other drugs in the class, called fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors.\\" The German drug regulator, the Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM) issued a statement 19 January that no clinical trials with FAAH inhibitors were underway in Germany, but that it had authorised seven such trials previously, which were completed without serious incidents. Outcome for trial participants The Rennes University Hospital provided updates on the remaining volunteers in the study and the treating specialists later published a medical report describing the sickened volunteers in November 2016 in The New England Journal of Medicine. The published medical report described the adverse events as \\"An acute and rapidly progressive neurologic syndrome [of which] the main clinical features were headache, a cerebellar syndrome, memory impairment, and altered consciousness\\". The authors were of the view that \\"the toxic effects we observed were related to drug accumulation. This hypothesis is supported by the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of BIA 10-2474 for doses higher than 40 to 100 mg\\" and as reported by the ANSM's expert committee. The authors were not however granted access to information from the post-mortem of the man who died. Of the five survivors from the top dose group and the other trial participants: * Two of the top dose group survivors with serious neurological injuries were discharged to care facilities closer to their homes on 18 January 2016, and a third on the 20th. As of 26 January, one of these men was being treated as an outpatient; one was suffering an intercurrent illness and had not yet been discharged, and a third had improved enough to go home. The last of the patients had improved enough to be discharged to home 21 January 2016. All five survivors were due to have a follow-up evaluation at the hospital in Rennes at the end of February 2016. *The hospital contacted the other 84 volunteers who received BIA 10-2474 and found no clinical or radiological abnormalities on re-examination of 75 of the volunteers in January 2016. An ANSM investigation into these 84 volunteers looked for evidence of brain abnormalities on MRI and any report of neurological symptoms experienced during or after the trial. The ANSM report, published in November 2016, concluded that the findings reported in these individuals were consistent with the typical incidence in the wider population and were not similar in characteristics to those seen in the top dose group. * The participant from the top dose group who was hospitalised for observation did not develop any symptoms, nor any findings by MRI, and returned home on 18 January 2016. The individual had remained asymptomatic as of November 2016. *According to the published medical report, at least two of the top dose group survivors continued to suffer effects as of November 2016 - \\"residual memory impairment\\" in one case, and \\"a residual cerebellar syndrome\\" in another. In December 2016, a Bial representative at a British Pharmacological Society conference in London confirmed that the four symptomatic survivors who received the top dose were continuing to suffer neurological side-effects. News reports from March 2016 described the condition of Stéphane Schubhan (42), a professional photographer from La Flèche, Sarthe and participant of the top dose cohort. Mr. Schubhan \\"sleeps badly, has nightmares, sees double at all times, walks with difficulty, and succumbs to dizziness and nausea if he stands more than 10 minutes at a time\\" and does not know if he will be able to work again. Mr. Schubhan said he had participated in a previous clinical trial, but in this case he was never informed about the animal deaths that were later revealed and would never have consented to take part had he known. Doctors have told Schubhan that they hope he will improve over the coming 6–12 months but that they do not know what the outcome will be. Under French Law, all clinical trial participants are protected by the 1988 Huriet Law on the protection of persons in clinical research. The BIA 10-2474 trial participants are therefore entitled to financial compensation as well as recourse to civil and criminal proceedings. The family of Guillaume Molinet commenced manslaughter proceedings in late January 2016. Implications for other FAAH inhibitors Other pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, and Vernalis, have previously taken other FAAH inhibitors into clinical trials without experiencing such adverse events (e.g., respectively, MK-4409, PF-04457845, JNJ-42165279, SSR411298, and V158866. Related enzyme inhibitor compounds such as URB-597 and LY-2183240 have been sold illicitly as designer drugs. Following the events in Rennes, Janssen announced that it was temporarily suspending dosing in two Phase II clinical trials with its own FAAH inhibitor, JNJ-42165279, headlining the decision as \\"precautionary measure follows safety issue with different drug in class\\". Janssen was emphatic that no serious adverse events had been reported in any of the clinical trials with JNJ-42165279 to date. Janssen did not state whether the suspension, though voluntary, was at the request of the FDA. The suspension was to remain in effect until more information is available about the BIA 10-2474 study. Pfizer had previously been developing an FAAH inhibitor PF-04457845 for indications including osteoarthritis pain and trauma. A spokesperson commented after the events in Rennes that \\"we [Pfizer] did explore the potential of a FAAH-inhibitor for osteoarthritic pain in Phase 2 trials, however, no significant efficacy was observed. The FAAH-inhibitor was recently being evaluated in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder but this trial was discontinued in 2015 for business reasons. We do not have any active trials in this area\\". Sanofi also had been developing an FAAH inhibitor candidate SSR411298 for the treatment of depression. However, a spokesperson stated in January 2016 that \\"we have no projects in development that target this enzyme\\".

He was appointed as Head of the Corps of Special Inspectors of the Presidency and Coordinator of the National Film School of Venezuela by his father. He was also elected by the PSUV party congress in 2014 to be the delegate of El Valle Capital District. Early life and education Maduro Guerra was born in Venezuela on 21 June 1990. He is the son of his father's first marriage with Adriana Guerra Angulo. As a child, he was interested in arts and between 1998 and 2004, he was a flautist in Venezuela's El Sistema program. Though Maduro Guerra sought a career in music, he placed 77 of 235 on a waiting list for the National Experimental University of the Arts and decided to abandon the idea. His high school scores were \\"not extraordinary\\", he scored 42.368% in reading classes and 64.461% in mathematics, graduating from Liceo Urbaneja Achelpohl School. Maduro Guerra attended the National Experimental University of the Armed Forces where he specialized in economics. In 2011, he began working for the Public Ministry of Venezuela until his condition became unknown among the organization in 2014. Political career Maduro Guerra's political career began shortly after his father became President of Venezuela. On 23 September 2013, he was appointed by his father as Head of the Corps of Special Inspectors of the Presidency, an organization designated to observe the effects of policies implemented by the President of Venezuela. On his 24th birthday on 21 June 2014, his father again appointed him as Coordinator of the National Film School of Venezuela. Prior to his appointments, Maduro Guerra had little experience as a politician and no experience in cinema. On 21 July 2014, the PSUV held a party congress and voted for Maduro Guerra to be a delegate for the El Valle Capital District. =Constituent Assembly= Maduro Guerra as a member of the 2017 Constituent Assembly of Venezuela beside Carmen Meléndez. Following the 2017 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election, Maduro Guerra was elected into the 2017 Constituent Assembly of Venezuela. On 11 August 2017, US President Donald Trump said that he is \\"not going to rule out a military option\\" to confront the government of Nicolás Maduro and the deepening crisis in Venezuela. Maduro Guerra responded, stating during the 5th Constituent Assembly of Venezuela session that if the United States were to attack Venezuela, \\"the rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump, we would arrive and take the White House\\". Controversy=Nepotism= His father President Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were accused of nepotism for allegedly placing family members in positions throughout the Venezuelan government.Clan Flores fuera de la AN \\"Es falso que tenga muchos familiares en la Asamblea\\" 30 May 2008. His appointments as Head of the Corps of Special Inspectors of the Presidency and Coordinator of the National Film School were criticized as examples of his family's acts of alleged nepotism. On 25 January 2017, President Maduro again named his son as the director of a newly established position, the Director General of Presidential Delegations and Instructions of the Vice President, raising more allegations of nepotism. =Jose Zalt wedding incident= At the wedding of Jose Zalt, a Syrian- Venezuelan businessman that owns the clothing brand Wintex, on 14 March 2015, Maduro Guerra was showered with American dollars at the gathering in the luxurious Gran Melia Hotel in Caracas. The incident caused outrage among Venezuelans who believed this to be hypocritical of President Maduro, especially since many Venezuelans were experiencing hardships due to the poor state of the economy and due to the president's public denouncements of capitalism. During a PSUV National Congress, Maduro Guerra responded to the incident, calling it \\"gossip\\". = Photograph incident = During a first communion party in the Creole Club of Maracaibo, a woman named Rita Morales took photographs of Maduro Guerra with her cellphone. According to witnesses, Maduro arrived at the party surrounded by bodyguards and far from the rest of the guests. The bodyguards tried to take the cellphone away from Morales and force her to delete the pictures after realizing that Maduro was photographed. Morales refused and left the party; days after the incident, she was visited by officers that, according to witnesses, broke her cellphone. On 8 June 2017, officers of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) detained Morales and her husband when they were about to aboard a private flight to Aruba in the La Chinita International Airport. Morales was taken to the SEBIN headquarters in El Helicoide. = Sanctions = The United States sanctioned Maduro Guerra on 28 June 2019 for being a current or former official of the Government of Venezuela, as well as being a member of Venezuela's Constituent Assembly.

It is now occupied by the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives. In June 1944, 20 Canadian soldiers were illegally executed at the abbey by members of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend. The event has become known as the Ardenne Abbey massacre.  History = Founding in the 12th century = According to legend, in 1121, a bourgeois from Caen named Ayulphe du Marché (Latinized as Ayulfus de Foro) and his wife Asseline, who were pious and practiced charity, had a vision of the Virgin Mary ordering them to build a chapel in that place. They acquired seven acres of the plot named \\"Saxons' wells\\" and erected a priory, which was headed by Canon Gilbert from Picardy. In 1138, the Romanesque church which had succeeded the original chapel, was consecrated by the Bishop of Bayeux, Richard III of Kent. In 1144, the priory was attached to La Lucerne Abbey, which brought it into the order of Saint Norbert. It became an independent abbey in 1160. Abbot Robert received a donation of a rock quarry in Bretteville-sur-Odon, an important indication of a construction campaign in the 12th century. = Middle Ages = The Ardenne Abbey expanded rapidly, and its heritage became very important. * Priory of Saint Vincent de Lebisey (Hérouville Saint-Clair) in 1291. * Priory of the Hermitage (Saint- Martin-des-Besaces) in the late 12th century. * Priory of St. Thomas (Lion- sur-Mer) in 1328. * The priests of twelve parishes in Calvados and Orne were appointed by Ardenne. On February 23, 1230, the choir of the Abbey collapsed and killed 26 canons, among them the third abbot, Nicolas. This disaster would have a significant impact on the abbey's design. = 15th century = The abbey was affected by the Hundred Years' War. On December 14, 1417, during the siege of Caen, the canons had to take refuge in that city to escape the looting of the abbey. On June 5, 1450, the abbey was occupied during the siege of Caen by Charles VII of France, who only left it after the surrender of the English garrison on July 5. After the war ended, Abbot Robert Chartier began to rebuild the cloister and a conventual building. = 16th century = During the early 16th century the abbey was held in commendam and began to decline. During the Wars of Religion the canons twice had to seek refuge in Caen. In 1562 the abbey was sacked and many buildings were abandoned. The abbey remained in a state of ruin for many years, only occupied by two or three canons at a time. The abbey gradually rebuilt and by 1587 there were eight canons, four novices and their master. The rebuilding was overseen by Prior Jean de la Croix, who came from the Belle-Étoile Abbey in 1596. He restored the abbey and remained the spiritual head of the Abbey for nearly 58 years, following the visit of Servais de Lairuelz, the vicar general of the Premonstratensians. = 17th century = The restoration continued into the 17th century following a concordat in 1602 between the prior and the new commendator, Pierre de Villemor, despite hesitations regarding the financial side of the restoration. In 1609 the church was consecrated. By 1639 a dormitory, library and a new altar were built. It is thought that under the leadership of John of the Cross that the Gothic cloisters were closed. On November 12, 1627, the prior, in conflict with his abbot Guillaume Galodé, adopted most of the reforming statutes of Pont-à-Mousson. The abbey only adhered to the Congregation of Lorraine only after obtaining guarantees on regionalisation, as Lorriane was not a part of the Kingdom of France. John of the Cross convinced other abbeys to adhere to this reform, despite strong opposition, and Ardenne became one of the most influential abbeys in Normandy. John of the Cross died on January 4, 1654, and a manuscript says that he was buried beneath the sanctuary towards the east of the complex. After his death, more building works were completed, including the Saint-Norbert gate, giving access to the complex from the north in 1672. In 1686 the ruined vaults of the abbey were replaced by frames of wooden ogives, the gallery running along the cloister was restored in 1689 and two chapels were built against the northern wall of the church. = 18th century = The press was restored and, on the north side, a new abbey house was built after 1711 outside the complex for the commendatory abbot. In 1766, the eastern gallery of the cloister was rebuilt and the old chapter house was demolished. During the French Revolution the canons were expelled and the abbey was sold as a national property on 1 May 1791 to a Parisian named Chauffrey. In 1795, three successive sales dispersed the furniture and numerous paintings. In 1799 the abbey was acquired by Englishman William Russell, who lived there until 1814. He made the church, for a time, a Protestant church. = 19th century = The high altar with its two panel paintings representing Saint Norbert and Saint Augustine was transferred in 1812 to the Church of Saint John of Caen. Beginning in 1814, the abbey and its land was divided up between different owner, being occupied by three separate farms. By 1830, the cloister as well as most of the abbey house had been demolished. Arcisse de Caumont witnessed further destruction of the site due to the removal of stone for new constructions, including the agricultural building built by the new owners. = 20th century = In 1918 a large part of the old abbey (church, north door, perimeter wall, barn and west gate) were classified as a monument historique with the remainder of the Abbey classified in 1947. During World War II one of the owners, Roland Vico, was a member of the resistance. The buildings were used to store weapons until its occupation by German soldiers who used the towers of the abbey to observe the surroundings.  Ardenne Abbey Massacre  In June 1944, 20 Canadian soldiers were massacred in a garden at the abbey by members of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend over the course of several days and weeks. During the course of the Normandy Campaign an estimated \\"156 Canadian prisoners of war are believed to have been executed by the 12th SS Panzer Division (the Hitler Youth) in the days and weeks following the D-Day landings.

Fernando Muñoz Altea was the King of Arms of the Royal House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. He was a Spanish/Mexican historian, specialised in the study of the aristocratic European colonial families of the Americas. Muñoz Altea was born in Madrid (Spain) on November 22, 1925. He died in Mexico City on March 2, 2018. Don Fernando Muñoz Altea was considered the \\"Dean of the Kings of Arms\\", since due to his seniority in the trade, he was one of the very few and genuine Kings of Arms left in the world today. The extraordinary quality of his genealogical certifications and of his heraldic designs, which he carried out personally, is internationally renowned. King of Arms  Seal of the King of Arms of the Royal House of Bourbon-Two SiciliesMuñoz Altea was introduced to the study of heraldry, genealogy and nobility by Don José de Rújula y Ochotorena, Marqués de Ciadoncha, Dean of the Corps of Chronicler King of Arms (Cuerpo de Cronista Rey de Armas), and by Don Julio de Atienza y Navajas, Barón de Cobos de Belchite, author of the well- known work “Nobiliario Español”. Both became his mentors and friends. On 10 November 1962 Muñoz Altea was first appointed King of Arms of the Royal House by Prince Ranieri, Duke of Castro, Head of the French Branch of the Royal House. The Former Kingdom of Sicily did not have actual heralds (to grant coats of arms and issue certificates of nobility) in recent times, but rather a Commission for Titles of Nobility based in Naples until 1861. This commission concerned itself with the administration of certain nobiliary institutions, recognition of titles of nobility and heraldry. The appointment of the King of Arms by the Prince Ranieri, Duke of Castro continues this tradition. Certifications of arms and certificates of nobility issued by Muñoz Altea's office in the name of the Royal House are, in effect, documents of a dynastic nature. Muñoz Altea was King of Arms of Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, not of Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria.

Early life and education Simaika was born in Cairo on 28 February 1864 to one of the oldest Coptic families of Cairene notables. The Simaikas prospered in the service of state and church; many served as magistrates. Simaika started his education at St. Mark’s Coptic Patriarchal school in Cairo. As was custom at the time, he was chosen by his father to become a priest, as at least one son of the leading Coptic families was destined to priesthood. As a result, his father forbade him to learn English fearing it would detract him from his ecclesiastical studies. Simaika went on a hunger strike until his father gave in and allowed him to study English. At school he studied the Bible and learned Arabic, Coptic, Greek, and English. He then transferred to Frères des écoles chrétiennes to learn French and graduated in 1882.Marcus Simaika. Reminiscences. The unpublished memoires of Marcus SimaikaSamir Mahfouz Simaika. Markus Pasha Simaika founder of the Coptic museum. His life and times. Farid Atiya Press 2011. Early career Upon graduation, Simaika joined the Engineering Department of the Egyptian State Railways as a translator then as an accountant, and in 1888 was promoted to Chief of Contracts and Purchases. In 1890, he became Secretary to the Chairman of the Board. Eight years later he was promoted to Director of the Commercial Department and in 1901 Director General of Accounts and Audit. He reorganized the accounts system of the railways, telegraphs and port of Alexandria, rooting out deep-seated endemic corruption and inefficiency. He became the only Egyptian to reach such high rank. In 1904, after the Fashoda incident and the Entente Cordiale, the French handed over the administration of the Egyptian government to the British who decided that all important departments would be headed by British officials. Simaika was asked to stay on for another two years to help his replacement, then allowed to retire on an exceptional pension with the addition of eight years to his period of service. Political career Simaika was appointed a permanent Member of the Legislative Council of the Khedivate of Egypt from 1907 to 1911 and was the reporter of the Finance and Budget Committee. He was then re-appointed to the Council from 1912 to 1922. He became a Member of the Superior Educational Council from 1907 to 1922. He joined the Comite de Conservation des Monuments Arabes et Coptes first as a Member then as President of its Permanent Committee in 1905 and 1929, respectively. He worked tirelessly on the until his death in 1944. He was proposed to be the Coptic minister of the cabinet of Muhammad Said Pasha in 1910. During his membership of the Legislative Council, Simaika succeeded in introducing religious instruction for non-Muslim pupils in all government schools. He also succeeded in obtaining grants to all private schools for boys and girls subject to inspection by the Ministry of Education. Coptic Church leadership Simiaika was first elected to the General Congregation Council (Maglis Milli) in 1885 at the age of 25 and elected Vice-President of the Maglis from 1908 to 1928. During this time he had a difficult relationship with the Pope Cyril V. Simaika allied himself with the Maglis reformists in their demand that the Maglis should have more say in the administration of Coptic schools and awqafs (religious endowments) as well as the personal state laws on divorce and inheritance. It became a show of strength between the Maglis and the Coptic Church hierarchy. In 1890 things came to a head, Patriarch Cyril refused to recognize the Maglis and the latter with the help of Lord Cromer and Prime Minister Mostafa Fahmy Pasha exiled Patriarch Cyril V to a Monastery. This caused a backlash within the Coptic community who thought this was an Anglican plot to take over the Coptic Church. The Pope was subsequently released from exile in 1893 and the Maglis dissolved. Simaika was one of only two Maglis hardliners who refused to sign the petition to recall the Patriarch from his desert exile. Soon another Maglis was elected and again Simaika, in spite of opposition from the Patriarch and clergy, was elected a member. This Maglis avoided confrontation and confined their duties to putting the Patriarchal affairs in order. By then, Simaika had matured considerably, and as the seed of an idea of building a Coptic museum had started to germinate, he knew he would need the permission of Pope Cyril V to start this project, and toned down his campaign for communal reform, made his peace with Cyril and as a result was given permission to build the museum on Church premises. Whilst engaged in the repair and restoration of ancient Coptic Churches, Simaika collected a large quantity of carved wood and stone fragments* G. Gabra and M. Eaton-Krauss. The treasures of Coptic art in the Coptic museum and churches of old Cairo. The American University in Cairo Press. Cairo/New York. 2005 and in 1907 thought of starting a small Coptic Museum. In 1908 Simaika, in his capacity of Vice-President of the Maglis, found Pope Cyril supervising while a silversmith weighed out old silver Gospel covers and church vessels to be melted for reworking. On closer inspection, he noted that these silver objects belonged to the 14th and 15th centuries and carried Coptic and Arabic inscriptions. He offered to pay the market value of these objects which would be stored in a room that would be the nucleus of the proposed museum. Simaika proposed to start the museum in one room adjoining The Hanging Church in old Cairo* G. Gabra, G. Van Loon. The history and religious heritage of old Cairo. Its fortress, churches, synagogue and Mosque. The American University in Cairo Press. Cairo/New York. 2013 and to entrust the entire collection to the care of the priests of the Church so that the objects would continue to be Church property. Cyril gave his approval and the Coptic Museum was born. Simaika visited, with Cyril’s authority, all the Coptic Churches and the desert monasteries, rummaging in basements and lumber rooms for objects to add to the collection. Simaika paid the church a nominal price for objects he selected. A subscription list for the museum was started in January 1908. The Egyptian royal family, cabinet ministers, notables of all creeds, the British advisers and Simaika’s colleagues in the various councils contributed generously. The Coptic Museum formally opened in 1910. In 1930 at the request of King Fuad I, the Coptic museum was made a State institution with Simaika director for life.Marcus Simaika. Guide to the Coptic Museum and the Principal Churches of Cairo. Cairo Government Press 1937 Simaika had a major role in saving Coptic manuscripts. Cyril donated the most valuable manuscripts in the Patriarchal library, including the four gospels in Arabic, beautifully illuminated. In 1912, Simaika visited the libraries the monasteries and found manuscripts scattered about various cells, exposed to dust and destruction and used to light fires. The libraries of the churches were in not in much better state. With the permission of Cyril V and his successor Pope John XIX, Simaika arranged and catalogued the libraries of the monasteries, Churches and Patriarchate with the help of Yassa Abdel Messih and subsequently issued Catalogue of Coptic and Arabic Manuscripts in the Coptic Museum, the Patriarchate, the Principal Churches of Cairo and Alexandria and the Monasteries of Egypt in 3 volumes in 1936, in both Arabic and English.Marcus Simaika.

He was elected Member of the Royal Geographical Society in 1917, Honorary Member of the Society of Antiquaries and Fellow of the Society of Archaeologists. He was awarded the Turkish Order of Osmanieh in 1901 followed by the Order of the Medjidie in 1912.

Ruth Wallach, published by History Press 2015  Life  Max Maltzman was born in 1899 in Mykolaiv, Novorossiya, Russian Empire, now in Ukraine. His parents were Esther Maltzman and Abraham Maltzman, a carpenter. He had six siblings. The Maltzman family immigrated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1909, but Max Maltzman moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts, U.S. in 1910. Following military service in World War I, Maltzman returned to Boston, where he began studying architecture. He married Russian native Sadye Seltzer (1906-1966) in 1921. Sadya was fifteen years old at the time of their marriage, while Max was 21 or 22. They had three children: Elliott (born 1923), Muriel (born 1924) and Donald (born 1938). Max Maltzman became an American citizen in 1923. Maltzman and his wife moved to Los Angeles in the 1920s. He established an office at 169 North La Brea Avenue, and later at 704 South Spring Street. Maltzman was known to be an avid Boston sports fan and frequently attended games at Fenway Park, cheering on the dominant Boston Red Sox through their championship seasons in 1912, 1915, 1916 and 1918. Even after moving across the country he remained committed to Major League Baseball as a Red Sox fan, and eventually began following other American sports, becoming a fan of the Boston Celtics in the 1940s and the Boston Patriots in 1960s. Maltzman passed this fandom on to his children as well, and as Elliott, Muriel and Donald grew up and had families of their own, they would all gather each Sunday to watch the Patriots play football. These traditions have persisted even after his death, as his grandchildren and great grandchildren carry on his memory through their support of Boston sports. Maltzman died in August 1971 in Los Angeles, at the age of 72.  Work  Several of Maltzman's buildings have become significant monuments, for example, The Ravenswood in Hollywood, which the City of Los Angeles declared in 2003 to be a Historic Cultural Monument, and the Charmont Apartments, which the federal government has placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Maltzman operated during the era of Old Hollywood glamor, and several stars from that era, including Mae West, Clark Gable and Ava Gardner sought to live in his buildings. In 1952, Maltzman was hired by Chicago organized crime figures to be the supervising architect for the Sahara Casino in Las Vegas.http://lasvegassun.com/news/2008/may/15/mob-ties/ Las Vegas Sun.

From 1925 on, she acted as the head of several microbiology and epidemiology institutes in Moscow. In 1925, Ermol'eva was appointed head of the Department of Microbial Biochemistry at the USSR Academy of Sciences. There, she began her research on bacteriophages and naturally- occurring antimicrobial agents—lysozyme in particular. During the Second World War, she isolated a penicillin-producing strain of Penicillium crustosum. It was first used in Soviet hospitals in 1943. In 1942, she published the results of an experiment performed on herself, where she infected herself by drinking a solution of Vibrio cholerae and recovered after treatment. The results of her research were seen as essential in preventative measures against cholera in Russia's war efforts in the Eastern Front of World War II.

He previously played for the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners. Amateur career Healy attended Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino, California. Undrafted out of high school, Healy enrolled at the University of Oregon, where he played college baseball as a first baseman for the Oregon Ducks. As a junior, Healy set a Ducks single-season record with 56 runs batted in (RBIs), and a career record with 118 RBIs. In 2011, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and returned to the league in 2012 with an all-star season for the Brewster Whitecaps. Professional career=Minor leagues= The Oakland Athletics selected Healy in the third round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft. Healy signed with the Athletics. In 2014, Healy played for the Stockton Ports of the Class A-Advanced California League, finishing the season with a .285 batting average, 16 home runs, and 83 RBIs. While playing for the Midland RockHounds of the Class AA Texas League in 2015, Healy was named an All-Star. He was also named Texas League Player of the Week twice. Without an invite to big league camp, Healy returned to Midland to begin the 2016 season. However, Healy went on to hit .338 with 8 HR and 34 RBI in 36 games before earning a promotion to the Nashville Sounds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He appeared in the 2016 All-Star Futures Game as Oakland's lone representative, and earned an unlikely promotion to the major leagues on July 15. In 49 games with Nashville, Healy hit .318 with 6 HR and 30 RBI, splitting time at first base and third base. =Oakland Athletics= Upon his promotion, Healy was immediately inserted by manager Bob Melvin as the team's third baseman, supplanting Danny Valencia. He recorded his first major league hit, a 3-run home run, on July 16 in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 24, Healy hit a walk-off home run against the Tampa Bay Rays, capping a three run ninth-inning rally. On October 3, Healy was named the AL Rookie of the Month for the month of September, when he hit .355 with 7 HR and 19 RBI to conclude his breakout season. In 72 games, Healy hit .305/.337/.524 with 13 HR and 37 RBI, with a batting average that led all qualified AL rookies, reaching as high as third in the batting order. Coming off of an impressive 2016, Healy was expected to enter 2017 as Oakland's permanent third baseman. However, plans changed when the team signed Trevor Plouffe on January 10, 2017, and was named the starting third baseman by general manager David Forst on January 18. The move allowed Healy to move to his natural position at first base. In early 2017, he has split time between first base and designated hitter. He finished the season with a .271 average with 25 home runs and 78 runs batted in. =Seattle Mariners= On November 15, 2017, the Athletics traded Healy to the Seattle Mariners for Emilio Pagan and Alexander Campos. In his first season with the Mariners, Healy hit .235 with 24 home runs and 73 runs batted in. The following season, Healy suffered multiple injuries while shifting from playing first base to third base. He was declared out for the season on August 2, 2019 as he would undergo hip surgery. He was outrighted off of the Mariners roster on October 28. =Milwaukee Brewers= On December 17, 2019, Healy signed a one-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers.

It can be used as part of a cryptographic protocol to provide end-to-end encryption for instant messaging. After an initial key exchange it manages the ongoing renewal and maintenance of short-lived session keys. It combines a cryptographic so-called \\"ratchet\\" based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DH) and a ratchet based on a key derivation function (KDF), such as a hash function, and is therefore called a double ratchet. The developers refer to the algorithm as self-healing because under certain conditions, it disables an attacker from accessing the cleartext of messages (\\"the communication\\") after having compromised a session key. This condition is that between the compromise of the key and the communication in question, there has been at least one message which was not tampered with by the attacker. This effectively forces the attacker to intercept all communication between the honest parties, since he loses access as soon as one uncompromised message is passed between them. This property was later named Future Secrecy, or Post-Compromise Security.  Etymology  A mechanical ratchet \\"Axolotl\\" was in reference to the salamander's self-healing properties. The term \\"ratchet\\" in cryptography is used in analogy to a mechanical ratchet. In the mechanical sense, a ratchet only allows advancement in one direction; a cryptographic ratchet only allows keys to be generated from the previous key. Unlike a mechanical ratchet, however, each state is unique.  Origin  The Double Ratchet Algorithm was developed by Trevor Perrin and Moxie Marlinspike (Open Whisper Systems) in 2013 and introduced as part of the Signal Protocol in February 2014. The Double Ratchet Algorithm's design is based on the DH ratchet that was introduced by Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) and combines it with a symmetric-key ratchet modeled after the Silent Circle Instant Messaging Protocol (SCIMP). The ratchet was initially named after the critically endangered aquatic salamander axolotl, which has extraordinary self-healing capabilities. In March 2016, the developers renamed the Axolotl Ratchet as the Double Ratchet Algorithm to better differentiate between the ratchet and the full protocol, because some had used the name Axolotl when referring to the Signal Protocol.  Properties  The Double Ratchet Algorithm features properties that have been commonly available in end-to-end encryption systems for a long time: encryption of contents on the entire way of transport as well as authentication of the remote peer and protection against manipulation of messages. As a hybrid of DH and KDF ratchets, it combines several desired features of both principles. From OTR messaging it takes the properties of forward secrecy and automatically reestablishing secrecy in case of compromise of a session key, forward secrecy with a compromise of the secret persistent main key, and plausible deniability for the authorship of messages. Additionally, it enables session key renewal without interaction with the remote peer by using secondary KDF ratchets. An additional key-derivation step is taken to enable retaining session keys for out-of-order messages without endangering the following keys. It is said to detect reordering, deletion and replay of sent messages and improve forward secrecy properties in comparison to OTR messaging. Combined with public key infrastructure for the retention of pregenerated one-time keys (prekeys), it allows for the initialization of messaging sessions without the presence of the remote peer (asynchronous communication). The usage of triple Diffie–Hellman key exchange (3-DH) as initial key exchange method improves the deniability properties. An example of this is the Signal Protocol, which combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and a 3-DH handshake. The protocol provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, participant consistency, destination validation, forward secrecy, backward secrecy (aka future secrecy), causality preservation, message unlinkability, message repudiation, participation repudiation, and asynchronicity. It does not provide anonymity preservation, and requires servers for the relaying of messages and storing of public key material.  Functioning  A client renews session key material in interaction with the remote peer using Diffie–Hellman ratchet whenever possible, otherwise independently by using a hash ratchet. Therefore, with every message a client using the double ratchet advances one of two hash ratchets (one for sending, one receiving) which get seeded with a common secret from a DH ratchet. At the same time it tries to use every opportunity to provide the remote peer with a new public DH value and advance the DH ratchet whenever a new DH value from the remote peer arrives. As soon as a new common secret is established, a new hash ratchet gets initialized. As cryptographic primitives, the Double Ratchet Algorithm uses ; for the DH ratchet : Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) with Curve25519, ; for message authentication codes (MAC, authentication) : Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) based on SHA-256, ; for symmetric encryption : the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), partially in Cipher Block Chaining mode (CBC) with padding as per PKCS #5 and partially in Counter mode (CTR) without padding, ; for the hash ratchet : HMAC.

It stands at Piastowski Square N°5, not far from Śniadecki Street in city downtown district (). The church is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List.  History  The history of the church is associated with the efforts of the Polish community, which, since 1898, strived to obtain the consent of the Prussian authorities to build a new Catholic church in the city. Consent was granted released in 1906, under the condition to establish two catholic churches: one for Poles (Holy Trinity Church) and one for Germans (Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus). The construction site for the German catholic temple was chosen at Elisabethmarkt, then a city square. The church was built from 1910 to 1913 with funds from the government, papal gift and contributions of German Catholics in Bydgoszcz. The preliminary design of the church was performed in the Department of Civil Engineering Design of Public Works in Berlin in May 1908. The main architect and builder was Oskar Hoßfeld (1848-1915), from Thuringia. He was at the time considered as a specialist in the construction of churches, such as in Poznan, Szczecin or Legnica. During the building in Bydgoszcz, he was assisted by a city senior official, Mr Herrmann and builder managers, Mr Handke and Mr Asmann. The church was built with Baroque Revival architecture features, in the like of a basilica, with an apse, a transept and an internal great domed rotunda. The style of the church refers to Baroque churches in northern Germany. Building has been consecrated by Suffragan bishop from Gniezno Wilhelm Kloske on June 19, 1913. Initially, the temple was an auxiliary church subordinated to the cathedral parish of Bydgoszcz. Reserved for the use of German Catholics, the temple was opened to both communities, German and Polish, on February 17, 1924. Until the outbreak of the Second World War, the church was the property of the municipality. In 1921, young organist Szczepan Jankowski (1900-1990) was nominated. Despite his blindness, he became a notorious composer with studies and recognitions from many universities ( Poznan, Leipzig, Munich, Berlin and Paris). For his great services to the Church, Pope Paul VI honored him in 1964 with the Medal Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice. He lived at Śniadecki Street N°55, where a plaque has been unveiled in 2008 in memoriam. In 1924, Cardinal Edmund Dalbor issued a decree related to the creation in Bydgoszcz of five new parishes, including the parish of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The first parish priest in 1925 was Kazimierz Stepczyński, murdered by Nazis in 1939. During World War II, the church has not suffered too much from the ravages of the conflict. Interiors have been refurbished from 1982 to 1988, and in 2002, a new façade and an outer illumination have been installed.  Characteristics  The temple is considered as one of the most beautiful historicism style churches built in Bydgoszcz at the turn of the 20th century.

A/746, on December 10, 1971.zabytek-kujawsko-pomorskie-28.02.2014 = Architectural style = The church follows the Neo-Baroque style, with a plastered facade which distinguishes it from many others built in Bydgoszcz during the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, which are usually adorned with a high-quality ceramic and many architectural details. It has the characteristics of a basilica with a dedicated transept, over which rises the dome. The temple has three aisles, with the chancel facing north: it has two chapels, and two sacristies. It can accommodate approximately 2000 believers. There are three main entrances and two side ones. In total, the church is 812 m2 large. It is a relatively early example of reinforced concrete structure in the city. The church tower is 48.4 m high, and topped with a bulbous dome carrying with a lantern. Inside the dome, in addition to the bells, a clock tower strikes the hour and the half-an-hour. It was built in 1912 by German company Ed. Korfhage & Soehne Melle, which still exists up to this day.Site of the company Gutters, cupola and flèche are all copper plate roofed. The facade is distinguished by its pilasters topped with attic style decoration. The main nave, the chancel and transept sides are ornamented with barrel vaults. Nave floor is covered with red sandstone, and chancel's with marble slabs. = Architectural details = Rich baroque motifs adorned both church interiors and façade: cartouches with writings, volutes, flaming vases, putti, rococo painting ornaments, festoons.Rudnicki Daniel Bernard. Parafia pw. Najświętszego Serca Pana Jezusa (1924-1996). [w.] Kalendarz Bydgoski 1998 The portal displays richly decorated stone statues of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. The transept boasts columns heaving balconies with statues of angels. Frescoes on vaults and ceilings have been made by artist painter Ernest Fey from Berlin. The two apostles figures of the facade portal have been realized by Schreiner from Regensburg. Exterior figures are the work of Meyer and Weber from Wilmersdorf. Interior sculptures, such as the Atlas of the matroneum organ and the four groups of angels in the transept have been created by Frank Vauschutz from Charlottenburg. = Altars = Six altars stand in the church: # Main altar, initially decorated with the image of the Heart of Jesus by Boleslaw Lewański. It has been replaced in 1930 by the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, by professor Faczyński; # Altar in the left aisle, with a picture of the Assumption of Mary; # Altar in the right aisle, with a picture of Saint Joseph; # Second altar in the right aisle, with a statue of Saint Anthony, by professor Giecewicz in 1924; # Altar in the chapel adjacent to the chancel, where is now placed -since 1930- the picture of the Sacred Heart by Boleslaw Lewański, initially at the main altar; # Altar in the chapel adjoining the left aisle, which initially housed a statue of Our Lady of Sorrows. However, it is now replaced by a stylish Baroque altar made by sculptor Skręt from Bydgoszcz, along with an image of Sainte Thérèse of Lisieux by professor Faczyński. A Pietà stands now in the right aisle. = Bells = In the church tower hangs three steel bells, with a combined weight of more than 5.6t: * The smallest christened \\"Ave Maria, gratia plena Dominus Tecum\\" (Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee); * The medium christened \\"Omnia ad Dei Major gloriam\\" (All for the greater glory of God); * The Largest christened \\"Cor Jesu sacratissimum Miserere nobis\\" (Sacred Heart of Jesus have mercy on us). The bells are electrically powered, cast in Bochum in 1912. = Pipe organ = Pipe organ has been built in 1912 by Paul Voelkner from Bydgoszcz, as a 28 voice instrument. In 1942, it has been rebuilt by Josef Goebel from Gdańsk, and increased by one voice. In 1968, tubular bells have replaced original ones. The instrument has two keyboards and one pedal, with a pneumatic tracker (air being forced through a noiseless fan). In April 2012, a major renovation has been carried out.

His publishing business was successful, and among the most important in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Through partnerships, often with members of his family, he expanded the business through much of Europe. At about the time of his death in 1538 there were Giunti presses in Florence and Lyon, Giunti bookshops or warehouses in Antwerp, Burgos, Frankfurt, Lisbon, Medina del Campo, Paris, Salamanca and Zaragoza, and agencies in numerous cities of the Italian peninsula, including Bologna, Brescia, Genoa, Livorno, Lucca, Naples, Piacenza, Pisa, Rome, Siena and Turin, as well as the islands of Sardinia and Sicily.  Life  Lucantonio Giunti was one of the seven sons of Giunta di Biagio, a weaver. He was born in the parish of in Florence in 1457. With his brother Bernardo, he left Florence in about 1477 for Venice, where he set up as a stationer. In 1489 he started book publishing with three titles: the works of Ovid; an anonymous translation into the volgare of the Transito de sancto Hieronymo, partly by Eusebius Cremonensis; and a translation of the Imitatio Christi, authorship of which he attributed to Jean Gerson. For all three he employed the printer and typographer Matteo Capcasa. From 1491 Giunti was constantly active as a publisher, and later as a printer too; he issued some 410 titles during his lifetime. He did not have his own printing workshop until about 1500; until that time, he employed independent typographers, most frequently Johan Emerich of Speier. File:The Malermi Bible, vol.

Based on the premise of One Librarian, One Reference, organizers estimated that if each librarian on the planet spent 15 minutes adding a citation, the combined effort would eliminate English Wikipedia's backlog of 350,000 [citation needed] notices.

Results of the first campaign The inaugural campaign ended with 1,232 revisions on 879 pages, by 327 users in 9 languages, using the hashtag #1lib1ref in the edit summary; these numbers likely underestimate the overall impact, since many participants were observed omitting the hashtag from edit summaries.

He served as President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Founding Director of Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter (FJIRSM), and Vice President of Fuzhou University, as well as high-ranking political positions including Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress. Biography Lu Jiaxi at graduation from Xiamen University (1934) On 26 October 1915, Lu Jiaxi was born to a scholarly family in Xiamen (Amoy), Fujian, China. A child prodigy, he finished elementary school in a single year, before spending another year and a half in junior high school. Before turning 13, he passed the entrance examination to a preparatory class for Xiamen University. He received the Tan Kah Kee scholarship for four years and graduated from Xiamen University in 1934 with a degree in chemistry. He then taught at the university for three years. In 1937, Lu passed a competitive examination and received a national postgraduate fellowship to study at University College London, where he studied under Samuel Sugden and obtained a Ph.D. at the age of 24. With the recommendation of Sugden, he was admitted to the California Institute of Technology in 1939, and studied structural chemistry under Linus Pauling, the future Nobel laureate. In 1944, he worked at the Maryland Research Laboratory of the US National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). His research in the area of combustion and explosion earned him an R&D; prize from the NDRC. After the end of World War II, Lu turned down numerous employment opportunities in the United States, and returned to war-torn China in the winter of 1945. He was appointed professor and dean of the Chemistry Department at Xiamen University. From 1960 to 1981, Lu was director of the Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter (FJIRSM), and vice president of Fuzhou University. He served as President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) from 1981 to 1988, and as a special advisor to the CAS afterwards. He was also Vice President of the Third World Academy of Sciences. His political positions include Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (1988–97, Honorary Chairman afterwards), Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (1988–93 and 1998–2003), and Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress (1993–98). Lu Jiaxi died on 4 June 2001. On 6 April 2002, a bronze statue of him was erected in front of the Chemistry Department of Xiamen University. Research and honours Lu Jiaxi's research focus was on physical, structural, nuclear, and materials chemistry. He proposed a structural model of the center of nitrogenase, a key enzyme used in biological nitrogen fixation, and studied the relationship between chemical structure and performance. His work is recognized internationally, and he was elected as a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts and of the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium. For his contributions to structural chemistry, he was awarded the Scientific Achievement Prize by the Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation. In 1998, the asteroid 3844 Lujiaxi was named in his honour.

She shared her views through essays and poems published in the Women's Exponent, a periodical for Latter-day Saint women. Raised by Mormon parents and devout to the faith, Dalton was a feminist; as a child, she felt jealous of boys for the freedom and privileges they enjoyed and felt that girls were neglected by the education system. She became a women's rights activist, believing that women should have the right to suffrage, education, property, control over their money, and custody of their children. As a teacher, she advocated for equal educational and recreational opportunities for girls. Dalton supported polygamy, arguing that it allowed more women to marry whom she deemed the few \\"good men\\", and bore six children with her husband Charles, who married her as his fourth wife. Her writings have been noted by critics for poetically conveying the role and struggles of Mormon women in her time. Early life Dalton was born in Coosa County, Alabama to Eliza Foscue and John Percival Lee. Her parents joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Texas in 1849, and they made the trek to Utah Territory shortly after their conversion. In 1851, Dalton's family moved to the San Bernardino Valley in California as part of a Mormon expedition led by Amasa Lyman and Charles C. Rich. Seven years later her family moved to Beaver, Utah. Despite her family's poverty, Dalton's parents tried to teach her at home and let her attend school as long as possible. There were many children in her family, and at the time, many teenage girls stayed home to help with childcare and housework, but Dalton's family encouraged her to go to school. Since her family moved between rural areas, her education was scattered and not very methodical. Her teacher in Utah tutored her during lunch and after school and started training her to be a teacher herself. At age 12, her father founded a private school where Dalton helped teach. At age 16, Dalton became a teacher herself for an \\"infant school.\\" Also around age 16, Dalton's younger brother grew gravely ill. According to her autobiography, she fasted and prayed that her brother's life would be spared, and while she prayed this way he remained alive, although still ill. When Dalton's mother wished that her son's sufferings would end, Dalton stopped praying that his life would be spared and instead prayed that God's will be done. Her little brother died shortly thereafter. Marriage to Charles Dalton and family life Lucinda Dalton was the fourth wife of Charles Wakeman Dalton, and they were married in 1868. Lucinda resented the expectation that she be meek and obedient in her marriage. Charles assured her that husbands have obligations to their wives as wives do to their husbands. She came to the conclusion that she should marry Charles because of a spiritual witness they experienced together: \\"I felt that we were in the presence of the hosts of heaven; and a direct incontrovertible testimony was given me that it was the will of God and not my will that I should accept this man for my yokefellow.\\" She and Charles had six children together. Before her first child Charles's birth, Lucinda had a premonition that her son would not live very long. She told her mother that the dress she sewed for him was like a funeral shroud, and after baby Charles's death at age two, she buried him in it. Lucinda's second child, a daughter named Rosette, also died in infancy. Dalton often references these lost child infants in her poetry. Her third child, Clifford, was born on February 18, 1875. Charles was a joint owner of a store in Beaver and also hauled freight to surrounding areas. However, his income was not sufficient to support his four wives and many children. Dalton taught school in Manti, Beaver, Payson, Ferron, and Ogden. When Lucinda's father remarried, her sister Emma came to stay with her, and Emma married Charles in 1871. In 1876, Emma left Charles and Lucinda, as well as the LDS Church, and moved to Arkansas and then California. After Charles's death, Lucinda Dalton applied to cancel her temple sealing to Charles in 1884: \\"though I know he had many imperfections ... now the brethren say he is unworthy, (though I know not who appointed them to judge him,) they urge that I stand in a very insecure position, and that for my children's sake, as well as my own, I ought to marry again.\\" Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her \\"brethren\\" considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931. Feminist views and writings As a child, Dalton felt jealous of boys for the freedom they enjoyed. They could travel alone without worrying about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers thought it would be wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved. Dalton argued for girls and boys to have equal recreational and educational opportunities and for women to have fair wages. Dalton advocated exercise for girls, including swimming and shooting. She believed that women had the right to suffrage, education, property, control over their earned money, and custody of their children. She was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued that parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did not permit, to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings. Dalton applied the logic of abolitionism to the cause of women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in marriage as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws. Dalton taught for sixty years. She taught her pupils energetically in spite of having crude educational resources. In 1891, Dalton encouraged other women teachers to ask for a raise. The board of education did give the teachers a raise, but considered Dalton responsible for their petitioning and demanded that she pay the difference from her salary. When Dalton refused, they replaced her with a male teacher. Luckily, the city of Payson requested that Dalton teach at their school, and she moved there happily. Later she taught in Ogden and Manti. She served as an officer of the territorial women's suffrage association. Her sister Rose was vice-president of the Utah State Chapter of Women Voters. Death and legacy A view of the Manti Cemetery, where Dalton was buried Dalton died on November 24, 1925 in Manti, Utah, survived by two of her children. Her funeral was held at the North Ward Chapel in Manti on November 27; she was buried in the Manti Cemetery. Edward Tullidge, a fellow Mormon contemporary with Dalton, said she was \\"a lady in whose writings are manifested the true spirit and independence of the Mormon women\\", saying that \\"the vigor and vivacity of her poetic productions are suggestive of a future enviable fame.\\" Another Mormon, Jill Mulvay, in Sunstone, called her poems \\"refreshingly imaginative, devoid of maudlin sentiment which marked much of the poetry of her age.\\" A Dialogue review of a book containing her poems considers her position: > Could there be a more 'queer yoking' than the polygamist and the suffragist? > In her amazing 'Woman,' Dalton refutes the traditional Christian view of > woman's subservient position. She counters the Christian image of woman as > the cause of humanity's fall from grace with the more enlightened 'latter- > day' view of woman as a divine daughter of God, as one who fell to 'seek > knowledge, the God-like prize.' Her play on the notion of latter-day > redemption continues to the end of the poem with the last two lines: 'The > Word has gone forth that when all is done, / the last shall be first > forever' (6). In a thesis on Dalton authored by fellow Mormon Sheree Bench: \\"As an essayist Dalton defends her religion calls for the expansion of women's political and economic opportunities and asserts that the elevation of women is crucial to achieving the potential of both sexes. As a poet she is a compelling writer who reveals in her poems her apprehensions and aspirations her faith and feminism much of her poetry reflects the same commitment to reform that is clear in her essays and she uses both genres do effective political work.\\" Another thesis writer believed that Dalton's poem Winter Winds \\"demonstrates the consistent opposition between male-identified and female-identified natural elements within LDS women's literature.\\" Selected works The items on this list are taken from Sheree Bench's thesis on Dalton unless otherwise noted. In her many contributions to the Women's Exponent, Dalton is often credited as \\"L.D.D.\\" =Essays= ;1872-3   ;1874  ;1880  ;1894 * =Poems= ;1873-6  ;1878-80  ;1885-93  NotesReferencesExternal links *Woman's Exponent entry in Mormon Publications: 19th and 20th Centuries, with link to digital scans at the Harold B.

Biography Konstantin Podrevsky was born in Turinsk, Tobolsk, to Nikolai Nikolayevich Podrevsky (1855–1916), a Chernigov-born Ukrainian raznochinets (later journalist and editor of Sibirsky Listok newspaper), and Zoya Ignatyevna, (born Vincentina Wilhelmina Lisowska, 1862–1925?), a daughter of the Polish revolutionaries who were deported to the Siberia after the 1863 Uprising. In Astrakhan, where the family settled after having received the permission to return from Siberia, Konstantin joined the city's First Gymnasium. After graduation in 1906 he enrolled into the Kiev University's law faculty. It was in Kiev that he debuted as a published poet, in the local Student Almanac magazine. In 1914 Podrevsky moved to Moscow and a year later enlisted as a private, to be posted to the World War I battlefields. Demobilized in 1917, he settled at the Arbat, and moved into a bohemian circle of friends, among them poet Andrey Bely. In 1922 Podrevsky became a professional poet and lyricist and a year later joined the Dramsoyuz (Dramatists Union), starting the artistic partnership with his new friend there, Boris Fomin. Among this tandem's most popular songs was \\"Dorogoi dlinnoyu\\" (1924), arguably, the most famous 20th century Russian romance. In 1929 the First All-Russian Musicians Conference pronounced the whole genre of the Russian romance 'counter-revolutionary'. Podrevsky's best known songs were banned, and he was personally attacked in the press as a 'NEPman stooge'. The same year Podrevsky failed to forward a declaration to his local tax authorities, and all of his family's property was arrested. He suffered a severe shock and, as a result, a fatal nervous breakdown. Konstantin Podrevsky died on 4 February 1930. He is interred in Donskoye Cemetery's columbarium in Moscow. In the early 2010s the Selected Poems by K.N. Podrevsky were published for the first time in Russia . Private life In 1910 Konstantin Podrevsky married his first wife Vera Alexandrovna Mikulina (1885—1956). A niece of the scientist Nikolai Zhukovsky, she was a poet who published as 'Vera Zhukovskaya'. They divorced in 1920. Podrevsky's second wife was Anna Ivanovna Lyamina (née Stepanova, 1898–1974). Andrey Glebovich Lyamin was her son from the first marriage. It was the latter's granddaughter Maria Filina who in the 2010 passed the poet's archives to the Vodolei Publishers which resulted in the publication of the Selected Poems by K.N. Podrevsky.
