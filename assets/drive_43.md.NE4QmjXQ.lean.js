FAVA is characterized by tough fibrofatty tissue taking over portions of muscle, most often contained within a single limb. FAVA also causes venous and/or lymphatic abnormalities. Though FAVA has only been recognized as a distinct vascular anomaly, separate from common venous malformations, within the past ten years, FAVA a distinct congenital disorder. Signs and symptoms Common symptoms of FAVA include severe pain and difficulty moving the affected limb, mild enlargement of the affected limb with visible veins, and contracture. In the cohort described by Alomari, et al. from the Vascular Anomalies Center at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, FAVA was located, in descending order, in the calf, forearm/wrist and thigh. The most common presentation is severe pain. Calf lesions, particularly those located in the posterior compartment, are commonly associated with restricted ankle dorsiflexion (equinus contracture). Genetics No one knows what causes FAVA, though recent research revealed mutations in a gene called PIK3CA in some ‚Äî but not all ‚Äî cases. PIK3CA is a gene in the receptor tyrosine kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3)-AKT growth-signaling pathway. The PIK3CA gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 3. There has been no evidence to suggest that FAVA is inherited or passed along in families. Diagnosis FAVA is most often diagnosed in older children, teens and young adults, though it has been diagnosed earlier and later in a patient's life. The constellation of clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic findings typically allow the diagnosis of FAVA. The most helpful imaging studies are ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The major imaging features of FAVA include the presence of complex intramuscular solid lesion replacing normal muscle fibers with fibrofatty overgrowth and phlebectasia. The extrafascial part is composed of fatty overgrowth, phlebectasia, and occasional lymphatic malformation. The histopathologic findings in FAVA include dense fibrous tissue, fat, and lymphoplasmacytic aggregates within atrophied skeletal muscle. Adipose tissue within skeletal muscles are associated with large, irregular, and sometimes excessively muscularized venous channels and smaller, clustered channels. Organizing thrombi, lymphatic foci and enlarged nerves encircled by dense fibrous tissue are also frequently noted in FAVA. Management Some FAVA patients develop limb contracture; in these cases early orthopedic consultation is necessary. Achilles tendon lengthening (heel-cord release) and physical therapy can be helpful for treating equinus contracture. Unlike classical venous malformations, pain in FAVA is multifactorial and clinical response to sclerotherapy of the venous component can be less effective. While intralesional steroid injections and nerve block may offer temporary or partial pain relief, the source of pain is often the solid intramuscular lesion. Surgical resection and image-guided percutaneous cryoablation may offer an effective control of pain in FAVA lesions. Sirolimus has been effective in improving the quality of life in some people with FAVA.

Dohm won national and intercollegiate championship titles at both 440 yards and 880 yards and set a world record at the latter distance in 1891. Biography Dohm was born in Princeton, New Jersey, on March 27, 1869. He studied at Princeton University, initially playing football; after picking up running, he developed rapidly under the guidance of Princeton's coach Jim Robinson. Originally, he competed mostly at 440 yards, and sometimes at 220 yards; in 1888, he was national quarter-mile champion of both the United States and Canada. In 1889, Dohm repeated as both American and Canadian quarter-mile champion and also won the intercollegiate (IC4A) championship at the distance. He also started to move up to the half-mile, breaking Lon Myers's American record of 1: with his time of 1:. One of his leading rivals was William Downs of Harvard, who won the 1889 intercollegiate title at 880 yards; in 1890 they met at the middle-ground distance of 600 yards, with Downs winning. Subsequently, they switched distances, with Downs becoming primarily a quarter-miler and Dohm a half-miler; at the 1890 IC4A championships each of them won at their new distance, with Dohm's half-mile time of 1: being a new meeting record. Dohm also won the long jump championship. Dohm graduated from Princeton after the 1890 season and became a reporter, but continued to race, winning the 880 yards at the 1891 AAU championships. On September 19, 1891 he broke Francis Cross's world record for 880 yards, running 1: in a handicap race in New York City; there was some confusion in the United States about what the old record by Cross (an Englishman) had been, with the media reporting Dohm had set a new American record but only equaled or narrowly missed the world best. Cross's actual time had been 1:, a tenth of a second slower than Dohm's. In 1892, Dohm started to suffer from pulmonary problems, which forced him to retire from running. As his condition worsened, he moved to Denver, Colorado, in the hope his health would improve there, but the move failed to help, and he died from tuberculosis in Denver on May 9, 1894. Many contemporary commentators believed he had damaged his lungs by training too hard and exerting himself too much, and that this had caused or contributed to his condition. Dohm's world record lasted until September 1895, when Charles Kilpatrick broke it.

The son of one of the nation's founding fathers, Read made numerous attempts at higher political office but was ultimately unsuccessful each time. Despite this, his substantial wealth acquired through his family and law career allowed him to build one of the largest homes in Delaware, which is today maintained as a museum. Early life and family Coat of Arms of George Read Jr. George Read Jr. was born on August 29, 1765 in New Castle, Delaware, United States. His father was George Read, a prominent lawyer and politician who would go on to sign both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. His mother was Gertrude Ross Read, the daughter of Rev. George Ross (the first rector of the Immanuel Episcopal Church on the Green) and the sister of lawyer George Ross, another future signatory to the Declaration. At the time of Read's birth, his father was serving as both the Crown Attorney General for the Delaware Colony as well as a member of the Delaware Assembly. By the time the boy turned ten, his father was serving in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Read was admitted to the bar in 1785 and opened a law office in New Castle. In 1786, he wed his cousin Mary Thompson, the daughter of General William Thompson. Political career In 1789, the same year his father began his service as a senator in the first session of the U.S. Senate, George Read Jr. received an appointment from President George Washington as the first U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware thanks to his father's efforts. The job meant that Read would be responsible for prosecuting cases brought in federal court in the state of Delaware. Read was called to testify before the Senate as a prosecution witness in the 1805 impeachment trial of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. Read had been serving as the prosecuting attorney before a grand jury in the New Castle Court House in 1800 when Chase refused to discharge the grand jury until they investigated a local printer for possible charges under the Sedition Act. Despite Read's testimony, Chase was acquitted by the Senate. In 1812, upon hearing of the death of U.S. District Judge Gunning Bedford Jr., Read wrote a letter to President James Madison seeking to be appointed to the bench. This was Read's first of several attempts at securing for himself a higher political office. Madison instead appointed John Fisher, the brother-in-law of Madison's former Attorney General, Caesar Augustus Rodney. U.S. Representative Henry M. Ridgely declined to seek reelection to the House in 1814, and Read ran for the office. Read ran as a Republican, but Delaware was one of the few states that remained fertile ground for the Federalist Party, which had won the state in the presidential elections of 1808 and 1812. Read lost by 10%. He made a second attempt at running for a seat in the House in 1818, but lost again, albeit by a much narrower margin of 1.65%. Read sent a letter of resignation from his post as U.S. Attorney in 1815, and he was succeeded by his son, George Read III. In 1820, at the request of Attorney General William Wirt, Read collaborated with Caesar A. Rodney in preparing a report for Secretary of War John C. Calhoun detailing the legal history of Delaware's colonial deeds and rights to the Delaware River in order to resolve a dispute over the ownership of Fort Delaware. Judge Fisher died in 1823, and Read wrote a letter to Rodney on April 22 applying for the position of U.S. District Judge for a second time. He was rebuffed again, however, as President James Monroe appointed Willard Hall to the bench instead. In 1831, Delaware convened a convention to draft a new state Constitution. Read was a delegate to the convention, alongside Judge Hall. During the convention, the two were generally aligned in advocating in favor of making substantial revisions to the Constitution in New Castle County's interests. Read House and Gardens Read purchased a lot in New Castle immediately adjacent to his father's home in 1797, where he began building a grand mansion for himself and his new family. George Read Sr. helped design the plan for his son's home. The mansion was under construction for the next six years, finally being completed in 1803. The Federal-style home contained 14,000 square feet of living space spread out over 22 rooms. It was the largest home in Delaware at the time. Read purchased the lot opposite his home as well. That lot bordered the Delaware River, and Read maintained it as an empty lot in order to have an unobstructed view of the river from his home. Architect Benjamin Latrobe, who resided for several years in New Castle and became an acquaintance of Read's, wrote that he found the arrangement quite wasteful, as the waterfront lot was amongst the most valuable in town. In 1824, much of New Castle was destroyed by fire, but Read's home survived. The next-door home of his late father, however, did not. Read had that piece of property converted into a formal garden. Death and legacy George Read Jr. died at his home in New Castle on September 3, 1836. He is buried at the cemetery of the Immanuel Episcopal Church on the Green, near his home in New Castle. His father is also buried there. In 1967, the National Park Service declared the New Castle Historic District to be a National Historic Landmark. Both the Immanuel Episcopal Church and the Read House and Gardens are contributing properties to this landmark district. The church and home are also both adjacent to the Green, which is a part of the First State National Historical Park. In 2017, the Read House was made a National Historic Landmark in its own right, in addition to remaining a contributing structure in the New Castle Historic District. One of Read's sons, William Thompson Read, was a founder of the Delaware Historical Society. The Society purchased the Read House in 1975 and it is currently open to the public as a museum.

Many of the group's fighters are al-Shaitat tribesmen from the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. The group was also active in Damascus city between January and July 2015, when its unit in Damascus merged into Jaysh al-Islam's 8th Brigade. It mainly focused on defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in the eastern Syrian Desert, where it gained control over large areas since 2016. History technical. The origins of the Lions of the East Army trace back to the rebellion in Deir ez-Zor Governorate in 2011-14, when several rebel groups emerged to fight against Bashar al-Assad's government. Among these was \\"Liwa Bashair al-Nasr\\" (translated: \\"Victory of Good News Brigade\\"), founded by Tlass al-Salama in 2012. Salama eventually became one of the most prominent anti-ISIL rebel leaders in the governorate, while his group became known for helping government officers and soldiers in Deir ez-Zor to defect by smuggling them to their home areas. Other notable rebel groups that later joined the Lions of the East Army were Liwa al-Qadisiyah and Liwa Omar al-Mukhtar from Abu Kamal, and Bayariq al-Shaitat, a militia formed from al-Shaitat tribal members. These groups unsuccessfully tried to resist a large-scale offensive by ISIL in mid-2014 that drove them from Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Many rebel groups, among them Salama's men, then moved into the eastern Qalamoun Mountains. There, Liwa Bashair al-Nasr merged with eleven other ex-Deir ez-Zor factions, forming the \\"Lions of the East Army\\" under Salama's leadership. The new group's name was chosen in order to retain the members' link with their eastern home areas. The army was originally a member of the Authenticity and Development Front. For a few months in 2015, the Lions had also had a presence in Eastern Ghouta in the Damascus suburbs, where Liwa Usud al-‚ÄôAsima joined them and aided other local rebels in fighting the Eastern Ghouta ISIL branch. Eventually, Liwa Usud al-‚ÄôAsima left the Lions of the East Army and merged with Jaysh al-Islam's 8th Brigade. A BM-21 Grad rocket artillery truck of the group during the 2017 southern Syrian Desert campaign. Since its formation, the Lions of the East Army has fought alongside other rebel groups against ISIL in the southern Syrian Desert and the Qalamoun Mountains, and despite reversals has managed to capture much territory. To expand its strength, Salama's group has recruited both young men from areas they have taken from ISIL, as well as former ISIL fighters who have surrendered. According to Salama, many ISIL fighters are \\"simple people and many had no choice\\" but to cooperate with the Islamist organization. The Lions of the East Army tries to \\"rehabilitate\\" ISIL members, with the group's cleric for example explaining to locals and prisoners why ISIL is not \\"Islamic\\". In late November 2015, however, many rebels from the Lions of the East Army joined the New Syrian Army. A month later the Lions left the Authenticity and Development Front, though continued to maintain a cordial relationship with it. In June 2016, the Lions joined an ultimately unsuccessful offensive to capture Abu Kamal from ISIL. One month later, the army's positions near the Hadalat border crossing with Jordan were hit by airstrikes from the Russian Air Force. Later that year it helped countering ISIL offensive in Eastern Qalamoun, and in early 2017 was part of a large-scale rebel campaign during which they captured much territory from ISIL. As the Lions of the East Army focus its strength mostly on fighting ISIL, the group has avoided fighting the Syrian government since 2016, though it remains hostile to Assad. In April 2018, along with other rebel groups in the eastern Qalamoun, fighters of the Lions of the East Army were evacuated to Turkish-occupied areas in the northern Aleppo Governorate, thus leaving the Southern Front coalition.  Ideology  The group appears to have no unifying ideology besides aiming at overthrowing Assad's government and defeating ISIL. Some units within the Lions of the East Army had no ideological commitments at all before merging into the group, while Salama has tried to portray his own faction as secular or at least non-Islamist. Analyst Aron Lund has noted, however, that both the group's leadership as well as some units within the army were close to moderate Salafist groups, including the Authenticity and Development Front, though this may have partially stemmed from the need to raise money and obtain equipment from both regional as well as international pro-Salafist organizations. The army has, consequently, expressed anti-Iranian tendencies, having called Assad's government the \\"ungodly Safavid regime\\". In an interview in July 2017, Salama claimed that the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Syrian Armed Forces are \\"two sides of the same coin\\".  Organization   Structure  The Lions of the East Army is led by Tlass al-Salama (also known as \\"Abu Faisal\\"), with his deputy being Abu Barzan al-Sultani. Although the army came into existence as a merger of 12 rebel factions, with more units such as the Lions of Sunna Brigade joining later, these groups have fully integrated into the organization and abandoned their individual identities. The militias that have joined the army are: *Lions of Sunna Brigade (originally from Deir ez-Zor, not to be mistaken for Daraa based Lions of Sunna Brigade)https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/JUaS-infographic-1200x1011.jpg *Lions of Umayyad Brigade *Qadisiya Brigade *Bayariq al-Shaitat *Descendants of Aisha Battalion *Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah Battalion Technicals in service of the Lions of the East Army. *Hamza Battalion *Son of al-Qaim Brigade *Mujahid Omar Mukhtar Brigade *Bashair al-Nasr Brigade *Ahwaz Brigade *Shield of the Ummah Brigade *Conquest Brigade *Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr Group *Commandos of the Desert Brigade (former, defected to the Syrian Army) *Lions of the Asima Brigade (former, later joined the 8th Brigade of Jaysh al-Islam) The Lions of the East Army divides its operations into two sectors, one for Eastern Qalamoun and one for the desert. By August 2017, around 100 fighters of the group were left in the Eastern Qalamoun, surrounded by government forces. Since its formation, the group has tried to adapt to desert warfare, with its commander noting the great difficulties of controlling territory and organizing logistics in the Syrian Desert.

The rising research attention towards 2D semiconductors started with a discovery by Geim and Novoselov et al. in 2004, when they reported a new semiconducting material graphene, a flat monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a 2D honeycomb lattice. A 2D monolayer semiconductor is significant because it exhibits stronger piezoelectric coupling than traditionally employed bulk forms, which enables 2D materials applications in new electronic components used for sensing and actuating. In this emergent field of research in solid-state physics, the main focus is currently on designing nanoelectronic components by the use of graphene as electrical conductor, hexagonal boron nitride as electrical insulator, and a transition metal dichalcogenide as semiconductor. Materials Monolayer graphene Graphene Graphene's two surfaces are single sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. Having two surfaces and lacking bulk makes it the thinnest possible material but also 5 times stronger than steel due to pi and sigma orbital bonds. Graphene has high electron mobility and high thermal conductivity. Although graphene can be used in different applications, one issue regarding graphene is its lack of a band gap, which poses a problem in particular with digital electronics because it is unable to switch off field-effect transistors (FETs). Nanosheets of other group-IV elements (Si, Ge and Sn) present structural and electronic properties similar to graphene. Layered structure of h-BN Hexagonal boron nitride Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), also known as ‚Äòwhite graphene‚Äô, is structurally similar to graphite and features a honeycomb arrangement with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms in place of carbon. h-BN has a higher energy gap (5.97 eV) than graphene, thus functions as an insulator instead of a semimetal. However, it can also function as a semiconductor with enhanced conductivity due to its zigzag sharp edges and vacancies. h-BN is often used as substrate and barrier due to its insulating property. Furthermore, h-BN also has a large thermal conductivity and mechanical strength. Thus, it can be employed as a support for metal catalyst due to its chemical, thermal, acid-base stability and high thermal conductance. Layered structure of MoS2, Mo in green, S in yellow Transition metal dichalcogenides Transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers (TMDs or TMDCs) are a class of two-dimensional materials, which have the chemical formula MX2, where M represents transition metals from group VI, V and VI, and X represents a chalcogen such as sulfur, selenium or tellurium. MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2 and WSe2 are TMDCs. TMDCs have layered structure with a plane of metal atoms in between two planes of chalcogen atoms as shown in Figure 1. Each layer is bonded strongly in plane, but weakly in interlayers. Therefore, TMDCs can be easily exfoliated into atomically thin layers through various methods. TMDCs show layer-dependent optical and electrical properties. When exfoliated into monolayers, the band gaps of several TMDCs change from indirect to direct, which lead to broad applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and quantum computing . Synthesis CVD setup for MoS2 synthesis 2D semiconductor materials are often synthesized using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Because CVD can provide large-area, high- quality, and well-controlled layered growth of 2D semiconductor materials, it also allows synthesis of two-dimensional heterojunctions. When building devices by stacking different 2D materials, mechanical exfoliation followed by transferring is often used. Other possible synthesis methods include chemical exfoliation, hydrothermal synthesis, and thermal decomposition. Device applications Proposed TMDC-based high-electron-mobility transistor device with top-gated Schottky contact and TMDC layers with different doping levels. Some devices applications include electronic devices, photonic and energy harvesting devices, and flexible and transparent substrates. Furthermore, applications on quantum computing qubit devices have been proposed. Electronic devices 2D Semiconductors can be used as transistors for digital electronics. The impure charges at the interfaces that are free of dangling bonds, allow for 2D semiconductors to run low-power devices. The 2D semiconductor interface has future potential in nano circuits due to its ability to optimize and regulate thermal transfer. Energy and harvesting devices 2D semiconductors have potential for application in the harvesting of solar energy. The atomically thin structure allows for lower surface recombination velocity, which leads to better photocurrent conduction. An improvement on solar cell performance has been shown, while stacking 2D semiconductors with multilayers of graphene. Flexible and transparent substrates The thin layer of 2D materials can be used for flexible electronics. In particular, 2D MoS2 can be used to create thin displays and wearable electronics due to its out of plane flexibility, strong covalent bonds, and diverse electronic properties. Proposed vdW qubit composed of ZrSe2/SnSe2. The electrode VG applies the vertical electric field, changing the state of the electron in the conduction band, represented by the green Bloch sphere. Zr, Sn, and Se in red, blue, and gray, respectively. Quantum computing Theoretical work has predicted the control of the band edges hybridization on some van der Waals heterostructures via electric fields and proposed its usage in quantum bit devices, considering the ZrSe2/SnSe2 heterobilayer as an example. Further experimental work has confirmed these predictions for the case of the MoS2/WS2 heterobilayer. Magnetic NEMS 2D layered magnetic materials are attractive building blocks for nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS): while they share high stiffness and strength and low mass with other 2D materials, they are magnetically active. Among the large class of newly emerged 2D layered magnetic materials, of particular interest is few-layer CrI3, whose magnetic ground state consists of antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic (FM) monolayers with out-of-plane easy axis. The interlayer exchange interaction is relatively weak, a magnetic field on the order of 0.5 T in the out-of-plane (ùíõ) direction can induce spin- flip transition in bilayer CrI3. Remarkable phenomena and device concepts based on detecting and controlling the interlayer magnetic state have been recently demonstrated, including spin-filter giant magnetoresistance, magnetic switching by electric field or electrostatic doping, and spin transistors. The coupling between the magnetic and mechanical properties in atomically thin materials, the basis for 2D magnetic NEMS, however, remains elusive although NEMS made of thicker magnetic materials or coated with FM metals have been studied.

Alternative purchase networks aim to promote ethical shopping behaviour, which has an environmentally-friendly approach and considers local realities.  Aims  Indeed, undertaking an economic action in favour of local environment is ‚Äúone of the aspirations of alternative and critical consumer practices‚Äù. Furthermore, ‚Äúa global humanitarian consumer-citizenship may require a further economic disentanglement, as it commands growth rates and volumes for green and ethical products which are at odds with small-scale local production‚Äù. Alternative products are commodities which embody a critical dialogue with many aspects of commoditization: they are concerned with the length of commodity chains, the environmental and human costs and the importance of nature and health. Role of the consumer The importance of the consumer‚Äôs role within economics is rapidly growing: indeed, the consumer has been becoming an active, moral and political subject. It‚Äôs necessary to consider that ‚Äòto buy is to vote‚Äô: when someone buys a good, he votes ‚Äúyes‚Äù; when he decides not to buy a product, he votes ‚Äúno‚Äù, forcing the companies to diversify into products he prefer, or to change some features of the good. According to consumers‚Äô votes, we have to consider the concept of elegant sufficiency, which is ‚Äúa mixture of environmentalism [‚Ä¶] and detachment from mass fashion. Its emphasis is on choice as a political and ethical process‚Äù. The consumer can do three different actions to influence the market: * Positive buying: he/she can buy things made ethically by ethical companies * Negative purchasing: he/she can avoid the products he/she disapproves of * Boycotting: he/she can decide not to buy things that are produced by unethical companies From a sociological point of view, consumers are considered citizens because they can influence politics, economics and culture through their choices and activities: in fact, every consumer can make a difference with every product he/she buys. An ethical consumer ought to consider not only the actual cost of a product, but also the sustainability cost of his choice, for example in terms of pollution generated by the production, the non-renewable resources used in manufacturing and distribution and the workers‚Äô conditions. In fact, the parameters used to choose a product are no longer price and quantity, like the neoclassical economics and the free-market rules promote; ethical consumers want to get closer to producers, relying on new forms of distribution, to shorten commodity chains, which limit consumers‚Äô choices and increase the pollution, to take back the production process. When we think about the critical development of the consumer‚Äôs role, there are two main socio-political trends to consider: ‚Äúthe process of individualization, on the one hand, whereby social actors are increasingly reflexive about their everyday identities, values and actions, and, on the other, the process of sub-politicization, whereby politics is emerging in places other than the formal political arena (sub-politics) because citizens no longer think that traditional forms of political participation are adequate‚Äù. Main purposes  It is important to consider that the concept of never-ending development is a utopia, that sooner or later the available resources will finish. One solution could be sustaining de-growth and sobriety: we should choose quality over quantity and most of all we should be aware of the products we consume, ‚Äúagainst a fictitious, fake overabundance‚Äù. Despite the differences between the various types of APN, it is useful to consider the main characteristics of them. In fact, the different forms of APN act according to their overt target, (the consumer, nature, or the community) and their aim: fighting the capitalist market, protecting the local markets and communities, supporting the less developed countries, providing alternative forms of integration in a contemporary capitalist culture. The fragmentation and the conflicts between the different alternative purchase practices render ‚Äúthe formation of viable collective identities rather difficult‚Äù. Alternative purchase networks, indeed, not only respond to a politically conscious middle-class consumer (who is mainly interested in ethical food consumption), but also to disadvantaged groups who can‚Äôt use the traditional market channels (mainly regarding second-hand shops and ethical finance). Furthermore, not all the ethical consumers are interested in the same features: there are some of them who, for example, check only the organic provenience of food; others, instead, also want to know the working conditions of who has produced this good, and the length of the commodity chains. There are some ethical shopping guides, such as Ethical Consumer, whose aim is giving information about ethical producers and products, chosen through a variety of ethical criteria. They include the impact on the environment, on animals and on human beings. Main areas   Trade and finance  For what concerns social and ethical movements, two of the most representative are ethical finance and the fair trade market. Ethical banking is used to express particular ways of working with money, based on non-financial deliberations; it provides direct finance through lending and risking capital to fulfil the financial needs of selected organizations and businesses. The cooperative movement from the beginning of the 20th century is an example of how essential needs can be satisfied through forms of collaboration. Modern forms of cooperation, such as the fair trade and microfinance movements, combining economic and social values, are important steps for solidarity in a global economic context. Both the cooperative movement and the new social movements from the sixties have developed a practice of ethical banking. Cooperative banks and new social banks co-exist, while some mainstream banks have become aware of business opportunities in this sector. In terms of ethical finance, the revolutionary system of micro-credit, created by the economist and Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, has allowed entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans to receive small loans. Fair trade market is an interesting example of alternative purchase networks because it extends its principles and practices to all manner of foods, handicrafts, and manufactured goods. Fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers ‚Äì especially in the South. Developing from political solidarity movements in the sixties, its main purpose is to replace the conventional international trading system. The World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), which operates in over 70 countries across 5 regions, is a global network of organizations representing the Fair Trade supply chain. There are ten Principles of fair trade in order to be part of the WFTO guaranteed by the Guarantee System: * Principle One: creating opportunities for economically disadvantaged producers * Principle Two: transparency and accountability * Principle Three: fair trading practices * Principle Four: payment of a fair price * Principle Five: ensuring no child labour and forced labour * Principle Six: commitment to non discrimination, gender equity and women‚Äôs economic empowerment, and freedom of association * Principle Seven: ensuring good working conditions * Principle Eight: providing capacity building * Principle Nine: promoting fair trade * Principle Ten: respect for the environment  Food  One of the main areas of interest of APN is the food economy. According to ethical criteria, alternative food networks promote a consumption of food closer to producers, which wants to shorten commodity chains and change consumers‚Äô culture and behaviour. In the last few decades, there has been an explosion of organic, fair trade, local and quality food. Following these criteria, we can consider some organizations and projects related to alternative food networks: * Slow Food organization was born to preserve the local food traditions and regional environmental specificity. In only a few years, Slow Food has become an international subject: it has involved local food ways and cultures from all over the world. The birth of Slow Food is one of the most important recent events ‚Äúto mark a shift in the dynamics of Americanization‚Äù. The Convivia are the local sections of Slow Food, coordinated by the headquarters in Bra. The Presidia are the Slow Food‚Äôs projects to protect local, marginal and fine tasting products, in the North and the South of the world. The International Hall of taste is a biannual meeting between ethical producers and consumers who have adopted the notion of eco-gastronomy: as the founder Carlo Petrini said, ‚Äúagriculture and ecology are part of gastronomy because they help us understand where our food comes from and produce it in the best possible way‚Äù. Another important element of Slow Food is Terra Madre, a charity born in 2004: its main purposes are giving voice to farmers, local producers, fishermen, breeders, sustaining their fundamental job, creating the best conditions for workers. Now Terra Madre is becoming a global network. * Community-Supported Agriculture (CPA) are groups of ethical consumers who criticize the traditional market and its rules. So they buy some products directly from the producers. The criteria followed to choose their suppliers are usually local products, small producers, organic products, workers‚Äô fair conditions, social cooperatives‚Äô products. * Vegetable box schemes allow receiving periodically a box of fresh fruit and vegetables in season, usually organic and locally grown, directly from the producers. * Farmers‚Äô markets shorten commodity chains because they allow a direct link between consumers and producers.  Fashion  Another important area of interest of alternative purchase networks is the one related to fashion industry. Despite the urgent need to reduce waste and conserve finite natural resources in order to develop a sustainable future, consumers from developed affluent nations are rapidly increasing their excessive consumption. The consumption of second-hand clothing is a sustainable alternative to the consumption of new clothes and to reduce the negative impact on the environment and on people of fast fashion industry. In fact, by reusing and re-adopting existing garments, the demand for new clothing production is reduced. (see used goods and second hand). In some cases the consumption of second-hand goods and clothes through alternative purchase networks can be related to charity initiatives. This is, for example, the case of Oxfam‚Äôs shops, which sell used items and fair trade products from developing country (especially books, clothes and toys). Products usually come from public donations and the proceeds are used by Oxfam to help needy people to improve their lives conditions. A generally more active approach to ownership or non-ownership is shown also through swapping that is particularly common with clothes (see clothing swap), and this not only through privately or publicly organized clothing swap parties, but also increasingly as a business model in the form of shops and online swapping platforms. Swapping has several benefits because reusing a product, rather than buying a new one, reduces the demands for water, energy and raw materials. Purchasing second- hand goods is increasing, also thanks to some second-hand buying and selling sites which can be used with an Internet connection all over the world. The most famous sites are eBay and Amazon, where it is possible to buy new or used products belonging to different categories. An interesting novelty is Depop, an app through which customers can easily buy or sell used objects, especially clothes.

She is currently signed to WWE where she is performing on the NXT brand under the ring name Aliyah.  Early life  Nhooph Al-Areebi was born in Toronto, Ontario. She is of Syrian and Iraqi descent and grew up in a strict, conservative family. In 2012, she graduated from St. Joseph's College School, and later attended George Brown College, where she studied nursing. She also attended a circus training school.  Professional wrestling career   Independent circuit (2013‚Äì2015)  Al- Areebi wrestled on the independent circuit under the ring name Jasmin Areebi, debuting for Squared Circle Wrestling (SCW) in Toronto in January 2013. She wrestled for a variety of promotions in Canada and the United States, including Pure Wrestling Association (PWA), Absolute Intense Wrestling (AIW), and New England Championship Wrestling (NECW).  WWE  = NXT (2015‚Äìpresent) = Aliyah in 2015 On March 17, 2015, it was reported that Al‚ÄìAreebi had signed a developmental contract with WWE. Her signing was confirmed by WWE on April 13. She made her first appearance at the NXT TakeOver: Unstoppable event on May 20, as part of Tyler Breeze's entrance. She made her in‚Äìring debut on June 20 during an NXT live event, where she competed in a six‚Äìperson tag team match. In October, she was given the ring name Aliyah. Aliyah's television debut took place on the January 13, 2016, episode of NXT, where she competed in a number one contender's battle royal for Bayley's NXT Women's Championship, which was won by Carmella. On the April 27 episode of NXT, Aliyah competed in her first televised singles match, where she lost to Carmella. Towards the end of the year, Aliyah debuted new ring gear and entrance music, leaving her Arabian gimmick, and picked up her first victory as part of the brand, as she defeated Billie Kay after a distraction by Liv Morgan, only for both of them to be attacked by Kay and Peyton Royce. This set a six‚Äìwoman tag team match between Aliyah, Morgan and Ember Moon against The Iconic Duo (Kay and Royce) and Daria Berenato, that was taped on NXT TakeOver: Toronto on November 19, where Aliyah's team was victorious. On January 3, 2017, Aliyah made her first main roster appearance as she appeared on SmackDown Live, where she lost to Carmella. Throughout 2018, Aliyah continued losing to various competitors such as Lacey Evans, Ember Moon and Mae Young Classic winner Kairi Sane, while also showing signs of a heel turn. In September, Aliyah, now officially working as a heel, started a short alliance with Evans, and the two had an altercation with Dakota Kai and Deonna Purrazzo, which led to a tag team match, where Aliyah and Evans were victorious, making Aliyah's first victory in over a year. After some time away, on the February 13, 2019, episode of NXT, Aliyah returned working full- time, as she defeated Taynara Conti after interference from Vanessa Borne. The duo then started an alliance and picked up their first victory against Conti and Xia Li, two weeks later on the February 27 episode. In mid November on an episode of WWE NXT, Aliyah went up against Xia Li in a losing effort, Li had kayfabe injured Aliyah‚Äôs nose in the process with a spin kick. This was done to write Aliyah off television, so that she could get surgery on her nose. Aliyah returned to in-ring competition in 2020 on the March 25 edition of NXT, where she lost to Io Shirai in a qualifying match. Aliyah had a match a few weeks later against Li in a losing effort. On the May 6 episode of NXT, she helped Chelsea Green get a victory over Li and tried to get on the Robert Stone Brand. The following week, on the May 13 episode of NXT, she tried to impress Stone in a match against Kayden Carter which she lost. When she tried to ask him if she could join his brand, he turned her down. Stone eventually changed his mind and officially joined forces with Aliyah on the June 17 episode of NXT, after he helped her get a victory over Xia Li. Aliyah and Stone would feud with Rhea Ripley as she lost to her on the June 24 episode of NXT. The following week on Night 1 of NXT: The Great American Bash, Aliyah competed alongside Stone against Ripley in a handicap match, with the stipulation that if Ripley lost then she would join the Robert Stone Brand, but they were defeated.  Personal life  Al-Areebi first decided she wanted to become a wrestler after watching Beth Phoenix and Mickie James compete at a taping of Raw on May 5, 2008. Her favorite wrestlers include Edge and Jeff Hardy. In September 2015, a number of racially insensitive comments made several years prior on Al-Areebi's Twitter account were discovered. WWE subsequently issued a statement regarding the controversy, stating that her account was used by another person at the time.

Recycling appliances for their original or other purposes, involves disassembly, removal of hazardous components and destruction of the equipment to recover materials, generally by shredding, sorting and grading. The rate at which appliances are discarded has increased with technological advancement. This correlation directly leads to the question of appropriate disposal. The main types of appliances that are recycled are televisions, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, and computers. When appliances are recycled, they can be looked upon as valuable resources. If disposed of improperly, appliances can become environmentally harmful and poison ecosystems. The strength of appliance recycling legislation and the percentage of appliances recycled varies around the world. Disassembly A key part of appliance recycling is the manual dismantling of each product. The disassembly removes hazardous components, while sorting out reusable parts. Procedures vary and depends on the appliance type. The amount of hazardous components able to be removed also depends on the type of appliance. Low removal rates of hazardous components reduce the recyclability of valuable materials. Each type of appliance has its own set of characteristics and components. This makes characterization of appliances essential to sorting and separating parts. Research on appliance dismantling has become an active area, intending to help recycling reach maximum efficiency. Classification There is a certain process used to recover materials from appliances. Parts are generally removed in order from largest to smallest. Metals are extracted first and then plastics. Materials are sorted by either size, shape, or density. Sizing is a good means of sorting to quicken future processing. It also classifies fractions that show composition. Materials report to larger or finer fractions based on original dimension, toughness, or brittleness. Shape classification contributes to the dynamics of the material. Classification by density is important when it comes to determining the use of a material. Example Batteries and copper are sorted out first for quality control purposes. The materials are then compacted. Next, iron and steel (ferrous metals) are extracted using electromagnets. They are collected and made ready for sale. Then metals are separated from non-metals using eddy currents. Eddy currents are created by rapidly alternating magnetic fields, which induce metals to jump away from non-metals. Then water separation is used to sort plastics and glass from circuit boards and copper wires. Circuit boards and copper content is then sold. Plastics and glass are further compacted for reuse.WEEE Recycling Process. (2014). Retrieved April 7, 2015, from Sims Recycling Solutions Centres website: http://www.simsrecycling.co.uk/Resources/WEEE- recycling-process Recycling by region Although appliance recycling is relatively new, several countries have enacted laws and regulations regarding electric waste. The first countries to establish home appliance recycling included Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany. European Union In 2003 Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) passed into European Law. It sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for all types of electrical goods. Japan By the 1950s and 60s Japan had already become a major producer of electric appliances. The first initiatives to recycle were launched in the 70s. Due to costs, disassembly was hardly achievable. The Home Appliance Recycling Law was enacted in 1998 and came into force in 2001, and recycling of waste electrics became a legal requirement under the Specific Household Appliance Recycling Law and the Law for Promotion of Effective Utilisation Resources. Appliance manufacturers are now required to finance the recycling of their products. The Association for Electric Home Appliances is a trade group that is responsible for orphaned products. China China produces a significant proportion of the world's appliances, and imports a large quantity of waste appliances. There has not been much progress in appliance recycling efficiency. China's undeveloped dismantling and processing has led to elevated levels of toxic chemicals in near waste appliance sites. United States The United States is the largest waste appliance producer in the world, however there is still no federal law requiring appliance recycling and its legislation varies between states. On a state level, many mandatory electronic recovery programs have been implemented. There are also several commercial appliance recyclers. =California= In 2003, the California Electronic Waste Recycling Act was signed. It established a new program for consumers to return, recycle, and ensure the safe and environmentally sound disposal of video display devices, such as televisions and computer monitors, that are hazardous wastes when discarded.Electronic Hazardous Waste. (2010). Retrieved from Department of Toxic Substances Control website: http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/hazardouswaste/ewaste/ In 2005, consumers began paying a 6-10 dollar fee when buying an electronic device. These fees are used to pay e-waste collectors and recyclers to cover their cost of managing e-waste. The EWRA classifies e-waste by dividing the products into two categories: electronic devices and covered electronic devices. Only covered electronic devices (CEDs) are included in the EWRA, however all electronic devices needed recycling measures to be taken. The CEDs include televisions and computers that have LCD displays or contain cathode ray tubes. Australia There are several commercial appliance recyclers in Australia. Some organisations that remove waste appliances and offer government-sponsored rebates. Some retailers including Appliances Online remove and recycle customers' old appliances. New Zealand In New Zealand there is a push to keep old appliances and e-waste out of landfills, however there is little legislation to preventing this. As in Australia there are companies including the manufacturer Fisher and Paykel that remove waste appliances and recycle them. EPR Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is defined as an environmental protection strategy that makes the manufacturer of the appliance responsible for its entire life cycle and especially for the ‚Äútake-back‚Äù, recycling and final disposal of the product. Essentially, manufacturers must now finance product treatment and recycling. Countries where this strategy has been adopted for waste appliances are: Switzerland (1998), Denmark (1999), Netherlands (1999), Norway (1999), Belgium (2001), Japan (2001), Sweden (2001) and Germany (2005), but it has also been expanded through legislation among certain South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Countries in which EPR has long been established, demonstrate that the combination of government legislation and sound company practices can produce a higher take-back and recycling rate. An example of this is the Sony Corporation in Japan, achieving a 53% recycling rate. Other ways countries approach the issue of waste appliances is either by offering recycling facilities or banning importation. Almost all countries, at least offer facilities that aid in appliance recycling. Many implement extended producer responsibility, in addition to recycling facilities.

He was one of the leaders of the 1596/97 peasant uprising, the Cudgel War. Year of Pouttu's birth is unknown. Pouttu was known as the \\"political leader\\" of the cudgel war since he was one of the first peasant leader who organized the resistance in Storkyro and sailed to Stockholm to complain to Duke Charles (Hertig Karl). Since a peasant rebellion in Ostrobothnia would benefit his plan to take over the rule from Sigismund, (king of Poland and Sweden) he signed a letter giving the peasants right to stop the injustices. Although this didn¬¥t help much and a few years later in August 1596 they did another trip to Stockholm and was told by duke Charles to \\"Answer violence with violence, and chase away those unlawful residents\\". Then the cudgel war was a reality, a former soldier in the Swedish army and wealthy landowner Jaakko Ilkka took command of the peasant army. It is said that Pouttu should have complained since he had more experience leading the rebellion. Although he had no formal combat training and was of Swedish origin which was a disadvantage since most of the peasant rebels was Finnish speaking. After Jaaku Ilkka was chosen as the leader they agreed that Pouttu should take charge of the Swedish speaking peasants along the coast recruiting them along the way and marsh towards Turku castle where the two peasant armies should meet. Although only about 200 of the Swedish speaking population joined the Cudgel war. This must have been expected since they didn¬¥t suffer as much as for example the Finnish speaking population near the Russian border. Pouttu must also have known that an armed rebellion was a suicide mission and he was promoting negotiation instead of violence. Although he had an early success in evicting some soldiers occupying his home in Pouttula near Storkyro. Pouttu¬¥s mark They were marching from Ostrobothnia to the province of Satakunta. On 20 December 1596, Pouttu and his men reached the Anola mansion in Ulvila. Their intention was to persuade the colonel Axel Kurck to join the rebellions, but he stayed loyal to the king Sigismund III. The peasants were beaten by Kurck's cavalry and Pouttu was captured. He was held at the Turku castle where Pouttu is said to have been \\"eaten by flees\\" and probably died in 1597.

AdmitSee is a database of successful college application essays and resumes. The service allows college applicants to read applications and resumes of accepted students. They browse basic profiles for free, and then pay to access full application files, including essays and advice; half of this money gets paid to the college students who shared their content. Applicants can also communicate directly with verified college students via the paid mentor messaging feature. As of January 2016, the platform has over 50,000 application files and over 100,000 active users. AdmitSee uses official school IDs to verify student profiles and facilitates universities screening for plagiarism.  Founding  The company was founded by Lydia Fayal and Stephanie Shyu in 2013 while attending law school at the University of Pennsylvania. The idea to create a database of application files came from Fayal's work as a college consultant when clients would ask how they compared to other applicants. After meeting at a Wharton event, the classmates expanded the idea to include peer mentoring and big data analysis. The founders were introduced in 2013 to founding engineer, Jerry Huyghe, who built the initial version of the website. The company advanced to the final round of the Wharton Business Plan Competition in 2014. Early funding for the company came from Founder.org and the edtech accelerator Imagine K12. The company raised $1.8million seed funding in 2015 with plans to build a lead generation offering. Earlier in 2015, Fayal and Shyu were named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list as influencers in the field of education. The founders credit early traction to their virtual internship program, which they modeled after oDesk and to early adoption of online communities, such as Reddit.  Reception  Press for AdmitSee includes USA Today lauding its plagiarism prevention methods and calling AdmitSee a \\"must-visit site this application season.\\" News coverage has tended to focus on the company's published data, which include linguistic analysis of the site's repository of essays and of survey responses.

It has a general orientation of north-northeast to south-southwest, taking water from the now dry Pie Noire (or Pinnoire),Michel Provost, Carte arch√©ologique de la Gaule - L'Indre-et-Loire, Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, 1988, p108-109. and is believed to have supplied water to ancient Luynes,Michel Laurencin, L'aqueduc gallo-romain de Luynes et l'antique Maillacum, Revue arch√©ologique du Centre, vol6 1967], p. 195-204. or even Caesarodunum.Michel Provost, Carte arch√©ologique de la Gaule - L'Indre-et-Loire, Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres,1988, p109.

Singleton has co-produced and/or engineered almost every Robert Fripp release (including King Crimson albums, EPs and archive releases) since 1992, and has also worked on releases by Bill Nelson, Bill Bruford, Europa String Choir and many others.\\"The Vicar Songbook ‚Äì Tuesday 30th April 2.30 pm at Dolby HQ, 4‚Äì6 Soho Square, W1 ‚Äì RSVP\\" ‚Äì press release at Phill Savidge PR In addition to his production and label administration work, Singleton has pursued an intermittent career as musician and songwriter. He released a solo single in the early 1980s and was part of the 1990s art-pop band Camilla's Little Secret. His work as producer has extended beyond executive and technical roles to embrace creative musical collaborations, generally using his skills as an audio technician and an aficionado of found sound. Singleton has collaborated with King Crimson (as re-arranger/re-composer of band material) on several albums released during the 1990s and 2000s. Singleton currently releases his own material under the alias of The Vicar ‚Äì a multimedia project persona that has produced a story blog and videoblogs, printed fiction, graphic novels, and song albums. Early career and production work, The Mobile (1981‚Äì1990) David Singleton was educated at St Johns College, Cambridge, where he studied philosophy and occasionally wrote and performed his own songs. His first release as a musician and songwriter was the single \\"If You Can Sing in Tune/Lazy Bugger\\", recorded and released in 1981 while he was still an undergraduate. Following graduation, Singleton worked as a teacher. In early 1984, while living in the Dorset village of Lytchett Matravers, he opted to change career and work as an audio engineer and record producer, setting up a 16-track studio called The Mobile inside a former mobile dental clinic caravan. While the Mobile was initially based in Lytchett Matravers, Singleton later re-situated it in the Courtyard Crafts Centre in nearby Lytchett Minster.\\"New Arts & Craft centre\\" ‚Äìarticle in Bournemouth Evening Echo, Tuesday 4 February 1987 Singleton's aim was to provide a potentially mobile recording service at a much lower cost than a standard studio, and to use this to encourage people and organisations with lower budgets to make recordings. To this end, he persuaded various recording equipment companies to sell him second-hand ex-demonstration equipment at a greatly reduced price: the proviso which he used to seal the deal was that the equipment would be used to record work by young people who might retain their interest in recording and thus become company customers in the future. In keeping with this initial pledge, early work with the Mobile included a recording of Britten's Noye's Fludde made at the Blandford Music Festival (released as an in-house recording) and assorted work with schools. Singleton also contributed outreach work at Youth Training Schemes encouraging young trainees towards their own careers in music production.\\"Breaking the sound barrier\\" ‚Äì article in Bournemouth Evening Echo, Friday 5 September 1986 In 1987, Singleton wrote a set of his own songs with the intent of recording them with a large communal group of Dorset musicians. Although the project was never completed, some of the songs written at this time were revisited several decades later for the Vicar project. Discipline Global Mobile and Ton Prob (1991‚Äìpresent) In October 1990, Singleton applied to work with art rock guitarist Robert Fripp (best known for his work as the leader of King Crimson and as a collaborator with David Bowie) who needed a live sound engineer at short notice in the middle of a tour with his Guitar Craft ensemble League of Crafty Guitarists. The two men quickly established a rapport, and Fripp subsequently hired Singleton to work on the 1991 King Crimson compilation Frame by Frame: The Essential King Crimson, to engineer, master and mix Kneeling at the Shrine (the lone 1991 album by the Fripp/Toyah band Sunday All Over the World) and to mix Show of Hands (the second album by The League of Crafty Guitarists). At the time, Fripp (who was living in the town of Wimborne Minster) was a near-neighbour of Singleton's and the duo soon joined forces as a permanent and equal partnership of complementary, overlapping skills and ideas. Consequently, Singleton has co-produced and/or engineered almost every subsequent Robert Fripp release, including the vast majority of King Crimson albums, EPs and archive releases since the start of the 1990s. In 1992 Fripp and Singleton founded both the Ton Prob production partnership and the record label Discipline Global Mobile (DGM), both of which have continued to the present day. DGM was explicitly set up as \\"a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed\\". The label was structured so as to operate within the marketplace without being dictated by commercialism, and to encourage development within three fields (within music, within a developing and sought-out audience, and within the personal lives of those working as part of the label). according to During this period Singleton worked with assorted DGM-signed artists (Trey Gunn, California Guitar Trio, Gitbox, Tony Geballe, Jacob Heringman, Ten Seconds) as well as The Orb (via the Fripp/Orb/Thomas Fehlmann collaboration FFWD) and Bill Nelson (musician), and worked on archive recordings by King Crimson, The League of Gentlemen and The League of Crafty Guitarists. Post-1998, his production clients have included past and present King Crimson frontmen John Wetton and Jakko Jakszyk and classic American songwriter Melanie. In 1996, Singleton was responsible for digitally collating, editing, re-arranging and partly re-composing a set of King Crimson live improvisations from their 1995 tour. This was released as the live album Thrakattak and was Singleton's first collaboration with King Crimson as a co-writer and performer (albeit at the post-production stage). He would follow this up in 2003 with a similar task on The Power to Believe, reworking a Robert Fripp soundscape to produce the album's final track. Camilla's Little Secret (1992‚Äì1994) In 1992 (at around the same time that he and Fripp were first founding DGM) Singleton joined keyboard player and arranger Toby Campling-Richard's band Camilla's Little Secret as bass guitarist/pianist/co-producer. As well as Campling-Richards and Singleton, the band also featured Sunday All Over the World's drummer Paul Beavis and two singers (Martin Rawle and Georgia Lewis) with Fripp making occasional guest appearance on guitar under the pseudonym of Bobby Wilcox. The first release by Camilla's Little Secret was the single \\"BEA\\" later in 1992. In March 1993 the band recorded and released a second single, a double-A-side on vinyl called \\"Tantalising Eyes\\", marketed with the tagline \\"Are you bored hearing the same guitar solo every time? There is now a record that can change every time you play it! Put it on your turntable and be amazed!\\" This effect was achieved by cutting two parallel concentric grooves on each side of the disc instead of the usual one, and pressing a different version of the song into each one ‚Äì the result being that the single actually offered four detailed variations on the song, with a gramophone stylus likely to fit into and trace a different groove each time that the disc was played.\\"Groovy secret of record that changes tune\\", article by Julian Champkin in Daily Mail, 1993Camilla's Little Secret ‚Äì Tantalizing Eyes @ Discogs.com Camilla's Little Secret went on to record an album ‚Äì 1994's The Steps ‚Äì before breaking up. \\"Tantalising Eyes\\" was re-released as a vinyl single in April 2015, as part of Record Store Day 2015. BootlegTV (1999‚Äì2001) In 1999, inspired in part by his ongoing work on reclaiming and remastering King Crimson's unreleased live recordings, Singleton (together with graphic designer Steve Ball) developed the idea of BootlegTV ‚Äì an online music distribution service and video sharing website dedicated to archived live concerts. BootlegTV was originally envisaged as \\"(a way) to use the web to enable distribution of live music in a way that would undermine the illegal bootleg market while giving musicians an opportunity to manage and monetize a previously difficult-to-distribute asset that (was) gathering dust in their closet: their live concert recordings.\\" Singleton also aimed to develop it as an appropriate business & distribution structure attuned to the original aims of DGM but incorporating new technology-driven changes. Based in Seattle, the project was launched in November 1999 with the taglines \\"the beginning of the end of bootlegs\\" and \\"the evolution will be televised.\\" An advertisement in Billboard magazine explained the idea in greater depth ‚Äì \\"Your fans love a great bootleg. We'll make sure you get both the love and the money. At BootlegTV, we're about protecting the intellectual property of creative artists and rightful copyright holders. We're also about uniting new media, art and commerce in a way that makes the concert experience available to fans anywhere, anytime. As a result, artists reach a wider audience and everyone gets their due.\\" Besides Singleton, Ball and Fripp, other people contributing to the project were filmmaker Kenneth Thomas and sound designer Guy Whitmore.\\"Blood, Sweat, and Video Cameras\\" ‚Äì article by Kathleen Richards in East Bay Express, 5 October 2011 The BootlegTV roster was spearheaded by King Crimson (who committed footage of virtually all of their 2000 tour to the company) and other DGM acts. Other bands who signed up to the roster included The Tragically Hip. Other ideas considered for development by the company included investigations into a standalone form of \\"non-linear music\\" and the provision of a video connection between artists and audience to allow the latter to follow the former's day-to-day developing work. Despite raising four million dollars in initial investment, BootlegTV folded in 2001, due a reluctance on the part of investors to continue supporting the original business plan. Fripp would later reflect that the concept had arrived too early and would have required broadband technology (which, at the time, was not widely available) to succeed. For several years, BootlegTV continued as a technology company called Bootleg Networks (championing the development of broadband and building tools to allow other companies to catalogue and stream their video archive content) although Singleton's involvement would be reduced. Although initially unsuccessful, BootlegTV's ideas anticipated later video sharing websites and digitally distributed audio-visual musician initiatives including YouTube, Live Phish Downloads and Pearl Jam Live. The Vicar (2001‚Äìpresent) In 2001, Singleton began working under the persona of \\"The Vicar\\", an eccentric and imaginary record producer. Initially a pseudonym for Singleton's diary on the DGM website, the persona developed into a multimedia project which incorporated satirical \\"whodunit\\" novels set in the music industry, a graphic novel, videoblogs and Singleton's own songwriting career. From 2001, several incidents of Singleton's production work on King Crimson or Robert Fripp releases were credited to the Vicar, and Singleton also used the persona as a production alias for the 2005 School Aid single 'Where's the Money, Mr Blair?' From 2003 onwards, Singleton's mystery stories about the Vicar (incorporating and narrated by the Vicar's alleged assistant Punk Sanderson) were published as instalments on the Vicar's diary page; from 2007 onwards, the stories were reposted as a video blog presented and narrated by Punk.Preface to Chronicle the First: The Mysterious Case Of Billy's G String by Punk Sanderson (from The Vicar's Diary, DGM homepage (diaries section), 23 September 2003) Various publicity stunts and culture-jamming incidents followed, ostensibly carried out by Punk: these included a period of incarceration within Facebook, 2013‚Äôs \\"Fart For Your Rights\\" campaign (a mock dirty protest aimed at Universal Music Group, who were at the time selling King Crimson's music without a proper legal agreement or due remuneration) and a 2014 iTunes app of drummer jokes. The first Vicar single, \\"Count Your Blessings\\" was released in 2010, with the debut Vicar album Songbook #1 following three years later in 2013. A second Vicar album, Songbook #2 is currently being recorded. In 2015, Singleton launched the \\"Be the Singer\\"/\\"V Factor\\" initiative (inviting members of the public to record vocals to existing Vicar backing tracks, with the best performers to be invited to record material for Songbook #2) and an \\"#IamTheVicar\\" instagram campaign in which fans could photograph themselves obscuring their faces (a Vicar visual trademark) to appear on the cover of future Vicar releases.

The current building is a domed facility that includes a 3400-seat sanctuary. Hudson retired June 3, 1990 due to health problems. Rev. Bradley Price succeeded Hudson. Price left in 1998 after attendance had dropped to 2000 and membership was 4000. Though he said he was not \\"forced out\\", there was controversy during his final months. While Price described himself as \\"exhausted\\", he felt better after several months and, after he was asked to start a new church, King's Way Baptist began in a hotel in 1999 with 262 members, many who followed him from Northside. By the time Rev. Dan Burrell took over as pastor, attendance was down to 1100. Northside started Northside Christian Academy. Northside had over 2000 members as of 2007.

San Jos√© Fort was located where later Guatemalan administrations built a new city Hall, a National Theater and part of the Bolivar Avenue. The fort had a shooting range for the soldiers, ammunition warehouses, horses, diners and a small pond that was called \\"Soldier's Pond\\".  History   Construction  Castle in 1907. Guatemala City in the early 20th century. The fort had a privileged view of the whole city and the surrounding valley at the time. Captain General Rafael Carrera, president for life of Guatemala. He had the fort built in 1846. The fort was located on the south extreme of Guatemala City and was placed at least 20 m above the level of the rest of the valley, giving it a great military advantage during the 19th century, when it was built as it could cover the whole valley and the city. During the first invasion of Honduran general Francisco Moraz√°n in 1829, the Buena Vista hill was used to strategically place some troops, which eventually helped for the defeat of the Guatemalan Army and in the expulsion of the regular clergy and the conservative part conformed by the Aycinena family. and the imposition of the liberal regime led by Dr.Mariano G√°lvez in the Central American State of Guatemala. After the events that led Rafael Carrera to power in 1839 and after the failed second invasion of Moraz√°n in 1840, general Carrera considered of the utmost importance to protect Guatemala City building a series of fortresses around it; San Jos√© Fort was the first one built. In 1843, Carrera appointed the city builder Jos√© Mar√≠a Cervantes to design and build a fort on the Buena Vista hill. Construction took about three years, and it was done as fast as possible due to the constant revolts in the country, like the ones of the Lucios and of the Cruz brothers in eastern Guatemala. Originally, the fort had a bridge, it was surrounded by water and had impressive protective walls. Carrera opened the fort on 25 May 1846, with a mass in the old El Calvario church, which used to be close by the fort; a procession of the Virgin of Santa Barbabra left the church and ended at the Fort wall, where it was blessed and remained during the time the fort was active. A year later, San Jos√© fort was already the most important ammunition warehouse in Guatemala.  Military service  By 1852 the name ¬´San Jos√©¬ª was already common for all the Guatemala City inhabitants, even though the military referred to it as the \\"Santa Barbara Artillery Brigade\\". By then, Carrera already used the building as prison for those that opposed his regime. In 1854, after destroying and moving to Guatemala the artillery of Honduras Omoa Castle, Carrera used San Jos√© to settle all the equipment.these artillery pieces remained at the fort until they were melted by general Jos√© Mar√≠a Orellana in 1923 to make one cent Quetzal coins. In 1866 sergeant Emilio Rasc√≥n was appointed as fort commander, establishing very rigid discipline.  Tragic week April 9‚Äì14, 1920  = April 9, 1920 = Fifth avenue of Guatemala City in 1911.

The prince was in Guatemala during the Tragic Week and wrote his experiences from it in his book Between two continents. Aerial view of San Jos√© castle in the 1930. From this higher ground Estrada Cabrera's troops attacked Guatemala City. On April 8, 1920, president Manuel Estrada Cabrera was declared mentally unfit to continue in office, after 22 years. He resisted this designation and settled for a fight from his residence in \\"La Palma\\", which was a large enclosed area with roads crossing both ways, without any real aspect of park or garden arrangement. Tumbled together in a group were some small buildings, painted in the crudest colors; each house appeared to be built for some particular purpose: one was the dining room, another the kitchen, a writing room, and so on. The structure had little open spaces, was blazed in the sun and had wonderful landscapes painted on the walls. At a little distance were straw-thatched huts with a lone broad bench used for bed and table for servants and soldiers. On April 9, 1920, Guatemala City was awakened with machine-gun fire and shells dropping close in every quarter of the city. In \\"La Palma\\" French field-howitzers and seventy-fives with anti-aircraft sights, quick firing guns and machine guns were drawn up; on the other hand, in Guatemala City streets were deserted and bloodshed commenced in earnest. The Unionists were caught off-guard: their organization was deficient, and they had almost no weapons, but they were able to remedy the situation. Government buildings were systematically plundered and ransacked and they got arms and ammunition from the most unlikely places; this way they got knives, machetes, saloon rifles, shotguns, axes and crowbars. With enthusiasm, all men raised barricades and dug trenches in the streets. The shooting at first accounted for as many friends as enemies, but after white badges bearing the name \\"Unionista\\" were distributed, the fire was more effective. A few hours later all males in the city were wearing that token in their hat, and there were even some that had a portrait of the new president on their chest. On the government side, steady fire was maintained from \\"La Palma\\" and the two forts of San Jos√© and Matamoros. Cars with the Red Cross flag dashed incessantly, carrying a sister on the footboard with her medical supplies on one hand and a machete stuck in her belt. After the combats, the water supply pipes and electric cables were damaged, leaving the city in darkness from the first night; telephone and telegraph were also out of order. The wildest rumors were the only source of news while bullets whistled about one's ears. It was a revolution, which, thanks to the modern weapons, was really hard fought. = April 10‚Äì13, 1920 = San Jos√© fort during \\"Tragic Week\\". During these days there was reason to fear that the Cabrerists might attempt to outflank the city and fall upon the revolutionaries from the rear, causing each to defend himself as best he could in the confusion; and several times a truce was proclaimed, only to be broken a few minutes later. = April 14, 1920 = Combat lasted until San Jos√© fort fell due partly to hunger and partly to buying the defenders, for the fort commanded the position at \\"La Palma\\" entirely.

He left his position in Utah when he got a job at the New York Botanical Garden in 1943. Maguire served at the New York Botanical Garden in many roles as Curator (1943-1958); Head Curator (1958-1961); Nathanial Lord Britton Distinguished Senior Curator (1961-1971); Assistant Director (1968-1969); Director of Botany (1969-1971, 1974-1975); Senior Scientist (1972-1974); and Senior Scientist Emeritus from 1975 until his death in 1991. While in Utah, Maguire started work on the Intermountain Flora, a flora on the vascular plants of the intermountain west, but he gradually relinquished work on this project to his former students Noel Holmgren and Arthur Cronquist (and Holmgren's spouse, Patricia Holmgren), as his own interests turned increasingly to tropical America.

The golf course, designed and built by noted golf course architect Perry Maxwell, hosted the 1952‚Äì1954 Ardmore Open as well as the 1954 LPGA Ardmore Open. History of Dornick Hills The Dornick Hills Golf Course was named from the Gaelic word \\"Dornick\\" meaning \\"small rocks\\". Thousands of these rocks had to be removed before the course could be built. There are still several outcroppings of the natural rock formations on the golf course, including the cliff at the signature \\"Cliff Hole\\". Course architect Perry Maxwell is buried in the family cemetery on the ridge north of the 7th fairway. Maxwell is credited with many of the great layouts in Oklahoma and throughout the United States. In 1913, on the site of a former dairy farm that he owned, Maxwell built the first nine holes of Dornick Hills. The remaining nine holes would not be completed until 1923. Maxwell was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. He came to be known as the \\"father of Oklahoma golf\\". Dornick Hills enjoys two distinctions, one being that it was Oklahoma's first golf course with Bermuda grass greens. It was also the first Oklahoma golf club to be affiliated with the United States Golf Association (USGA), which occurred on July 20, 1914. For the next six years no other Oklahoma golf club had a USGA affiliation. Signature hole at Dornick Hills Maxwell built a green atop a 50-foot cliff on the 16th hole, a signature hole known as the \\"Cliff Hole\\", at Dornick Hills to make a demanding approach shot on the par 5 hole. Long hitters can risk a wood or long iron shot to the elevated green but most players have no choice but to lay up below the cliff for a short iron approach to the green. On the next hole, golfers tee off from the cliff summit and play sharply downward to a par 3 green below.

Overview  Trains are run by private company Casimiro Zbikoski S.A. under an operation agreement with State-owned Operadora Ferroviaria Sociedad del Estado (SOFSE). The train crosses the San Roque Gonz√°lez de Santa Cruz Bridge which joins the two countries together and has an average journey time of 10 minutes with a 30-minute frequency. The current rolling stock consists of two-carriage diesel-hydraulic railcars originally called \\"Wadloper\\", built between 1981 and 1983 by German company D√úWAG for the Dutch railway company Nederlandse Spoorwegen,Tren a Posadas ‚Äì Encarnaci√≥n: con una escribana p√∫blica en la redacci√≥n de Misiones Online, la empresa Casimiro Zbikoski SA pidi√≥ derecho a r√©plica, Misiones Online, 22 Mar 2019 and have a capacity to carry 250 people. Those railcars had been previously used in the binational service Tren de los Pueblos Libres that joined Argentina and Uruguay, having been active only for one year. With passenger numbers increasing rapidly after the aperture of the service, the Argentine Ministry of the Interior and Transport stated in March 2015 that it may have to evaluate adding more rolling stock and extending the length of the platforms. Customs officials are only present on the Argentine side of the railway, with entry into both countries managed from there. In August 2015, the service was suspended for an unspecified period of time, with no reasons given from both, the concessionaire ‚ÄìCasimiro Zbikoski‚Äì and Trenes Argentinos. At the time of the service being suspended, the train had carried 250,000 people within the year. On the other hand, the Government of Paraguay stated that they had no objections to anything related to the service, blaming the Argentine authorities for the suspension of the train. Other versions affirmed that the service could be reestablished the second week in September. On 7 September, service resumed as normal, though the three-week interruption had not been explained.

This proposes the expansion of its base flake graphite concentrate production and also the establishment of an advance graphite manufacturing facility. Valence Industries‚Äô aim is to produce graphite products for multiple applications and multiple industries for sale to global markets, including the Asia Pacific region, Europe and North America. Project overview The Uley graphite project is located near the major regional town of Port Lincoln, in the Lower Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. The project contains near surface, disseminated, high-grade flake graphite. The project comprises two Mining Licences and two associated Retention Licences, plus an extensive Exploration Licence which provides the opportunity for project expansion in the future. Valence owns the land on which its current operations are conducted, including extensive existing infrastructure. It also owns the land where proposed expanded operations would be carried out. Project history Graphite was discovered in the area of the Uley project in the early 1800s and was mined intermittently at the site since the 1920s. When in production, the open cut mine was capable of producing up to 14,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate annually. It was placed on care and maintenance in 1993 and was not worked again until 2014, when Valence reported the first sales of graphite from the mine under its ownership had taken place. These initial sales were for advanced qualification and testing purposes ahead of proposed long term sales contracts.

History Fiery Dragon Productions was founded in Toronto in 2000 by authors James Bell, Jason Kempton and Todd Secord. They got into the business to publish d20 adventures and their first, Nemoren's Vault (2000), was an early entrant to the field. After publishing just two more adventures ‚Äì The Silver Summoning (2001) and To Stand on Hallowed Ground/Swords Against Deception (2001), the latter by Mike Mearls ‚Äì Fiery Dragon was invited to become a part of the Sword & Sorcery imprint at White Wolf. They were the fourth publisher in the imprint, following Necromancer Games and two White Wolf divisions, Sword & Sorcery Studios and ArtHaus. One of their early supplements offered some support for Necromancer Games' first Rappan Athuk adventure (2001) and even after Fiery Dragon left Sword & Sorcery in 2002, they continued working with Monte Cook's Malhavoc Press. Though Fiery Dragon got its start in adventures ‚Äì and published a few more at Sword & Sorcery ‚Äì they increasingly were moving toward publishing counters, which they had begun in their first adventure, Nemoren's Vault by including a few illustrated counters to represent characters and monsters. Fiery Dragon continued inserting counters into their adventures through 2002 but by that time they had retained the services of artist Claudio Pozas. Pozas allowed them to create counters in volume, and the result was Counter Collection I: The Usual Suspects (2001), a Sword & Sorcery publication and the first of many books (and later boxes and tins) that contained counters and nothing else. By 2003 and 2004, Fiery Dragon was publishing almost nothing but counters, and two publications at the time were Counter Collection 5: Summoned Creatures (2004) and Counter Collection Gold (2004), which together depicted the entire span of base 3.5e creatures. Prior to 2004, all of Fiery Dragons adventures ‚Äì and some of their Counter Collections ‚Äì were based in their own world of Karathis. In 2005, they returned to publishing things other than counters but instead of their traditional setting, they instead turned to licensed backgrounds. The majority of their licences were taken from Malhavoc Press, and Fiery Dragon thus put out adventures and counters for both Arcana Evolved (2005) and Ptolus (2006-2007). They also became the primary publisher for the Iron Heroes d20 game (2005-2008). Fiery Dragon also published the seventh edition of Tunnels & Trolls (2005, 2008) and a fourth-edition D&D; book that updates the best of White Wolf's Creature Collection (2009). They have also published a number of \\"Counter Strike\\" mini-games. With the publication of D&D; fourth edition, Fiery Dragon began mostly publishing counters once more.

Military Service During the reign of Emperor Constantius II, Lupicinus was named Magister Equitum (commander of cavalry) in 357. Lupicinus took a leading role in the campaign of Emperor Julian along the Rhine against the Salian Franks and the Alemanni. In one instance, he devised a successful plan whereby 300 Roman troops secretly crossed the Rhine at night and attacked the Alemannic camp on the opposite bank. This allowed the main body the Julian's army to cross and quickly defeat and accept the surrender of the five confederated Alemannic kings. The Roman Diocese of Britain was invaded from the north and from Hibernia to the west in 360. Lupicinus was dispatched there by Julian to stave off the attacks. However, his order came at the same time that Constantius II ordered Lupicinus east against the Persians. Not wishing to march east, Julian's army mutinied and acclaimed him Augustus over Constantius II. Refusing to side with Julian in the imminent civil war, Lupicinus fell out of favor and was arrested by Julian's troops. After the death of Emperor Julian in 363, Julian's successor Jovian brought Lupicinus back into service and appointed him Magister Equitum per Orientum (Commander of the Cavalry of the East). Lupicinus continued in this command after the death of Jovian in 364 and on through the reign of the newly-elected Emperor Valentinian and Valentinian's brother Valens. In 365, there was an attempted usurpation of the eastern portion of the Empire by Procopius. Lupicinus was Emperor Valens' senior commander against the rebel troops holding Asia Minor. After a chain of victories and the overthrow of Procopius in 366, Lupicinus was rewarded with the Consulship the following year. His consular colleague was the western military commander, Flavius Jovinus. Lupicinus is not to be confused with Lupicinus, a general in the Gothic wars of the 370s.

After graduation from the Mechanical Engineering Department of Lviv Polytechnic in 1904, Bohdan Stefanowski pursued a career in industry as a specialist in heat management and then spent several years furthering his education under the supervision of Prof. Mollier in Dresden and Prof. Joss at K√∂nigliche Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg. In 1910, Bohdan Stefanowski returned to Lviv to continue his research at the Theory of Heat Engines Department headed by Prof. Tadeusz Fiedler. It was here that he was awarded his doctoral degree and lectured mechanical measurement as a paid associate professor of mechanical measurement and mills technology. In 1913, he was commissioned by Prof. Fiedler to develop a Machine Laboratory which had long been in the planning when the sudden outbreak of World War I brought an end to the ambition as well as all research and teaching done by Prof. Stefanowski, who remained in Russia for the duration of the entire World War I. In 1918 Bohdan Stefanowski returned to Warsaw where he assumed the post of Head of the Technical Thermodynamics Department and the Machine Laboratory. In 1933 he became a member of the Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee. In the post-war era he managed to develop and equip the facility to European standards and both the Department and the Laboratory became a hub of vibrant scientific life. Already in 1939 he was planning to open the Institute of Heat Technology at Warsaw University of Technology. He was an excellent lecturer. In the mid-war period he authored textbooks in thermodynamics, heat management and cooling, which were among the first such publications in the Polish language. He also published a lot of research into the theory of combustion, fuel properties and cooling circuits. Bohdan Stefanowski was a very active member of technical organizations and was nominated 66th ordinary member of the Academy of Technical Sciences in Warsaw and the Polish Academy of Learning in Cracow. During the war, he continued his work organizing secret courses and working at Staatliche Technische Fachkurse. He was injured in the Warsaw Uprising and after partial recovery moved to Czƒôstochowa, where he stayed until the end of the war. In 1945 he was appointed Rector of Lodz University of Technology and given the task of organizing its structure and operation, which he soon completed and also established the Heat Technology Department and the Thermal Energy Laboratory. In 1949 Prof. Stefanowski returned to Warsaw, where he rebuilt the Thermal Energy Laboratory and in 1951 he succeeded in commencing the building of the future Institute of Heat Technology to be opened in 1954. The Institute of Heat Technology was officially constituted in 1961 after Bohdan Stefanowski's retirement. The moment Polish Academy of Sciences was established, Prof. Stefanowski became its ordinary member. He supervised many doctoral and habilitation dissertations. He was granted the title of honorary doctor of Warsaw and Lodz Universities of Technology. For his lifetime achievements in the field of science he was recognized with the State Award for Outstanding Research as well as some of the highest Polish distinctions, 1st category Order of the Banner of Work, Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta.

The building has been dated by denchrochronology or tree-ring dating giving felling dates for timbers within the house of 1559‚Äì1561, and for the rear store-house range of 1576. The Building was acquired by the Machynlleth Tabernacle Trust and excavations and survey were undertaken by CPAT before restoration work was started in 2005.http://www.cpat.org.uk/projects/longer/machyn/machyn.htm The restoration was supported by the Heritage Lottery funding supported the restoration in 2006http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/3026058.stm Location In the centre of the town, in Heol Maengwyn, on the corner of Penrallt and Garsiwn. History Royal House is a mid 16th century town-house, which combined, probably from the outset, domestic and commercial functions, with domestic accommodation between a shop facing the street and a slightly later store- house at the rear. It occupied a half-burgage plot within the late medieval town, and was built to run lengthwise down the plot. The building has been tree-ring dated, giving felling dates for timbers within the house of 1559‚Äì1561, and for the rear store-house range of 1576. History of the Royal House Although the Royal House has had a long commercial history, much of the early structure and layout have, remarkably, survived. The original house was extended by the addition of the store-house (referred to as ‚Äò‚Äôysgubor newydd‚Äô‚Äô in 1628), and whilst the character of the shop facade is early 19th century, it covers an earlier structure, which had been extended towards the street with the addition of a storeyed porch, probably of the 17th century. . Documentary evidence for the history and use of this building starts with a reference to it in 1581. In 1656, it was the home of a draper, William Lloyd, who sold it, in that year, to Thomas Pugh, a mercer. It was an occupied by mercers until at least the early 18th century, and probably by a family of drapers during the C19. A currier may have occupied it at some time during the late C17. Local Traditions According to local tradition, Dafydd Gam, a Welsh ally of the English kings, was imprisoned here from 1404 to 1412 for attempting to assassinate Owain Glynd≈µr. After his release by Glynd≈µr, ransomed Gam fought alongside Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt and is named amongst the dead in Shakespeare's Henry V. However, the evidence from the dendrochronlogical dates suggests that, this must have been before this house was built. The name Royal House stems from the tradition that Charles I stayed at the house in 1643. Architecture Royal House, Machynlleth 1559‚Äì61 The narrow hip-roofed front to Heol Penrallt was much remodelled in the 19th century. The house extends seven long bays down the adjacent street. Three- light window with ovolo mullions, and doorway with voussoired head. The roof of the main part of the building is tree-ring dated to 1559‚Äì61, that of the three W bays to 1576. Despite alterations, the plan of what was clearly a decent Elizabethan merchant‚Äôs house. The house formed the centre part of the range, with first floor hall and parlour heated by back-to-back fireplaces. The shop faced the main street, and the rear addition bays probably formed a warehouse and some extra rooms. The hall was open, the collar-truss roof has wind-braces. Fireplace has a bressumer on large corbels; post-and-panel partition. There is an ogee-headed doorway to the parlour.‚ÄúScourfieldand Haslam‚Äù.

Guards admitted two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call, and the thieves tied the guards up and looted the museum over the next hour. The FBI has valued the haul at $500 million, and no arrests have been made and no works have been recovered. The museum is offering a $10 million reward for information leading to the art's recovery, the largest bounty ever offered by a private institution. The stolen works were originally procured by art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840‚Äì1924) and intended for permanent display at the museum with the rest of her collection. Among them was The Concert, one of only 34 known paintings by Johannes Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting in the world. Also missing is The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, Rembrandt's only seascape. Other paintings and sketches by Rembrandt, Degas, Manet, and Flinck were stolen, along with a relatively valueless eagle finial and Chinese gu. Experts were puzzled by the choice of artwork, since more valuable works were left untouched. The collection and its layout are permanent, so empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for their return. The FBI believes that the robbery was planned by a criminal organization. The case lacks strong physical evidence, and the FBI has largely depended on interrogations, undercover informants, and sting operations to collect information. They have focused primarily on the Boston Mafia which was in the midst of an internal gang war during the period. One theory is that gangster Bobby Donati organized it to negotiate for his capo's release from prison; Donati was murdered a year after the robbery. Other accounts suggest that the paintings were stolen by a gang in Dorchester, though they deny involvement even after a sting operation put some of them in prison. All have denied any knowledge or have given leads that were fruitless, despite being offered reward money, reduced prison sentences, and even freedom if they gave information leading to recovery of the art. Background Museum visitors viewing A Lady and Gentleman in Black in 1941 The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum was constructed under the guidance of art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840‚Äì1924) to house her personal art collection. The museum opened to the public in 1903, and Gardner continued to expand the collection and arrange it until she died in 1924. She left the museum with a $3.6 million endowment, and her will stipulated that the arrangement of the artwork should not be altered and no items were to be sold or bought into the collection. By the 1980s, the museum was running low on funds. This financial strain left the museum in poor condition; it lacked a climate control system and an insurance policy, and was in need of basic building maintenance. After the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) uncovered a plot by Boston criminals to rob the museum in 1982, the museum allocated funds to improve security. Among these improvements were 60 infrared motion detectors and a closed-circuit television system consisting of four cameras placed around the building's perimeter. There were no cameras installed within as the board of trustees thought installing such equipment in the historical building would be too expensive. More security guards were hired as well. Despite these security improvements, the only way police could be summoned to the museum was with a button at the security desk. Other museums at the time had fail-safe systems which required night watchmen to make hourly phone calls to the police to indicate all was well. An independent security consultant reviewed the museum's operations in 1988 and determined they were on par with most other museums, but recommended improvements. The security director at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston also suggested security upgrades to the museum. Because of the museum's financial strain and Mrs. Gardner's wishes against any major renovations, the board of trustees did not approve these security enhancements. The board also denied a request from the security director for higher guard salaries in a bid to attract more qualified applicants for the job. The current guards were paid slightly above minimum wage. The security flaws of the museum were an open secret among the guards. Robbery Gardner Museum in 2018alt=refer to caption Prelude The robbery occurred in the early hours of Sunday, March 18, 1990. The thieves were first witnessed around 12:30a.m. by several St. Patrick's Day revelers leaving a party near the museum. The two men were disguised as police officers and parked in a hatchback on Palace Road, about a hundred feet from the side entrance. The witnesses believed them to be policemen. The museum guards on duty that night were Rick Abath, age 23, and Randy Hestand, age 25; Abath was a regular night watchman and it was Hestand's first time on the night shift. The security policy maintained that one guard patrolled the galleries with a flashlight and walkie-talkie, while the other sat at the security desk. Abath went on patrol first. During his patrol, fire alarms sounded off in different rooms in the museum, but he could not locate any fire or smoke. Abath returned to the security room where the fire alarm control panel indicated smoke in multiple rooms. He assumed some type of malfunction and shut down the panel. He went back on patrol and before he completed his rounds, made a quick stop at the side entrance of the museum, briefly opening the side door and shutting it again. He did not tell Hestand he was doing this or why. Abath completed his tour and returned to the security desk around 1:00a.m., at which point Hestand began his rounds. Guards are subdued At 1:20a.m. the thieves drove up to the side entrance, parked, and walked up to the side door. They rang the buzzer, which connected them to Abath through an intercom. They explained to Abath that they were police investigating a disturbance and needed to be buzzed in. Abath could see them on the closed-circuit television wearing what appeared to be real police uniforms. He was not aware of any disturbance, but theorized that as it was St. Patrick's Day, perhaps a reveler had climbed over the fence and someone had seen and reported it. Abath let the men in at 1:24a.m. The thieves were let into a locked foyer that separated the side door from the museum. They approached Abath at his desk and asked if anyone else was in the museum and to bring them down; Abath radioed Hestand to return to the security desk. Abath noticed around this time that the mustache on the taller man appeared fake. The shorter man told Abath that he looked familiar, that they may have a warrant for his arrest, and to come out from behind the desk and provide identification. Abath complied, stepping away from the desk where the only panic button to alert police was. The shorter man forced Abath against a wall, spread his legs and handcuffed him. Abath noticed that he was not frisked. Hestand walked into the room around this time, and the taller thief turned him around and handcuffed him. Once both guards were handcuffed, the thieves revealed their true intentions to rob the museum and asked the guards to not give them any problems. The thieves wrapped duct tape around the heads and eyes of the guards. Without asking for directions, they led the guards into the basement where they were handcuffed to a steam pipe and workbench. The thieves examined the wallets of the guards and explained that they know where they live and to not tell authorities anything and they will get a reward in about a year. It took the thieves 11 minutes to subdue the guards, it was now about 1:35a.m. Stealing the works The frame which once held Chez Tortoni The thieves' movements through the museum were recorded on infrared motion detectors. Steps in the first room they entered, the Dutch Room on the second floor, were not recorded until 1:48a.m. This was 13 minutes after they finished subduing the guards, perhaps waiting to make sure no police were alerted. As the thieves approached the paintings in the Dutch Room, a device began beeping that would normally trip when a patron was too close to a painting. The thieves smashed it. They took Storm on the Sea of Galilee and A Lady and Gentleman in Black and threw them on the marble floor which shattered their glass frames. Using a blade, they cut the canvases out of their stretchers. They also removed a large Rembrandt self-portrait oil painting from the wall but left it leaning against a cabinet. Investigators believe they may have considered it too large to transport, potentially because it was painted on wood, not more durable canvas like the others. Instead, the thieves took a small postage stamp-sized self-portrait etching by Rembrandt on display beneath the larger portrait. On the right side of the room, they removed Landscape with Obelisk and The Concert from their frames. The final piece taken from the room was an ancient Chinese gu. At 1:51a.m., while one thief continued working in the Dutch Room, the other entered a narrow hallway dubbed the Short Gallery on the other end of the second floor. The other thief joined soon. In this room, they began removing screws for a frame displaying a Napoleonic flag, likely an effort to steal the flag. They appeared to have given up partway through as not all the screws were removed, and ultimately only took the exposed eagle finial atop the flagpole. They also took five Degas sketches from the room. The last work stolen was Chez Tortoni from the Blue Room on the first floor. The museum's motion detectors did not detect any motion within the Blue Room during the thieves' time in the building. The only footsteps detected in the room that night were Abath's during the two times he passed through the gallery on his patrol earlier. As they prepared to leave, the thieves checked on the guards one last time and asked if they were comfortable. They then moved to the security director's office where they took the video cassettes that recorded their entrance on the closed-circuit cameras, and the data print-outs from the motion detecting equipment. The movement data was still captured on a hard drive, which remained untouched. The frame for Chez Tortoni was left at the security director's desk. The thieves then moved to take the artwork out of the museum; the side entrance doors were opened once at 2:40a.m. and again for the last time at 2:45a.m. The robbery lasted 81 minutes. The next shift of guards arrived later in the morning and realized something was amiss when they could not establish contact with anyone inside to be let in. They called in a security director who, upon entering the building with his keys, found nobody at the watch desk and called police. The police searched the building until they found the guards still tied in the basement.

In 1990, the FBI estimated the value of the haul at $200 million. and raised this estimate to $500 million by 2000. In the late 2000s, some art dealers suggested the haul could be worth $600 million. The most valuable works were taken from the Dutch Room. Among these was The Concert by Dutch painter Vermeer (1632‚Äì75), one of only 34 paintings attributed to him. The painting accounts for half of the haul's value, estimated at $250 million in 2015. Experts believe it may be the most valuable stolen object in the world. In the same room, the thieves targeted works by Dutch painter Rembrandt (1606‚Äì69). These included The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, his only seascape and the most valuable of his works stolen that night. Estimates have placed its value at over $100 million since the robbery. The other Rembrandt works taken were A Lady and Gentleman in Black and a small postage stamp-sized self- portrait etching. The latter was previously stolen and returned in 1970. The thieves may have taken Landscape with Obelisk believing it was a Rembrandt; it was long attributed to him until it was quietly credited to his pupil Govert Flinck (1615‚Äì60) a few years before the heist. The last item taken from the Dutch Room was a bronze gu about tall. Traditionally used for serving wine in ancient China, the beaker was one of the oldest works in the museum, dating to the Shang Dynasty in the 12th century BC. Its estimated value is only several thousand dollars. In the Short Gallery, five sketches by French artist Edgar Degas (1834‚Äì1917) were stolen. They were each done on paper less than a square foot in size and made with pencils, inks, washes, and charcoal. They are of relatively little value compared with the other stolen works, worth under $100,000 combined. Also taken was a French Imperial Eagle finial from the corner of a framed flag for Napoleon's Imperial Guard. There is a $100,000 reward for information leading to the return of the finial alone. It possibly appeared like gold to the thieves. Chez Tortoni by French painter √âdouard Manet (1832‚Äì1883) was taken from the Blue Room; it was the only item taken from the first floor. The eclectic mix of items has puzzled experts. While some of the paintings were valuable, the thieves passed other valuable works by Raphael, Botticelli, and Michelangelo and left them undisturbed, opting to take relatively valueless items like the gu and finial. The thieves never entered the third floor where Titian's The Rape of Europa hung, one of the most valuable paintings in the city. The selection of works and the brutish ways the thieves handled the artwork has led investigators to believe the thieves were not experts commissioned to steal particular works. As Gardner's will decreed nothing in her collection should be moved, the empty frames for the stolen paintings remain hanging in their respective locations in the museum as placeholders for their potential return. Because of the museum's low funds and lack of an insurance policy, the director solicited help from Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses to post a reward of $1 million within three days. This was increased to $5 million in 1997. In 2017, it was doubled to $10 million with an expiration date set for the end of the year. This reward was extended following an outpouring of tips from the public. It is the largest bounty ever offered by a private institution. The reward is for \\"information that leads directly to the recovery of all of [their] items in good condition\\". Federal prosecutors have stated that anyone who willingly returns the items will not be prosecuted. The statute of limitations expired in 1995 as well, so the thieves and anyone who participated in the theft cannot be prosecuted. Early leads and people of interest alt=refer to caption The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) took immediate control of the case on the grounds that the artwork could likely cross state lines. Investigators have called the case unique for its lack of strong physical evidence. The thieves did not leave behind footprints or hair, and it is inconclusive if the fingerprints left at the scene were from the thieves or museum employees. The FBI has done some DNA analysis in the years following as advancements in the field grew. Some of the evidence has been lost among their files. The guards and witnesses in the street described one thief as about to in his late 30s with a medium build, and the other as to in his early 30s with a heavier build. Rick Abath Security guard Rick Abath was investigated early on because of his suspicious behavior on the night of the theft. When on his patrol, Abath briefly opened and shut a side door, a move which some believe could have been a signal to the thieves parked outside. Abath told authorities that he did this routinely to ensure the door was locked. One of Abath's colleagues told journalists that if Abath had opened the door routinely as he maintains, supervisors would have seen it on computer printouts and put a stop to it. More suspicion has been drawn from the museum's motion detectors, which did not detect any movement in the Blue Room (which housed Chez Tortoni) during the 81 minutes the thieves were in the museum. The only footsteps in the room that night were Abath's during his security patrol. A security consultant reviewed the motion detector equipment several weeks after the theft, and determined they were operating correctly. Abath maintains his innocence, and the FBI agent overseeing the case in its early years determined the guards were too incompetent and foolish to have pulled off the crime. In 2015, the FBI released a security video from the museum on the night before the theft, showing Abath buzzing in an unidentified man into the museum to converse at the security desk. Abath told investigators he could not recall the incident or recognize the man, and so the FBI requested the public's assistance. Several former museum guards came forward and said the stranger was Abath's boss, the museum's deputy security chief.  Whitey Bulger  Whitey Bulger was one of the most powerful crime bosses in Boston during the era, heading the Winter Hill Gang. He claimed he did not organize the heist, and in fact sent his agents out in an attempt to determine who did because the robbery was committed on his \\"turf\\" and he wanted to be paid tribute. FBI agent Thomas McShane investigated Bulger for his involvement. He determined that Bulger's strong ties with the Boston Police could explain how the thieves acquired legitimate police uniforms, or perhaps that real police were arranged to do the heist. Bulger also had relations with the Irish Republican Army (IRA). McShane identified the bogus tripping of the fire alarm ahead of the heist a \\"calling card\\" of the IRA and the rival Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Both organizations had agents in Boston at the time, and both had demonstrated capability in the past of pulling off art heists. McShane's investigation of Bulger and the IRA did not produce any evidence to tie them to the theft. According to Charley Hill, a retired art and antiquities investigator for Scotland Yard, Bulger gave the Gardner works to the IRA and they are most likely in Ireland.  1994 letter to the museum  In 1994, museum director Anne Hawley received an anonymous letter from someone who claimed to be attempting to negotiate a return of the artwork. The writer explained that they were a third party negotiator and did not know the identity of the thieves. They explained that the artwork was stolen to reduce a prison sentence, but as the opportunity had passed, there was no longer a motive to keep the artwork and they wanted to negotiate a return. The writer explained that the artwork was being held in a \\"non-common law country\\" under climate controlled conditions. They wanted immunity for themselves and all others involved, and $2.6 million for return of the artwork, which would be sent to an offshore bank account at the same time the art was handed over. If the museum was interested in negotiating, they should print a coded message in The Boston Globe. To establish credence, the writer conveyed information only known by the museum and FBI at the time. Hawley felt this was a strong lead. She contacted the FBI, who then contacted the Globe and the coded message was printed in the May 1, 1994, edition of The Boston Globe. Hawley received a second letter a few days later in which the writer acknowledged the museum was interested in negotiating, but had become fearful of what they perceived was a massive investigation by federal and state authorities to determine their identity. The writer explained that they needed time to evaluate their options, but Hawley never heard from the writer again. Brian McDevitt Brian McDevitt was a conman from Boston who attempted and failed to rob The Hyde Collection in Glens Falls, New York in 1981. He dressed up as a FedEx driver, carried handcuffs and duct tape, and planned to steal a Rembrandt. He was also a known flag aficionado, and fit the description of the larger robber except for his thinning red hair. These parallels to the Gardner case fascinated the FBI so they interviewed him in late 1990. McDevitt denied any involvement and refused to take a polygraph test. The FBI ran his fingerprints which did not match any of those at the crime scene. McDevitt moved to California after and conned his way into television and film writing. He died in 2004.  Investigation of the Boston Mafia   Merlino gang  The FBI announced significant progress in their investigation in March 2013. They reported \\"with a high degree of confidence\\" that they identified the thieves, which they believed were members of a criminal organization based in the mid- Atlantic and New England. They also felt \\"with that same confidence\\" that the artwork was transported to Connecticut and Philadelphia in the years following the theft, with an attempted sale in Philadelphia in 2002. Their knowledge of what happened after that is limited, and so they requested the public's help to locate and return the artwork. In 2015, the FBI stated both thieves were deceased. Though the FBI did not publicly identify any individuals, sources familiar with the investigation said they were associated with a gang from Dorchester. The gang was loyal to Boston Mafia boss Frank Salemme and ran their operations out of an automobile repair shop run by criminal Carmello Merlino. Merlino's associates may have gained knowledge of the museum's weaknesses after gangster Louis Royce cased it as early as 1981. He devised plans with an associate to light up smoke bombs and rush the galleries amidst the confusion. In 1982, when undercover FBI agents were investigating Royce and his associates for an unrelated art theft, they learned of their interest in robbing the Gardner Museum and warned the museum of the gang's plan. Royce was in prison at the time of the robbery. Royce shared his plan with others and believes associate Stephen Rossetti may have ordered the robbery or shared it with someone else. = Robert Guarente and Robert Gentile = Among those associated with the Merlino gang were Robert Guarente and Manchester, Connecticut, gangster Robert Gentile. Guarente died from cancer in 2004, but his widow Elene told the FBI in 2010 that her husband had previously owned some of the paintings. She claimed that when her husband got sick with cancer in the early 2000s, he gave the paintings to Gentile for safekeeping. Gentile denied the accusations, claiming he was never given them and knew nothing of their whereabouts. Federal authorities indicted Gentile on drug charges in 2012, likely in an attempt to pressure Gentile for information about the Gardner works. He submitted to a polygraph test which indicated he was lying when he denied any knowledge of the theft or location of the artwork. Gentile maintained he was telling the truth and demanded a retest. During the retest he said Elene had once shown him the missing Rembrandt self-portrait, to which the polygraph machine indicated he was telling the truth. Gentile's lawyer felt that the veracity of Gentile's claims were being affected by the large presence of federal agents, and requested a smaller meeting in hopes that it would get Gentile to speak honestly. In the more intimate meeting, Gentile maintained that he did not have any information. A few days later, the FBI stormed Gentile's house in Manchester with a search warrant. The FBI found a secret ditch beneath a false floor in the backyard shed, but found it empty. Gentile's son explained that the ditch flooded a few years prior and his father was upset about whatever was stored there. In the basement, they found a copy of the Boston Herald from March 1990 reporting the theft along with a piece of paper indicating what each piece might sell for on the black market. Beyond this, no conclusive evidence was found to indicate he ever had the paintings. Gentile went to prison for 30 months on drug charges. If he knew information about the theft, at no point did he opt to share it, which would have reduced his sentence or freed him from prison. After getting out of prison, he spoke with investigative reporter Stephen Kurkjian, claiming he was framed by the FBI. He explained how the imprisonment negatively impacted his finances and personal life. He also explained that the list found in his basement was written up by a criminal trying to broker return of the works from Guarente and was talking to Gentile as an intermediary. When asked about what could have been in the ditch, Gentile could not recall but believed it could have been small motors. = David Turner = David Turner was another associate of Merlino. The FBI began investigating him in 1992 when a source told them Turner had access to the paintings. That same year, Merlino was arrested for cocaine trafficking, and told authorities that he could return the paintings for a reduced prison sentence. He asked Turner to track down the paintings, to which Turner was unsuccessful though he heard they were in a church in South Boston. Another associate arrested in the drug sting told authorities about Turner's involvement in several break-ins, but never mentioned the Gardner heist. Based on conversations with Merlino after his release from prison in the mid 1990s, authorities gathered that he never had direct access to the paintings but possibly could broker for their return. Despite his claims of innocence, the FBI believes he may have been one of the thieves. Evidence indicates that he went to Florida to pick up a cocaine order just days before the heist, and credit card records suggest he remained there through the night of the robbery, but some investigators believe this may have been Turner's attempt at creating an alibi. The FBI thinks the other thief was his friend and Merlino associate George Reissfelder. He died in July 1991. No clues were found in his apartment or the homes of friends and relatives, but his siblings recall a painting similar to Chez Tortoni in his bedroom. Investigators believe he looks similar to the slimmer of the police sketches. In 1999, the FBI arrested Turner, Merlino, Rossetti, and others in a sting operation the day they planned to rob a Loomis Fargo vault. When the FBI brought Turner in for questioning, they told him they had information that he participated in the Gardner robbery, and that if he returned the paintings, they would let him go. He told the authorities he did not know who stole the paintings nor where they could be hidden. In his 2001 trial, he claimed entrapment, that the FBI let the Loomis Fargo plot proceed so they could pressure him for information about the Gardner paintings. The jury found him guilty and he was sent to prison. Turner knew Gentile through Guarente, and in 2010, wrote a letter to Gentile asking if he could call Turner's former girlfriend to assist in recovering the Gardner paintings. In cooperation with the FBI, Gentile spoke with Turner's girlfriend, and she told him that Turner wanted him to speak with two of his ex-convict friends in Boston. The FBI wanted Gentile to meet the men and send an FBI undercover agent with him, but Gentile did not want to cooperate further. Turner was freed in November 2019, one month after Stephen Rossetti. Merlino died in prison in 2005.  Bobby Donati  Bobby Donati in an undated photo Criminal Bobby Donati was murdered in 1991 in the midst of a gang war within the Patriarca crime family. His involvement in the Gardner theft was suspected after notorious New England art thief Myles J. Connor Jr. spoke with authorities. Connor was in jail at the time of the heist, but he believed Donati and criminal David Houghton were the masterminds. Connor had worked with Donati in past art heists, and claimed the two cased the Gardner Museum where Donati took interest in the finial. Connor also claimed that Houghton visited him in jail after the heist and said that he and Donati organized it and were going to use the paintings to get Connor out of jail. If this is true, they likely borrowed the idea from Connor as he returned art to reduce sentences in the past. Even though Donati's and Houghton's appearances did not fit the witness descriptions, Connor suggested they probably hired lower-level gangsters to carry out the robbery. Like Donati, Houghton also died within two years of the robbery, though from an illness rather than murder. Connor told investigators he could assist in returning the Gardner works in exchange for the museum's posted reward and his freedom. When investigators did not give into Connor's demands because of lack of evidence, he suggested they speak with criminal and antiques dealer William P. Youngworth. Acting on Connor's lead, the FBI opened a case on Youngworth and conducted raids on his home and antique store properties in the 1990s. The raids caught the attention of journalist Tom Mashberg, who began talking with Youngworth in 1997 about the theft. One night in August 1997, Youngworth called Mashberg and told him he had proof he could return the Gardner paintings under the right conditions. That night, Youngworth picked up Mashberg from the Boston Herald offices and drove him to a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Youngworth led him inside to a storage unit with several large cylinder tubes. He removed one painting from its tube, unfurled it, and showed it to Mashberg under flashlight. It appeared to Mashberg to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. He noticed cracking along the canvas and the edges were cut in a manner consistent with the museum's reports, as well as Rembrandt's signature on the ship's rudder. Mashberg wrote about his experience in the Boston Herald, leaving out details to hide Youngworth's identity and the painting's location. He reported that his \\"informant\\" (presumably Youngworth) told him the robbery was pulled off by five men and identified two: Donati was one of the robbers, and Houghton was responsible with moving the art to a safe house. The FBI discovered the location of the warehouse several months later and raided it, finding nothing. The veracity of Youngworth's claims and the authenticity of the painting shown to Mashberg is disputed. Youngworth supplied paint chips to Mashberg, and federal authorities reported that they were indeed from Rembrandt's era, but did not match oils used for The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. The way Mashberg described the painting as being \\"unfurled\\" has also been scrutinized, as the stolen painting was covered with a heavy varnish that would not roll easily. Federal authorities and the museum began working with Youngworth after Mashberg's story was published, but Youngworth made negotiations difficult. He would not work with authorities unless his demands could be met, which included full immunity and Connor's release from jail. The authorities were skeptical of Youngworth's veracity, and only offered partial immunity. The United States attorney overseeing the case eventually ceased talks with Youngworth unless he could provide more reliable evidence that he had access to the Gardner works. Youngworth again provided a vial of paint chips, purportedly from The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and 25 color photographs of the painting and A Lady and Gentleman in Black. A joint statement from the museum and federal investigators announced that the chips were not from the stolen Rembrandts, though they did test as being from 17th century paintings and could potentially be from The Concert. In 2014, investigative reporter Stephen Kurkjian wrote to gangster Vincent Ferrara, Donati's superior during the gang war, inquiring if he had information about the Gardner theft. He received a call back from an associate of Ferrara who explained the FBI was wrong in suspecting the Merlino gang's involvement and claimed that Donati organized the robbery. The caller explained that Donati visited Ferrara in jail about three months before the theft, after the latter was charged for murder, and told Ferrara that he was going to do something to get him out of jail. Three months later, Ferrara heard news about the Gardner theft, after which Donati visited him again and confirmed to Ferrara that he was involved in the robbery. He claimed to have buried the artwork and would start a negotiation for his release once the investigation cooled down. The negotiations never occurred because Donati was murdered. Kurkjian believes Donati was motivated to free Ferrara from prison because Ferrara could protect him in the gang war. A friend of Guarente also corroborated that Donati organized the robbery, and that Donati gave paintings to Guarente when he became concerned for his own safety. Donati was close friends with Guarente. The two were seen at a social club in Revere shortly before the robbery with a bag of police uniforms.  Fictional interpretations  Fictional accounts of the robbery and what occurred to the paintings were explored on television shows Blindspot, The Blacklist, The Venture Bros. and The Simpsons, as well as the novels The Art Forger (2012) by B.A. Shapiro, Artful Deception (2012) by James J. McGovern, and The Hidden Things (2019) by Jamie Mason.

It survives today as a diversified group in Thailand. and in Indonesia, being nationalized in 1961, as PT Rajawali Nusantara Indonesia (Persero). History Founded in 1863 by the self-made businessman Oei Tjie Sien, Kian Gwan began life as a small trading concern in Semarang, capital of Central Java, then in the Dutch East Indies. Oei's son and heir, the tycoon Oei Tiong Ham, took over the management of the company in 1893, and promptly incorporated it as Handel Maatschappij Kian Gwan. Krebet sugar factory in Malang, one of Kian-Gwan Kongsi's assets. Oei's strategy was gradually to build up dominance in the highly lucrative opium market towards the end of the nineteenth century. This feat was all the more remarkable given the virtual control of the opium monopoly by more established, older concerns with close ties to the 'Cabang Atas', or the old Chinese upper class of colonial Indonesia. The bankruptcy of one of the older concerns in 1889 prompted the colonial government to host an auction to select new opium farmers. This auction has gone down as one of the most competitive in history, described by the poet Boen Sing Hoo in his Boekoe Sair Binatang (\\"On Animals\\", published in 1895) as a real \\"peperangan diantara raja-raja\\" (\\"battle of kings\\"). It gave the young Oei and Kian Gwan an opportunity to establish themselves as a significant player. Boen's poem describes how the parvenu Oei, whom he calls Anak Sapi (the \\"Young Ox\\"), outbid the established Batavia partnership led by Kapitein Loa Tiang Hoei (Boen's Boeaja Emas or \\"Gold Crocodile\\") and Kapitein Oey Hok Tjiang. Having gained control over the opium market of central Java, Kian Gwan went on to corner the sugar market. The company gradually integrated its plantations, mills, shipping lines, banks and complementary enterprises. A fleet of merchant ships was registered in Singapore (as Heap Eng Moh Steamship Co.). One of the employees in Singapore was Lee Hoon Leong, grandfather of the first Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew. This fully integrated chain, as James R. Rush points out, differed from the earlier opium empires and older Chinese concerns, for Oei's main competitors were not other Chinese, but the large European trading companies. Oei's company was also groundbreaking in employing professional personnel, instead of relying completely on family members in the old Chinese way. Only ownership of Kian Gwan rested with the family. Fate Oei Tiong Ham died in Singapore in 1924. In his will, he named nine children as heirs, one of whom was Oei Tjong Hauw, whom he appointed to lead Kian-gwan Kongsi. Under Tjong Hauw, OTHC continue to expand, opening a rubber processing plant in Sumatra and an alcohol distillery in Shanghai. Tjong Hauw also led the company to Japan and Indonesia - in this period many assets such as factories were destroyed during World War II. Tjong Hauw died suddenly in 1950. After Tjong Hauw died, Oei Tjong Tjay led OTHC. He was the youngest son of Oei Tiong Ham and Oei Ing Swie, son of Oei Tjong Hauw. Tjong Tjay, who was 27 at the time, found it difficult to adapt to the business climate in Indonesia, since he was raised abroad and lacked fluency in Indonesian language. Indonesia's uncertain political conditions at the time also made it difficult to expand OTHC; many considered OTHC to be pro-Dutch due to its close relation with the Dutch during the independence war.Oei Tjong Tjay Interview Archived copy Notwithstanding, in this period OTHC established many joint venture with local and governmental figures, such as pharmaceutical company, Phapros which was established in 1954. Tjong chose to support the PSI and PNI party, but it the choice would become problematic when PSI figures were arrested and exiled abroad. Dispute with the Indonesian government, which begins with the prosecution against Bank Indonesia in Amsterdam on OTHC disbursement breakdown in the bank, worsened relations toward the government.Oei Tjong Tjay Interview part 2 Archived copy In July 1961, the Indonesian government decided to seize the entire assets of OTHC in Indonesia, and in 1964 the state-owned company Rajawali Nusantara Indonesia (RNI) was formed to manage these assets. This incident led to the end of OTHC in Indonesia, although Kian Gwan branches abroad survive under the sons of Oei Tiong Ham. One of the largest overseas branches is Kian Gwan Thailand, led by Oei Tjong Bo (the elder brother of Oei Tjong Tjay) that continues to this day in the field of property and electronic tools distributor.

Overview and history A Gaia Movement clothes and shoes collection bin in the United States, Gaia movement USA collects donated clothes and shoes in large bins placed along public streets. The Chicago Reader reported in 2001 that part of the donations were sold in local stores while the majority were exported in bulk, primarily to developing countries. The authors of a 2004 Chicago Tribune investigation observed that \\"The Gaia bins offer what people seem to want: painless altruism, cleaner closets, and utter convenience\\". Gaia's website stated their mission in March 2016 to be \\"to educate the general public about the plight of the environment while taking action to protect it\\". The group was established in 1999 and incorporated in the state of Delaware by Danish- born activist Helle Lund. Memos obtained by the Danish police detailed a grant of $60,000 from Tvind, also known as the Teachers Group (TG), to procure metal collection bins and start Gaia Movement USA's operations in Chicago in 2000. Tvind, which critics liken to a cult organization, reportedly operates a number of similar aid agencies, as well as boarding schools and various commercial enterprises. The ultimate purpose of Tvind's charitable ventures, say investigators, is to enrich its top leaders under the guise of humanitarianism.Henley, Paul (21 March 21, 2002). \\"Denmark's Tvind\\". BBC News.Smith, Matt (8 June 2011). \\"Your Rags to Their Riches: Donated Clothes May Fund International Fugitive\\". San Francisco Weekly. Journalists have investigated several related clothes-collection organizations linked to the Teachers Group besides Gaia Movement USA. They include Planet Aid, USAgain, Humana People to People, Institute for International Cooperation and Development, and Recycle for Change. Most have received failing ratings from philanthropy watchdog groups, yet have managed to place thousands of collection bins on streets in the United States. Through such clothing collection bins, the Teachers Group generates revenue of $50 million per year, according to public charities documents. Charity accountability Charity Watch, previously the American Institute of Philanthropy, gave Gaia Movement USA and another Tvind-affiliated group, Planet Aid, a grade of \\"F\\" for \\"lack of transparency, insufficient spending on program services (11 to 44 percent) and too much spending on fundraising\\", according to the Chicago Tribune. According to Charity Watch, only 2% of the more than $3.4 million raised in 2014 by Gaia from the sale of used clothes was spent on programs related to educational and environmental concerns.Living Earth's 'Recycling' Program, Debunked!\\" (2 October 2015). Charity Watch. A more recent study stated, \\"GAIA reports spending over 86% of its expenses on programs in 2016. CharityWatch's analysis of GAIA's 2016 tax form, however, shows the charity spending none, or 0%, of its expenses on programs. Gaia includes the expense of processing used clothing in its accounting of environmental program costs, claiming that their clothing-collection activities prevent clothes from being disposed of in landfills. Charity Watch, on the other hand, characterizes collecting and processing donated clothes as a form of fundraising for the organization. They note that many charitable organizations compete for such donations, and that Gaia sells the majority of the goods it collects rather than distributing them to those in need. Charity Watch asserts that used clothes would otherwise more likely end up with another charity or for-profit company than in a landfill. In Gaia's financial report for 2013, expenses related to \\"recycling\\" used clothes made up more than 96% of the total allocated to environmental programs. Based on reports from 2008, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) noted that Gaia Movement USA failed to meet 8 of its 20 charity accountability standards. The BBB estimated that only 1% of Gaia's revenue was going to charitable programs, if the clothes collection program were counted as fundraising. Gaia afterward reported changing some of its accounting practices so that only a portion of its clothes-recycling activities were defined as charitable services. , an evaluation of the organization's governance, finances, and fundraising by the BBB Wise Giving Alliance was listed as \\"in progress\\". An investigation by The Chicago Tribune revealed that approximately 4% of Gaia's expenses were listed as \\"charitable donations to environmental causes\\" between 1999 and 2002. In what the Tribune describes as \\"a typical pattern of money movement among Tvind ventures\\", the actual benefactor was a group in Switzerland named Gaia-Movement. According to the Tribune, only a small fraction of the funds transferred was ever spent on environmental work, and that that work was fraught with mismanagement and poor outcomes for the community involved. The Tribune reports that four of Gaia Movement USA's directors had served on the board of the Swiss charity, which had given Gaia Movement USA a large start-up grant in 1999. In return, Gaia Movement USA pledged to donate a comparable sum to the Swiss Gaia before funding any other environmental projects. \\"At worst, the Chicago Gaia's grants might be viewed as Tvind's gift to itself; at best, repayment on a loan\\", according to the Tribune. Environmental claims Gaia's application for nonprofit status listed several projects in developing countries relating to forestry, agriculture, and waste management to be supported with funds generated from clothing donations. However, the Chicago Reader reported that in the following two and a half years the proceeds from the sale of clothing were used entirely within the used-clothing operation. Despite the lack of spending on environmental projects, in 2001 Gaia Movement bins in Chicago stated the organization's goals to be \\"saving animals; becoming a part of the Gaia- Movement; practicing deep ecology; [and] acting as partners in the solidary [sic] humanism\\", along with 18 separate environmental projects, including the establishment of nature reserves, preserving natural habitats including mangrove forests and the barrier reef, environmental education, supporting sustainable forestry, water purification, carbon-neutral electricity generation, natural sewage systems, and building wildlife sanctuaries. The bins also urged donors to contribute by claiming that Gaia would get \\"$2 worth for every $1 spent\\". Gaia Movement USA's director Eva Nielsen explained this by saying \\"It's more like a symbol. It's not concrete. It's like we are devoting a lot of money to the environment.\\" Labor practices  The costs of maintaining the bins and paying drivers is partly offset in Gaia's case by hiring non-unionized workers, who as of 2004 were also not offered health insurance, according to the Chicago Tribune. Gaia and other related clothing operations also employ student volunteers who have joined Tvind schools to learn about humanitarian aid; they often work scouting for new clothing box locations. Some of these volunteers arrive via the Institute for International Cooperation and Development (IICD). The IICD, a part of Tvind's \\"DRH Movement\\", exists ostensibly to train young people for humanitarian projects in developing countries. Former students interviewed by the Chicago Tribune, however, said they received little to no training, instead being sent out on fundraising missions. Several students said that they were enlisted to work for Gaia and the for-profit USAgain in their clothing-collection operation under the guise of raising money for their overseas projects. Some quit after discovering that the funds were going instead to Tvind and the IICD.Eng, Monica; Jackson, David (13 February 2004). \\"Humanitarian work turns into servitude\\". Chicago Tribune. Tvind has also attempted to enlist children in foster care and other youthful wards of the state to provide a workforce for Gaia and other clothing- collection charities. Tvind's application to operate a boarding school in Michigan for troubled youth to work collecting and sorting clothes for Gaia in Chicago was denied in 2003.  Tvind embezzlement scandal  Tvind was founded in Denmark circa 1970, and has since expanded its business activities to as many as 50 countries. According to Danish police estimates, the Teachers Group/Tvind controls global assets exceeding US$850 million. A 2001 FBI report into Tvind stated, \\"Tvind derives income from the creation of developmental aid organizations. Money is raised by the collection of used clothes. The clothes are recycled and sold in third world countries. The proceeds are sent to charitable trust funds established in off shore tax havens. ... In each of these organizations the funds are ultimately controlled by captioned subjects who divert the money for personal use. Little to no money goes to the charities\\". A 2004 investigation by Chicago Tribune reporter and former IICD student Monica Eng connected Gaia, which was not mentioned in either the FBI or Danish police reports, to Tvind through its financial records. In a 1998 report to Danish authorities, former Tvind leader Steen Thomsen said that the various charities linked to the group artificially inflate the value of the used clothing they collect by buying and selling it among themselves at \\"symbolic prices\\" (known as transfer pricing) before selling the clothes to the public. Thomsen says that he left Tvind in 1998 because he was required to help embezzle money for the Teachers Group and Petersen. He says that Petersen's personal physician, Marianne Thomsen (no relation) would conduct checkups on members of the Teachers Group as a way of monitoring their activities for Petersen. , \\"Marianne Thomsen\\" is listed as \\"clerk\\" for Gaia Movement USA's board of directors. Tvind founder Mogens Amdi Petersen was apprehended in the United States in 2002, and later extradited to stand trial in Denmark for embezzlement and tax evasion.\\"Tvind founder acquitted\\" (31 August 2006). Copenhagen Post (Denmark). Petersen insisted that the allegations were false and a result of political persecution. A judge declared Petersen and six other Tvind members not guilty, upon which Petersen disappeared from the country along with four of his co-defendants. At the appeals trial, Tvind spokesperson Poul J√∏rgensen was convicted of fraud and sentenced to 30 months in prison.\\"Humanitarian fraudster convicted\\". The Copenhagen Post (Denmark). 21 January 2009. In 2013, Petersen and four others were sentenced in absentia to a year in prison for their suspected role in embezzling millions of Danish kroner from the Tvind Humanitarian Fund during the 1990s.\\"‚ÄòCult school‚Äô leader sentenced to prison\\" (30 August 2013).

She is a nationally-known sculptor whose work combines organic materials and found objects. Biography LeCocq was born in 1949 in Santa Rosa, California. She attended Fresno State College and was a student of Judy Chicago, visiting artist. In 1970, Chicago, along with 15 female students (LeCocq included) started the first feminist art program in the United States. LeCocq received a BA degree from Fresno State College in 1971. She attended California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in Valencia, CA in 1972 where she participated in the Feminist Art Program developed by Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro. The first class project of this program was a group project called Womanhouse, an installation and performance piece. LeCocq and Nancy Youdelman created a room in Womanhouse they called ‚ÄúLeah‚Äôs Room‚Äù from Colette‚Äôs Ch√©ri. They borrowed an antique dressing table and rug, made lace curtains and covered the bed with satin and lace to create the effect of a boudoir. They filled the closet with old-looking clothes and veiled hats, and wallpapered the walls to add a feeling of nostalgia. LeCocq sat at the dressing table dressed in a nineteenth-century-style costume as Cheri, studiously applying make-up over and over and then removing it replicating the character‚Äôs attempts to save her fading beauty. LeCocq returned to Fresno State College where she received an MA degree in 1976. LeCocq is a sculptor and a lecturer at the University of California, Merced in Merced, California.

The AWD, established in 1997, has over 250 members and is based in Los Angeles. Programs The AWD works to support and promote the work, visibility, and professional development for female directors through a variety of programs including screenings, educational events, and industry parties both for their members, and the general public. The Alliance offers a \\"TV Shadowing Program\\" providing opportunities for new directors to learn from experienced directors at work. The AWD is a nominator for the Fox Global Directors Initiative and an allied organization of the Women Filmmakers Initiative. The AWD helps its members make professional connections. In 2014, Maria Burton was hired as director of A Sort of Homecoming http://www.asortofhomecoming.com when the film's producer consulted the AWD to find a suitable candidate. In 2008, Victoria Rose Sampson won a competition for her film, Need for Speed, after being notified about the contest via the Alliance. Views According to their press kit, the Alliance believes in \\"foster[ing] a community of professionals to advance the art, craft and visibility of women directors in the world of film, television and new media\\" and promotes the idea that it is \\"vital that stories are told from all perspectives\\". Eleonore Dailly, co-chair of the AWD, in an interview with Elle magazine, described the group's goals as, \\"debunk[ing] this myth that there aren't enough female directors. There are highly trained female directors who can handle thrillers and action films just like male directors can handle romantic comedies.\\" Director Maria Burton was the co-chair of the Alliance for six years. Describing the problem to the LA Daily News, Burton said \\"through all the years, through all the genres, in front and behind the camera, women are vastly underrepresented.\\" Speaking as an AWD board member, director Jacqui Barcos told The Huffington Post on the lack of women-directed films at Cannes, \\"complex dramas [...] tend to be difficult to finance in the U.S. If they are complex, the only way to get them financed is to have a big- name director, because then the investors are assured it'll be a masterpiece. And many of the most talented female directors are still relatively unproven, so investors don't want to take a chance.\\" Similarly, Barcos told Variety that it was important to demonstrate that \\"a woman director can deliver a commercially successful film that is outside the romantic comedy ghetto\\". Membership and organization Currently, AWD membership is over 250, including Eleonore Dailly, Judy Chaikin, director-producer Hilari Scarl, Alexis Krasilovsky, Jen McGowan, Debra Granik, Mimi Leder, Betty Thomas, Bethany Rooney, and Lesli Linka Glatter. To qualify for AWD membership, an applicant must be a woman who has directed a publicly aired feature film, TV episode, TV movie, documentary, commercial, or short film. Members pay annual dues to support the group's work. The AWD is Chairperson, currently Jennifer Warren. It has a six-person board, a smaller advisory board, as well as honorary members and emeritus board members. In March 2019, the AWD board appointed AnnaLea Rawicz Arnold as its first executive director. Awards On April 28, 2016, the AWD held its first Alliance of Women Directors Awards ceremony at the Paley Center for Media (Beverly Hills). Television producers Greg Berlanti (Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash) and Ilene Chaiken (Empire) were honored for expanding opportunities for women in directing and other behind the camera roles in the television industry.

She reported on corruption in the Philippines. She was murdered in 2014.  Personal  Rubylita Garcia was a 52-year-old widow who had one son, Tristan, and a granddaughter. She was buried in Trinity Garden in her hometown of Bacoor City after a Mass at the St. Michael Church.  Career  Garcia was a reporter for over 25 years. She was an investigative journalist reporting for Remate, the Pilipino Times, and also worked for the radio station dwAD in Cavite province. Garcia was president of a group of journalists, which was called the Confederation of Active Media Practitioners Organization, in the area of Calabarzon. She was also a member of the National Press Club (Philippines).  Death  She was gunned down by two men in front of her ten-year-old granddaughter, son, and sister-in-law in her home in Bacoor City. Before she died, she said that the local police chief was the only one who wanted her dead, no conviction has been made however, only a temporary relief of duty. She died on the way to the hospital and her family members were not physically harmed. The Philippine National Police formed a special investigation task force, but no one was captured. One of the suspects was witnessed to be about 6 foot tall, in his thirties, with a tattoo of a cross on his neck and a tattoo on his arm. A man was arrested during a busy bust operation in Cavite City, but further examination of the suspect from a witness declared that this was not one of the men who murdered Garcia. No further reports have been made to the capture of these gunmen.  Context  From 2001 to 2014, 115 reported media workers have been killed in the Philippines. 48 of these were work-related murders while only 36 were filed in court. Under Philippines President Benigno Aquino III's administration there have been 27 media killings from 2010 to 2014, 11 were work related while 16 were non-work related. Out of the 11 work related murders, Garcia was the only person who was murdered in 2014 while 6 people were murdered in 2013. The Philippines is ranked the 3rd worst country for journalists in CPJ's impunity index.  Impact  Irina Bokova, who is the director-general of UNESCO, said, \\"I condemn the murder of Rubylita Garcia. It is essential that the authorities of the Philippines do all they can to identify and bring to trial those responsible for this cowardly crime. Murderers cannot be allowed to set limits to journalists‚Äô freedom of expression or on citizens‚Äô rights to information.\\" The National Press Club along with many other of the Philippines‚Äô largest media organizations, mourned Garcia's death. Garcia's death added to the journalistic turmoil in the Philippines, which resulted in many media practitioners having increased dissatisfaction and disappointment with the Aquino government's ability to rectify and prevent media killings.  Reactions  Bacoor's Mayor, Strike B. Revilla, started a P 50,000 reward for anyone who would solve the case of Garcia's murder. Later, the P 50,000 reward was raised to P 100,000 and was then raised again to P 150,000 by Alab ng Mamamahayag (ALAM). This group rallied at the Cavite police headquarters, protesting their concerns of how long it was taking to investigate Garcia's case. Funeral marchers carrying Garcia's casket during ‚ÄúA Walk For Justice‚Äù adopted the slogan ‚ÄúJustice For Ruby Garcia‚Äù and had it printed on their T-shirts which they wore while marching.

The film is divided into three chapters and follows the story of a stick-figure man named Bill, who struggles with his failing memory and absurdist visions, among other symptoms of an unknown neurological illness, implied to be brain cancer. The film employs both offbeat humor and serious philosophical musings. It received critical acclaim and won numerous awards.  Plot  Bill is a young man whose daily routines, perceptions, and dreams are illustrated onscreen through multiple split-screen windows, which are in turn narrated (by Don Hertzfeldt). The Narrator subtly explains that Bill is suffering from a problematic memory disorder, which interferes with his seemingly mundane life. Bill often has meetings with his unnamed ex- girlfriend, and had been recently referred to a clinic for his condition. On a visit to the clinic, Bill's doctor recommends that Bill have a new batch of medication, after his recent treatment didn't yield any positive results. It is unknown if Bill did take the new medication, as he undergoes a hallucinatory experience the next morning and then stays awake the following night. The next day Bill suffers more hallucinations, seeing monsters and ripping his own head open. Bill is then shown lying down in an alleyway. To recuperate, Bill's mother comes to take care of him, though he attacks her when she comes at him with a pair of scissors. Bill is then taken to hospital, where his health fluctuates, confusing his doctor. Bill's doctor concludes that Bill is not going to die, wherein his mother removes all the flowers from the hospital room and returning a casket meant for him. Bill then goes back to work. The film flashes back to Bill's childhood, with the Narrator explaining the death of Bill's half-brother Randall. Randall was in the \\"special\\" class at school, having aluminium hook arms and \\"a brain as misshapen as his legs\\". On a school trip at the seaside, Randall chased a gull and disappeared into the sea. After Randall's death, Bill's mother soon became fiercely protective of Bill and rarely left home. The Narrator then explains the details of Bill's stepfather leaving the house for good and Bill's mother rocking on the spot in front of the door afterwards. The Narrator also details the history of Bill's family, with many of them suffering from various diseases, such as polio and yellow fever. Many of Bill's family members were apparently killed by trains, and one‚Äîhis great-great-uncle‚Äîwas outcast from town and \\"died in the field one summer morning while dreaming of the moon.\\" A few days after leaving the hospital, Bill receives a call telling him that his mother had died; she was hit by a train after skipping her medication and launching into a fit of senile hysterics. After the funeral, Bill goes through his mother's old belongings, finding a physician's note strongly recommending that she never have a child. Bill sees his doctor once again, who unexpectedly finds nothing wrong with him. On his way to lunch, Bill suffers a seizure and collapses to the ground. During the seizure, various memories of his infancy and childhood flash before him, including an encounter with someone on a beach. Bill is again taken to hospital, where he is frequently visited by his ex-girlfriend. Bill's new doctor questions him, revealing that Bill cannot remember basic information about his life, such as his address or what month it is. He also cannot remember the name of his ex-girlfriend. Bill has surgery, after which he is asked various questions and shown photographs that appear irregular or nonsensical. Bill's doctor explains to his ex-girlfriend that Bill is having trouble understanding past-tense and present-tense, and it is implied that many of Bill's childhood memories and family history could have been confabulated. Bill is allowed to go home for family care, but when he arrives home, no one is there to take care of him. Bill starts to repeat and then forget various tasks, such as buying food and taking walks, and does not seem to understand that he is ill. Bill's doctor explains that he doesn't have long to live. Bill's outlook on life starkly changes; he marvels at the night sky and notices details of insignificant objects that amaze him. This change is complemented by a change in the film's animation: full-color photography is merged into the scenery. Bill rents a car and drives into the night, blindly following his instincts without knowing where he will end up. Arriving at a house, the Narrator reveals that it is in fact Bill's childhood home. Bill's uncle, who may have followed him, gives him an address to where Bill can find his real father, who Bill has not seen since childhood. Going to a nursing home, Bill finds his father chair bound; neither of them remember who the other is or why they are there. When Bill leaves, he tells his father that he is forgiven, causing Bill's father to cry. The Narrator explains that they will never see each other again. Bill continues driving on, more frenzied now, and stops in a forest. He lies down underneath a tree, and the Narrator states, \\"It's such a beautiful day.\\" The screen cuts to black. The Narrator, breaking character, realizes that Bill may die there and stubbornly refuses to believe that he will. Bill is then shown walking away from the forest. The Narrator explains that Bill has become immortal and travels the world, learning everything there is to know, yet death remains a complete mystery to him. Bill outlives the human race, surpassing the next inhabitants of the Earth who revere him as a god. He continues living until the Earth is destroyed by the Sun, continuing even when that has gone as well. Floating in space, Bill observes the stars going out and death of the universe, until the screen cuts to black. Release It had a limited theatrical run before becoming available on DVD, Vimeo, iTunes, and Netflix, from which it was later removed. The three chapters of the film were originally produced and released independently as animated short films, captured entirely on 35mm film with in- camera special effects. The first installment, Everything Will Be OK, was released in 2006 and won the 2007 Sundance Film Festival Grand Prize for Short Film. The second installment, I Am So Proud of You was released in 2008. The third and final chapter of the trilogy, It's Such a Beautiful Day, shares the same name as the feature-length movie and was released in 2011 to similar acclaim, including the Audience Award from the Ottawa International Animation Festival. In 2015, Hertzfeldt began a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for a Blu-ray release consisting of both the feature version of It's Such a Beautiful Day, as well as his 2015 short, World of Tomorrow. By the end of the campaign, backers had raised more than seven times the needed amount. Critical response It's Such a Beautiful Day received wide acclaim from film critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 31 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 8.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A collection of three shorts by Don Hertzfeldt, It's Such a Beautiful Day is an impossibly dense and affecting piece of animated art.\\" The film holds a score of 90/100 on Metacritic, based on 7 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Of the trilogy, Steven Pate of The Chicagoist wrote, \\"There is a moment in each installment of Don Hertzfeldt's masterful trilogy of animated shorts where you feel something in your chest. It's an unmistakably cardiac event, the kind that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's when you say to yourself: are stick figures supposed to make me feel this way? In the hands of a master, yes. And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe what they do in literal terms is borderline demeaning.\\" The Los Angeles Film Critics Association named it their runner-up for Best Animated Feature Film of the year, behind Frankenweenie. Indiewire ranked Hertzfeldt the 9th best Film Director of the Year in its annual poll (tied with Wes Anderson), and film critics for The A.V. Club ranked the film #8 on their list of the Best Films of 2012. Slate Magazine named It's Such a Beautiful Day their pick for Best Animated Feature Film of 2012. In the United Kingdom, the film was ranked #3 on Time Out London's list of the 10 Best Films of 2013, and #4 on The London Film Review's list of the same. In 2014, Time Out ranked It's Such a Beautiful Day #16 on their list of the \\"100 Best Animated Movies Ever Made.\\" Critic Tom Huddleston described it as \\"one of the great outsider artworks of the modern era, at once sympathetic and shocking, beautiful and horrifying, angry and hilarious, uplifting and almost unbearably sad.\\" In 2016, The Film Stage critics ranked the film #1 on their list of the \\"Best Animated Films of the 21st Century (So Far).\\" That same year, three critics polled by the BBC named It's Such a Beautiful Day one of the greatest films made since 2000. In 2019, The Wrap named It's Such a Beautiful Day the #1 \\"Best Animated Film of the 2010s.\\" The Vulture film critics also ranked it #12 on their overall list of the \\"Best Movies of the Decade.\\" References External links * Category:2012 animated films Category:2012 films Category:Films directed by Don Hertzfeldt Category:Self-reflexive films Category:Films about death ","title":"It's Such a Beautiful Day (film)"},{"id":"45702500","text":"The Punjab Forensic Science Agency (, abbreviated as PFSA) is an agency under the Home Department, of the provincial Government of Punjab of Pakistan.

The electrons now in the LUMO energy level can travel to nearby acceptor molecules, which are more electronegative and thus lower in energy. The driving force for the electron transfer between donor and acceptor is the difference in LUMO energy levels. Polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells are a type of solar cell researched in academic laboratories. Photovoltaic cells featuring a polymeric blend of organics have shown promise in a field largely dominated by inorganic (e.g. silicon) solar cells. Specifically, fullerene derivatives act as electron acceptors for donor materials like P3HT (poly-3-hexyl thiophene-2,5-diyl), creating a polymer- fullerene based photovoltaic cell. Some of the improvements that organic solar cells have over inorganic solar cells are that they are flexible and therefore can be applied to a larger range of surfaces. They can also be produced much more easily via inkjet printing or spray deposition, and therefore are vastly cheaper to manufacture. A downside is that, because they are not crystalline (like silicon), but instead are produced in a purposely disordered blend of electron-acceptor and -donor materials (hence the name bulk heterojunction), they have a limited efficiency of charge transport. However, the efficiencies of these new types of photovoltaic cells have risen from 2.5% in 2001, to 5% in 2006, to greater than 10% in 2011. This is because improved methods for solution processing of acceptor and donor materials led to more efficient blending of the two materials. Further research can lead to polymer-fullerene based photovoltaic cells that approach the efficiency of current inorganic photovoltaic cells. Structure Three different schematic representations of blending electron donor and acceptor materials. (a) Bilayer representation, with efficient charge generation but poor charge transport.[10] (b) Solution processed representation, in which rapid drying leads to a randomized network of acceptor/donor blending, currently the most optimal way to blend. (c) Theoretical, ideal representation of acceptor/donor blending. Materials used in polymer-based photovoltaic cells are characterized by their total electron affinities and absorption power. The electron-rich, donor materials tend to be conjugated polymers with relatively high absorption power, whereas the acceptor in this case is a highly symmetric fullerene molecule with a strong affinity for electrons, ensuring sufficient electron mobility between the two. ITO is applied onto glass, and a hole transport layer of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate)) on top of that. The photoactive layer is a blend of electron acceptor and donor atoms, and the cathode interlayer is a low work function metal used to lower the work function of the electrode on top to accept electrons. The arrangement of materials essentially determines the overall efficiency of the heterojunction solar cell. There are three donor-acceptor bulk morphologies: (a) the bilayer, (b) the bulk heterojunction, and (c) the ‚Äúcomb‚Äù structure. Typically, a polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cell has a layered structure. Functions/Applications The primary function of a solar cell is the conversion of light energy into electrical energy by means of the photovoltaic effect. In particular, polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells are promising because of their potential in low processing costs and mechanical flexibility in comparison to conventional inorganic solar cells. Solution processing potentially allows reductions in manufacturing costs through screen printing, doctor blading, inkjet printing, and spray deposition at low temperatures. To overcome the narrow spectral overlap of organic polymer absorption bands, experiments have blended conjugated polymer donors with high electron affinity fullerene derivatives as acceptors to extend the spectral sensitivity. Ternary solar cells are a promising approach to increased efficiency and light harvesting properties of organic photovoltaic cells (OPV).

Biography Turcan was born to a poor flour- packer and was himself constrained by poverty to work as a knacker. Having been given a scholarship by the city of Marseille, he went to study under Antoine Bontoux at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris until his studies were interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War. In 1871 he resumed under Jules Cavelier and went on to win second prize in the 1876 Prix de Rome for his Jason carrying off the golden fleece. Two years later he exhibited his GanymedeMoika Palace at the Salon, winning second prize. A bronze version (destroyed in World War II) was placed in the park at Aix-les-Bains and seen there by Paul Verlaine, who wrote a homoerotic poem about it in 1889.Dominique Fernandez, Amants d'Apollon: L'homosexualit√© dans la culture, Grasset 2015, \\"Un Ganym√®de aquatique\\" Official commissions now began to come Turcan's way, including statues of Cardinal de Richelieu (1880) and the historian Jules Michelet (1882) for the Hotel de Ville, Paris. In 1883 his best-known statue, depicting the fable of The Blind Man and the Lame, won him a first class medal at the Salon. Subsequently the French state arranged for him to work up the plaster cast in marble, a project he worked on for three years,M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie des sciences, lettres et beaux-arts de Marseille, 1917, p.106 and it was exhibited at the 1888 Salon. On this occasion it received a medal of honour, while the Revue des Deux Mondes devoted to it several pages of enthusiastic description, pointing out its dynamic yet compassionate qualities.Georges Lafenestre, Le Salon de 1888: La Sculpture, vol. 88, July- August, pp.153-5 The next year it was given a further prize at the Universal Exhibition and afterwards was placed in the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. Later Turcan urged the city of Marseille to fund a bronze version. This was eventually agreed in 1892 and, after being exhibited at the Paris World Fair of 1900, the statue was installed in the city in 1901. Subsequently it was to be melted down during World War II.Marseille, ville sculpt√©e But despite success and the award of the Legion of Honour in 1888, financial difficulties forced Turcan to work for a period in the studio of Auguste Rodin, where he was responsible for carving a large-scale version of the sculptor's The Kiss. Later official commissions included the figure of Painting on the east fa√ßade of the Cour Carr√©e in the Louvre Palace and the war memorial for the fallen of the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne militia during the Franco-Prussian war.Illustrated minutely online Eventually the victim of a lingering ataxia malady, he died shortly before the money raised by fellow artists to support him could be delivered.Chronique des arts et de la curiosit√© for 1895, p.8 Works Turcan's great war monument can be found in Marseille where the All√©e Gambetta and All√©e de La Canebi√®re meet, while the marble version of \\"The Blindman and the Lame\\" (L'Aveugle et le Paralytique) is now in the episcopal palace of Arles.

Todd Rose (born November 28, 1974) is the co-founder and president of the Center for Individual Opportunity and a faculty member at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He is a scientist in developmental psychology known for his work applying dynamical systems principles to the study of development, intelligence, and learning, and for his contributions to the field of Mind, Brain, and Education (Educational Neuroscience). His current focus is in the area of the Science of the Individual, with an emphasis on applying insights about individuality to issues of human potential, talent development, and the design of social institutions. He is the author of Square Peg and The End of Average.  Early life and education  Rose was born in Ogden, Utah (1974). He has stated publicly that he struggled in school from an early age, and that he dropped out of Layton High School his senior year (1993). In 1995, after being on welfare and working multiple minimum wage jobs to support his wife and two children, he obtained his GED and started attending night classes at a local college. Rose eventually received a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Weber State University (2000), as well as a master's degree in Mind, Brain, and Education (2001) and a Doctorate in Human Development (2007) from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he worked with notable psychologist Kurt W. Fischer. He also completed a postdoctoral fellowship with the Laboratory for Visual Learning at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (2008).  Science of the Individual  In an excerpt from the book, Rose relates that in the 1940s, after multiple flying accidents, the US Air Force required adjustable airplane cockpit equipment when measurements revealed zero pilots were in the average range of 10 body measurements from a population of 4,063 pilots. The measurements revealed that with only three of the ten size measurements, neck circumference, thigh circumference and wrist circumference, fewer than 3.5 per cent of pilots would fit within the average sizes on the three measurements. If a cockpit was designed for an average pilot, the cockpit fit no pilot. Rose's TEDx talk, \\"The Myth of Average\\", communicates the basic principles of the science of the individual and show how its findings can be harnessed by parents, teachers, managers, and individuals to improve performance.  Center for Individual Opportunity  To advance research into the science of the individual and use its findings to influence educational and management policies, Rose co-founded the Center for Individual Opportunity (CIO), a 501c3 nonprofit. The CIO encourages educators, businesses, and the public to support the design of more effective learning environments, improve methods for identifying, developing, and rewarding employee talent, and lay down more pathways leading to individual success.

One quantum generates what is known as a miniature end plate potential (MEPP) which is the smallest amount of stimulation that one neuron can send to another neuron. Quantal release is the mechanism by which most traditional endogenous neurotransmitters are transmitted throughout the body. The aggregate sum of many MEPPs is known as an end plate potential (EPP). A normal end plate potential usually causes the postsynaptic neuron to reach its threshold of excitation and elicit an action potential. Electrical synapses do not use quantal neurotransmitter release and instead use gap junctions between neurons to send current flows between neurons. The goal of any synapse is to produce either an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP), which generate or repress the expression, respectively, of an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. It is estimated that an action potential will trigger the release of approximately 20% of an axon terminal's neurotransmitter load. Quantal neurotransmitter release mechanism Neurotransmitters are synthesized in the axon terminal where they are stored in vesicles. These neurotransmitter-filled vesicles are the quanta that will be released into the synapse. Quantal vesicles release their contents into the synapse by binding to the presynaptic membrane and combining their phospholipid bilayers. Individual quanta may randomly diffuse into the synapse and cause a subsequent MEPP. These spontaneous occurrences are completely random and are not the result of any kind of signaling pathway. Calcium ion signaling to the axon terminal is the usual signal for presynaptic release of neurotransmitters. Calcium ion diffusion into the presynaptic membrane signals the axon terminal to release quanta to generate either an IPSP or EPSP in the postsynaptic membrane. Release of different neurotransmitters will lead to different postsynaptic potentials. Action potentials that transmit down to the axon terminal will depolarize the terminal's membrane and cause a conformational change in the membrane's calcium ion channels. These calcium channels will adopt an \\"open\\" configuration that will allow only calcium ions to enter the axon terminal. The influx of calcium ions will further depolarize the interior of the axon terminal and will signal the quanta in the axon terminal to bind to the presynaptic membrane. Once bound, the vesicles will fuse into the membrane and the neurotransmitters will be released into the membrane by exocytosis. The exact mechanism of calcium ion signaling to the presynaptic membrane is unknown, but it has been well established that calcium ion influxes in the axon terminal are linked to neurotransmitter release. Current research suggests that neurotransmitter release into neuromuscular junctions is signaled using a hierarchy of calcium ion channels and receptors in the presynaptic membrane, with different channels and receptors showing varying degrees of excitability in the presynaptic membrane. The variety in calcium channels suggests that more efficient channels are utilized first and that differing use of calcium ion channels leads to differing levels of quantal release. Once in the synapse, neurotransmitters will rapidly move across the synapse to attach themselves to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. Neurotransmitter receptors will either signal postsynaptic channels to \\"open\\" or \\"close\\" which will affect the rates that ions are able to cross the synaptic membrane. The relative change in ion flow will polarize the membrane based on the properties of the affected ion channel. For example, opening a potassium ion channel in the presynaptic membrane will create a flow of positive potassium ions out of the neuron; loss of the positively charged potassium ions will cause the neuron to become more negatively charged. It is through the use of a variety of neurotransmitters and receptors that neurons are able to send a plethora of potential signals to each other. Estimations of quantal release time courses can be roughly estimated from the original quantal release events following presynaptic simulation. Such estimations cannot be reliably used in all synapses, but can be useful tools in developing the understanding of neurotransmitter release time courses in general. Synaptic vesicle recycling As described above, the synaptic vesicle will remain fused to the presynaptic membrane after its neurotransmitter contents have been released into the synapse. The repeated additions to the axon terminal membrane would eventually result in the uncontrolled growth of the axon terminal, which could lead to disastrous breakdown of the synaptic complex. The axon terminal compensates for this problem by reuptaking the vesicle by endocytosis and reusing its components to form new synaptic vesicles. The exact mechanism and signaling cascade which triggers synaptic vesicle recycling is still unknown. No one method of synaptic vesicle recycling seems to hold true in all scenarios, which suggests the existence of multiple pathways for synaptic vesicle recycling. Multiple proteins have been linked with synaptic vesicle reuptake and then subsequently been linked to different synaptic vesicle recycling pathways. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) are the two most predominant forms of synaptic vesicle recycling, with ADBE being more active during periods of high neuronal activity and CME being active for long periods of time after neuronal activity has ceased.

T. Walsh, John Snyder, Martin Donovan, and Spalding Gray. It was directed and written by Rick King, with story written by Robert Mickelson. The film received a positive reception from Roger Ebert, Allmovie, and VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever. The Village Voice called it a sleeper hit. Plot The film's story revolves around a young adolescent Bobby (Gary McCleery) who decides to accompany his brother along for a drive in his vehicle. While on this venture, associates of his sibling steal from a shop and kill an employee who was working at the business. The suspects are apprehended, and the protagonist is found guilty of the crime and jailed for his actions. The local sheriff (John Seitz) empathizes with the boy's situation. A woman counselor Laura (Margaret Klenck) is given the young man's file and she is under the impression that he did not commit the crime. This counselor finds herself having feelings for the young man. She decides to attempt to assist him in convincing the legal system that he is not guilty. Her other option if this fails is to illegally ferret him out of the prison of her own accord. Laura requests a favor from her friend involved in substance abuse (John Sayles), and this friend provides her with a weapon. Laura, now armed, goes into the police department and gets Bobby out of prison. Laura's acquaintance involved with the substance abuse manages to successfully transport Bobby and Laura to Florida, where they may continue expressing their affectionate feelings towards one another while attempting to avoid the reach of law enforcement. Production Financing The promotion budget for the film was US$40,000. The total budget for the film was $500,000. Writing The story for the film was derived from actual events. The script was written in 1983. Filming The majority of the film was set in Tennessee. These scenes were filmed in the Catskill Mountains of New York. Marketing Filmmakers Rick King and Robert Mickelson resorted to passing out fliers around New York City as a way to promote the film. In the three weeks leading up to the film's release, they had handed out approximately 20,000 fliers advertising their movie. Release Hard Choices was an entrant in the category \\"Dramatic Competition\\" at the 1985 Sundance Film Festival. The film was released in the United States on May 16, 1986. It opened at the Embassy 72nd Street Theatre in New York City. It was released on video tape on VHS editions in 1984, and 1986, both by Karl Lorimar Home Video. Reception Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, and commented: \\"Many movies start out strong and end in confusion and compromise. 'Hard Choices' starts out like a predictable action picture, and grows and grows until at the end it astonishes us.\\" Ebert concluded: \\"'Hard Choices' is a sleeper. It doesn't have any stars, was made on a small budget, is getting haphazard distribution around the country and will never be heard of by most people. No wonder it has a low profile: It's intelligent, surprising, powerful and true to itself, and that sure puts it outside the mainstream.\\" Vincent Canby gave the film a mixed review, writing in The New York Times: \\"Hard Choices is Mr. King's first dramatic feature and it's clear that he has talent. Some of the film's crucial decisions (which, I assume, he had a hand in making) are fine, especially the casting, though others don't measure up. Totally unnecessary, and off-putting, is the use of overlapping dialogue, which is supposed to keep the film moving at a breathless pace but more often interrupts it.\\" Dave Kehr gave the film a critical review for the Chicago Tribune, concluding: \\"The characters in Hard Choices remain pawns in the director's ideological game, their movements dictated not by inner necessity but the requirements of King's preprogrammed political strategies.\\" Kehr described the plot of the movie as boring and predictable. Writing for the Sun-Sentinel, Candice Russell likened the film to Smooth Talk directed by Joyce Chopra and She's Gotta Have It by filmmaker Spike Lee; all independent films that she said were modifying the nature of the movie business. She wrote that the film \\"resonates with authenticity\\", and that it was not predictable story. The Village Voice characterized Hard Choices as a \\"sleeper indie hit\\". The Sundance Institute of the Sundance Film Festival concluded: \\"Hard Choices is a bittersweet story that is tight, honest and well-acted.\\" A review in the Los Angeles Times assessed: \\"It's a good film‚Äînot extraordinary, but solid and steady.\\" Allmovie reviewed the film and gave it a rating of three-and-a-half out of four stars. Writing for Allmovie, Eleanor Mannikka described Hard Choices as an \\"odd mix of social commentary, forbidden romance, police action thriller, and teenage delinquency\\". VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever reviewed the film and gave it a rating of three stars out of four. The review praised the acting in the film: \\"Excellent work by Klenck, McCleery, and Seitz.\\" The review went on to call the film: \\"Intelligent, surprising, and powerful.\\" The publication concluded that \\"this is a low profile film that deserves to be discovered.\\" See also *1985 in film *John P.

The combination of helium‚Äôs extremely low molecular weight and weak interatomic reactions yield interesting properties when helium is cooled below its critical temperature of 5.2 K to form a liquid. Even at absolute zero (0K), helium does not condense to form a solid under ambient pressure. In this state, the zero point vibrational energies of helium are comparable to very weak interatomic binding interactions, thus preventing lattice formation and giving helium its fluid characteristics.Yang, Shengfu, and Andrew M. Ellis. \\"Helium Droplets: A Chemistry Perspective.\\" Chemical Society Reviews 42.2 (2012): 472-84. Print. Within this liquid state, helium has two phases referred to as helium I and helium II. Helium I displays thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of classical fluids, along with quantum characteristics. However, below its lambda point of 2.17 K, helium transitions to He II and becomes a quantum superfluid with zero viscosity.Woods, A. D B, and R. A. Cowley. \\"Structure and Excitations of Liquid Helium.\\" Reports on Progress in Physics 36.9 (1973): 1135-231. Print. Under extreme conditions such as when cooled beyond TŒª, helium has the ability to form a new state of matter, known as a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate (BEC), in which the atoms virtually lose all their energy. Without energy to transfer between molecules, the atoms begin to aggregate creating an area of equivalent density and energy.Penrose, Oliver, and Lars Onsager. \\"Bose‚ÄìEinstein Condensation and Liquid Helium.\\" Physical Review 104.3 (1956): 576-84. Print. From observations, liquid helium only exhibits super-fluidity because it contains isolated islands of BECs, which have well-defined magnitude and phase, as well as well-defined phonon‚Äìroton (P-R) modes.Haussmann, R. \\"Properties of a Fermi Liquid at the Superfluid Transition in the Crossover Region between BCS Superconductivity and Bose‚ÄìEinstein Condensation.\\" Physical Review B 49.18 (1994): 12975-2983. Print. A phonon refers to a quantum of energy associated with a compressional wave such as the vibration of a crystal lattice while a roton refers to an elementary excitation in superfluid helium. In the BEC‚Äôs, the P-R modes have the same energy, which explains the zero point vibrational energies of helium in preventing lattice formation.Bossy, Jacques, Jonathan Pearce, Helmut Schober, and Henry Glyde. \\"Phonon‚ÄìRoton Modes and Localized Bose‚ÄìEinstein Condensation in Liquid Helium under Pressure in Nanoporous Media.\\" Physical Review Letters 101.2 (2008): n. pag.

A schematic of a helium cooling system; heat flow is represented by red arrows and helium flow is by black arrows. Though seemingly paradoxical, cryogenic helium systems can move heat from an area of relatively low temperature to an area of relatively high temperature. Though this phenomenon appears to violate the second law of thermodynamics, experiments have shown this to prevail in systems where the area of low temperature is constantly heated, and the area of high temperature is constantly cooled. It is believed this phenomenon is related to the heat associated with the phase change between liquid and gaseous helium. Applications Superconductors Liquid helium is used as a coolant for various superconducting applications. Notable are particle accelerators where magnets are used for steering charged particles. If large magnetic fields are required then superconducting magnets are used. In order for superconductors to be efficient, they must be kept below their respective critical temperature. This requires very efficient heat transfer. Because of the reasons discussed previously, superfluid helium can be used to effectively transfer heat away from superconductors.Pier Paolo Granieri ‚ÄúHeat Transfer between the Superconducting Cables of the LHC Accelerator Magnets and the Superfluid Helium Bath‚Äù Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne Thesis No. 5411 (2012): 1‚Äì2 August 29, 2012 http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/180620/files/EPFL_TH5411.pdf Quantum computing right One proposed use for superfluid helium is in quantum computing. Quantum computers utilize the quantum states of matter, such as the electron spin, as individual quantum bits (qubits), a quantum analogue of the bit used in traditional computers to store information and perform processing tasks. The spin states of the electrons present on the surface of superfluid helium in a vacuum show promise as excellent qubits. In order to be considered a usable qubit, a closed system of individual quantum objects must be created that interact with each other, but whose interaction with the outside world is minimal. In addition, the quantum objects must be able to be manipulated by the computer, and the quantum system‚Äôs properties must be readable by the computer to signal the termination of a computational function.Dykman, M. I., P. M. Platzman. ‚ÄúQuantum Computing with Electrons Floating on Liquid Helium.‚Äù Science 284 (1999): 1967-69. Print. It is believed that in vacuum, superfluid helium satisfies many of these criteria since a closed system of its electrons can be read and easily manipulated by the computer in a similar fashion as electrostatically manipulated electrons in semiconductor heterostructures. Another beneficial aspect of the liquid helium quantum system is that application of an electrical potential to liquid helium in a vacuum can move qubits with little decoherence. In other words, voltage can manipulate qubits with little effect on the ordering of the phase angles in the wave functions between the components of the liquid helium quantum system.Lyon, S.

X-ray crystallography The advent of high-flux X-rays provides a useful tool for developing high-resolution structures of proteins.

Michael Huffaker, one of Morgan County's first settlers, established the farm in the 1820s after buying up a large section of land. Due to the many agricultural innovations of the 1830s, Huffaker earned a significant amount of money from his farm and became one of the county's wealthiest residents. Huffaker mainly raised livestock, particularly cattle and pigs, on his farm; while he also grew crops, they mainly served as feed. In 1840, Huffaker built the farm's farmhouse, an I-house with a Greek Revival entrance and frieze. According to local tradition, the house was a stop on the Underground Railroad; as Huffaker employed many free black farmhands, he could conceal escaped slaves among his workers. The farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 6, 2007.

The receptor represents other optional hydrogen deficient compounds, such as graphene in the context of metal catalysis. In heterogeneous catalysis, hydrogen molecules can be adsorbed and dissociated by the metal catalyst. Hydrogen spillover is the migration of hydrogen atoms from the metal catalyst onto the nonmetal support or adsorbate.Gardes, G. E. E., Pajonk, G. M., and S. J. Teichner (1974). ‚ÄúCatalytic Demonstration of Hydrogen Spillover from Nickel-Alumina Catalyst to Alumina.‚Äù J. Catal. 33, 145-148. Spillover, generally, is the transport of a species adsorbed or formed on a surface onto another surface.R. Prins: Hydrogen Spillover. Facts and Fiction. In: Chemical Reviews. 112, 2012, S. 2714, . Hydrogen spillover can be characterized by three major steps, the first being where molecular hydrogen is split via dissociative chemisorption into its constitutive atoms on a transition metal catalyst surface, followed by migration from the catalyst to the substrate, culminating in their diffusion throughout the substrate surfaces and/or in the bulk materials.Hansong Cheng, Liang Chen, Alan C. Cooper, Xianwei Sha, Guido P. Pez: Hydrogen spillover in the context of hydrogen storage using solid-state materials. In: Energy & Environmental Science. 1, 2008, S. 338, . Mechanism and trends Mechanism The mechanism behind hydrogen spillover has been long disputed.Sculley, J., Yuan, D., Zhou, H. (2011). ‚ÄúThe current status of hydrogen storage in metal‚Äìorganic frameworks‚Äîupdated‚Äù. Energy Environ. Sci. 4, 2721-2735. Khoobiar‚Äôs work in 1964 marks the nascency of the spillover concept. In his findings, yellow WO3 can be reduced by H2 to a blue compound with the use of a platinum catalyst. Since the phenomenon was not found when using Al2O3 as the catalyst, he claimed that the dissociative chemisorption of H2 molecules on the Pt particles created hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms migrated from the Pt surface to the WO3 particles and reduced them to blue WO3‚àíx particles. Essentially, hydrogen atoms would migrate from a hydrogen-rich to a hydrogen- poor surface. However, these atoms are usually not generated on the surface of a support metal. Hence, the two conditions for hydrogen spillover include the creation of hydrogen atoms (requires catalysts capable of dissociating and absorbing hydrogen) and the ability of hydrogen atoms to be transported. Attempts to characterize the mechanism of hydrogen spillover have seen the use of radiation photoelectron spectroscopy to analyze the shift between different oxidation states of the support (commonly metal oxides) via their respective emission spectra.Lykhach, Y., Staudt, T., Vorohkta, M., Skala, T. Johanek, V., Prince, KC., Matolin, V., Libuda, J. (2012). ‚ÄúHydrogen spillover monitored by resonant photoemission spectroscopy‚Äù. J. Catal. 285, 6-9. 12 In general, the mechanism is thought to proceed via the transfer of neutral hydrogen atoms to the support upon overcoming an activation energy barrier. This has even been observed at temperatures as low as 180K in metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts laced with Palladium nanoparticles (PdnP‚Äôs). Upon transfer to the support, they assume the role of Lewis bases where they donate electrons and reversibly reduce the sorbent. Additionally, the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene show that hydroxyl groups seem to favor the migration of spillover hydrogen, whereas sodium cations may trap the spillover hydrogen and are detrimental to hydrogenation pathway.Wang, A., Li, X., et al. (2004). ‚ÄúHydrodesulfurization of Dibenzothiophene Over Proton-Exchanged Siliceous MCM-41 Supported Bimetallic Sulfides‚Äù. Dalian University of Technology, China Recently the mechanism of hydrogen spillover has been described using a precisely nanofabricated model system and single-particle spectromicroscopy. Occurrence of hydrogen spillover on reducible supports such as titanium oxide is established, yet questions remain about whether hydrogen spillover can take place on nonreducible supports such as aluminium oxide. The study shows a convincing proof of the spillover effect at well-defined distances away from the metal catalyst explaining why hydrogen spillover is slower on an aluminum oxide catalyst support than on a titanium oxide catalyst support. The results reveal that hydrogen spillover is fast and efficient on titanium oxide, and extremely slow and short-ranged on aluminium oxide. Figure 2: Dissociative chemisorption of H2 on metal catalysts. Hydrogen atoms move from a hydrogen- rich to a hydrogen-poor surface. Trends Hydrogen spillover increases with adsorption temperature and metal dispersion.Andrew, M., and R. Kramer (1979). ‚ÄúAdsorption of Atomic Hydrogen on Alumina by Hydrogen Spillover.‚Äù J. Catal. 58, 287-295. A correlation has been reported between available surface area and the capacity for hydrogen storage. For PdnP-containing MOFs, in the presence of saturated metal particles, the capacity for hydrogen spillover only relied on the sorbent‚Äôs surface area and pore size. On catalysts such as platinum or nickel, atomic hydrogen can be generated at a high frequency. Through surface diffusion, multi-functional transport of hydrogen atoms can enhance a reaction and even regenerate a catalyst. However, problems present in the strength of the hydrogen-support bond; too strong of an interaction would hinder its extraction via reverse spillover and nullify its function as a fuel cell. Conversely, too weak a bond and the hydrogens are easily lost to the environment. Figure 3: Hydrogen storage in carbon materials through spillover techniques. In this case, the receptor is a carbon nanotube. Note that while physical mixtures of a primary hydrogen spillover source and a secondary receptor demonstrate moderate storage capacity, adding a bridge to improve the contact between the support metal and the receptor serves to double or triple hydrogen storage capacity on the receptor. Applications With burgeoning interest in alternative energy sources, the prospect of hydrogen‚Äôs role as a fuel has become a major driving force for the optimization of storage methods, particularly at ambient temperatures where their application would be more practical for common use.Pevzner, S., Pri-Bar, I., Lutzky, I., Ben-Yehuda, E., Ruse, E., Regev, O. (2014). ‚ÄúCarbon Allotropes Accelerate Hydrogenation via Spillover Mechanism‚Äù. J. Phys. Chem. C. 118, 27164‚Äì27169. Hydrogen spillover has emerged as a possible technique for achieving high-density hydrogen storage at near-ambient conditions in lightweight, solid-state materials as adsorbents.Lueking, A. D., & Yang, R. T. (2004). Hydrogen spillover to enhance hydrogen storage: study of the effect of carbon physicochemical properties. Applied Catalysis A: General, 265, 2.) Hydrogen storage in carbon materials can be significantly enhanced by spillover techniques.Wang, L., & Yang, R. T. (2008). New sorbents for hydrogen storage by hydrogen spillover - a review. Energy & Environmental Science, 1, 2, 268-279Lachawiec, A. J. J., Qi, G., & Yang, R. T. (2005). Hydrogen storage in nanostructured carbons by spillover: bridge-building enhancement. Langmuir : the Acs Journal of Surfaces and Colloids, 21, 24, 11418-24. Current trends include the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and other porous materials with high surface area for such storage, including but not exclusive to nanocarbons (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotubes), zeolites, and nanostructured materials. Hydrogen atom diffusion on nanostructured graphitic carbon materials is primarily governed by physisorption of hydrogen atoms. Singled- walled nanotubes and multi-walled nanotubes are the best acceptor of spilt over hydrogen atoms. Another recent study has shown that the synthesis of methanol from both CO and CO2 over Cu/ZrO2 involves the spillover of H atoms formed on Cu to the surface of ZrO2.Jung, K-D. & Bell, A. T. (2000). ‚ÄúRole of hydrogen spillover in methanol synthesis over Cu/ZrO2‚Äù. J. Catal. 193, 207‚Äì223 The atomic H then participates in the hydrogenation of carbon-containing species to methanol.

Ambedkar Open University. History Hyderabad Public Service Commission The early Asaf Jahi rulers of the Hyderabad State followed the Mughal administrative traditions, practices and appointed public servants on the basis of nomination and representation. Sir Salar Jung I, the Diwan (Prime Minister) was the creator of modern Hyderabad Civil Service. In 1882, Salar Jung issued the extraordinary Jareeda and emphasized the need of educating and training the young Hyderabadis for recruitment in the Nizam‚Äôs Services. He propounded the idea of building an efficient administrative system on the model of British India and introduced several administrative reforms. He dismantled the old/archaic administrative structure and streamlined the public institutions by creating a distinct civil service class. The establishment of Zilabandi system, creation of Subedari and Taluqdari system, Revenue, Police and Judicial reforms by Salar Jung facilitated the formation of Hyderabad Civil Service. Subsequently, the proclamation of Qanuncha Mubarik of 1892, the Cabinet Council, and the Executive Council (1919) framed rules and regulations governing the services as well as regulated and institutionalized the Hyderabad Civil Services. In 1938, through a resolution of the Executive Council a Committee was constituted composed of all Secretaries to Government with the Finance Member as the President and an officer of the Finance Department as Secretary to examine the possibility and role of an agency or agencies for recruitment and appointment and its/their sphere(s) of action. After detailed discussion, it was recommended to establish an independent and impartial recruitment agency, known as the Hyderabad Public Service Commission. The Committee opined that \\"the efficiency of an administration depends on its personnel. It is therefore evident that the procedure of recruitment especially for the higher services of the administration, play an important role in creating and maintaining its standard and efficiency. Accordingly, the Hyderabad Public Service Commission was established by a Firman on 27 April 1947. It brought the entire administrative machinery of civil services of the Nizam‚Äôs State in tune with the modern times. The Hyderabad Civil Service, was a coveted service in the State of Hyderabad. It was considered to be an elite service, and the best of the government officers were inducted into it through a competitive examination. It was abolished after the Police Action in 1948 and its Officers were absorbed into the Indian government civil services. Hyderabad Civil Service Committee was established and as a personnel agency it played a significant role in the management of civil services. It was independent in its functioning and no attempt was made to bring pressure on the decision- making process of the Committee. It was a multifunctional agency and closely associated with all aspects of Hyderabad Civil Service. It had to conduct examinations for the selection and placement of the candidates for the various vacancies in different departments. The Hyderabad Public Service Commission was constituted on the model of British Provincial Public Service Commission with similar functions. It consisted of a Chairman and Members not exceeding four in number. They were appointed by His Highness the Nizam on the recommendation of the President of the Executive Council. The Chairman and Members of the Hyderabad Public Service Commission were not permitted to further employment after relinquishing their office. The Public Commission established by the last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan in 1947 became the forerunner of the Hyderabad Public Service Commission under the Constitution of India, during the period of Burgula Ramakrishna Rao, the first elected Chief Minister of Hyderabad State. The Hyderabad Public Service Commission was finally merged into the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission in 1956. Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission was in existence until the united Andhra Pradesh State was bifurcated into Telangana State and AP State in accordance with AP Reorganization Act, 2014. Formation of Telangana State and constitution of TSPSC According to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 the Telangana State came into existence with effect from the appointed day i.e., 02.06.2014.

The second of Jackson's published novels, Hangsaman is a bildungsroman centering on lonely college freshman Natalie Waite, who descends into madness after enrolling in a liberal arts college. The novel takes its title from an old folk ballad. The official publisher's description of Hangsaman says the novel is ‚Äúloosely based on the real-life disappearance of a Bennington College sophomore in 1946,\\" referencing the case of Paula Jean Welden. At the time, Jackson was living in Bennington, Vermont, as her husband, Stanley Edgar Hyman, was employed at Bennington College, where Welden had been a student. However, Ruth Franklin's research for her 2016 biography of Jackson found no evidence the novel was inspired by Welden's disappearance. Jackson's text mixes satire with psychological elements as her protagonist spends half her time in an imaginary world.  Plot summary  On the verge of leaving for college, Natalie Waite feels oppressed by the expectations of her pompous, overbearing father, who imposes his personality on her, and by her miserable, defeated mother, who Natalie sees as an example of the unhappy future that awaits her if she does not escape from home. Natalie withdraws into elaborate fantasies where she is a proud, unbreakable criminal being grilled by a detective for her crimes. On the eve of Natalie's departure for college, she is invited to her first adult party, where she witnesses her parents and their drunken colleagues at their most contemptible. Natalie experiments with different identities among the party-goers and seems to successfully intrigue an older man, only to be led by him into the woods behind the family's home where he sexually assaults her. The following morning, Natalie convinces herself that the assault did not happen. Natalie leaves for her all-female college, where she is determined to reinvent herself. Most of her fellow students are too superficial and self-absorbed to even notice Natalie, who finds an uncomfortable place at the fringe of a group of popular girls, while her self-important professors and their resentful wives are not much different from her own parents. She resumes her fantasy life, imagining herself as an implacable giant that destroys the college and devours its residents. Natalie hears rumors of an impish student named Tony who is both scorned and secretly admired for her lack of conventionality. Natalie is determined to find and befriend Tony, but Tony seeks her out first. Natalie becomes totally absorbed with Tony, and together they embark on a series of eccentric adventures where they revel in their difference from and superiority to those around them. Natalie's reputation suffers due to her strange new behavior, but for the first time in her life, she no longer cares how others perceive her, even as Tony begins to lure her into increasingly dangerous situations. Finally, on a stormy night, Tony persuades Natalie to take a bus to an unfamiliar location miles from the college. With only Tony to guide her, Natalie follows her onto a bridge. Natalie realizes that Tony intends to jump from the bridge and that she expects Natalie to join her. Natalie is on the verge of jumping when Tony abruptly vanishes, revealing herself to have been another of Natalie's fantasies all along. Shaken by how close she came to suicide, but with renewed courage, Natalie begins to make her way back toward the college.  References in other media  The 2020 film Shirley is a fictionalized account of the time in which Jackson was writing Hangsaman, depicting the novel's creation as being inspired both by the Welden disappearance and the life of a boarder in the home of Jackson and her husband Stanley Hyman.

She was one of the last known survivors of the Tulsa race massacre of 1921, and the first African-American woman to enter the U.S. Coast Guard in February 1945. She became a SPAR (Semper Paratus Always Ready), a member of the United States Coast Guard Women's Reserve, during World War II, earning the rank of Yeoman, Second Class during her service. She served in the Coast Guard until her unit was disbanded in mid-1946; she went on to become a psychologist intern at a women's correctional facility and a clinical professor at Fordham University.  Early life and education  One of five children, Hooker was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, to Samuel Hooker and Anita Hooker (n√©e Stigger). The family was living in the Greenwood District of Tulsa on May 31, 1921, when a group of white men carrying torches entered their home and began destroying their belongings, including her sister's piano and her father's record player. She and her siblings crouched under a table, hidden by a tablecloth, until the men were gone. \\"It was a horrifying thing for a little girl who's only six years old,\\" she told Radio Diaries in 2018, \\"trying to remember to keep quiet, so they wouldn't know we were there.\\" The attack was part of the Tulsa race riots of May 31‚ÄìJune 1, 1921, in which members of the Ku Klux Klan and other white residents of Tulsa destroyed the Greenwood District‚Äîalso known as Black Wall Street for the concentration of Black-owned businesses in the area‚Äîkilling as many as 300 people and leaving more than 10,000 homeless. In 1997, Hooker and other survivors of the massacre founded the Tulsa Race Riot Commission, to investigate the massacre and its aftermath, and seek reparations. In 2003, she was one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit filed against the state of Oklahoma and the city of Tulsa by more than 100 survivors and about 300 descendants of people who lost their lives or property in the attacks, seeking compensation due to the local governments' involvement in the massacre; the US Supreme Court dismissed the case without comment in 2005. After the riots, her family moved to Topeka, Kansas, and then to Columbus, Ohio, where she earned her bachelor of arts in 1937 from The Ohio State University and taught third grade. While at OSU, she joined the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, where she advocated for African- American women to be admitted to the U.S. Navy. In 1947, she received her master's from the Teachers College of Columbia University, and in 1961 she received her PhD in clinical psychology from the University of Rochester, with her dissertation on the learning abilities of children with Down syndrome.MacKay, Jenna (2013).

Career U.S. Coast Guard Olivia Hooker (front) with Aileen Anita Cooks (behind) on the (nicknamed USS Neversail) during boot training, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn Hooker applied to the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) of the U.S. Navy, but was rejected due to her ethnicity. She disputed the rejection due to a technicality and was accepted; however, she had already decided to join the Coast Guard. She entered the U.S. Coast Guard in February 1945. On March 9, 1945, she was sent to basic training for six weeks in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York. Throughout training, Hooker became a Coast Guard Women's Reserve (SPARS) and had to attend classes and pass exams. She was one of only five African-American females to first enlist in the SPARS program. After basic training, Hooker specialized in the yeoman rate and remained at boot camp for an additional nine weeks before heading to Boston where she performed administrative duties and earned the rank of Yeoman Second Class in the Coast Guard Women's Reserve. In June 1946, the SPAR program was disbanded and Hooker earned the rank of petty officer 2nd class and a Good Conduct Award. Psychology After receiving her master's degree from the Teachers College of Columbia University, Hooker moved upstate to work in the mental hygiene department of a women's correctional facility in Albion County. Many women in this facility were considered to have severe learning disabilities by staff. Hooker felt they were treated unfairly and re-evaluated them in hopes to help the women pursue better education and jobs after their time in the facility. She credited this success with \\"approaching them with an open mind.\\" The correctional facility today continues to help women earn a degree and job experience for when they are released. In 1963, she joined Fordham University as a senior clinical lecturer and an APA Honors psychology professor; eventually she served as an associate professor until 1985. Hooker was one of the founders of the American Psychological Association's (APA) Division 33, Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and was later honored by the Association for her work with children. She served as an early director of the Kennedy Child Study Center in New York City where she gave evaluations, extra help, and support/therapy to children with learning disabilities and delays. Later life and legacy Hooker retired at the age of 87. She joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary at age 95 and served as a auxiliarist in Yonkers, New York. Hooker received the American Psychological Association Presidential Citation in 2011. In 2012, she was inducted into the New York State Senate Veterans' Hall of Fame. On February 9, 2015, Kirsten Gillibrand spoke in Congress to \\"pay tribute\\" to Hooker. In the same year, the Olivia Hooker Dining Facility on the Staten Island coast guard facility was named in her honor. A training facility at the Coast Guard's headquarters in Washington, D.C. was also named after her that same year. On May 20, 2015, President Barack Obama recognized Hooker's Coast Guard service and legacy while in attendance at the 134th Commencement of the United States Coast Guard Academy. On November 11, 2018, Google honored her by telling her story as part of a Google Doodle for the Veterans Day holiday. Hooker died of natural causes in her home in White Plains, New York on November 21, 2018, at the age of 103. Tulsa Girl, by Shameen Anthanio-Williams, is a book focused on Hooker's experiences in the Tulsa Race riots. In October 2019, it was announced that the fast response cutter would be named in her honor. This will be the sixty- first Sentinel-class cutter, due to be delivered to the Coast Guard after 2023.

Critical reception The Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Kallappadam works more as a heist movie, probably because we have only recently had Jigarthanda and KTVI talk about the film industry and they did it better. So, the first half, when we get to see the characters' struggles feels fairly routine and the film receives a jolt of energy only when they start to plan the robbery. But the gripping second half makes up for the earlier disappointment\\". Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"Vadivel is nothing if not ambitious, but his ideas are easier to applaud than his filmmaking skills. The pace is sluggish, and the film comes to life only in the heist portions...more fatally for the film, the leads just don‚Äôt measure up. It may be nice in a meta-ish sense to cast behind-the-scenes people, but there‚Äôs a reason actors make a living. There are things like charisma, timing, dialogue delivery, reaction shots ‚Äî none of these is in evidence\\". Indo-Asian News Service gave it 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"What we get to see may not be exceptional, but something far offbeat than the mainstream garbage that's thrown at the audiences every week..With some good ideas and intentions, Kallappadam could've been an excellent meta film. But it still doesn't disappoint\\". Indiaglitz gave 3 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Vadivel has presented an engaging screenplay with some intelligent twists...The courage to do an independent movie is highly appreciable, but the obvious production constraints pull down the movie to some extent\\". Sify wrote, \\"The biggest strength of Kallappadam is the film's promising plot and screenplay which is incorporated with some well executed sequences...but that's not enough to declare Kallappadam as a perfect movie...Kallapadam is a film where everything is enjoyable except for the misfit casting of protagonists and dreary dialogues\\". Deccan Chronicle wrote, \\"Kallappadam is a solid piece of writing, but mired by a skewed view of casting and capturing the screenplay...the problem with the film is its questionable casting. Nevertheless, the film can be watched once for it novel concept\\".

It follows a melodramatic main plot about an abducted girl, Cabiria, and features an eruption of Mt. Etna, heinous religious rituals in Carthage, the alpine trek of Hannibal, Archimedes' defeat of the Roman fleet at the Siege of Syracuse and Scipio Africanus maneuvering in North Africa. Apart from being a classic on its own terms, the film is also notable for being the first film in which the long-running film character Maciste (played by Bartolomeo Pagano) makes his debut. Running nearly three hours (14 reels), the film was one of the first feature-length films and was both critically and financially successful and launched Quaranta into international stardom.Profile, silentera.com; accessed 18 March 2015.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Of the 331,946 Australians who embarked for overseas service, nearly 60,000 did not survive the First World War. Memorials were commissioned by service organisations, shire or city councils and by business groups. Some commemorated those who had died, while others recorded all who had served in the armed forces during the war. This honour board was erected by the Queensland National Bank in commemoration of those employees who served during this War. The Sydney firm of Wunderlich Ltd, suppliers of architectural metalwork, manufactured the board. Listed in an oval centrepiece are the names of 115 employees of the Queensland National Bank (now the National Australia Bank) who saw service during the war and returned. Around this are the photographs and names of 22 employees who died while on active service. The memorial was unveiled by George Edward Bunning, Chairman of the Queensland National Bank Board on 19 August 1920.

Description  Aker was first depicted as the torso of a recumbent lion with a widely opened mouth. Later, he was depicted as two recumbent lion torsos merged with each other and still looking away from each other. From Middle Kingdom onwards Aker appears as a pair of twin lions, one named Duaj (meaning \\"yesterday\\") and the other Sefer (meaning \\"tomorrow\\"). Aker was thus often titled \\"He who's looking forward and behind\\". When depicted as a lion pair, a hieroglyphic sign for \\"horizon\\" (two merged mountains) and a sun disc was put between the lions; the lions were sitting back-on-back.Pat Remler: Egyptian Mythology, A to Z. Infobase Publishing, 2010, , pp. 4 & 5. In later times, Aker can also appear as two merged torsos of recumbent sphinxes with human heads.  Cult  Aker appears for the first time during the 1st Dynasty with the kings (pharaohs) Hor Aha and Djer. An unfinished decorative palette from the tomb of Djer at Abydos shows Aker devouring three hearts.Peter Kaplony: Die Inschriften der √§gyptischen Fr√ºhzeit, 3rd edition. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1963, pp. 65. The location of Aker's main cult center is unknown, though. His mythological role was fully described for the first time in the famous Pyramid Texts of king Teti.  Mythology  Aker was first described as one of the earth gods guarding the \\"gate to the yonder site\\". He protected the deceased king against the three demonic snakes Hemtet, Iqeru and Jagw. By \\"encircling\\" (i.e. interring) the deceased king, Aker sealed the deceased away from the poisonous breath of the snake demons. Another earth deity, who joined and promoted Aker's work, was Geb. Thus, Aker was connected with Geb. In other spells and prayers, Aker is connected with Seth and even determined with the Set animal. This is interesting, because Seth is described as a wind deity, not as an earth deity.Georg Meurer: Die Feinde des K√∂nigs in den Pyramidentexten (= Orbis biblicus et orientalis, vol. 189). Saint-Paul, 2002, , pp. 295, 296 & 311. In the famous Coffin Texts of Middle Kingdom period, Aker replaces the god Kherty, becoming now the \\"ferryman of Ra in his nocturnal bark\\". Aker protects the sun god during his nocturnal travelling through the underworld caverns. In the famous Book of the Dead, Aker also \\"gives birth\\" to the god Khepri, the young, rising sun in shape of a scarab beetle, after Aker has carried Khepri's sarcophagus safely through the underworld caverns. In other underworld scenes, Aker carries the nocturnal bark of Ra. During his journey, in which Aker is asked to hide the body of the dead Osiris beneath his womb, Aker is protected by the god Geb.Friedrich Abitz: Pharao als Gott in den Unterweltsb√ºchern des Neuen Reiches (= Orbis biblicus et orientalis, vol. 146). Saint-Paul, 1995, , pp. 119, 158 & 159. In several inscriptions, wall paintings and reliefs, Aker was connected to the horizon of the North and the West, forming a mythological bridge between the two horizons with his body. Certain sarcophagus texts from the tombs of Ramesses IV, Djedkhonsuiusankh and Pediamenopet describe how the sun god Ra travels through the underworld \\"like Apophis going through the belly of Aker after Apophis was cut by Seth\\". In this case, Aker seems to be some kind of representation of the underworld itself.Geraldine Pinch: Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of Ancient Egypt.

Samadov was the gold medalist at the 1991 World Weightlifting Championships, representing the Soviet Union with his superior clean and jerk evening his total weight with teammate Aleksandr Blyshchyk. In 1992, Altymurat Orazdurdiyev was the favorite, but was not selected for the Unified Team by coach and Russian national hero Vasily Alekseyev because Orazdurdiyev was from Turkmenistan, while Samadov was from Russia. Thus, Samadov was the new favorite. The Olympic competition was the closest in history, with all three medalists tied with the same weight lifted. The first tiebreaker was the athlete's body weight and Samadov was .05 kg heavier, pushing him to the bronze medal position. The second tie breaker was based on which athlete had lifted their weight first and Samadov would have bested eventual winner, Greek Pyrros Dimas by lifting his snatch on his second lift to Dimas' third. At the medal ceremony, Samadov refused to lean forward to accept his medal, instead taking it in his hand, before he dropped it to the podium and walked away to very loud boos. The International Olympic Committee disqualified Samadov and banned him for life. Samadov apologized the following day but the medal was not awarded, to him or to fourth place Chon Chol-Ho because the disqualification did not happen during the award ceremony. The IOC also did not accept his apology, and he was also banned for life by IWF commissioner Gottfried Schoedl. He was ineligible for the Weightlifting Hall of Fame, since making a medal ceremony protest was an offence to the entire Olympic Games.

It has a highly branched crown and the branchlets are covered with fine white hairs but become glabrous with age. The leaves are long and wide, narrow oval shaped and have a short stalk. The leaves also become glabrous as they develop. The flowers occur on the ends of the branches and in some leaf axils near the end but the branch usually continues to grow after flowering. There are 10 to 12 yellow stamens, long in each flower, sometimes with some of the stamens fused together. Flowering occurs mainly in July and August and the fruit which follow are woody capsules long. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca brevisepala was first formally described in 1992 by John Dawson in Flore de la Nouvelle-Cal√©donie et D√©pendances as Callistemon brevisepalus. In 1998 it was transferred to the genus Melaleuca by Lyndley Craven and John Dawson in the journal Adansonia.

It features Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage in an alternative universe where they have successfully built an analytical engine and use it to \\"fight crime\\". The book was published simultaneously by Pantheon Books in the US and Penguin Books in the UK on April 21, 2015. It has received positive reviews and awards.  Setting and publication history  The book grew out of a webcomic of the same name. The comic began as a single comic strip for Ada Lovelace Day, a celebration of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Disliking the fact that both Babbage and Lovelace died with their life work incomplete, Padua created a fictional ending for the strip, then found that \\"a lot of people saw it and thought that I was actually going to do a comic, which I had no intention of doing. But then I started thinking, 'What if I actually did the comic?' I started fooling around, and I guess I'm still fooling around with it.\\" The setting describes an alternative historical reality in which Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage have actually built an analytical engine and use it to \\"fight crime\\" at Queen Victoria's request. Also featured in the comic is the great engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, whom Padua has called \\"the Wolverine of the early Victorians\\". The comic is based on thorough research on the biographies of and correspondence between Babbage and Lovelace, as well as other bits of early Victoriana, which are then twisted for humorous effect. \\"Some of the documents are more entertaining than the actual comic. Plenty of times, I've thrown something into the comic just so I'd have an excuse to refer to some document,\\" Padua says. Awards and reception The book received positive early reviews from Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews. In December 2015 it was announced that, for The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, Padua would receive the biennial Neumann Prize of the British Society for the History of Mathematics, which is \\"awarded for a book in English ... dealing with the history of mathematics and aimed at a broad audience\\". The UK edition of the book received the 2015 British Book Design and Production Award for graphic novels. In April 2016 The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage was nominated for the Eisner Award in the Best Graphic Album‚ÄìNew category, and Padua in the Best Writer/Artist category.

Bidar enjoys a picturesque situation, having been situated and built on the brink of a plateau, and thus commanding lovely views of the lowlands (talghat) towards the north and the east. Its latitude is 17¬∞55'N., its longitude 77¬∞32' E., and the height above the sea-level . The climate is bracing and the temperature in the hottest season does not usually rise above . The Bidar plateau is an irregular oblong, in length and in extreme breadth. Ancient Period Traditional tales describe Bidar as the place where Vidura (one of the central character in the hindu epic Mahabharata) lived and the place was thus known as Viduranagara. Legend has associated Bidar with the ancient kingdom of Vidarbha, to which references are found in early Hindu literature.Malavikagnimitra ; Mahabharata ; the Harivamsa, Bhagavata, and a few other Puranas. But the situation of the latter kingdom has been determined by modern research, and it is now considered that Vidarbha occupied the country which was called Berar. The rulers of the kingdom are supposed to have been vassals of the Andhra rajas, whose dominions covered the plateau of the Deccan and at times extended over a much wider area. Bidar, which is some south-east of Paithan, the ancient capital of the Andhra kings, must have been included in the territory of the latter, and it has been associated with Vidarbha apparently on account of the similarity in names Bidar and Vidarbha. The identity of Bidar with Vidarbha was, however, a common belief in Firishta's time, for he, when referring to the romances of the early rulers of Bidar, describes the love-story of Nala and Damayanti (daughter of Raja Bhima of Vidarbha). The ancient megalithic culture began from about 1200 B.C.-1100 B.C., flourished up to about 3rd and 2nd century B.C. and survived up to c. 100 B.C. The megalithic culture of the region perhaps had intrusions of two Megalithic strains of different sort from the Vidharba region and eastern India, indicating respectively by certain pottery types particularly lids and also by horse-bits & copper objects on the one hand and the stone alignments on the other in north-eastern part of Karnataka. This region formed the southern part of Mauryan Empire as attested by the edicts of Ashoka. It came to be a part of Mauryan empire by the fact that Mauryas defeated the Nandas and became the heirs to the Nanda Empire in which Karnataka was also included. Bindusara ruled over the Deccan including the parts of Karnataka. Satavahanas dominated the post-Mauryan period for about four centuries. Gautamiputra Satakarni established his reign which was succeeded by his son Vashishtiputra PulumƒÅyi. Coins of this period are found in plenty in the deccan region which can be dated to a period from the 1st century A.D. to 3rd century A.D. Classical Period During the Kadamba's reign, the rule of Mayurasharma (325‚Äì345 A.D.) and that of Kakusthavarma (405‚Äì430 A.D.) were prominent. Their rule was confined up to the southern part of Bidar district. Kadambas extended their patronage to Shaiva, Vaishnava and Jaina dharmas. Their rule lasted for over 200 years. The history of the (Deccan) region in general and Karnataka in particular assumes special significance with the commencement of the rule of the Chalukyas of Badami (c. 500‚Äì757 A.D.) also called as the Early Western Chalukyas to distinguish them from the Later Chalukyas who ruled from their Capital at Kalyana. The Chinese traveller Hieun-Tsang visited the Chalukyan kingdom during 634‚Äì635 A.D. under the reign of Pulakeshi II and has paid a handsome tribute to the king and the prosperity of the kingdom. Kirtivarma II (c.745‚Äì757 A.D.) was the last ruler of the dynasty which was established by Jayasimha who ruled between 500 A.D. and 520 A.D. Rashtrakutas established their rule from early 750s which lasted till early 970s. They were highly distinguished dynasties of the Deccan & Karnataka. Some accounts relate them to Latur as the place of their origins. Krishna I and Govinda III were the great kings of the period. Amoghavarsha I moved the capital to Manyakheta (present day Malkhed) and beautified it. He patronised many religions including Buddhism. After a long reign of 64 years, he died in 878 A.D. and was succeeded by his son, Krishna II, who later developed friendly relations with the Arabs. The Rashtrakuta Empire was perhaps the most extensive than any of their Hindu successors in the Deccan. In no other period of ancient Indian history did the Deccan enjoy their political prestige which it did during the time of Rashtrakutas. The remarks of Arab traveller Sulaiman (851 A.D.) that this empire was one of the four great empires of the world and they were the most feared rulers of India. Temple building saw a great boom in this period. Ellora and other rock-cut / cave temples have been built under this dynasty. The Chalukyas of Kalyana were so called because they ruled from their capital Kalyananagara (modern day Basavakalyan) and are considered to be the descendants of the Chalukyas of Badami. The first king of the dynasty was Taila II (Tailapa II) who ruled from 973‚Äì997 A.D. after overthrowing Karka II, the last king of Rashtrakutas. The famous kannada poet Ranna also mentions of him belonging to Badami lineage. Taila II fought against the Cholas and defeated Rajaraja Chola in 992 A.D. and later his son Ahavamalla (Satyashraya) in 995 A.D. again defeated Chola's Army. Satyashraya who had the titles of Ahavamalla, Irivabedanga, Sahasabhima and Sattiga ruled from 997 A.D. to 1008 A.D. The hostility between Chalukyas and Cholas continued during this period also. Rajaraja Chola I and later his son Rajendra Chola marched against Satyashraya. The Cholas came up to Bijapur (present day Vijayapura) and ransacked the whole kingdom causing great violence. But Satyashraya drove them back. Ranna was patronised by Satyashraya. Despite his military engagements, he built his capital Kalyana and made it famous. The fifty-year rule of Vikramaditya VI (1076‚Äì1127 A.D.) was a glorious period in Karnataka's history. Many temples were built in this period which have some of the finest sculpture. In the temple at Jalsangi (Jalasangvi) is a beautiful sculpture which depicts a young woman writing an inscription paying great tribute to Vikramaditya VI. Thus Karnataka became a great centre of cultural activities. He was succeeded by Someshvara III (father of Taila III) During the reign of Taila III (1149‚Äì1162 A.D.), the Kalachuri Bijjala II was first to rebel against the Chalukyans and was largely responsible for the downfall of Chalukyas. By 1153 A.D., he proclaimed independence and occupied many parts of the Chalukyan kingdom. Thus was the southern Kalachuri established. The Kalachuris belonged to the Kattacchhuri family which ruled in Madhya Pradesh. Bijjala II was son of Permadi. Kalachuri chiefs were subordinates to the Chalukyans and were also in matrimonial alliances with them. Bijjala II was also a grandson of Vikramaditya VI. In about 1162 A.D., Bijjala II defeated Taila III replacing him as King. But his rule came to an end after 5 years due to opposition by the loyal feaudatories of Chalukyas. In all his political activities, Bijjala II was greatly helped by his able General Kasapayyanayaka. Bijjala's treasurer was the celebrated religious leader Basaveshwara. Bijjala II died in 1167 A.D. Singhana was the last king of Kalachuri Dynasty which ended in 1184 A.D. Someshvara IV (successor of Taila III) who had left the kingdom and ruled in nominal capacity re-captured the kingdom from Kalachuris in 1184 A.D. with the help of his able General Brahma and ruled until 1186. He was then challenged by the Hoysalas and Seunas. He lived up to 1198 A.D. as testified by the inscriptions but he was no longer the Chalukyan monarch. Hoysala Ballala II took over the Basavakalyan fort. During all this period it was political supremacy and cultural development moving hand in hand. In administration it evolved new principles which made the people happy and kingdoms prospered. Some of the luminaries in Kannada and Samskrita flourished in this era. The period also marked inauguration of a new social and religious movement under the leadership if Basaveshwara. This helped the growth of Vachana literature in Kannada. In the excavations carried out by the Archaeological Department, State of Hyderabad , some sculptures and broken tablets bearing inscriptions have been found in the Bidar fort; but they do not carry back the history of the place earlier than the 10th century A.D., when it was apparently included in the kingdom of the later Chalukyas (A.D. 974‚Äì1190), whose capital, Kalyani (present day Basavakalyan) is only west of Bidar. The power of the Chalukyas, however, rapidly declined during the rule of the last three kings of the dynasty, and a large portion of their territory was occupied by the Yadavas of Deogiri and the Kakatiyas of Warangal, whose kingdoms were at the zenith of their glory in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Bidar was apparently annexed to the Kakatiya kingdom, for in A.D. 1322, when Prince Ulugh Khan marched upon Warangal, he besieged and conquered the town of Bidar, which was on the frontiers of Telangana. An inscription of Ghiyath-ud-Din Tughluq, dated A.D. 1323, recently found at Kalyani, shows that the latter town was also conquered by Ulugh Khan in this expedition, but the absence of Kalyani's name in this connexion in contemporary history shows that Bidar at that time was a more important town than Kalyani, the glory of which seems to have faded with the decline of the Chalukyas. In this inscription Kalyani is mentioned as only a qasba, or minor town. Medieval Period Bahmani Sultanate  Bidar Sultanate  The Bidar Sultanate (also known as Barid Shahi dynasty) ruled the city formally from 1542 to 1619, although they formally held power since 1492. The dynasty was founded by Qasim Barid, who served as Prime Minister of the Bahmani Sultanate. His son Amir Barid succeeded him as Prime Minister and later became de facto ruler when the last Bahmani ruler fled from Bidar. Ali Barid Shah I, son of Amir Barid was the first to assume the royal title of Shah. He also played a key role in the Battle of Talikota.

The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra, Georg Feuerstein, 2011 Its root is sama (‡§∏‡§Æ) meaning ‚Äì equal or even.SƒÅmya - meaning equal consideration towards all human beings - is a variant of the word. Description Samatva occupies a high place in the Bhagavad Gita where it means even-mindedness or what would be called in English equanimity. Krishna in the context of metaphysical knowledge refers to equanimity when he tells Arjuna that all feelings are transitory and fleeting, ‡§§‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§§‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ therefore ignore them for they have to be endured (II.14) and that the wise are ‡§® ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§•‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø not tormented by these feelings (II.15). He once again refers to even-mindedness in the context of svadharma when Arjuna is told not to waver in the performance of his duty or shirk his duty, and to treat alike victory and defeat, gain and loss, pleasure and pain. For then he will not incur sin (II.31-38). Therefore, Arjuna is told ‚Äì : ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§É ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡§ø ‡§∏‡§ô‡•ç‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ß‡§®‡§û‡•ç‡§ú‡§Ø  : ‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§É ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ã ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó ‡§â‡§ö‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á  : \\"Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.\\" ‚Äì Bhagavad Gita (II.48) This sloka delineates the process of practicing Karma yoga which is a part of human nature and promotes tranquility. Man reaches the ultimate state of unshakable stability through the constant practice of indifference to success and failure of actions. Action with selfish motive does not result in even-mindedness. In the context of Karma yoga, Krishna tells Arjuna that the sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision (‡§∏‡§Æ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§ø‡§®‡§É) all beings of all castes and creed because the Atman is present in all bodies without any distinction (V.18), and affirms that ‚Äì ‡§á‡§π‡•à‡§µ ‡§§‡•à‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§§‡§É ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡•ã ‡§Ø‡•á‡§∑‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§®‡§É that those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already conquered the conditions of birth and death to be established in the Eternal (V.19). And, that ‚Äì : ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡•å‡§™‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§® ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ω‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡•Å‡§®  : ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ñ‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§¶‡§ø ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§¶‡•Å‡§É‡§ñ‡§Ç ‡§∏ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡•Ä ‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§§‡§É  : \\"He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both, their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna.\\" - Bhagavad Gita (VI.32) Then for that yogi there remains nothing in this world which has a separate identity from him, and no pain whatsoever; conscious of all such experiences but not affected by them he works for others to be uplifted. Thus, Krishna harmonizes ≈öreyas (personal salvation) and Lokasamgraha (good of the society) by linking ≈öreyas with 'even-mindedness' and Lokasamgrah with 'equal vision'. Swami Chinmayananda while commenting on Isha Upanishad (6), which speaks about the wise man beholding all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings, gives the meaning of samatva as ‚Äì the sameness of mind, inward tranquillity. The phrase 'All Beings' refers to the highest cosmic manifestation, and the phrase 'the Self in all beings' refers to Pure Consciousness, the inmost Atman of all embodied souls. The principle of Ni≈õkƒÅmakarma or the ideal of desire-less and motiveless action, does not bind the yogi to act‚Äôs consequences at the individual level; the yogi stays contented and even indifferent towards those very consequences; he knows that actions are not to be renounced, the fruits of actions alone are to be renounced. Once repulsion and action are removed what remains is \\"samatva\\". All enjoyment is dependent on certain conditions being met, much enjoyment occurs because some accomplish goals, this may be highly relative and dependent. Expectations of any benefit, that can be of any material gain, according to Bhagavad Gita is removed from ourselves. Knowledge of ourselves is in balance, the fruits of actions are changeable, unnecessary, unreal, unimportant, they lack what can uplift, they aren't furthering dignity, love and happiness and are transitory physically, mostly unrelated to knowledge and the true self. The followers of Jainism consider the practice of samtava as SƒÅdhanƒÅ because it is real human nature; they do not view samtava and dhyana as two varied aspects, according to them these two are interdependent, steadiness of the mind is reached by thinking about maitri (universal friendship), pramoda (emphasizing goodness), karuna (universal compassion) and madhyastha (indifference to sin of others). Mahavira had told Gautama that the nature of the soul is equanimity (Bhagavatisutra (9.386). Therefore, one who has samatva as his essential nature is called samayasƒÅra. In Gandhian aesthetics, samatva, understood as unity, equality, equanimity, balance and harmony in different perspectives, is the very essence of 'Sarvodya ideology'.

ATC changes the tool very quickly, reducing the non-productive time. Generally, it is used to improve the capacity of the machine to work with a number of tools. It is also used to change worn out or broken tools. It is one more step towards complete automation.  Description  Simple CNC machines work with a single tool. Turrets can work with a large number of tools. But if even more tools are required, then ATC is provided. The tools are stored on a magazine. It allows the machine to work with a large number of tools without an operator. The main parts of an automatic tool changer are the base, the gripper arm, the tool holder, the support arm and tool magazines. Although the ATC increases the reliability, speed and accuracy, it creates more challenges compared to manual tool change, for example the tooling used must be easy to centre, be easy for the changer to grab and there should be a simple way to provide the tool's self-disengagement. Tools used in ATC are secured in toolholders specially designed for this purpose. A chain type automatic tool changer with swiveling arm and two grippers, installed on a mill Types of ATC Depending on the shape of the magazine, ATC can be of two types: Drum Type changers are used when the number of tools is lower than 30. The tools are stored on the periphery of the drum. Chain type changers are used when the number of tools is higher than 30(The number is different depending on the design and manufacturer. It is important to note that the number of tools for the drum type is fewer than the chain type). But the tool search speed will be lower in this case. Automatic Tool Changer Mechanism After receiving the tool change command, the tool to be changed will assume a fixed position known as the \\"tool change position\\". The ATC arm comes to this position and picks up the tool. The arm swivels between machine turret and magazine. It will have one gripper on each of the two sides. Each gripper can rotate 90¬∞, to deliver tools to the front face of the turret. One will pick up the old tool from turret and the other will pick up the new tool from the magazine. It then rotates to 180¬∞ and places the tools into their due position. ATC on sheet metal working machinery ATCs were first used on chip-removal machinery, such as mills and lathes. Systems for automatic rearrangement of tools have also been used on sheet metal working machinery as well. Panel benders have an integrated, CNC-controlled device that allows to move punches according to the size of the part. Automated tool change on press brakes was limited to machines integrated on a robotic bending cell. Typically, a 6-axis robot used for handling sheet metal blanks is also in charge of changing punches and dies between different batches. Since the second decade of the XXI century, though, automatic tool changers have appeared on non-robotized press brakes. The most common configuration is a tool rack on the side of the press brakes, with a shuttle picking up tools and positioning them where needed. This reduces physical strain on the operator and increases overall productivity. An Automatic Tool Changer for press brakes, used to set up, rearrange, and remove punches and dies. Tooling is stored in a motorized tool rack (right) and is placed in the desired position by the shuttle (blue/grey/white on center). Functions of ATC The use of automatic changers increases the productive time and reduces the unproductive time to a large extent. It provides the storage of the tools which are returned automatically to the machine tool after carrying out the required operations, increases the flexibility of the machine tool, makes it easier to change heavy and large tools, and permits the automatic renewal of cutting edges. .

These dyes are commonly used every day. However, a side effect of their widespread use is that up to 12% of these dyes are wasted during the dying process and about 20% of this wastage enters the environment (mainly into water supply). Rauf, M.A.; Ashraf S.S. Fundamental Principles and Application of Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Degradation of Dyes in Solution. Chemical Engineering Journal 2009, 151, 10-18. Common industrial dyes of varying colors and types. Dye degradation is a process in which the large dye molecules are broken down chemically into smaller molecules. The resulting products are water, carbon dioxide, and mineral byproducts that give the original dye its color. During the dyeing process, not all of the dye molecules are used. The water waste that the industry releases contains a percentage of these dye molecules. Dye molecules persist in the environment because many of them are not reactive towards light, acids, bases and oxygen. The color of the material becomes permanent.  Photocatalysis  Standard photocatalysis set-up Heterogeneous photocataylsis is a widely accepted technique of choice for environmental purification. Pandit, V.K.; Arbuj, S.S.; Pandit, Y.B.; Naik, S.D.; Rane, S.B.; Mulik, U.P.; Gosavic, S.W.; Kale, B.B. Solar Light driven Dye Degradation using novel Organo‚ÄìInorganic (6,13-Pentacenequinone/TiO2) Nanocomposite‚Äù. RSC Adv. 2015, 5, 10326-10331. The standard experimental set up for dye degradation photocatalysis is by using a UV lamp to provide energy for the creation of oxidizing radicals. Photocatalysis is the addition of light to a semiconductor oxide/sulphide that results in electrons moving from the valence band to the conduction band. The electron-hole pairs formed will react with oxygen and water molecules to create superoxide anions and hydroxide radicals that have increased oxidizing and reducing abilities to be used on numerous industrial dye compounds.  Methods   6,13-Pentacenequinone/ Titanium Dioxide  Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is biologically stable, non-toxic, and cheap, which makes it a very common semiconductor for dye degradation. Due to its large band gap, some alterations can be made to improve its photocatalytic abilities such as the synthesis of 6,13-pentacenequinone/ TiO2. Titanium dioxide in conjunction with ultraviolet light can be utilized for the decolorization and detoxification of diluted colored water waste such as Alizarin, azo dyes, methyl red, methylene blue, etc.Lachheba, H.; Puzenata, E.; Houasb, A.; Ksibib, M.; Elalouib, E.; Guillarda, C.; Herrmanna, J.

Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 2012, 19 (9), 3676-3687.  CuS 3-D structures of copper sulfide (CuS) is favored for methylene blue degradation because it is nontoxic, inexpensive, and stable under ambient conditions. It has efficient catalytic ability because of its high surface area to volume ratio allowing for better contact between the reactants and CuS. Shu, Q.W.; Lan, J.; Gao, M.X.; Wangb, J.; Huang, C.Z.

Graphitic Carbon Nitride  Hierarchically porous graphitic carbon nitride (hp-g-CN) had a 90% photodegradation of methyl orange, which is an improvement over other commercial photocatalysts. Gu, S.; Xieb, J.; Li, C.M. Hierarchically porous graphitic carbon nitride: large-scale facile synthesis and its application toward photocatalytic dye degradation. RSC Adv. 2014, 4, 59436-59439. This is due to a higher surface area for an increased absorption capacity and porous features that allow for an increased diffusion of methyl orange.  Fenton Process  The Fenton reaction pathway. Oxidizing hydroxyl- and peroxy- radicals are generated that unselectively degrade any dye molecules present. The Fenton process utilizes iron catalysts with H2O2 to create powerful, oxidizing hydroxides for the degradation of organic pollutants such as sewage and sludge as well as dyes. To enhance the catalytic abilities, a combination of Fe2+ cations, ultraviolet light, and hydrogen peroxide can be used and has shown greater removals of dye solutions. Xu, X.; Li, H.; Wang, W.; Gu, J. Degradation of dyes in aqueous solutions by the Fenton process. Chemosphere 2004, 57, 595-600.  Biomass  Biomass degradation refers to the utilization of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi to produce enzymes that can interact with molecules of dyes. Laccases are proteins that are produced by Lentinus sp; its active site contains a group of polyphenol oxidases incorporated with four copper ions. These can form hydrogen bonds with synthetic dyes. The efficiency of this enzyme is proportional to the number of hydrogen bonds that form between the enzyme and dyes. Hsu, C.A.; Wen, T.N.; Su, Y.C.; Jiang, Z.B.; Chen, C.W.; Shyur, L.F. Biological Degradation of Anthroquinone and Azo Dyes by a Novel Laccase from Lentinus sp. Environmental Science & Technology 2012, 46 (9), 5109-5117. Microorganisms are easy to manipulate, but the efficiency is highly dependent on the pH, ionic strength, and temperature. This will be varied with different effluents. Prachi, K.; Anushree, M. Fungal dye decolourization: recent advances and future potential. Environment International 2009, 35 (1), 127-41.

It comprises four novels that were published between 2009 and 2012, and in 2014 was followed by a second series set in the same universe, Dangerous Creatures. The series is told from the viewpoint of the teenage boy Ethan. Synopsis The series follows Ethan Wate, a 16-year- old boy that dreams of leaving his small South Carolina town for something larger. At the start of the series he falls in love with Lena Duchannes, a new girl that is part of a secret section of humanity called Casters, people who are capable of working magic. They find that there are several obstacles to their love, most notably the social and cultural differences between their two societies and the fact that Ethan is incapable of touching Lena for extended periods of time without suffering a severe electric shock. Throughout the series Lena is troubled by the fact that she must claim herself as either a Light or Dark Caster on her sixteenth birthday and in the first novel she manages to perform a spell that prevents her from having to make this choice. However, in the process Ethan is mortally wounded and Lena is forced to perform another spell to bring him back to life, which causes her to distance herself from him out of fear that he will be further harmed. Their relationship is further harmed by the introduction of Liv, a secondary love interest for Ethan that is also aware of the Caster world. As the series progresses Ethan finds that he is constantly haunted by a series of strange songs and Lena is further tempted by various family members (including her mother and her cousin Ridley) to claim herself as a Dark Caster. These ongoing problems pose serious threats to their romance but are ultimately unsuccessful as Ethan and Lena are inevitably and continually drawn to one another. The only true barrier to their love comes in the form of a prophecy that the \\"One Who Is Two\\" must be sacrificed to bring Order back to the world. Initially they believe this to be Lena due to her dual Light/Dark nature, but find that it actually refers to Ethan, as his resurrection was done too quickly and part of his soul was left behind in the underworld. Knowing that this is the only way to keep everyone he knows and loves safe, Ethan voluntarily throws himself off of the town's water tower to his death and both parts of his soul are reunited. In the underworld Ethan finds that he still has limited communication with the living world and through this he manages to communicate with family members. He also discovers that he can come back to life, but only through a difficult ordeal that requires him to remove his page from The Caster Chronicles held by the Keepers at the Gates of the Far Keep. Ethan barely manages to succeed at this task and returns to the living world, where he is reunited with Lena. Although left with more questions than answers to everything, Ethan finds that he can now touch Lena without physical harm, allowing them to finally become a true couple. Novels #Beautiful Creatures #Beautiful Darkness #Beautiful Chaos #Beautiful Redemption Reception Critical reception for the series has been largely positive and the books were praised by multiple media outlets. Adaptations There have been two adaptations of the work, the 2013 film Beautiful Creatures and a manga adaptation that was illustrated by Cassandra Jean. Film In 2013 Alcon Entertainment produced a movie version of the film, which was directed by Richard LaGravenese. The movie starred Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert as Ethan Wate and Lena Duchannes and was released on February 14, 2013. The film was a box office and critical disappointment. Dangerous Creatures In 2013 Garcia and Stohl announced that they had begun work on a new series set within the same universe as the Caster Chronicles. The series, which is entitled Dangerous Creatures, follows the relationship between Ethan's friend Link and his girlfriend Ridley, a Siren and Lena's cousin. The two authors launched the series on December 17, 2013 with the e-novella Dangerous Dream and the first novel in the series was published on May 6, 2014.

SOD mimetics effectively convert the superoxide anion (O), a reactive oxygen species, into hydrogen peroxide, which is further converted into water by catalase.Baudry, M; Etienne, S; Bruce, A; Palucki, M; Jacobsen, E; Malfroy, B (30 April 1993). \\"Salen-Manganese Complexes Are Superoxide Dismutase-Mimics\\". Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 192 (2): 964‚Äì68. Retrieved 10 January 2015. Reactive oxygen species are natural byproducts of cellular respiration and cause oxidative stress and cell damage, which has been linked to causing cancers, neurodegeneration, age-related declines in health, and inflammatory diseases.Vujaskovic, Zeljko; Batinic-Haberle, Ines; Rabbani, Zahid; Feng, Qin- Fu; Kang, Song; Spasojevic, Ivan; Samulski, Thaddeus; Fridovich, Irwin; Dewhirst, Mark; Anscher, Mitchel (15 September 2002). \\"A small molecular weight catalytic metalloporphyrin antioxidant with superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic properties protects lungs from radiation-induced injury\\". Free Radical Biology and Medicine 33 (6): 857‚Äì63. Retrieved 10 January 2015. SOD mimetics are a prime interest in therapeutic treatment of oxidative stress because of their smaller size, longer half-life, and similarity in function to the native enzyme. The chemical structure of SOD mimetics generally consists of manganese, iron, or copper (and zinc) coordination complexes. Salen- manganese(III) complexes contain aromatic ring structures that increase the lipid solubility and cell permeability of the entire complex. Manganese (II) and iron (III) complexes are commonly used due to their high kinetic and thermodynamic stability, increasing the half-life of the mimetic. However, manganese-based SOD mimetics are found to be more therapeutically effective than their counterparts due to their low toxicity, higher catalytic activity, and increased stability in vivo. Dismutation of superoxide anions with a metal-based catalyzer (denoted by M) in a redox cycle. The Mn and Mn-1 show the oxidized and reduced forms of the metallic center, respectively. The metallic center is able to convert a superoxide anion to oxygen in the first half reaction by accepting an electron. In the second half reaction, the reduced metal atom donates the electron to another superoxide anion in order to form hydrogen peroxide, regenerating the metal ion in its original oxidation state. Mechanism of Action Similar to the native enzyme‚Äôs mechanism, the manganese complexes undergo a reversible oxidation/reduction cycle. In the first half reaction manganese covalently coordinates to the superoxide anion on its oxygen binding site, through inner-sphere electron transfer. (Mn) is reduced by superoxide, yielding molecular oxygen and a reduced form of manganese (Mn-1). The metal (Mn-1) is then regenerated to its former oxidation state (Mn) by reducing a second superoxide molecule to hydrogen peroxide. : 1. Mn \\\\+ O ‚Üí Mn-1 \\\\+ O2 : 2. Mn-1 \\\\+ O + 2H+ ‚Üí Mn \\\\+ H2O2 : Net: Mn \\\\+ 2O + 2H+ ‚Üí Mn \\\\+ O2 \\\\+ H2O2 The metal complex must be electron deficient in nature, allowing it to accept electrons from the superoxide. This is accomplished by coordinating electron-withdrawing ligands around the metal center. Since the mechanism of SOD mimetics involves a redox cycle, the catalytic activity of the SOD mimetic is partially dependent on the reduction potential of the metal center. Coordinated ligands of SOD mimetics fine-tune the chemical properties of the complex and are designed to match the 300mV reduction potential of the native enzyme.Crapo, James; Day, Brian; Fridovich, Irwin. \\"Development of Manganic Porphyrin Mimetics of Superoxide Dismutase Activity\\". Madame Curie Bioscience Database [Internet]. Landes Bioscience. Retrieved 31 January 2015. Manganese-Based SODs The most prominent SOD mimetics are: manganese porphyrin complexes, manganese (II) penta- azamacrocyclic complexes, and manganese (III) salen complexes.  Manganese Porphyrin  counter ion has been omitted from the structure. Porphyrin SOD mimetics consist of manganese (III) centers coordinated by a single porphyrin ring. Although both complexes are effective porphyrin-based superoxide dismutases, MnTBAP [Mn(III)tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin] was shown to better protect the cells from oxidative damages compared to ZnTBAP ((Zinc (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride)) in vivo. Researchers found MnTBAP reversed obesity and induced faster wound healing in diabetic mice. MnTBAP has the ability to prevent formation of cytotoxic peroxynitrite, a hazardous byproduct of superoxide reacting with nitric oxide, and induces healing process of wounds. MnTMPyP [manganese (III) tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin], another porphyrin molecule, was also found effective in relieving oxidative stress caused by peroxynitrite in intracellular and extracellular conditions. Manganese-porphyrin complexes reduced the damaging effects of radiation treatment in mice.  Manganese (II) Penta-Azamacrocyclic: M40401/3  Rotating model of M40401, a manganese- containing superoxide dismutase mimic. Grey, blue, purple, and white balls represent carbon, nitrogen, manganese, and hydrogen atoms, respectively. The counter ion has been omitted from the structure. M40403 and M40401 are Manganese (II) Penta-Azamacrocyclic complexes with SOD mimetic properties. Mn (II) complexes are found to be more stable in vivo and have high specificity for the superoxide anion, preventing unwanted interactions with biologically important molecules. They are characterized as having a small size, high stability, and higher catalytic efficiency than superoxide dismutase, especially in more acidic environments. M40403 was found effective in reducing oxidative tissue damage induced by total body irradiation. M40401 is similar in structure to M40403, but it has two additional methyl groups, causing a one hundredfold increase in catalytic activity in treatment of ischemia- reperfusion injuries. M40401 was also found to protect against hypoxic- ischemic brain injury.  Manganese (III) Salen  Mn (III) Salen complexes are found to be more stable than other iron or manganese mimics of superoxide dismutase. In certain synthesized forms, aromatic rings are coordinated with the manganese center, increasing the lipid solubility of the entire complex, allowing it to pass the cellular membrane. Life-span extension Treatment of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/catalase) mimetics has been reported to extend life-span. Mice with deficient SOD2 die prematurely, exhibiting severe metabolic and mitochondrial defects. Treatment of such mice with SOD/catalase mimetics extended their life-span by as much as three-fold. Treatment of wild-type mice with a carboxyfullerene SOD mimetic not only reduced age-associated oxidative stress and mitochondrial radical production, but significantly extended life-span. This treatment also rescued age-related cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that oxidative stress is an important determinant of life-span.

(Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology) Thor Solberg (March 28, 1893 ‚Äì February 26, 1967) was a Norwegian-born aviation pioneer who made the first successful flight from the United States of America to Norway in 1935. He made the journey, which started in New York City, in an open-cockpit single-engine aircraft with no landing instruments. For this reason, he was restricted to an altitude of . Solberg also founded the Solberg-Hunterdon Airport in New Jersey. Early life Thor Simonsen Solberg was born on his family's farm (Solberg p√• √Örebrot) at Flor√∏ in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. He had ten brothers and sisters, including Halfdan and Lars Solberg. Solberg was interested in motors and aviation from an early age and was a \\"daring\\" motorcyclist in his youth. He was also interested in artistic picture framing in his youth. Solberg participated in a number of motorcycling speed events during his early years. He also rode from Oslo to Paris in 48 hours in 1923. Early flying career Solberg received his pilot's training in Germany in the years following World War I. He took a pilot's license in 1919 and became one of Norway's aviation pioneers. Solberg, inspired by aviators such as Charles Lindbergh, was to be the first person to fly from Norway to the United States solo, receiving some aid and advice from Roald Amundsen. Solberg lived in the United States from 1925 or 1928. Upon arriving in the United States, Solberg worked at various jobs, such as proprietor of an art studio and picture framing store in Brooklyn, while planning his flight. Solberg flew over much of the United States in his Bellanca CH-200 Pacemaker while preparing for the flight. Flight to Norway In preparation for his flight to Norway, Solberg practiced blind flying, studied his route, and created his own maps of it. He received financial and technical support from two of his brothers, Bernt Balchen, and several other people. After managing to convince the Enna Jettick Shoe Company to fund his flight, Solberg made his first attempt to fly from the United States to Norway with Carl Petersen in a Bellanca K, named Enna Jettick, (formerly Roma from a failed US to Italy flight), on August 23, 1932, but that attempt failed. They encountered fog and snow near Newfoundland and were forced to make a crash landing. Shortly afterwards, they were rescued by nearby fishing boats. On July 18, 1935, Solberg made a second attempt with a different plane, an amphibious single-engine Loening C-2-C Air Yacht that he named Liev Eiriksson. On this flight, Paul C. Oscanyan, who had worked for Eastern Airlines, joined the flight as radio operator. They departed from Floyd-Bennett Field and made four stops at locations between the United States and Norway before landing in Norway on 16 August 1935 after passing through Labrador, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Bergen. Solberg's course roughly followed the path that Leif Erikson's voyage took. Upon his arrival in Norway, the King of Norway gave Solberg a gold medal. Later flying career In 1939, Solberg founded the Solberg-Hunterdon Airport in central New Jersey. In 1941, he received permission from the Readington Township Committee to operate a commercial airport. The airport was also used as a training facility during World War II where Solberg trained approximately 5,000 aviators. Solberg Airport was also used to train pilots for Pan American World Airways. Personal life, death, and legacy Solberg was a Knight of the Order of St. Olav. He was also a notable member of the Norsemen Lodge, an organization which was composed of people of Norwegian birth or descent. Additionally, he was a life member of the Explorers' Club in New York. Solberg died in Branchburg, New Jersey at the age of 73 and was buried at the churchyard in Flor√∏.

According to the 2014 census, they make up 39.1% of the total population with around 105,000 people. Though Melanesian settlement is recorded on Grande Terre's Presqu'√Æle de Fou√© as far back as the Lapita culture, the origin of Kanak people is unclear. Ethnographic research has shown that Polynesian seafarers have intermarried with the Kanaks over the centuries. The Kanaks refer to the European inhabitants of New Caledonia as Caldoches. New Caledonia was annexed to France in 1853, and became an overseas territory of France in 1956. An independence movement led to a failed revolt in 1967, and was restarted in 1984, pursuing total independence status from the French rule. When the 1988 Matignon agreements were signed between the representatives of France and New Caledonia to decide on holding the referendum for independence, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the Kanak leader of the independence movement, had mooted a proposal to set up an Agency for the Development of Kanak Culture (ADCK). After Tjibaou's assassination in 1989, the French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand ordered that a cultural centre on the lines suggested by Tjibaou be set up in Noum√©a, the capital of New Caledonia; it was to be the last of Mitterrand's Grands Projets. The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre was formally established in May 1998. Although ancient Lapita potteries date back to 1500 BC, and the people of the island have long been involved in the arts, since the establishment of the ADCK, Kanak arts and crafts have become more popular in New Caledonia. Wooden carvings in the shape of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are popular as is fl√®che fa√Æti√®re, a carving which resembles a small totem pole with symbolic shapes. Music, dance and singing are part of many a Kanak ceremonial function and dances are performed during the traditional Kanak gatherings with the objective of cementing relationships within the clan and with ancestors. Etymology The word 'Kanak' is derived from kanaka maoli, a Hawaiian phrase meaning 'ordinary person' which was at one time applied indiscriminately by European colonisers, traders and missionaries in Oceania to any non-European Pacific islander. Prior to European contact, there were no unified states in New Caledonia, and no single self-appellation used to refer to its inhabitants. Other words have been coined from Kanak in the past few generations: Kanaky is an ethno-political name for the island or the entire territory. Kan√©ka is a musical genre associated with the Kanak, stylistically a form of reggae with added flutes, percussion and harmonies. Kaneka often has political lyrics and is sung in Drehu, Paici or other Melanesian languages, or in French. The word \\"kanak\\" is grammatically invariable. The German racial epithet Kanake ‚Äî which is now applied to all non-whites, even Southern Europeans in some cases, and especially to Turkish immigrants ‚Äì also derives from the same source, and was originally applied to people from German colonial possessions in Oceania. History Antique lithograph of Kanaks. Origin Melanesian settlement on Grande Terre dates back at least as far as the Lapita culture. However, the origin of Kanak people is unclear. Obsidian transported from New Guinea was found with the earliest New Caledonian Lapita pottery. In addition, some researchers have claimed there is evidence of New Caledonian human habitation dating from 3000 BC (predating Lapita culture by 1500 years), while others claim to have found pre-Lapita pottery. At the Fourth Lapita Conference, held in June 2000, in Canberra, Australia, the question was posed: \\"Is Lapita Kanak, or is Lapita the oldest and first ancestor of a later culture that is labelled Kanak?\\" Still another problem in determining the origin and early history of Kanak people is that the archaeological interpretation is in conflict with the views of Kanak people which have become politicized subsequent to colonial rule. Early colonial rule The earliest history of Europeans arriving on these islands is when Captain James Cook of the Kingdom of Great Britain landed in these islands in 1775 at a time when there were reportedly 70,000 Kanaks living in the archipelago. Cook gave the name \\"New Caledonia\\" to these islands, after Caledonia, a traditional name for his Scottish Highlands. Fifty years later, the Protestants of London Missionary Society came to New Caledonia, which was followed by entry of the French Catholics to the island, in 1843. This resulted in a conflict between the two religious factions and eventually the French Catholics' control of the islands prevailed. The island nation was thereafter annexed by France, in 1853. During the colonial period, in the 19th century, Kanaks were recruited or enslaved, to perform unfree labour in places such as Australia, California, Canada, Chile and Fiji (with the inter-Asian slave trade to India, Japan, South Africa, and what is now Malaysia). During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were unprepared for the arrival of European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works. Revolt Kanak warriors, When Kanaks were forced to move to reserve areas of the island, closer to the mountains, they occupied only 10 per cent of the area of their ancestral territories given that their population had declined so dramatically due to disease, and their living conditions became very hard. This situation arose consequent to induction of 20,000 convicts by the French government between 1864 and 1897, most of whom settled permanently in the country, and who were employed to extract nickel (beginning with 1864) and copper from 1875 onwards. This caused serious resentment among the Kanaks who revolted in 1878 against the French colonial rule, which was suppressed by the French who were better armed. The Kanak leader was decapitated, and his head was put on display in the Museum of Natural History. After World War II After World War II, the Kanak independence movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French settlers in the country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly before it became an overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were then also allowed to move out of their reserve areas. This was followed by the establishment of the Territorial Assembly in 1957, but this was short-lived; Charles de Gaulle abolished it after he became the President of France, in 1958. Agitation for independence In 1981 the movement for Independence began, following the murder of Pierre Declercq, the secretary general of the Caledonian Union (French: Union cal√©donienne, UC) on 19 September 1981. A national forum titled \\"Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak Socialiste\\" (FLNKS) was established in 1984. This forum refused to participate in elections to the Territorial Assembly and even declared its own Provincial Government; it met with opposition by the French. FLNKS \\"organized a boycott of the territorial elections in New Caledonia, smashing ballot boxes and setting up roadblocks to prevent people from voting.\\" The FLNKS persisted with their agitation and unilaterally announced on 7 January 1985 that a referendum on independence would be conducted in July 1985. After the death of Kanak leader Eloi Machoro in 1985, Kanak activists took 27 gendarmes hostage on the island of Ouv√©a, igniting a French response (see Ouv√©a cave hostage taking). The Kanak movement proposed a self-government in January 1986. An interim arrangement was announced by Mitterrand who moved to give greater autonomy in the colony. However, the French prime minister Jacques Chirac stationed troops in the islands and the autonomy issue was shelved. The FLNKS, backed in their campaign for a referendum by regional organizations such as the \\"Groupe du fer de lance m√©lanesien\\" (the Melanesian Spearhead Group), the Pacific Forum, and the Nonaligned Countries Movement, were successful in getting the UN Resolution 41-41 A of 2 December 1986 passed; it re-inscribed New Caledonia on the Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories. But this resolution did not mitigate the violence as what ensued was more confrontations with the authorities: the \\"Ouv√©a cave hostage taking\\" resulted in 21 deaths including 19 Kanaks. Following the battle, there was an international outcry that resulted in initiation of talks for settlement between the French government, the Kanaks and the French settlers. Matignon Accord An agreement called the Matignon Accord followed on 6 November 1988 between the French and the Kanaks, which had the majority support of 80% of the French people. According to the Matignon Accord (or Matignon Agreement) a referendum on independence was proposed to be held by 1998. However, two of the Kanak leaders who had signed the agreement, Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene, were assassinated on 4 May 1989 by a Kanak activist. The Kanak independence activists were unhappy with the situation as they felt that France would never allow them independence. Noum√©a Accord A subsequent agreement, the \\"Noum√©a Accord\\", was signed between the FLNKS President and the French Government on 5 May 1998, allowing for a degree of autonomy to New Caledonia over a transition period of up to 20 years. A referendum for independence from France was held in 2018. Progressive changes that were expected of this agreement were in the local political control and structure; the Kanaks would have greater say over internal and regional affairs while France would retain sovereign rights including control over military and foreign affairs. In a speech made before the Fourth Commission of the United Nations on 10 October 2005, the FLNKS Vice President, L√©opold Jor√©di√©, urged the UN \\"to establish a monitoring and follow-up system for the previous contracts signed between multinationals and municipalities, by drawing on the initiatives of Global Witness and asking the UN to put in place an ad hoc commission in order to protect the wealth of New Caledonia, following the example of what was done for Congo.\\" Present status The Caledonian Union, one of the political parties within the pro-independence FLNKS group had, in 2010, appealed for a national committee to evaluate progress and prepare New Caledonia for the change in leadership before the planned referendum in 2014. In this appeal, the UC also argued that, according to the Noum√©a Accord, it was obligatory for the French government to train and build the capacity of Kanaks to be able to take over the government in 2014 and urged them to respond swiftly. In reality the referendum was delayed until 2018 and its result was to remain with France, by a 56% majority. Two repeat referendums will be held, the first in 2020. Population Two Kanak warriors posing with penis gourds and spears Demographics New Caledonia or Territoire des Nouvelle-Caledonie et Dependances, is approximately 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) off the northeast coast of Australia. Of its 500 islands, the five main ones are inhabited, are spread across an area wide and over in length. As of 2009, the Melanesian Kanak people constituted 40.3% (99,078) of the population of 245,580 in New Caledonia, a minority in their ancestral land. The other groups consist of Europeans (mostly French) at 29%, Wallisian 9%, people of mixed ancestry (8%), and other groups including Polynesians, Indonesians, Vietnamese and those (believed to be chiefly of European ancestry) who identified simply as \\"Caledonian.\\" In 1774, Cook landed in Balade and estimated a population of around 50,000 for the whole island. A minimum of 100,000 is more likely, considering the amount of land that can be shown to have been cultivated pre- colonially.Sand, Christophe. 2000. \\"Reconstructing \\"traditional\\" Kanak society in New Caledonia: the role of archeology in the study of European contact\\". In: Clark A. and Torrence, R. The Archaeology of Difference: Negotiating Cross-Cultural Engagements in Oceania. London; New York: Routledge. This declined to 27,000 during early colonial rule as a result of disease. Kanaks were historically associated with tribes, including the Bwaarhat, Tiendanite, Goa, and Goosana, as well as clans, such as the Poowe. Languages Kanak languages are extremely diverse, but French serves as the official language of New Caledonia. There are 28 distinct Kanak languages, as well as many dialects, out of the 1,200 Melanesian languages spoken throughout the Pacific. They are mutually incomprehensible. All are a part of the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family. They all belong to the New Caledonian subgroup ‚Äì except for Fagauvea, spoken at the Loyalty Island of Ouv√©a, which is a Polynesian language. New Caledonia languages are divided into several groups. The Northern language group is tonal and includes 12 languages: Caac, Cemuh√Æ, Fw√¢i, Jawe, Kumak, Nemi, Paic√Æ, Pije, Pwaamei, Pwapwa, Yalayu, and Yuaga. Approximately 60,000 residents of New Caledonia speak at least one of the Kanak languages. Most of these languages are only in spoken form. There is no one unified language among the Kanaks; however, the largest group of Kanaks speak Drehu. Coming from an oral tradition, the written word was nonexistent until the missionary arrival. Kanak knowledge was passed orally in the form of poems, legends, and stories. Children's oral history is provided by parents and other relatives who also use tickling and onomatopoeic noise to hold the child's attention. Of the Kanak authors, some of the notable ones are Jean- Marie Tjibaou who wrote La Pr√©sence Kanak; Susanna Ounei-Small, a Kanak author from Ouv√©a who wrote about the Matignon Accords; and Kaloombat Tein, author of Hwanfalik ‚Äì Sayings from the Hienghene Valley which provides insight into Hiengh√®ne legends and is written in Hiengh√®ne, with English language translation. Tjibaou was involved in the establishment of the √âcoles populaires kanak, which was taught in a local Kanak language and educated children in spiritual and practical knowledge, while including French and English language instruction. Since 2006, pre-school children have been given the opportunity to learn indigenous Kanak languages. While the Kanak languages have been taught in high schools across the Loyalty Islands and North Province, the language education has not been as common in the more European South Province. The establishment of the Kanak Language Academy (KLA) was a provision of the Noum√©a Accord. Culture Traditional beliefs and religion Kanaks, The Kanaks were known to worship their ancestors. This worship was embodied in the sepulchre, sacred stones, and devotional hearths where they offered sacrifices. Today, most Kanaks are Christians. Religion is an important aspect of Kanaks' life. Kanaks attend the Catholic Church in Noum√©a. and they form nearly 50% of the population of Catholics in New Caledonia, next only to the Europeans. Also, the majority of Protestants are Kanaks. However, there are a few who follow traditional beliefs. According to the traditional beliefs of the Kanak people, the sea is sacred as it provides them with \\"fish for food\\", so they treat it with great reverence. The folk stories created by the Kanak people not only attest to this fact but are also strictly followed as unwritten laws. Some of the important aspects of the oral laws relate to environmental protection and conservation, such as the closure of fishing operations when the fish stocks are on the decline, and fishing rights in certain areas are strictly observed with respect to locals. Conservation Following these beliefs and traditions, Kanak people and Conservation International (CI) have been jointly involved in conserving the ancestral waters and natural resources. According to a rapid assessment survey conducted with help from the Kanaks, 42 coral reefs have been identified for protection near Nord's Mont Pani Province. Its rich biodiversity reserves also include sea cucumbers, molluscs, crustaceans, herrings, groupers, and snappers. Supporting Kanak traditions, the Coral Reef Initiative for the South Pacific's (CRISP) partnership with CI provided recommendations and underwater species guides to the Kanak people. In 2004, a proposal was put forward to promote the entire coastal region as a World Heritage Site. Further work on this initiative has been pursued by CI's Center for Applied Biodiversity Science, the Coral Reef Initiative for the South Pacific (CRISP), and the French Government, in collaboration with WWF to assess marine resources used by both Kanak tribes and people of European descent across three coastlines of the Nord Province. Cuisine A Kanak woman with bougna, a casserole of fruit and fish baked in a ground oven. Bougna is a traditional Kanak casserole, considered a national food by many Kanaks. It is made of sliced root vegetables which might include taro, manioc, yams and coconut milk. Pork, chicken or seafood may be used in the filling which is then wrapped in poingo banana leaves before being cooked over hot stones in an earthen oven. Other local ingredients used in Kanak cuisine include Rousettus (flying foxes) and local deer; marine staples such as lagoon and coral reef fish (including dawa), as well as crabs and lobsters. Paita beans are locally grown haricots, while custard-apple, lime and saffron are other local ingredients. Fine arts The Kanak arts of sculpture, dance, music and theatre have become more popular since the 1990s with the efforts of the Agency for Development of Kanak Culture ADCK Art forms in Kanak culture comprise: ;Lapita pottery The ancient Lapita potteries date to 1500 BC. Essentially a women's craft, the pottery is generally decorated with geometric patterns and stylised human faces, although there is variation between northern and southern New Caledonian pottery. The various handles and glazes have pinhole-incised designs made from tooth combs. The pottery was made from clay deposits found in the islands. ;Paintings Painting is a recent art form common among women artists. Famous artists include Yvette Bouquet from Koumac who has produced paintings with Pacific and Oceania themes, Paula Boi, whose paintings are of more abstract scenes, and Denise Tuvouane and Maryline Thydjepache who use mixed art forms. Bus stop shelters are common places where their paintings are illustrated. ;Wood sculpture Wood sculpture represents the spirit of Kanak culture of which the Fl√®che fa√Æti√®re, which resembles a small totem pole with symbolic shapes, is the most common. A mini Stonehenge-looking religious memorial near the village in L'√éle-des-Pins has a display of religious carvings. Other wooden objects include war clubs carved from the strongest wood, made in the form of a phallic head (casse-tete), a lethal bird's beak club (bec d'oiseau), and spears made from niaouli trees used to burn enemy houses. Fragment of a roof finial of a large clan house, sculpture of the Kanak people made of Houp wood, New Caledonia, late 14th century‚Äîearly 15th century Wooden carvings in the shape of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are decorated with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor's voice, and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faiti√®re is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses. ;Stone carving Stone carvings made of jade or serpentinite are in the form of ceremonial axe representing clan's strength and power. These were used to behead enemies during war and during ancestor celebrations known as Pilou. The bottom of the handle represents the particular clan and is embellished with stones and shells. The axe is polished smooth like a disc. Carvings made of soapstone are also popular. ;Bamboo carvings A meter in length canes, dated between 1850 and 1920, are used to make an entry into a village or in dance ceremonies. The canes were fired to give black patina over the engraved parts; the engraving designs consist of geometrical real images from the pilou dance, agricultural motifs and village scenes of fishing or building a Grand Hut or case. These were also stuffed with magic herbs to ward off evil spirits. ;Tapa Tapa is a bark cloth made into small pieces, often from banyan trees used to wrap up Kanak ancient bead money. ;Boats Kanaks living on the islands made canoes out of hollowed‚Äìout trunks and large double‚Äìhulled outriggers with triangular sails, known as pirogues, traditionally used for fishing. Dances Dances are performed during the traditional Kanak gatherings with the objective of cementing relationships within the clan and with ancestors. Dance is performed in the form of a message or a legend, often related to their daily activities or important events such as birth, marriage, circumcision, the death of a chief and so forth. Dancers paint themselves colourfully to please the ancestors watching over them. Wooden masks made of local materials such as bark, feathers and leaves adorn them representing a physical link with the invisible world. The Festival des Arts du Pacifique, the Festival of Pacific Arts, is organized every four years. Dancers are trained in traditional dances in special workshops. Welcome dances performed by groups are very popular. Of the various dance forms, the pilou-pilou dance is a unique dance form of the Kanaks, which recounts many stories of the clans. The pilou-pilou dance form of the Kanaks, now almost extinct, was so named by the early French missionaries of New Caledonia and involved stomping with bamboo tubes and beating of bark-clappers accompanied by singing in duets with shrieks and whistles of hundreds of dancers. However, in view of very strong nature of this form of dance, with a trance-like status attained by the dancers, these have been banned; the last such dance reported was in 1951. Music Music, dance and singing are part of many a Kanak ceremonial function such as initiation, courting and mourning. Conch shells are blown by an appointed person to represent a clan chief's arrival or the voice of an ancestor. Rhythm instruments used include Bwanjep, used during ceremonies by a group of men; Jew's harp, (wadohnu in the Nengone language where it originated) made of dried piece of coconut palm leaf held between the teeth and an attached segment of soft nerve leaf; coconut-leaf whizzer, a piece of coconut leaf attached to a string and twirled that produces a noise like a humming bee; oboe, made of hollow grass stems or bamboo; end-blown flute, made of 50 cm long hollowed pawpaw leaf stem; bamboo stamping tubes that are struck vertically against the ground and played at major events; percussion instruments (hitting sticks, palm sheaths); rattles that are worn on the legs made of coconut leaves, shells and certain fruits. Kanak groups such as Bethela first made the recordings on cassette around 1975 or 1976. Exhibit of stages of construction of a Kanak hut Art festivals In 1971 the women's association, Smiling Melanesian Village Women's Groups was formed and advocated the idea of a cultural festival to promote Kanak arts. As a result of this movement the first festival of Melanesian arts, \\"Melanesia 2000\\", was held in Noum√©a in September 1975, supported by Jean-Marie Tjibaou. Kanak arts festivals became popular with two international events held early in the 1990s that created the awareness of Kanak arts. The first exhibition of modern-day wood sculptors and painters was held at Ko i Neva, which was also published as contemporary Kanak arts. This was followed by a large exhibition of Kanak arts in Paris known as \\"De Jade et de Nacre - Patrimoine Artistique Kanak (Jade and Mother of Pearl - Kanak Artistic Heritage\\". The Centre Cultural Tjibaou also stages occasional art exhibitions. A popular quadrennial event is the Festival of Pacific Arts where the indigenous people of all Pacific nations and people gather to display the Pacific's cultural heritage.

The algorithm was published in 2010 and implemented in a program also named UCLUST. The algorithm is described by the author as following two simple clustering criteria, in regard to the requested similarity threshold T. The first criterion states that any given cluster's centroid sequence will have a similarity smaller than T to any other clusters' centroid sequence. The second criterion states that each member sequence in a given cluster will have similarity to the cluster's centroid sequence that is equal or greater than T. UCLUST algorithm is a greedy one. As a result, the order of the sequences in the input file will affect the resulting clusters and their quality. For this reason, it is advised that the sequences will be sorted before entering clustering stage. The program UCLUST is equipped with some options to sort the input sequences prior to clustering them. UCLUST program is widely utilized among the bioinformatic research community, where it used for multiple applications including OTU assignment (e.g. 16s), creating non-redundant gene catalogs, taxonomic assignment and phylogenetic analysis.

He was named \\"Biggy\\" as he was larger in appearance. In 1977, Biggy decided to start a career in music. He joined the jazz band Kiwiro as a drummer. He later left Kiwiro to team up with D.O. Misiani of jazz band Shirati as a drummer. A new band, Super Heka Heka, was formed following the departure of Biggy from Kiwiro. Original members of the band included : Okello Adwera (bass guitar), Paul Olang'o (vocalist), Ochieng Viva (vocalist & composer), Dick Ouma 'Wuod Gi Mbala Jasuba'(Rhythm Guitar & vocals),Owiti Ahuja (Solo guitar), Bingwa (drummer) and Okatch (founder of the band). They were later joined by Oginga Wuod Awasi. This new band was resident at Gusii Night Club in Kisii. Upon moving to Kisumu, Biggy's music gathered something of a cult following among fans of the modification of Benga. While in Kisumu, few rich friends and lovers of his music like ; Prof. Francis Owino Rew, Hosea Songa and Oduor Leo organized a fundraising and the resultant cash was used to buy Biggy new musical instruments to start up his band. His personal approach and singing style drew fans. Kisumu Junction Inn was the center for this music. The band's popularity later spread across Kenya. For the two years his music career peaked, Benga maestro Okatch Biggy bestrode the entertainment industry like a colossus. Between 1995 and 1997, the artiste gave benga music a new meaning, and went ahead to snatch its control from legend Owino Misiani whose fame spanned Kenya and Tanzania. Biggy stole the limelight after a prolonged lull in benga, which saw kingpins like Ochieng Nelly, Collela Mazee, Awino Lawi, Ochieng Kabasellah, George Ramogi and Ouma Omore take a beating from invasion of the local scene by Congolse music. His seismic beats and striking compositions laced with words that bordered on the lewd earned him a special place in the hearts of fans in Kisumu, Mombasa and Nairobi where he staged most of his shows. At the time of his death on 16 November 1997, Biggy and his Super Heka Heka Band had recorded five albums.

During the defense Rebollo showed several inconsistencies in the prosecutor's story but Grimau was convicted and executed. Several decades after the trial Rebollo pleaded for the rehabilitation of the integrity of Grimau. He furthermore stated that he took up the defense as part of his duties as a military man, Christian and lawyer. Czechoslovakia honored Rebollo by naming a street in Prague after him. In 1970 he was the Spanish representative in the International Congress for Civil Law. Rebollo took up several positions as civil servant administrator. In 1973 Rebollo became Secretary General of Spanish train operator Renfe, a position which he kept until 1976. Between 1976 and 1977 he was director general of Vivienda. He was director general of state-owned post service Correos between 1977 and 1978. Rebollo subsequently became Sub-secretary for Transport and Communication and stayed in this position until 1980. He then returned to Renfe, where was president until 1982. He became known as a vigorous defender of the proposed rail-line which would link central Spain with his home community of Asturias. In 1983 he worked as a lawyer for the holding company Rumasa when it was nationalized by the Spanish government on 23 February. Rebollo was an active member of the political party Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) and when that party fractured in the early 1980s he became one of the founders of the Democratic and Social Centre party in 1982. He was the president of the party in Asturias and also served as its Deputy in the Congress for the Legislatures III (1986‚Äì1989) and IV (1989‚Äì1993). Adolfo Barthe Aza, a former member of the UCD, stated that Rebollo was not content with the status of Spanish politics in later years, and that he planned a re-entry into politics in Asturias in 2007 but later changed his mind. Personal life Rebollo was considered to be the right-hand man of Spanish Prime Minister Adolfo Su√°rez and friend of Spanish Kings Juan Carlos I and Felipe VI. He was married and had five children. His brother Jos√© Luis Rebollo was the anti-drugs prosector of Asturias. Rebollo received the Order of Civil Merit, the Cross of Military Merit and the Gran Plaque of the Order of Postal Merit. Rebollo suffered from Alzheimer's disease. He died on 11 March 2015 in Madrid, aged 80.

He was a member of the Party Politburo Agitation Committee in the German Democratic Republic from 1965, and in 1981 he replaced Harri Czepuck as chairman of the country's national Union of Journalists.Wilke, J√ºrgen, Julia Martin, Denis Fengler, and Marc Levasier. Journalisten und Journalismus in der DDR: Berufsorganisation, Westkorrespondenten, \\"Der schwarze Kanal\\". K√∂ln: B√∂hlau, 2007. pp. 26‚Äì28 Life Eberhard Heinrich was born in a small rural town in Lower Silesia, roughly 80 km (50 miles) west of Breslau. His father was a clerical employee. Heinrich attended a commercially focused school and started on an industrial/commercial training. In 1943 he was arrested and held in youth detention for several months on account of \\"illegal political activity\\". In 1944 he was excluded from the Hitler Youth and conscripted for National Labour service. At this stage of the war, with the German army having suffered massive casualties, national labour service rapidly became conscription into the army even for boys who a few years earlier would have been considered too young to serve. Heinrich deserted from the army in 1945 which was the year in which, in May 1945, the war ended. He spent 1945/46 as a Prisoner of War, held by the Americans, at the same time working at agricultural labour and relief work in L√ºtzelsachsen. In May 1945 what remained of Germany had been divided into four principal zones for military occupation. Eberhard's home region of Lower Silesia was now part of Poland, survivors from its formerly German speaking population having been persuaded to leave. L√ºtzelsachsen where he had been imprisoned was to the west, in the American occupation zone. As soon as he was able, however, in June 1946 Eberhard Heinrich relocated to the east, settling in the Soviet occupation zone. Here the way was already being paved for a return to one-party government with a contentious merger, in April 1946, between the old Communist Party and the Moderate-left SPD. Heinrich lost no time in joining the resulting Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands), now the ruling party for what would become the German Democratic Republic, formally founded in October 1949. In October 1946 Heinrich became a volunteer editorial assistant with the left-wing newspaper \\"Vorw√§rts\\": he stayed with the paper at least through most of 1947. Between October 1947 and May 1948 he underwent a journalistic training at the Party Academy. Heinrich was evidently still associated with \\"Vorw√§rts\\" in 1949 which was when The Party took the decision to merge the Berlin edition of \\"Vorw√§rts\\" with Neues Deutschland, the official mass-circulation newspaper of the ruling SED (party) and thereby of the German Democratic Republic. The merger took effect on 1 January 1950. Eberhard Heinrich now joined Neues Deutschland, workling between 1950 and 1962 as a departmental head and editorial secretary. Between 1962 and 1965 he served as the newspaper's deputy chief editor. During this period, in 1953, he also undertook a correspondence degree course with the Leipzig Journalism Academy. Moving beyond the world of journalism, between 1965 and 1980 he worked full-time with the Party Politburo Agitation Commission, taking a succession of increasingly senior roles before becoming the personal assistant to Werner Lamberz, the Commission Secretary, following whose death Heinrich himself served as Commission Secretary between 1978 and December 1980. Although Heinrich never actually followed Lamberz to become a member of the powerful Party Central Committee, his name did feature on the list of candidates for membership from 1971 right up till the institutional collapse of 1989/90. He was, however, on the central committee of the East German Union of Journalists, serving as the union president in succession to Harri Czepuck between 1981 and 1990. This led to international roles including vice-presidency of the (Soviet sponsored) International Organization of Journalists and chairmanship of the International council for journalism training. Personal Eberhard Heinrich was married to Lieselotte Thoms- Heinrich, a journalist and, between 1963 and 1990, a longstanding member of the National Legislature (Volkskammer).

They are characterized as Princess Aurora's fairy godmothers, who appear at baby Aurora's christening to present their gifts to her, as well as her guardians and/or parents. The three were voiced by Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen, and Barbara Luddy, respectively. Characteristics and Personalities Flora is the tallest and oldest fairy, dressed in a red gown (although she is obsessed with the color pink), a red hat, and a red cape clipped with a yellow square. She is the strongest-willed and the leader of the group. Her gift to Aurora is the gift of beauty. She created and possesses the powerful Sword of Truth and the invulnerable Shield of Virtue, which she can conjure whenever she sees fit. Fauna is the middle fairy, dressed in a green gown, a green hat, and a green cape clipped with a green triangle. She is shown to be a bit flighty, but is the kindest of the three and the most sensitive. Her gift to Aurora is the gift of song. Merryweather is the shortest and youngest fairy, dressed in a blue gown, a blue hat, and a blue cape clipped with a blue circle. She is the more aggressive of the fairies and is bolder and feistier than the other two. As Merryweather is about to give her gift, Maleficent makes her appearance and curses Aurora to die when she touches a spinning wheel's spindle before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday. Merryweather's gift is to weaken the curse so that instead of death, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep until she is awakened by true love's kiss. Appearances Sleeping Beauty The three good fairies arrive at the christening of King Stefan and Queen Leah's newborn daughter, Princess Aurora. They tell the King Stefan and the Queen Leah that each of them will give a single gift to the infant, and proceed to give their respective gifts, the first two being beauty from Flora and song from Fauna. As Merryweather is about to give her gift, the wicked witch named Maleficent arrives and stresses about not receiving an invitation, to which Merryweather replies that she is \\"not wanted.\\" Maleficent prepares to leave, but also decides to give a \\"gift\\" to Aurora by cursing her so that before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. Merryweather then uses her gift to weaken the curse so that instead of death, it will be a deep sleep from which Aurora can awaken through true love's kiss. The three good fairies plot against Maleficent, since they were not convinced that King Stefan and Queen Leah's response to the curse (declaring that every spinning wheel in the kingdom be burned) would be enough to stop the witch. Flora came up with the plan of the three of them raising Aurora while disguising as peasant women, as the unkind Maleficent would never expect such a thing. All of them are gleeful about it, and they become excited about taking care of a baby. Flora then confiscates Merryweather's and Fauna's wands, since they should avoid using magic while carrying out the plan. After asking for the king and queen's consent, they take Aurora to raise her. Years later, on the day of Aurora (whom they call Briar Rose)'s sixteenth birthday, the fairies plan a surprise for her, and so they send her berry-picking in the forest (while warning her not to go too far and not to speak to strangers). Merryweather starts to get their wands, arguing that the sixteen years are almost over, but Flora and Fauna object. Flora decides to make the gown (using Merryweather as the dummy) and Fauna says that she'll make the cake. Merryweather tells Flora \\"But you can't sew,\\" and that Fauna has no experience in cooking, and that they should switch their duties with each other; Flora objects, saying that it is Fauna's last chance to bake. As they work, the three begin to reminisce about the days when Aurora is just a child, and they begin to weep; eventually Flora tells them to finish their tasks. When they finish, Flora is unable to make a proper gown and Fauna is unable to make a stiff cake, angering Merryweather and prompting her to get the wands, and Fauna tells Flora, \\"You know? I think she's right.\\" After getting the wands, the three fairies block every opening in the house, so that the lights from their magic would not be seen outside, then proceed to do their tasks. As Flora finishes the pink dress, Merryweather, who wants it to be blue, changes its color to blue, irritating Flora who changes it back to pink. Merryweather changes it to blue again, and Flora changes it to pink; this continued, escalated and became a magical quarrel over whether the dress should be pink or blue. The lights from their magical fight begin to escape through the chimney, catching the attention of Maleficent's crow and thus revealing their location. The quarrel ends with the dress getting both of the pink and blue colors, and then the three hear Aurora get near the cottage, prompting Flora and Merryweather to stop their argument and the three prepare their surprise (as they do so, Flora secretly turns the dress' color into pink, then Merryweather secretly turns it into blue). They welcome and surprise Aurora, who tells them that she met a man in the woods whom she loved, and they reveal her true heritage as a princess and that she has been betrothed to Prince Philip since her christening, and that she must never meet the man she met in the woods again; this causes Aurora to go to her room and weep in sadness and depression. Later, they take Aurora to a room in the castle. They conjure a crown for her to wear as a princess, then they leave the depressed girl alone so she could recover more easily. They argue over whether Aurora should be forced to marry Prince Philip until Flora hears Maleficent's magic, causing them to enter the room and discover that Maleficent has arrived and has hypnotized Aurora into going through a hidden passage which leads up to another room, where Maleficent has turned herself into a spinning wheel. The three fairies go after Aurora and yell out to \\"Don't touch anything!\\", but Maleficent then tells her to touch the spindle, which causes her to do so. The fairies enter the place, but arrived too late as they bump into Maleficent, who taunts the three fairies, then throws her cloak to reveal the sleeping princess. Maleficent then laughs and vanishes as the three fairies weep over Aurora's fate. The three place the sleeping princess on a bed within the topmost tower. They weep in sadness, and Flora decides that, in order to prevent everyone from being heartbroken, they put the entire kingdom to sleep until Princess Aurora awakens. While falling asleep, King Hubert tries to tell Stefan of his son being in love with a peasant girl, which makes Flora realize that Prince Phillip is the man Aurora has fallen in love with, and they fly back to the cottage for him. However, Phillip is already captured by Maleficent's goons by that time, so with no other choice, the fairies sneak into Maleficent's stronghold and managed to free the prince. Flora conjures the Sword of Truth and the Shield of Virtue for Philip to wield, and they escape from the Forbidden Mountain whilst being attacked by Maleficent's minions, whose attacks are countered by the three good fairies. When Diablo tries to warn Maleficent, Merryweather chases him and eventually turns him into a stone statue. The fairies then assist Phillip in his escape, and battle against Maleficent, ultimately enhancing Phillip's sword as he throws it directly into Maleficent's heart, thus destroying Maleficent. The fairies are present as Aurora meets her parents and as she dances with Phillip, but Flora and Merryweather's argument over the color of Aurora's gown is revived. Maleficent The good fairies also appear in Disney's live action film Maleficent, as a trio of pixies named Knotgrass, Flittle and Thistlewit, respectively. The pixies are markedly different from their animated counterparts, with their role being reduced to comic relief; they are shown to be incompetent and unable to fulfill their task of raising Aurora as mortals. The child's actual care was overseen by Maleficent in secret. * Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton) wears shades of red and is the Flora equivalent: bossy and superior. She blesses Aurora with the gift of beauty. * Flittle (Lesley Manville) wears blue (like Merryweather) but is the Fauna equivalent: naive and absent-minded. She blesses Aurora with the gift of happiness. In the sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, Flittle sacrifices herself in an effort to save the Moorland fair folk from Queen Ingrith‚Äôs genocide plot. * Thistlewit (Juno Temple) wears green and yellow (the subtractive counterpart of green, which is the color of Fauna's dress) but is the Merryweather equivalent: giddy, playful and childlike. She was interrupted by Maleficent before she could bless Aurora. By Aurora's sixteenth birthday, she and Knotgrass bicker about when to take Aurora back to King Stefan, and in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, they bicker about the color of Aurora's dress. Other appearances The three good fairies also appear in Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams during the \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\" segment. As King Stefan, Queen Leah, King Hubert and Prince Phillip leave the kingdom for a Royal Conference; Aurora is left in charge of the kingdom. The fairies offer to help her, but Aurora declines; however, Aurora later asks the three good fairies to deliver King Hubert his speech which he has forgotten at the castle. Merryweather still is worried about Aurora and, before leaving with Flora and Fauna, gives her wand to the princess in case she needs any assistance and warns her to be very careful with it. The fairies manage to deliver the speech in time, and are about to return when Merryweather reveals she had lent her wand to Aurora when she was not supposed to do so. The fairies appear at the end of the segment and take part of the welcome-back meal. They were also among the Disney characters to appear at the end of The Lion King 1 1/2. They are in the last shown crowd before Timon and Pumbaa start the movie again sitting between Terk (from Tarzan) and Br'er Bear (from Song of the South). The three good fairies also play a role in the Kingdom Hearts series of video games. They first appear in Kingdom Hearts II at Yen Sid's tower, giving Sora his new outfit after he wakes from his year-long sleep, as well as the Star Seeker Keyblade and the ability to use Drive, and later witnessing Maleficent's return to power. At first, they all argue over what colour Sora's new outfit should be, until agreeing to zap it all at the same time. The end result is a black outfit with colourful highlights all over. In Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, the fairies appear in their homeworld, the \\"Enchanted Dominion\\", talking with Ventus about Aurora and Phillip and later assisting him in his battle against Maleficent. They also appear at the end of Aqua and Phillip's battle against Maleficent in her dragon form, again blessing Phillip's sword as he throws it into Maleficent's heart; however, the attack does not kill her and just defeats her. During the credits, while Aurora and Phillip are dancing, Flora and Merryweather continue their old argument over what color Aurora's dress should be. They do not make a physical appearance in Kingdom Hearts III, but are mentioned by Yen Sid as the creators of the cast's new clothes. The three fairies had appeared as guests in the TV series Disney's House of Mouse. They also appear at themed-parks and live events. They co-host the Magic, Music and Mayhem show with the Fairy Godmother from Cinderella. In the Disney Divas event at Disneyland, the fairies appeared at the climax of the show, confronting Maleficent, the Evil Queen and Cruella de Vil, among others, and later introducing Cynthia Harriss, former president of Disneyland Resort. As of 2013, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather appear as regular characters in Disney's Sofia the First animated television series. Reception of the original characters The characters received positive reception. Variety stated that \\"Some of the best parts of the picture are those dealing with the three good fairies,\\" Rob Burch, of Hollywood News, noted how the fairies are more prominent than the film's title character Aurora: \\"It could be argued the three Fairies are the real heroines, as much of the running time revolves around them.\\"Disney 53, Week 16: Sleeping Beauty Retrieved May 8, 2013 Of the three, he praised Merryweather as the best character. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times stated \\"Indeed, these busy little ladies, fluffy grandmotherly types, called Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, whose operations are conducted largely with wands.\\" He further notes: \\"They [the fairies] are cunning, especially when they've 'wanded' themselves down to glowworm size and go buzzing through the palace or across the country as cheerful little lights.\\" References Category:Film characters introduced in 1959 Category:Sleeping Beauty (1959 film) characters Category:Female characters in animation Category:Female characters in film Category:Fictional fairies and sprites Category:Fictional trios ","title":"Flora, Fauna and Merryweather"},{"id":"45705197","text":"Cristofori is an Italian surname.

The concept of funeral celebrants is analogous in Western countries to that of civil celebrants (for marriages). Civil celebrant funerals began in Australia in 1975. On 19 July 1973 the Australian Attorney- General Lionel Murphy had appointed civil marriage celebrants with the aim of creating ceremonies of substance and meaning for non-church people. As secular (civil) marriage ceremonies became accepted, first in Australia and then in other Western countries such as New Zealand, and much later in the United States of America it was inevitable that a similar philosophical paradigm would be applied to secular funerals.Messenger, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), pp148-192 Though initiated in Australia, and recognised as such, the program and the process has been followed and is now established in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America.NOTE:see for the USA Celebrant Foundation and InstituteNOTE: for the United Kingdom see Humanist celebrant and Humanists UKNOTE:for various other countries see Dally Messenger III (section Civil celebrancy in the UK etc. Descriptive definition A civil funeral celebrant is an individual person, quite often, but not necessarily, an authorised civil marriage celebrant, who offers to perform civil funerals in a dignified and culturally acceptable manner, for those who, for whatever reason, do not choose a religious ceremony. Civil funeral celebrants also serve people who have religious beliefs but do not wish to be buried or cremated from a church, temple or mosque. More frequently, people choose civil funeral celebrants because they wish a professional person to co-create a service centred on the person, their history and their achievements. This is often in contrast to the established set-ritual ceremonies of most religions. In celebrant ceremonies decisions about the content of the ceremony are made by the family of the deceased in consultation with the celebrant. Therefore, the civil celebrant can be defined as a professionally trained ceremony-provider who works in accordance with the wishes of the client. Depending on circumstances, best practice is usually for funeral celebrants to interview the family, carefully prepare and check the eulogy, brief those persons chosen to give reminiscences, and finally to provide resources and suggestions that will assist the client family to choose the most appropriate music, video/photo presentations, quotations (poetry and prose), symbols and movement or choreography. Sometimes a rehearsal is indicated for a funeral. More often a planning session is sufficient to ensure that the ceremony that is delivered is the one that is planned. In this task the funeral celebrant works in cooperation with a funeral director. Thus the celebrant is usually the central person who delivers the ceremony. He or she is the facilitator, the adviser, the resource person, the co-creator of the ceremony, and the director. A celebrant, by this definition, does not come from the standpoint of any doctrinal belief or unbelief. A trained celebrant usually operates professionally on the principle that their own beliefs and values are not relevant.Messenger, Dally, Ceremonies and Celebrations, Hachette Livre, Melbourne, 2000 , Early History An acknowledged pioneer of civil Celebrancy, Dally Messenger III claims to have officiated at the first funeral celebrant ceremony. This was in the sense that the client sought a service from Messenger, as a government appointed civil celebrant, and as a professional ceremony provider. There had occasionally been secular funeral ceremonies before this date, but they were extremely rare and informal, e.g. some words spoken at the graveside by members of the Communist party. In general, funerals were considered to be the province of the clergy - even for unbelievers. For example, many funerals for non-believers were simply the playing of music. Dally Messenger III records that this first celebrant funeral was for Helen Francis (n√©e Grieves) on 2 July 1975 at the Le Pine Funeral Parlour in Ferntree Gully, a suburb of Melbourne in the state of Victoria. Helen Francis was a young woman who had engaged Messenger as a celebrant for her wedding to Roy Francis some four weeks previously. Roy Francis convinced Messenger that just as his wife was entitled to a civil celebrant marriage, she was similarly entitled to a civil celebrant funeral. Some 200 people attended and many urged Messenger to continue the work as \\"much more important than weddings.\\" Messenger credits Dennis Perry, then brother in law of Helen Francis, as being a decisive influence. The inaugural association of funeral celebrants Support of the funeral industry and the clergy Major religious affiliations in Australia by census year. This graph illustrates the dominance of the three Major Christian Groups in the years of the White Australia Policy. The growth in the percentage of secular, \\"no religion\\" and \\"no particular church\\" people, and the corresponding decline in church attendances intensified the need for meaningful alternative non-religious \\"civil\\" ceremonies.From this time on some marriage celebrants began to quietly and carefully officiate at funerals when they were asked to do so. On Tuesday 3 May 1977 a group, consisting of some authorised marriage celebrants and some other persons formed an association - The Funeral Celebrants Association of Australia. Dally Messenger III was elected the inaugural president. Funeral Directors and clergy attended as supportive members of the Association. For them it solved the problem of appropriate ceremony providers for the increasing number families for whom a religious ceremony was no longer an authentic option. For many years this had been an uncomfortable problem for which there had been no good solution.NOTE: Explanatory:Readers should be aware that the vast majority of Australians were members of one of the five main churches - Anglican, Roman Catholic, Methodist Presbyterian and Congregationalist. It was still in the period of the White Australia policy and a strong Christian tradition without the influence of eastern and non-Christian religions - save a small Jewish community of pre and post war immigrants. Controversy among celebrants These innovations soon produced a bitter controversy. In a time when death and funerals were almost taboo subjects, the majority of marriage celebrants were viscerally opposed to being associated with funerals. Most, supported by the public servants of the Commonwealth‚Äôs Attorney-General‚Äôs Department, viewed the situation of civil marriage celebrants also being funeral celebrants as \\"using their appointment as civil marriage celebrants, to commercially exploit vulnerable people in their time of grief\\". Most of those marriage celebrants who had attended the inaugural meeting then withdrew their support. The few \\"marriage celebrant associations\\" declared their opposition to funerals. However, Lionel Murphy, then a judge of the High Court of Australia, encouraged Messenger to go out into the \\"highways and byways\\" and find non-marriage celebrants to fulfil the societal need. Murphy urged Messenger and his colleagues to prepare each ceremony well, to charge a reasonable fee to ensure long term sustainability, and to see the civil ceremony as a cultural bridge between ordinary people and the rich world of the visual and performing arts - especially music,Adams, Pamela, \\"Music suggestions for Funeral Ceremonies\\", Celebrations, Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants Inc 2009 English literature, and poetry. The pioneer civil funeral celebrants Brian McInerney: Pioneer Funeral Celebrant of Australia - arguably the doyen of the original Funeral Celebrants.The few marriage celebrants of that time (1975-1976) involved - notably Dally Messenger III and Marjorie Messenger - were in the years and months following (to 1980) joined by non-marriage celebrants, Brian McInerney, Diane Storey, Dawn Dickson, Jean Nugent, Ken Woodburn and Jan Tully. A decisive influence later was marriage celebrant, mayor of Croydon, and public advocate Rick Barclay. Messenger credits these persons with establishing the profession in Melbourne, and subsequently throughout the western world. In 1980, the media noted that a surge in demand for civil funeral celebrants had become apparent. In an article on Jean Nugent, characterised as the Mornington \\"peninsula's first civil funeral celebrant\\", Tony Harrington, headlined that \\"Business grows for civil hatchers and dispatchers\\". Setting standards and prices Standards As with marriage celebrants, public acceptance of funeral celebrants was enthusiastic and rapid. The early celebrants reported the commonly expressed need of non-church people to have a funeral that was personal in nature, with a minimum of platitudes, and also a personal eulogy that was well prepared, and substantial in its coverage of the life of the person who had died. There was a strong antipathy to mistakes which people had experienced in funeral services, such as factual errors: the deceased being called by the wrong name, or a mispronounced name, as was characteristic of many under-prepared and ritualistic funeral ceremonies provided by the churches.Marinos, Sarah, Prepare Yourself to say Goodbye, Family Circle, June 1997 pp40-41 The public also required that music, quotations and individual tributes be appropriate to the deceased person. (Clergy were then induced to compete with these standards and were thus led to provide more personalised ceremonies.) The problem of fees The new Funeral Celebrants needed to establish working relationships with the Funeral Directors, whose role was to collect, prepare, and store the bodies of the deceased. Funeral directors were then (1970s and 1980s) mostly smaller family owned firms. Funeral Directors John and Rob Allison of John Allison Monkhouse (Melbourne, Victoria) were particularly supportive of Funeral Celebrants. So was the active idealist Des Tobin, General Manager of Tobin Brothers Funeral Parlours of Melbourne.Messenger, Dally, Victorian Celebrants Lead the World, The Australian Funeral Director, December 1994 The fee that funeral directors had customarily paid to the clergy was not a fee for service but merely an \\"offering\\", since the general presumption was that the client was a churchgoer, who had donated to the upkeep of the clergy all his or her life. Funeral Celebrants argued that those who required a personally prepared service, which required many extra hours of preparation, should pay more. Rob Allison agreed, and a two-tiered structure of fees was established. The Funeral Directors argued that the fee should be fixed so they could quote costs clearly to the client. The resulting two-tiered fee acknowledged that civil funeral celebrants had no other sources of income such as the clergy had. However, this happened only in Victoria. Funeral Directors in other states of Australia refused to pay celebrants any more than they had decided to pay the clergy. This led predictably to unsatisfactory standards and uninspiring funeral services. Training and education of celebrants Training It also became clear, as funeral celebrancy became an organised profession, that it was not appropriate for funeral celebrants to learn how to carry out the work by learning from one‚Äôs mistakes and experience while ‚Äòon the job‚Äô. Celebrants observed that mistakes made in funeral ceremonies could leave lifelong psychological scars. It was clear that skills such as creative writing and public speaking, a knowledge of suitable poetic, literary, symbolic and musical resources, an awareness of punctuality and time, appropriate dress and similar were essential. It was clear that a formal educational and training process was required. Education Experienced celebrants maintained it was crucial for trainee celebrants to achieve an understanding of the \\"grief process\\" and how it impacted on their work. The Australian lecture tour of a renowned scholar in this area, Elisabeth K√ºbler- Ross, organised by funeral celebrant Diane Storey, received wide media publicity and was credited with changing social attitudes to death and dying. Training, in the informal sense, began by constant reflective interaction among the original celebrants who all knew each other. Later on when more funeral celebrants were attracted to the vocation, programs of seminars were set up by celebrants Beverley Silvius, Diane Storey and Brian and Tina McInerney. This body of learning was later incorporated into the courses more formally prepared by the College of Celebrancy in 1995. The securing of celebrant professionalism It was agreed that adequate training of celebrants must leave them capable of providing the standards the general public expected such as full personal interaction and cooperation with the family, careful preparation of a historical and personal eulogy, attentive choosing of readings (poetry and prose), music, choreography (processionals and recessionals), symbolism, and an appropriate setting and place for the ceremony. Another essential was that Celebrants should check the eulogy and the ceremony with a member of the family, so that harmful mistakes were avoided. In short, funeral ceremonies were viewed as a serious responsibility which should be prepared with efficiency and attention to detail, requiring an attitude of genuineness, empathy and compassion. The high ideals of the original celebrants and the ones who slowly joined their ranks changed the nature of the funeral ceremony scene in Melbourne and Victoria. They professed to offer the best and most personal funerals which existed in the Western world. This high standard is well acknowledged by Professor Tony Walter, lecturer and reader in Death and Society at the University of Reading UK. Professor Walter particularly singles out for commentary two celebrants he considered outstanding, Brian McInerney and Rick Barclay.Walter, Tony, \\"Secular Funerals or Life-Centred Funerals?\\" in, Funerals and How to Improve Them, Hodder and Staughton, London, 1990, , pp. 217-231 TIME Magazine report International acknowledgment was provided by a comprehensive article in Time Magazine (September 2004) reporting that in the \\"liberal\\" cities of Melbourne (Australia) and Auckland (New Zealand) civil celebrants \\"conduct substantially more than half of the funerals.\\" It reported that before 1973 only clergy funerals were available to the general public in Australia and New Zealand. The article describes celebrant funerals as \\"intimate and personalised\\". But it also cited an alternative point of view by atheist sociologist Mira Crouch who stated that celebrant funerals were \\"mawkish and sentimental\\". The Australian Institute of Civil Celebrants In January 1992 the ‚Äò‚ÄôFuneral Celebrants Association of Australia‚Äô‚Äô had become the ‚Äò‚ÄôAustralian Institute of Civil Celebrants‚Äô‚Äô. This new body was able to welcome marriage celebrants, who were increasingly in disagreement with the Marriage Celebrants Associations, which continued to oppose secular funeral celebrants. He was also the Mayor of Croydon, a Melbourne suburb Rick Barclay was voted in as President, Dally Messenger III as Secretary, and Ken Woodburn as Treasurer. These three administered the Institute until it became ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants Inc‚Äô‚Äô in January 1994. Australian States other than Victoria Funeral Directors in states of Australia other than Victoria still refused to pay celebrants any more than they paid the clergy i.e. a low \\"stipend\\" or \\"offering\\". The results were predictable. With some notable exceptions, very few marriage celebrants were prepared to put the amount of painstaking time and effort into the preparation and checking of funeral ceremonies that was required to reach the Victorian standard. Many Funeral Directors in these states saw celebrants as a threat to their income and were openly hostile. Several firms declared every member of their staff a celebrant. Others employed an in-house celebrant who was required to perform 13 or 14 funeral ceremonies per week ‚Äî compelling such employees to resort to one-size-fits-all impersonal ceremonies. A \\"celebrant funeral\\" in these contexts became the worst option available. As author and commentator Robert Larkins put it, speaking of one family‚Äôs experience- > Geoff was not a religious man so there was no minister of religion present, > just a celebrant‚Ä¶ Susanne had found the funeral experience to be deeply > dissatisfying.Larkins, Robert, Funeral Rights -What the Australian ‚Äòdeath- > care‚Äô industry doesn‚Äôt want you to know, Penguin Australia, Camberwell > Victoria, 2007, p.ix As church attendances declined, funeral directors in New South Wales pushed non-church people into organising \\"family ceremonies\\". A few families proved capable of this, but most were not. A further decline in standards in Australia As inflation took hold during the years 1990 to 2009 the value of money declined. Funeral Directors in Australia, who effectively controlled fees for celebrants, held out against any increases in payments. The loss of support for celebrants due to the retirements of idealist Funeral Directors such as Rob and John Allison and Desmond Tobin was keenly felt. The takeover of the small and middle size Funeral Companies by the multinational company Invocare Limited,Henly, Susan, Death of a Salesman, The Sunday Age (Melbourne), Extra section p.18, 28 August 2005 meant there was little interest in any celebrant standards of ceremony. Larkins lists five pages of Funeral Homes purchased by Invocare LimitedMcNicol, D.D., Lifting the Lid on the Funeral Industry, The Australian, Summer Living Section p.12, 2 January 2006 including such names as Simplicity Funerals, White Lady Funerals, Tobin Brothers Funerals and Le Pine Funerals. All these smaller firms kept their original names, thus misleading the public as to ownership.Larkins, Robert, Funeral Rights -What the Australian ‚Äòdeath-care‚Äô industry doesn‚Äôt want you to know, Penguin Australia, Camberwell Victoria, 2007, pp.231-235 Notwithstanding the above, a core group of Funeral Celebrants throughout Australia still provide the public with funeral ceremonies in accordance with the original ideals.http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/CFCs.html Funeral celebrants in NZ, UK and USA In the late 1970s New Zealand followed Australia in establishing funeral celebrants and have had an untroubled history. The Humanist Society of England and Scotland, after many visits to Australia in the 1980s, established a wide network of quality funeral celebrants characterised by a strong non-religious stance.Meaningful non-religious ceremonies just for you, https://humanism.org.uk/ceremonies/non-religious- funerals/ , British Humanist Association, Retrieved 24-02-2015 Others in the UK have set themselves up as Civil Funeral Celebrants based on the Australian/Victorian model. They are gaining wide acceptance particularly funeral celebrants trained by the United Kingdom Society of Celebrants. The USA Celebrant Foundation, established by graduates of the Australian-based International College of Celebrancy in 2003, has emerged as the leading organisation in training and educating civil celebrants in the USA. Originally a force for secular wedding and naming ceremonies, since 2009 some civil celebrants in the USA have become more involved in high standard funeral ceremonies.Machelor, Patty, http://www.celebrantinstitute.org/media/Arizona%20Star%20Story/Arizona%20Star%20Story.htm, Arizona Daily Star, 30 December 2012  References  Category:Australian culture Category:Funerals ","title":"Funeral celebrant"},{"id":"45705262","text":"An√∫cita/Anuntzeta is a village that belongs to the municipality of Ribera Alta and the Cuadrilla (that is, a territorial division of √Ålava) of A√±ana, in the judicial district of Vitoria-Gasteiz, √Ålava-Araba, in the Basque country of Spain. It lies at the foot of the mountain San Vitores (891 m) and on the left bank of the Bayas River at an elevation of 580 m. The village is bordered to the north by Subijana and Morillas, to the east by Nubilla, to the south by Here√±a, and to the west by Pobes. Spanish is the local language; Basque ceased to be used between the 16th and 17th centuries.  Education  It has no public school so the children have to go to the town of Nanclares de la Oca.  History  It is located on the southern slopes of the Western appendix of Sierra of Tuyo. It is visible from many points from the bank of the river Bayas. √Ånucita is divided in three neighbourhoods: √Ånucita, San Miguel and Mimbredo, the latter two in the lower area and adjacent to the left bank of the river Bayas. In √Ånucita, the church of San Esteban is located in a privileged location, in the higher part of the village with splendid panoramic views of the work lands bathed by the river Bayas. The temple is of a vamet with polygonal head, square tower topped by a bell tower body and a porth with two arches of half point. By deed of obligation it is known that the altarpiece of the high altar was built in the year 1793 by Juan Antonio Moraza. In the outer wall of the tower on the bottom window there is a circular Chrismon which is an anagram formed by the first two letters of the name of Christ in Greek. The Chrismon is a symbol of Christ and also an emblem of victory, both military and spiritual, triumph of the faith and triumph over death. A notable building is the palace of √Ånucita, having belonged to the Zulueta family. This family presided the cultural association ‚ÄúSancho el Sabio‚Äù. It is rectangular, with three floors and with a compact appearance, made of masonry and stonework, with important works in wood, such as the front door and the balconies. Iron looks at the main balcony above the door. In the neighborhood of San Miguel, there are two modules for collection cereals, their function is identified by the ‚Äúsilo‚Äù. Today these buildings belong to a cooperative of cereal. In Mimbredo there is a small mill, which is now abandoned. In this neighbourhood there is a bridge over the river Bayas with three arches. On the other side of the bridge there is an archaic and well- preserved spring that is known as Fuente Pinto. It celebrates its patron day on 12 October.

Early life and family Alec Dakin was born in Mytholmroyd in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1912, the son of inventor and sawmaker, Bertram Alexander Dakin and his wife Annie Louise Naylor who were married in 1908 in Todmorden. He came from an inventive family since his father, who was born in 1879, was an inventor (of carving knives, saws, pan handles and wall coatings).https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1437141/Alec-Dakin.html He won a scholarship to Heath School, Halifax. Academic career At school he won a second scholarship, this time to Queen's College, Oxford. There he read Greats and took walks with his fellow Yorkshire scholarship-boy and Nonconformist, Harold Wilson. Alec's tutor, Oliver Franks encouraged him to begin the study of Egyptology, and he was also guided by Professor Battiscombe Gunn, an English Egyptologist and philologist who had published his first translation from Egyptian in 1906 and, in 1934, was appointed Professor of Egyptology at the University of Oxford just a few years prior to Alec's time there where Battiscombe devoted himself to his pupils and his classes, at the expense of his own research. In 1936 at the age of 24, Alec became a Fellow of University College Oxford. Cryptology During his studies Alec had acquired fluent German, which would later turn out to be extremely advantageous to his career. He was clearly destined for a distinguished career as an Oxford Egyptologist but just two years later in 1940, his life took an unexpected turn when he was recruited by her Majesty's government to work as a cryptographer at Bletchley Park ‚Äì to assist the war effort. He worked in complete secrecy in hut 4, alongside many others at Bletchley, including the well known cryptographer, Alan Turing who was put in charge of all of them by Winston Churchill. He later described this period as the happiest time of his life and especially enjoyed the challenge of the early days, before the Colossus computer took over the decrypting. Enigma Alec was responsible for rapidly translating the decrypted German naval Enigma signals for the Admiralty to determine which ones were most important. Memorable decryptions One such signal was from the Bismarck which read \\"Most immediate. Torpedo hit right aft. Ship unmanoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the Fuehrer.\\" Another might simply inform a numbered rating on a U-boat that his home in Germany had been bombed. Dakin was one of the first people to read the message \\"The Fuehrer Adolf Hitler is dead.\\" although this was somewhat premature as Hitler actually survived the assassination attempt that this signal presaged. Total secrecy As with other Bletchley Park staff he was obliged to take an oath of secrecy, never speaking to anyone of his war work, even his wife Joan, whom he married in 1953. Hee tried to join the Royal Navy, but was prevented on the grounds that he knew too much to risk his being captured. Codebreakers book Together with Ernest Ettinghausen, Walter Ettinghausen's younger brother, he described the work of Hut 4 for secret Foreign Office files. It was so secret that he was not even allowed to consult it himself when eventually he wrote his chapter on the work of Hut 4 for \\"Codebreakers: The inside story of Bletchley Park\\", an inside story account of Bletchley Park, edited by F. H. Hinsley and Alan Stripp. Postwar career After the war he decided to become a schoolmaster instead of returning to Oxford. He thought that he could more directly help to build the world by influencing young people at their most formative stage. In 1946 he joined the staff at Kingswood School, Bath, teaching classics, and remained there until his retirement in 1969.

The river rises in The Natural Park of Urbasa-And√≠a (Sierra de Urbasa), near the village Baquedano. It is 19 km long and flows into the Ega River, which is a tributary of the Ebro. The first emerge is produced in a 713 metres high clift in the southern ledge of the rock massif and makes a more than 100 metres waterfall which with the passing of the years has modelled a rocky and karstic landscape. Urederra in summer Behind the waterfall there are some smaller waterfalls and a lot of river pools whose water has a unique turquoise colour, which is a remarkable feature of the Urederra River. Because of the karst the small waterfalls and pools have been made. The karstic area also enables water to strain through the cracks of the rocks and issuing from inside the land. Flora and fauna In the Urederra river pools, waterfalls and water curtains can be seen surrounded by a dense forest where oaks, elms, maples, yews, hazelnuts and specially beeches are found. The diversity of flora is also remarkable in the fauna, among another species the vulture, the Egyptian vulture, the white tailed kite, the eagle and the raven are protagonists of the animal. Accesses The official path to see the waterfalls of the Urederra River is the one called << the route of the waterfalls of Baquedano>>, a pedestrian trail that starts in the parking of the village, which is fitted out for the visitors. It has a low level of difficulty of 5,3 kilometres long and goes over the course of the river in the opposite way and ends in the source of the Urederra. The trail is signalled by markers and it is recommended to go from the left part which is near the river and return from the eastern path which goes higher and further from the river. Due to the high volume of visitors, it is necessary to make an online reservation to visit the waterfalls and leave the car in the nearby town of Baquedano. In 2017, 150.000 people visited Urederra.

He was a member of the Chaulukya (also called Chalukya or Solanki) dynasty. Jayasimha's capital was located at Anahilapataka (modern Patan) in present-day Gujarat. Besides large parts of Gujarat, his control also extended to parts of Rajasthan: he subdued the Shakambhari Chahamana king Arnoraja, and the former Naddula Chahamana ruler Asharaja acknowledged his suzerainty. Jayasimha also annexed a part of Malwa (in present-day Madhya Pradesh) by defeating the Paramaras. He also waged an inconclusive war against the Chandela king Madanavarman. Jayasimha's daughter Kanchana married Arnoraja. The couple's son Someshvara (the father of Prithviraj Chauhan) was brought up by Jayasimha at the Chaulukya court.  Early life  Jayasimha was a son of the Chaulukya king Karna and queen Mayanalla-devi. According to folklore, he was born in Palanpur, but there is no historical evidence of this. Jayasimha (\\"victory lion\\") was so named by the old ladies of the Chaulukya palace. He later assumed the title \\"Siddharaja\\". The 12th century Jain scholar Hemachandra mentions a legend according to which Karna prayed to the goddess Lakshmi for a son. He restored a temple of Lakshmi, and meditated for a long time, overcoming seductive apsaras and a threatening demon. Ultimately, the goddess Lakshmi appeared before him, and blessed him, as a result of which Jayasimha was born. The 14th century author Merutunga does not mention Hemachandra's semi-mythical account. But he mentions another legend about Jayasimha's childhood: at the age of 3, Jayasimha climbed on the royal throne, and sat there. The astrologers declared that this had happened at an auspicious moment, so Karna performed his son's coronation ceremony then and there. Merutunga dates this event to 7 January 1094, and therefore, suggests that Jayasimha was born in 1091 CE. However, this account does not seem to be accurate as it has not been mentioned by earlier authors such as Hemachandra. In his Dvyashraya, Hemachandra mentions several mythical tales presenting Jayasimha as an epic hero. Had Merutunga's account been historically accurate, Hemachandra would not have failed to mention it. According to Hemachandra, Jayasimha's father Karna had a brother named Kshemaraja who renounced his rights to the throne. Kshemaraja's descendants were Devaprasada, Tribhuvanapala and Kumarapala (who was Jayasimha's successor). When Karna died, Devaprasada left his son Tribhuvanapala in Jayasimha's care and committed suicide by immolating himself on Karna's funeral pyre. Jayasimha treated Tribhuvanapala like his own son. All other chroniclers state that Jayasimha hated Tribhuvanapala's son Kumarapala. As Hemachandra was a courtier of both Jayasimha and Kumarapala, historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that he created a fictional account to hide an unpleasant truth. According to Majumdar, Karna probably banished Devaprasada to avoid any rival claims to the throne. After Karna's death, Devaprasada tried to usurp the throne, taking advantage of Jayasimha's young age. However, Karna's wife Mayanalla and her loyal minister Santu had Devaprasada killed. Mayanalla then acted as a regent for the young king Jayasimha.

According to Merutunga, Khangara was an Abhira, which suggests that this is a reference to king Khengara of Chudasama dynasty. Jayasimha's Dahod inscription boasts that he imprisoned the king of Saurashtra; this is most probably a reference to his victory over Khangara. According to bardic legends, Khangara married a woman coveted by Jayasimha, because of which the Chaulukya king invaded Khangara's kingdom. However, this legend is not credible. Jain chronicler Prabhachandra mentions that Siddharaja had first dispatched an army led by Kirtipala (brother of Kumarapala) to attack Navaghana. When this army was unsuccessful, another force led by Udayana was dispatched in its support. This joint army defeated Navagaha, but Udayana was killed in the battle. Prabhachandra goes on to mention that Jayasimha later killed Khangara. According to Merutunga, Navaghana was another name of Khangara. So, it appears that Khangara was not completely subdued in the battle in which Udayana was killed. Merutunga claims that Khangara defeated Jayasimha 11 times, but the Chaulukya king emerged victorious in the 12th battle. Merutunga's claim cannot be taken literally: 12 was a favourite number of the Jain writers, and he may have used the number to emphasize the seriousness of the war. Merutunga's legend also states that Khangara fortified Vardhamana and other cities. He did not want to die by weapons, and therefore, asked his nephew to kill him with coins if the enemy succeeded in scaling the ramparts. As a result, he was beaten to death with boxes full of coins. According to Jayasimha Suri, after defeating Khangara, Jayasimha appointed Sajjana as the governor of Girnar (a town in Saurashtra). This is corroborated by an 1120 CE inscription found at Girnar. Merutunga also supports this claim, although he calls Sajjana the governor of Saurashtra. Historical evidence indicates that Jayasimha was unable to capture all of Khangara's territories in Saurashtra: Jayasimha's successor Kumarapala had to send an army against the Abhiras. According to Prabhachandra, Jayasimha was unable to annex Khangara's kingdom because a large number of Khangara's followers continued to offer resistance.  Chahamanas of Naddula  The Naddula Chahamana ruler Asharaja (alias Ashvaraja) became a vassal of Jayasimha. It appears that Asharaja was dethroned by his rival Ratnapala, because of which he sought Jayasimha's help. Ashraja's 1110 CE and 1116 CE inscriptions do not mention Jayasimha as his overlord. Ratnapala's 1120 CE and 1135 CE inscriptions prove that he was the ruler of Naddula during this period. Thus, Ratnapala must have displaced Asharaja sometime during 1116-1119 CE. Ashraja must have sought help from Jayasimha sometime before 1143 CE; his 1143 CE inscription describes him as subsisting on the feet of Jayasimha. The later 1262 CE Sundha Hill inscription also states that Asharaja pleased Jayasimha by helping him in a campaign in Malwa. Despite gaining Jayasimha's favour, Asharaja was not able to recapture Naddula. This is proved by the fact that Ratnapala's son and successor Rayapala issued eight inscriptions from Naddula during 1132-1145 CE.  Chahamanas of Shakambhari  Several sources suggest that Jayasimha subdued the Shakambhari Chahamana ruler Arnoraja. Arnoraja's ancestor Vigraharaja III had helped the Paramara king Udayaditya against Jayasimha's father Karna. So, the two kingdoms most probably did not have friendly relations when Jayasimha ascended the throne. The conflict between Arnoraja and Jayasimha may have been triggered by their attempts to control the weakening Paramara kingdom of Malwa. The Chaulukya poet Someshvara, in his Kirti-Kaumudi, states that when Arnoraja saw the decapitated heads of kings lying before his feet, he bowed to Jayasimha out of fear. Hemachandra's Dvyashraya also states that ƒÄnƒÅ of Sapadalaksha (that is, Arnoraja), bent his head before Jayasimha. An inscription discovered at the Chahamana capital Shakambhari (modern Sambhar) provides a genealogy of the Chaulukya kings, from Mularaja to Jayasimha. It mentions Shakambhari, which indicates that Jayasimha may have even occupied the Chahamana capital for a brief period. Jayasimha's daughter Kanchana-devi married Arnoraja. The poet Someshvara declares that the only difference between Jayasimha and the deity Vishnu was that Vishnu took the daughter of the Arno (literally \\"ocean\\") as his wife, while Siddharaja gave away his daughter in marriage to Arno-raja. The Chahamana chronicle Prithviraja Vijaya also states that Jayasimha's daughter was one of the two wives of Arnoraja. Usually, the defeated kings would give their daughters in marriage to the victor. So, it is not certain why Jayasimha married his daughter to Arnoraja. He probably saw this as a diplomatic way to end the hostility between the two families. This strategy seems to have been successful, as Arnoraja helped him against the Paramara king Naravarman. Someshvara (not to be confused with the poet), who later became the Chahamana king, was a son of Arnoraja and Kanchana. According to Prithviraja Vijaya, some astrologers told Jayasimha that Someshvara's son (Prithviraja III) would be an incarnation of Rama. Therefore, Jayasimha brought up Someshvara in his own kingdom.  Paramaras of Malwa  This is a old story The ruler of Junagadh at that time was Siddhiraj Solanki. He saw a beautiful woman near the lake who belonged to the Meghwal community. He asked her to marry him but as she was already married, she declined the proposal. Later, she was forced into a marriage and in rage she cursed the king that his kingdom and its people will die without water. There was no rain for a few years and all the ponds and lakes dried up. Distraught, Siddhiraj called the Brahmins and Rishis to find some solution to this problem. Brahmins suggested that a sacrifice of a male who had 32 qualities would be the solution for the drought. In his kingdom there were only two persons with 32 qualities, one was Siddhiraj himself and the other was Veer Meghmaya. So he ordered his soldiers to get him to his court. He was brought by the soldiers, when Siddhiraj asked him if he would sacrifice his life for the wellbeing of Junagadh, Veer Meghmaya replied saying, \\"I will sacrifice my life only if you accept my demands\\". With his exemplary bravado he demanded for the Meghwal community be allowed to reside inside the village and the broom from their back should be removed along with the spitting pot from the neck. He made 10 such similar demands for the emancipation of the people of the Meghwal community. Siddhiraj had to agree to the demands made by Veer Meghhmaya. According to Jivraj Helia, \\"Veer Meghmaya was Veer Purus who gave his life for the community\\". Jaydev bappa says that, \\"his life was taken by the brahmins because he had 32 qualities which even Brahmins did not have. As they were jealous, they created this trap\\" During the 1130s CE, Jayasimha defeated a Paramara king of Malwa (or Avanti). The Vadnagar prashasti inscription of his successor states that he imprisoned the king of Malwa, which scared all other rulers of the earth. The Dahod inscription also confirms Jayasimha's victory, but doesn't name the Paramara king. The Talwara inscription states that Jayasimha humbled the pride of Naravarman, but the Ujjain inscription states that Jayasimha defeated Naravarman's successor Yashovarman. Multiple chronicles also mention this victory. According to the chronicles written by Someshvara, Jinamandana and Jayasimha Suri, the Paramara king was Naravarman. However, other chroniclers such as Hemachandra, Arisimha, and Merutunga state that he was Yashovarman. Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that the Chaulukya-Paramara war began during the reign of Naravarman (r. c. 1094-1133 CE), and ended during the reign of Yashovarman (c. 1133-1142 CE). Jayasimha's title Avantinatha (\\"Lord of Avanti\\") first appears in the 1137 CE Gala inscription. The Naddula Chahamana ruler Asharaja as well as the Shakambhari Chahamana ruler Arnoraja (r. c. 1135-1150 CE) helped Jayasimha in this campaign. Based on these evidences, Jayasimha's conquest of the Paramara capital Dhara can be dated to 1135-1136 CE. According to the 12th century chronicler Hemachandra, Jayasimha was the aggressor in this conflict, while the 14th century chronicler Merutunga claims that the war started with a Paramara invasion of the Chaulukya kingdom. Hemachandra claims that some yoginis once asked Jayasimha to visit Ujjain, and worship the goddess Kalika there. Since Ujjain was located in the Paramara territory, Jayasimha invaded the Paramara kingdom. He first marched to Ujjain, and then captured the Paramara capital Dhara. He tied up Yashovarman \\"like a bird\\" and subdued the entire Avanti region (the Paramara territory). Hemachandra's account features elements of fantasy. According to Merutunga's legend, Jayasimha once went on a pilgrimage to Somnath with his mother. Taking advantage of his absence, Yashovarman invaded the Chaulukya capital. Jayasimha's minister Santu requested Yashovarman to negotiate a peace treaty. Yashovarman replied that he would leave if he was granted all the merits (punya) gained by Jayasimha during the Somnath pilgrimage. Santu agreed, and conducted a ceremony to symbolically transfer Jayasimha's merits to Yashovarman. The Paramara king then returned to Malwa. When Jayasimha returned to his capital and learned about what had happened in his absence, he became furious. He invaded Malwa, and defeated the Paramara king after a 12-year war. Merutunga's account does not seem credible, because the Paramaras were too weak at this time to invade the powerful Chaulukya kingdom. The poet Someshvara states that Jayasimha put Naravarman in a wooden cage like a parrot. Balachandra adds that Naravarman was brought to Gujarat in a wooden cage. Jayasimha Suri claims that when Siddharaja decided to invade the Paramara kingdom, he took a vow to make a scabbard for his sword with Naravarman's skin. He defeated Naravarman after a 12-year campaign, and fulfilled this vow. Jina-Mandana repeats the same story, but states that Jayasimha's ministers convinced him to give up this vow. The Ujjain inscription states that Jayasimha appointed one Mahadeva as the governor of Avanti. Yashovarman may have also ruled the Paramara kingdom as Jayasimha's vassal. It is not known for how long did Jayasimha control Malwa. Yashovarman's successor Jayavarman I (Paramara dynasty) (r. c. 1142-43) assumed the title Maharajadhiraja, which indicates that he managed to restore the Paramara ruler in at least a part of Malwa. However, he was dethroned by an usurper named Ballala, apparently after Jayasimha's death.  Chandelas  Jayasimha's conquest of Malwa made him a neighbour of the Chandela kingdom, which was located to the east of Malwa. Several Chaulukya chronicles claim that Jayasimha subdued the Chandela king Madanavarman. On the other hand, the Kalanjara inscription of the Chandelas states that Madanavarman defeated the king of Gurjara (that is, Jayasimha) in an instant, just like Krishna had defeated Kamsa. The Prithviraj Raso of Chand Bardai also corroborates this claim. These contradictory claims suggest that the conflict between Jayasimha and Madanavarman was inconclusive, with both the sides claiming victory. The Chaulukya court poet Someshvara claims that the Chandela king submitted to Jayasimha, frightened by the Chaulukya conquest of Malwa. Another chronicler Jayasimha Suri claims that Jayasimha Siddharaja defeated Madanavarman, and took 960 million gold coins from the Chandela king. According to Jina Mandana's Kumarapala-Prabandha, a bard once told Jayasimha that Madanavarman was a very wise, generous and pleasure-loving ruler, whose court was as splendid as that of Jayasimha. Jayasimha confirmed the veracity of this claim by sending a person to Mahoba. He then invaded the Chandela kingdom. After reaching the outskirts of Mahoba, he sent an emissary, asking Madanavarman to surrender. Madanavarman was busy celebrating the spring festival, and did not take the demand seriously. When the emissary reminded him about the fate of the Paramaras, he derisively asked his minister to make Jayasimha return by paying him some money. Jayasimha received the money, but when he heard about Madanavarman's nonchalance, he refused to return without meeting the Chandela king. He visited the Chandela palace with a large retinue. Only four of his attendants were allowed to accompany him inside the palace, but Madanavarman offered him a warm reception. Consequently, Jayasimha returned to his capital peacefully. According to K. M. Munshi, this legend is \\"fanciful\\", and Jayasimha did not achieve much success against the Chandelas.  Other conflicts  The Talwara inscription of the Chaulukyas boasts that Jayasimha crushed Permardi. \\"Permardi\\" was a title used by the contemporary Kalyani Chalukya monarch Vikramaditya VI, as well as several other rulers. The Permardi mentioned in the Talwara inscription is unlikely to be Vikramaditya VI, since such a victory would have been the greatest military success of Jayasimha. Jayasimha's victory over Permardi is not mentioned in other records, and finds only a casual mention in the Talwara inscription. This suggests that Permardi was an insignificant ruler. Historian A. K. Majumdar identifies him with Perma-nripa, the son of an obscure king named Pitta, mentioned in a Huli inscription. The Kalyani Chalukya records claim that Vikramaditya VI crossed the Narmada river, and conquered the Lata and Gurjara regions. This claim is not supported by historical evidence, though it is possible that Vikramaditya raided the territory to the north of Narmada. Jayasimha helped Someshvara, a ruler of the Paramara branch of Bhinmal, regain his lost throne. Someshvara's father Udayaraja claims to have conquered \\"Choda, Gauda and Karnata\\". This probably refers to the wars he fought as one of Jayasimha's generals. In this context, Gauda may refer to eastern Punjab. The 1158 Ujjain inscription describes Jayasimha as Barbaraka-jishnu (\\"conqueror of Barbaraka\\"), an epithet also used by his successors. According to Hemachandra, Barbaraka was a rakshasa (demon), who harassed the sages of the hermitage located on the banks of the Sarasvati river at Shristhala (Siddhapura). Jayasimha defeated Barbaraka at the request of the sages, but later released him. Barbaraka then gifted precious jewels to Jayasimha, and became his follower. Later chroniclers also repeat this legendary account with some variations. The historical identification of Barbaraka is not certain, but scholars such as Georg B√ºhler and Bhagwan Lal Indraji speculated that he was a non-Aryan tribal chief. The Dahod inscription states that Jayasimha defeated Sindhuraja, who was probably a Soomra king of Sindh. Succession Jayasimha did not have a son. According to his Jain courtier Hemachandra, he had visited several Hindu and Jain shrines to pray for a male heir, but then came to learn through divination that he would be succeeded by his grand- nephew Kumarapala. According to the legends in the later Jain chronicles, Jayasimha hated Kumarapala, and tried to persecute him during his lifetime. However, Kumarapala escaped, and became the king after his death.  Diplomatic relations  According to Merutunga, the king of Dahala (the Tripuri Kalachuri ruler) sent a letter of alliance to Jayasimha. This Kalachuri king was probably Yashah-Karna. Merutunga also claims that Jayasimha had a diplomatic agent at the court of Jayachandra, the king of Varanasi. However, Jayachandra's reign started in c. 1170 CE, nearly three decades after the end of Jayasimha's reign in c. 1142 CE. During Jayasimha's reign, the king of Varanasi was the Gahadavala ruler Govindachandra, who was Jayachandra's grandfather. Historian A. K. Majumdar speculates that Jayachandra may have assisted his grandfather in an expedition; Merutunga's claim probably refers to an alliance between the Chaulukyas and the Gahadavalas.  Cultural activities  Literature Jayasimha patronized several scholars, and made Gujarat a noted centre of learning and literature. Most notably, he was a patron of the Jain scholar Hemachandra. According to the Jain chronicles, when Jayasimha defeated the Paramaras of Malwa, he brought several Sanskrit manuscripts form Malwa to Gujarat. One of these manuscripts included a treatise on grammar written by the 11th century Paramara king Bhoja. Impressed by this work, Jayasimha commissioned Hemachandra to write a simpler and more comprehensive treatise on grammar. Hemachandra completed the new treatise after consulting several other works, and included the king's name in the title of the new work. Jayasimha had the treatise distributed all over India. Hemachandra also composed other works such as Dvyashraya Kavya, which were completed after Jayasimha's death. Jayasimha also patronized the poet Sripala, who composed the Vadnagar prashasti inscription after his death. The poet described himself as the king's brother. This is corroborated by the chronicler Somaprabha who mentions that Jayasimha considered Sripala his brother, and bestowed the title of Kavindra upon him. Other poets and writers who flourished during Jayasimha's reign included Hemachandra's disciple Ramachandra, Acharya Jayamangala, (author of Kavi-shiksha), the dramatist Yashahchandra (author of Mudrita-Kumudachandra), the poet Vardhamana (author of Siddharaja-Varnana). Coins The gold coins attributed to Siddharaja are found in Pandwaha near Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh. The gold coins are round weights 65-66 grains and measures 0.8\\" to 0.9\\". It has legend Shri Siddharajah on reverse and obverse. The silver coins attributed to him are found at Vanthali, Junagadh and Pilwai in North Gujarat. On obverse of these silver coins, the three lines legend Shri Jayasimha in Nagari script appears; with one more word priya in some coins. On reverse there is an image of an elephant. These elephant either represents Laxmi or commemorates victory in war with Avanti in which his beloved elephant Yasahapatala which was killed. They are 20 grains (1.715 gram) in weight and 0.3\\" in measure. Some small copper coins are also reported.

It is believed that people of 98 different faiths and creeds were living peacefully in his capital.Ejan 15, 115,121;1,7,39 The king's religious perceptor was Bhava Brihaspati, who originally lived in Malwa, and had been brought to Gujarat after Jayasimha's victory over the Paramaras. Jayasimha either renovated or rebuilt the Rudra Mahalaya Temple at Siddhapura (modern Siddhpur). It was the greatest temple of his period, of which only some pillars, shrines and arches survives today. It was completed in 1142 CE. He renovated a lake built by his ancestor Durlabha in Patan, and named it Sahastralinga (\\"1000 lingas\\"). The lake was surrounded by 1008 small shrines, each of which housed a linga (symbols of Shiva). Jayasimha diverted the flow of the entire Saraswati River into the lake. Many artificial islands were created on which many temples, palaces, and gardens were built. On the banks of this lake were thousands of temples to Shiva. Apart from these, there were 108 temples to Devi, Yagnashala and Matha for pupils. Jayasimha invited 1001 Brahmans from Varanasi at the time of the renovation of Sahastralinga lake; their successors are known as Audichya Brahmin.Dryashraya by Hemchandracharya. 15. 115 There is a legend of Jasma Odan associated with the lake who had cursed Jayasimha to remain childless. According to Jain sources, he also built Siddhavihara at Siddhpur. The stepwell in Dhandhalpur is also ascribed to Jayasimha Siddharaja. His mother Mayanalladevi is credited for building lakes at Viramgam and Dholka. The Minal stepwell in Balej village in Sabarkantha district are ascribed to her and was built in 1095 CE. A stepwell in Nadiad and Minaldevi Vav in Virpur in Rajkot district are also ascribed to her and has stylistic affinities to Chaulukya architecture. The fort of Jhinjhuwada with its well-carved gates as well as the five kunds at Sihor were built during his period. Jayasimha patronized several Jain scholars, and the Jains occupied important positions in his kingdom. The Jain authors show him treating all the different religious communities impartially. According to Hemachandra's Dvyashrya-Kavya, Jayasimha made arrangements for the maintenance of Jain monks, and also visited the shrine of Neminatha on his way to Somanatha. The Jain chronicles state that Sajjana, the governor of Saurashtra, appropriated the state funds to build a temple of Neminatha. However, Jayasimha was so impressed by the temple's beauty that he forgave Sajjana. Some later Jain chronicles claim that Hemachandra convinced Jayasimha that Jainism was superior to Shaivism, and that the king banned animal slaughter for 8 days in each year. However, these stories are apocryphal in nature and were invented several centuries after Jayasimha's death. The 14th century chronicler Merutunga states that Jayasimha once banned the Jain temples from hoisting their banners, but later revoked it, acknowledging it as a mistake. In Patan, Jayasimha built Rayavihara or Rajavihara, the great temple commemorating victory of Shwetambara Jain Acharya Vadi Devsuri over Digambara Jain pontiff Kumudchandra. It was constructed under Minister Ashuka and consecrated in 1127 CE. His minister Udayana built Udayana-vasatika at Khambhat mentioned by Kavi Dungara's Khambhayat-chaitya-paripati. Minister Solaka built Solaka-vasati at Patan before 1112 CE. Another Shantinath Jain temple was built in Patan somewhere before 1125 CE. His minister and later governor of Sorath, Sajjana built Neminath temple, called Karna-vihara after king's father, on Mount Girnar which was consecrated in 1129 CE according to Jinaprabha and other sources. Hemchandra also mentions his erection of Mahavira temple at Siddhpur which appears same as the Siddhavihara mentioned in Kumarapalapratibodha (1185 CE). It was also known as Rai-vihara. This chaturmukha temple was supervised by Minister Aliga and consecrated by Vadi Devasuri in 1142 CE. Later it was used as a model for Dharana-vihara temple at Ranakpur. Other temples mentioned are Ukesha-vasati (before 1109 CE) at Patan, Parshwanath temple (after 1118 CE) by Nittala Devi at Patadi, the Jain temple (1119 CE) at Patan by Dandanayaka Kapardi and installed by Jayasimhasuri, Simandhara temple (1119 CE) at Dholka by Minister Udayana and installed by Vadi Devasuri, Munisuvrata temple (1137 CE) at Dholka by Shreshthi Dhavala. The Neminatha temple at Kumbhariya was consecrated in 1137 CE by Vadi Devasuri. The Bhattarika Temple with Vinayaka-kulika at Gala in Saurashtra as well as Udaleshwara and Kurpaleshwara temples in Bhadravati (Bhadreshwar) were erected in 1137 CE. The Dahod inscription mentions Goga Narayan temple built by Senapati Keshava in memory of his mother in 1140 CE. Koka-vasati mentioned in Vividha-tirthakalpa as well as the Jain temple at Bhalej by Shreshti Yashodhana were built during this period. The extant temples of his period include Parshwanath Jain temple at Kumbhariya, Shrikrishna temple at Valam, Jasmalnathji Mahadev Temple at Asoda near Vijapur, Shitalamata temple at Piludra, small double shrine at Khandoran, the shrines at Munsar lake at Viramgam, two temples at Chaubari in Saurashtra, Chandramauli temple at Kamboi, the shrines in compound old Limboji Mata temple and some other shrines in and around Delmal, old Shiva temple at Ruhavi, the triple shrine at Kasara; many of them are in north Gujarat. Other temples include the best surviving Navlakha temple, Shiva shrine opposite it and a small Jain temple at Sejakpur as well as the Navlakha temple at Anandpur. Jayasimha extended his religious tolerance to Islam as well, and the Muslim historian Muhammad Aufi has recorded stories about his impartiality. During his rule, there were communal clashes in the city of Khambhat and a congregational mosque was damaged. He had ordered its rebuilding.Iliat 2 162-163 According to a legend, a da'i named Ahmad once took two Gujarati orphans (Abdullah and Nuruddin) to Cairo, trained them in the Ismaili doctrine, and sent them back to Gujarat as missionary. Abdullah laid the foundation of the Bohra community. According to the Bohra myths, Jayasimha sent an army to capture Abdullah, but Abdullah converted him to Islam by performing miracles and by exposing the purported miracles of Hindu pandits as fake. There is no evidence that Jayasimha ever gave up Shaivism, but several of the Bohra Walis and Da'i al-Mutlaqs claimed descent from him. These included Syedna Ismail, the 34th Da'i al-Mutlaq. In another Ismaili tradition called Satpanth, it is claimed that Jayasimha was converted to their tradition by their allegedly the first leader, Pir Satgur Nur.

It was once one of the largest buildings in the district and remains a landmark. The ground floor arcade is well known for its many snack shops. History and background Tai On Building is located at 57-87 Shau Kei Wan Road on Hong Kong Island, which is next to the Sai Wan Ho MTR station and the tram stop of Tai On Street. It was constructed by Hong Kong Land Buildings Limited in 1968. It was designed as a H-block, which was the common structure of residential properties in the 1960s. It has 28 floors from Ground floor to the 28th floor, there are 68 flats per floor, a total of 1,884 flats all together and 16 lifts for the entire building. Before land reclamation in around 1978, it was alongside the coastal area. In the early 1960s, there were no walled residential buildings in Sai Wan Ho area. Thus, the construction of Tai On Building was a sensation at that time and Hong Kong Land Buildings Limited received more than ten thousand applications. There are two types of flats (375 square feet and 465 square feet including common area) in Tai On Building. In the earlier years, the most expensive flat cost only from $17,300-$27,000 and buyer only needed to pay 10% initial deposit while the whole installment payment could be paid off in a maximum of 14 years. Thus, the common working class could also afford the payment. Besides residence, it also consists of a shopping centre, parking lot, petrol station and an open garden/terrace area on the waterfront side on the first floor. Once upon a time, Tai On Building has its own cinema named Tai On Cinema which was located at the current McDonald's restaurant. The 20,000 square feet shopping center is on the ground floor with around hundred shops, including food stalls, grocery stores, Chinese restaurant, stationery store, laundry-shop, hardware store, clinic, bookstore, game center etc. Due to the varieties of shops, many locals in the area besides the building residents often visit Tai On Building for goods and services. Tai On Building is famous for the food stalls. Visitors can find many local snacks from those shops. Besides, as most of the food stalls open at night, Tai On Building has been nicknamed \\"the night market of Hong Kong Island\\". Ten years ago, some of the food stalls did not have the Food Factory License issued by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. However, in recent years, most of the food stalls are licensed and therefore the hygiene status has been improved. Nowadays, many Hong Kong's style snacks are going to disappear as the young generations are not interested in preserving the local refreshments. However, as Tai On Building is providing more and more local cuisines, the popularity of Tai On Building continues to grow. Besides, the most special thing is, currently, not only local citizens but also tourists from all over the world are interested in visiting Tai On Building. As a result, in the future, it may become one of the hottest eating spot in Hong Kong. Features Door-to-door delivery There are 1,884 flats in Tai On Building. However, for security reasons, there are no standard letterboxes for householder in the lobby. In the past few years, the Owners‚Äô Corporation of Tai On Building was designed to construct the letterboxes on every floor. Nonetheless, the construction cost is too expensive that the Owners‚Äô Corporation gave up the idea. As a result, postmen need to walk along the H-block for delivering every time. No visitor registration CCTV of Tai On Building Unlike other typical housing estate, visitors to Tai On Building can go straight up the stairs without any registration. However, there are more than 200 CCTV in different areas, especially at the corners. In addition, there are plainclothes guards working for 24 hours. As a result, crime has been reduced in recent years. Obsolete fountain The fountain of Tai On building On the first floor of Tai On Building, there is a non-functional fountain. In the past, the first floor terrace had a great broad view of the harbour and because of that reason, it used to be an excellent place for residents and guests to relax and chill out. At one point, the fountain was a place for residence to launch their toy vessels/boats in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it drew quite a large crowd. When the building first opened to the public, there was a huge party with bands and singers on top of the fountain one weekend and since then, it has been nicknamed \\"The most colourful lighting fountain\\" by the public. The advertising agencies also took it as a selling point for Tai On Building and it has presented the former's glory. However, due to the security reasons, the fountain has been abandoned years ago. Nowadays, people can only see the periphery of the fountain and few chairs on the first floor garden. Snacks Numerous Hong Kong ‚Äústreet snacks‚Äù can be found in Tai On Building, for instance, egg waffles, bovine offals, cart noodles, fish balls, torn pancakes and others.

Connecticut. He best known as a birth control advocate and, along with Estelle Griswold, party to several legal cases that ultimately repealed Connecticut's Comstock laws and established a Constitutional right to privacy for married couples. Biography Buxton was born in Superior, Wisconsin, in 1904 to Edward Timothy Buxton, a lumber trader, and Lucinda Lee Buxton. He grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota, then attended Princeton University. Buxton graduated with an M.D. from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1932. A specialist in female infertility, he joined the Columbia faculty in 1938. He became full professor in 1951, but moved to the Yale School of Medicine in 1953 when offered a position as chair of its Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology. At Yale, he was a fellow of Jonathan Edwards College. Buxton and his wife, Helen Rotch, had four children. Contraception activism Upon moving his infertility practice to New Haven, Buxton discovered he would be unable to prescribe or supply contraceptives to his patients because of Connecticut's anti- contraception Comstock law of 1879, which had been enforced for the first time in 1940. The prohibition extended to his patients whose lives were threatened by pregnancy and those who had experienced serial miscarriages, cases which stirred Buxton to action, and later formed the basis of a legal challenge. He began working with Estelle Griswold of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut in 1955 on their legislative challenge of Connecticut's anti- contraception law, and in 1957 testified in Connecticut state legislature for a doctors' exception to the ban. In the absence of legislative progress, Griswold and Buxton decided to mount a judicial challenge. Supported by Yale Law School professor Fowler Harper and lawyer Katie Roraback, they filed five cases on behalf of Buxton and four anonymous patients: Buxton v. Ullman, Hoe v. Ullman, Roe v. Hullman, Doe v. Ullman, and Poe v. Ullman. The Connecticut Supreme Court upheld the ban on contraception. On appeal, Buxton v. Ullman and Poe v. Ullman, filed for a patient who had experienced three stillbirths, were accepted by the US Supreme Court in 1960. In June 1961, the cases were dismissed by the court in a 5‚Äì4 ruling on the grounds that the case was not ripe because the law had not been enforced on the plaintiffs. Immediately after the case, Buxton notified the Yale School of Medicine and Grace‚ÄìNew Haven Hospital that his clinic would begin providing contraceptive advice to patients. In November 1961, Griswold announced the opening new New Haven Planned Parenthood headquarters building with a family planning clinic, with Buxton as its medical director. Griswold and Buxton were arrested by the New Haven Police nine days after the clinic opened. The resulting case against Buxton and Lee, The State of Connecticut v. Estelle T. Griswold and C. Lee Buxton, was affirmed by the Connecticut Supreme Court in April 1964, providing evidence that the case was ripe. The appeal, known as Whitney v. Griswold, was heard by the US Supreme Court one year later and overturned in a 7‚Äì2 ruling, finding the original anti-contraception statute unconstitutional because it violated \\"the right to marital privacy.\\" Buxton's health began to fail towards the end of the appeal. In 1965, he took a leave of absence from Yale. He died on July 7, 1969 in Hamden, Connecticut. Bibliography Books *Buxton, C. Lee. (1949).

The Liberal leaders are portrayed as jocular scoundrels attacking the upright Attorney General T. Upington. The Koegas atrocities or Koegas affair (1878‚Äì80) was a notorious murder case in the Cape Colony, which led to deep political divisions and a follow up campaign, due to the perceived racial bias of the country's Attorney General. It culminated in libel suits, filed by the government against several liberal leaders and news outlets. Background In 1878 the Cape Colony was going through a period of enormous strife and conflict, due mainly to the enforcement, by Britain, of a Confederation model onto the various states of southern Africa. This had involved the overthrow of the Cape's liberal first government, and the setting up of a pro-imperialist puppet-government under Prime Minister Gordon Sprigg. Under British direction, this new government had embarked on a series of expansionist frontier wars. There was a concurrent movement away from political and social inclusiveness and public feeling in the war environment became considerably more hostile to perceived \\"outsiders\\". The liberal remnants of the previous government were very much on the defensive. Against this backdrop, a low-scale conflict was underway all along the Orange River. This involved war between two tribes, the Koranas and the Bastaards, but on a larger scale was directed by the Cape in order to secure its northern frontier. The murder (1878) The actual atrocities were inflicted in the Northern Cape, at Luisdraai near Koegas (roughly within the modern Siyathemba Local Municipality). In October 1878, a group of Korana and San rebels were savagely attacked by a military patrol and 46 of them were killed. It later arose that they were killed in cold blood, after having been disarmed and taken prisoner, and among the 46 were 11 women and children. The perpetrators were mounted militia, consisting of several white and Griqua farmers. The trial for the Koegas murders (1879) The trial of five members of the military patrol, for willful murder, took place the following year at the circuit court in Victoria West. The trial took place in a deeply conservative town, where many of the commandos had initially been raised. Therefore in September 1879, in spite of enormous evidence, the jury found all four of the white militiamen to be not-guilty, and only Zoutaar, the black militiaman, to be guilty (and then only of \\"assault\\"). The verdict was received with cheers from the local townsfolk, however an immediate uproar resulted across the Cape Colony as the trial was roundly accused of being a massive miscarriage of justice. The Judge himself (Justice Dwyer) angrily wrote to the powerful Cape Town MP and newspaper proprietor Saul Solomon, asking him to take up and publicise the matter. Liberal reaction (1879) It was widely believed that a racist jury had acquitted the accused simply because they were predominantly white. Indignation focused on the Cape's Attorney General (and Minister of Justice) Thomas Upington, for allowing the trial to take place in a racist and hostile environment. Present at the time, he had in fact been officially warned about the strong partisan feeling of the town and its local jury, before the verdict, but had refused to move the trial.R.Ross: Status and Respectability in the Cape Colony, 1750‚Äì1870: A Tragedy of Manners. Cambridge University Press, 1999. p.54. From early October 1879, a campaign began in Cape Town, led by Saul Solomon and Francis Joseph Dormer of the Cape Argus, soon joined by Francis Statham and Patrick McLoughlin of the Cape Post. Other vocal leaders of the campaign were the MP John X. Merriman and Rev D. P. Faure - who had even been present at the original trial, though just as an interpreter.A.Nash: The Dialectical Tradition in South Africa Routledge. 2009. p.54. The campaign accused the Attorney General and his colleagues of allowing white juries to acquit whites who had killed blacks. Its leaders called for the Attorney General's resignation and for an all-round condemnation of the verdict. The campaign dominated the newspapers of the Cape, for the duration of this period, and deeply divided the country between liberal and reactionary.http://www.cristoraul.com/ENGLISH/histoy-of-africa/books/HISTORY- OF-SOUTH-AFRICA-2.htm The \\"Fiat Justitia\\" trial (1879-80) Attorney General Upington fought back, when he sued Saul Solomon and Dormer for libel, relating to pieces written by Dormer, but under Solomon's aegis. In particular, the Argus had published a letter, attacking the trial, signed \\"Fiat Justitia\\" (\\"May there be justice\\"), which formed the main point of Upington's attack. (\\"Fiat Justitia\\" turned out to have been D.P. Faure himself, who had his career terminated as a result) The libel trial (popularly known as the \\"Fiat Justitia trial\\") was held in Cape Town, before two judges - Sir Henry De Villiers and Sir Andries Stockenstrom. Enormous public attention focused on the trial, and a high level of public emotion resulted. The judges publicly concluded that \\"the most gruesome atrocities had been committed against defenceless prisoners\\" and local prejudice had indeed caused the miscarriage of justice in the ensuing circuit court. The statement also concluded that the Attorney-General was indeed gravely at fault, and that it was undesirable for him to continue to hold political office. However in their verdict on the specific crime of the trial, that of libel, they concluded that one of the articles had gone too far, and that attacks on the Attorney General were valid and permitted, but should be grounded in facts and not in blind emotion. Saul Solomon was therefore told to pay a symbolic fine (1 shilling). The ruling concluded with a warning on the country's future direction if faults in its legal system were not addressed: \\"It amounts then to this, that the pure streams of justice have been polluted at their fount, and the question we have now to ask is whether the country is content to drink longer of these unwholesome waters.\\"http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S1021-545X2013000200005&script;=sci_arttext While the verdict was undoubtedly intended to heal a divide and appease both parties, it was nonetheless controversial and caused both parties to feel that the matter had not been resolved.Albie Sachs: Justice in South Africa UCP. 1973. p.61.http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3489n8p6&chunk.id;=d0e841&toc.id;=&brand;=eschol References Category:Cape Colony ","title":"Koegas atrocities"},{"id":"45705591","text":"Fitness culture is a sociocultural phenomenon surrounding exercise and physical fitness. It is usually associated with gym culture, as doing physical exercises in locations such as gyms, wellness centres and health clubs is a popular activity. An international survey found that more than 27% of world total adult population attends fitness centres, and that 61% of regular exercisers are currently doing \\"gym-type\\" activities.Burgess, Tim. 2013. ‚ÄúFitness is the World‚Äôs Biggest Sport‚Äù. Les Mills Global Consumer Fitness Survey. Les Mills  Development   Gymnastics of ancient Greece and Rome  The word gymnastics is derived from the Greek word gymnazein which literally means \\"to exercise naked\\".In ancient Greece and Rome, a public place devoted to athletes training, called gymnasion (plural: gymnasia) for Greeks and palaestra (plural: palaestrae) for Romans existed in cities. Fitness was regarded as a concept shaped by two cultural codes: rationalization and asceticism; authenticity and hedonism, respectively. In Greece, gymnastic excellence was regarded as a noble and godly pursuit, and was included in a complete education. Gymnasiums became the center of the community, being associated with the arts, the study of logic, and a source of entertainment. Skilled athletes attained an elevated status and devoted their lives to becoming proficient in exercise. Both men and women participated in various gymnastic exercises. The series of activities include swimming, throwing, wrestling, jumping and weightlifting. After the Romans conquered Greece they developed the activities into a more formal sport and used their gymnasiums to prepare their legions for warfare. However with the decline of the Roman empire people lost their interest in gymnastics and it now is only known as a form of entertainment.  Nineteenth century  From around 1800, gymnastics developed in Western countries was meant to enhance body in order to sustain public morals and to mold better citizens.Fit Bodies. Fitness Culture and Gym Sassatelli, Roberta. 2006. Pehr Henrik Ling was a pioneer in the teaching of physical education in Sweden, and he sought to reform and improve the gymnastics of the ancient Greeks. In 1850, the Supreme Medical Board of Russia reported to their emperor on Ling's system, that by improving one's overall fitness, an athlete became superior to those who merely focused on a subset of muscles or actions. In the mid 19th century the world saw the rise of physical culture, a movement that emphasized the importance of physical exercise for men, women, and children alike. Diocletian Lewis, a physician, even advocated for males and females exercising together in the gym. In 1896 Men's gymnastics was on the schedule of the first modern Olympics. The Olympic gymnastic competition for women began in 1924.  World War II  Leading up to and during World War II, totalitarian regimes used gymnastics as a way to promote their ideologies. Physical fitness was at the core of Nazi philosophy, and the German government financed the construction of sports and wellness facilities. In 1922, the Nazi Party established the Hitler Youth, where children and adolescents participated in physical activities to develop both their physical and mental fitness. Nazi sports imagery served the purpose of promoting the idea of \\"Aryan\\" racial superiority, and in 1933, an \\"Aryans only\\" policy was instituted in all German athletic organizations. In the Soviet Union, the Leninist Young Communist League created the Ready for Labour and Defence of the USSR in 1931, which was a fitness program that was designed to improve public health and prepare the population for highly productive work and the defense of \\"the motherland\\".  The Cold War  During the Cold War, a focus on physical fitness emerged in both the United States and the Soviet Union. Senator Hubert Humphrey gravely warned that communist dominance came from superior sports and fitness programs. His remarks reflected the growing American paranoia of communism. In response, leaders of the military, civilian government, and private sector began crafting a \\"cult and ritual of toughness\\". President John F. Kennedy issued a call to the nation urging Americans to prioritize their physical fitness across the country. Fitness was clearly described as a \\"matter of achieving an optimum state of well-being\\" that required exercise from both young and old. This focus on fitness also opened the doors for female athletes in both the U.S. and the USSR to become more prominent as contenders in the Olympics.  Mass participation, commercialization  After World War II, a new form of non-organized, individualistic, health-oriented physical and recreational activities such as jogging began to prevail. The Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans, developed by Dr Bill Orban in 1961, sold 23 million copies to the public. United States Air Force Colonel Kenneth Cooper's book \\"Aerobics\\" was released in 1968 and mass-market version \\"The New Aerobics\\" in 1979. These publications by Orban and Cooper helped to launch modern fitness culture. The Olympics inspired a running boom in the 1970s. After the release of Jane Fonda's Workout exercise videos in 1982, aerobics became a popular form of group gymnastic activity. Fitness began to be commercialised. Gyms were set up with the goals not to improve public health but to stimulate and exploit the desire of people to keep fit, have fun and improve themselves. It can also be observed in today's gyms where bodybuilders are trying to reach their aesthetic ideas, through muscle development, using weights and other equipment. Growth in bodybuilding as a fitness phenomenon followed the movie and book Pumping Iron in 1977 and the movie Pumping Iron II in 1985. The term gym is often associated with the term fitness and going to gyms means doing exercises in fitness institutions such as fitness centres, health clubs or gym clubs where people have to pay for membership in order to use fitness equipment and participate in group fitness activities with instructors, such as aerobics and yoga classes.  Technology, specialization, branding  Advances in technology in the twenty-first century have changed the way of doing fitness activities. The Quantified Self has become a new phenomenon, where people use technological devices to support their workouts. It is characterized by the use of gadgets such as pedometer, GPS, heart rate monitor and smartphone apps to quantify or monitor the exerciser‚Äôs efforts. There is a decrease in popularity of \\"pure aerobics\\" exercises. The attention is moving from aerobics, bodybuilding and traditional technique of exercises, to activities such as yoga, zumba, pilates, spinning and aquacycling, tai chi, kickboxing, and outdoor fitness. Exercises have been commercialized as branded exercises by fitness institutions. Branded exercises are group workouts developed by fitness institutions for people with different goals of fitness.  Influences   Mass media  Mass media plays an important role in shaping fitness culture because of the messages of an ideal body image they convey. Media such as TV, magazines and book publications, tend to promote slimness or even thinness as the ideal standards of female body image and slenderness or muscularity as the ideal male body image.Pressure Increasingly Affects Boys Jamie Santa Cruz. 2014, The Atlantic Commercial advertisements have also created an influential and powerful force in promoting a stereotype of ideal body image which is not limited to fashion advertisements. Advertisements on commodities such as watches, smartphones and household appliances, have promoted an idealized body image of women and men as well. The perception of being slim and thin for women and slender and muscular for men became a stereotype in society, creating sociocultural pressures and influencing people to engage in fitness in order to pursue the ideal body image promoted by the mass media.Brown, Kirsty. 1997. ‚ÄúFrom Fashion to Fitness? A Sociocultural Analysis of the Representation of Thinness within the Mass Media‚Äù. University of Toronto Exercising and dieting is often seen as the best way to achieve such ideal body image. For instance, fitness publications promote an idea that doing physical exercise is the natural medicine to your body and health.Sassatelli, Roberta. 2000. ‚ÄúThe Commercialization of Discipline: Keep-fit Culture and its Values‚Äù. Journal of Modern Italian Studies, Volume 5, Issue 3, pp396‚Äì411 On the other hand, fashion magazines promote slimness and thinness as the ideal female image: to promote high fashion, models are usually slim and thin. There is also a significant increase of diet and weight loss articles in magazines. In addition, the shape of models has changed dramatically towards a ‚Äúmore tubular female form‚Äù in high fashion culture, often sparking controversies.Former Vogue editor: The truth about size zero Kirstie Clements. 2013. The Guardian  Peer influence  People who regularly attend fitness institutions tend to make friends at these locations. They want to feel part of a group, which can be referred to community feeling, as the behaviour of group membership is transmitted from member to member within a group. However, this kind of friendship usually remains restricted within the fitness institution.Crossley, Nick. 2006. ‚ÄúIn the Gym Motives, Meaning and Moral Careers‚Äù. Body and Society, Volume 12, No.3, pp23‚Äì50. SAGE Publications Besides, the atmosphere in fitness institutions created by people with the same goal becomes a force of motivation. When people go to fitness institutions or start a new activity, they can be encouraged by others and give support to each other. In addition, fitness institutions can function as dating agencies, creating chances to meet people apart from workplaces. Music, body movement and costumes of people exercising, can easily draw attention and become an occasion to engage with each other.Sassatelli, Roberta. 2010. Fitness Culture Gym: Gyms and the Commercialization of Discipline and Fun. Palgrave Macmillan Another important aspect of fitness culture is the gender differentiation in exercises performed. One study showed that women prefer to do cardiovascular exercise over weight training because it allows them to gain strength without transgressing norms for feminine physical appearance, whereas men prefer other exercises like bodybuilding or boxing in order to be more muscular.  Personal trainers  Fitness institutions are places where people can cultivate their individual needs in terms of keeping fit and having fun with other people. They have been developed as a commercial environment since 1980s. The concept beyond this commercial aspect can be explained by the idea of making the best use of time because people must pay for their membership in order to join a fitness institution. Thus, they are considered customers. Fitness institutions are trying to explore the market by providing extra services such as personal trainers, coaches and experts. Personal trainers act as representative roles that represent the fitness club. It is a kind of representation for customers in term of satisfaction and loyalty to that particular fitness institution. Trainers also act as brokers, or agents, to create a link between the activities of their customers and the purchase of extra goods and services that their customers need for particular activities such as shoes for specific training, clothing, or home equipment. Trainers are also motivators of the goods and services. They are required to have technical skills in order to provide professional fitness services to their customers and they need to have good communication skills meant to persuade their customers to do more in the fitness institution, which in turn means purchasing more goods and services. Finally, personal trainers also act as entrepreneurs: creating a large network of customers for different goods and services in order to produce profits. From this point of view, personal trainers are intermediaries between customers and the fitness institution, playing a crucial role in the commercialization of fitness culture.Maguire, Jennifer Smith. 2001. ‚ÄúFit and Flexible: the Fitness Industry, Personal Trainers and Emotional Service Labor‚Äù. Sociology of Sport Journal, 18, pp379‚Äì402 The popularity of personal trainers can be explained by the analysis of rule-governed behaviour in terms of evolutionary thinking. From this perspective, personal trainers act as speaker to give rules, while trainees are listeners to follow the rules. Much human behaviour starts out from rule- governed behaviour and switches to long-term control. Whether the trainees will continue the training depends on the reinforcement by following the rule of personal trainers, because being fit and bodily well-being is a long-term contingency of fitness activities.Baum, William M. 1995. ‚ÄúRules, Culture and Fitness‚Äù. The Behavior Analyst, 18, pp1‚Äì21 The role of personal trainers has also revealed a phenomenon which can be explained from the sociological perspective of \\"outsourced-self\\".Hochschild, Arlie Russell. 2012. The Outsourced Self: Intimate Life in Market Times. Metropolitan Books This means ‚Äútransferring our own responsibility to other‚Äù. Keeping healthy and well are people‚Äôs own responsibility, however people are hiring personal trainers to be responsible for it. It is also relevant to the perspective of \\"body work\\" in the sociology of body: people are outsourcing their own bodies to the paid workers in order to keep healthy and prevent illness.Gimlin, Debra. 2007. ‚ÄúWhat Is ‚ÄòBody Work‚Äô? A Review of the Literature‚Äù. Sociology Compass, Volume 1, Issue 1, pp353‚Äì370  Sport fashion  Sport fashion is a product created by commercialization of fitness culture. As mentioned above, personal trainers also act as agents to sell different goods and services. An example is the case of Body Training System (BTS). BTS instructors are suggested to change their costume according to the programmes in order to show the differences in character. The aim is to aspire the trainees to purchase the same costume offered by the programmes.Felstead, Alan, Fuller, Alison, Jewson, Nick, Kakavelakis, Konstantinos and Unwin, Lorna. 2007. ‚ÄúGrooving to the Same Tunes? Learning, Training and Productive Systems in the Aerobics Studio‚Äù. Work, Employment & Society, Volume 21(2): pp189‚Äì208. SAGE Publications Besides, sport wear and athletic footwear has become the fastest growing segment in the apparel market. The trend in sport wear frames it not only for sport activities but also as daywear or weekend wear. While classic sport brands continue to expand their market share in the industry, high fashion brands have also joined the competition.Why Fitness is Having a Moment in Fashion Vingan, Alyssa. 2014.

It is situated about north east of Yulara and south west of Alice Springs. The lease shares a boundary with other pastoral leases including Angas Downs to the west, Lyndavale to the south, Erldunda to the south east and Palmer Valley to the north west. The Lasseter Highway bisects the property from east to west. The property takes its name from the peak Mount Ebenezer that is found in the Baselow Range within the station boundaries. Mount Ebenezer is named after Ebenezer Flint who was delivering supplies to telegraph stations in the area in 1871. The pastoralist, Richard Warburton, took up Erldunda Station to the east of Mount Ebenezer in 1822. Warburton is thought to have passed through the area while mustering stray cattle. William Liddle took up the nearby Angas Downs Station in 1922. The Mount Ebenezer Roadhouse was closed for several months in 2012. When William O'Donnell signed a lease to reopen the roadhouse he was driven from the property by a spear wielding Indigenous man. The owners of the roadhouse terminated the contract shortly afterward. As of 2014 the property was still on the market along with at least 15 others in the Kimberley and Northern Territory.

He is well known as the founder of Capital Radio's 'Soul Spectrum' programme (from 1975 onwards) and for the promotion of PIR records and associated artists when it was formed in 1971. Early career Edwards was born in Grenada and raised in New York City although he moved to the UK in 1971 in order to assist in the running of the newly formed Philadelphia International record label which was founded by writer-producers Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff. He worked as an Executive at CBS records during this time, where he was responsible for the marketing and promotion of soul music, with acts such Earth, Wind and Fire, Lou Rawls and Johnny Nash. BBC and Capital Radio Whilst still working for CBS, Edwards was approached by BBC radio producer Dave Price to stand in for the Emperor Rosko radio show in 1972. (Rosko had to return to Los Angeles, as his father Joe Pasternak was ill). It is here that Edward's radio career began, working for BBC Radio 1 on the Saturday noon3pm slot. It was Edwards' intention to promote soul and jazz music which had very little UK airplay at that time. He also presented three editions of the long-running music show Top of the Pops, during March and April 1974. However, he decided to leave the BBC and work for the new Independent Radio Station set up in October 1973, called Capital Radio. It was at Capital Radio that Edwards worked alongside DJs such as the late Kenny Everett, Dave Cash (disc jockey) and Chris Tarrant. Edwards was well known for promoting record labels on his station. He once said, \\"Buy anything that is issued on the Prelude label\\". The station even issued a 'soul spectrum playlist' each Saturday which was available from the station, located in Euston Tower, London.

Although this family is currently made up of three named genera; Diplonema, Rhynchopus, and Hemistasia, there likely exist thousands of still unnamed genera. Organisms are generally colourless and oblong in shape, with two flagella emerging from a subapical pocket. They possess a large mitochondrial genome composed of fragmented linear DNA These non-coding sequences must be massively trans-spliced, making it one of the most complicated post- transcriptional editing process known to eukaryotes. Etymology The word ‚ÄúDiplonemidae‚Äù come from the Greek words ‚Äòdiplo‚Äô, meaning two, and ‚Äònemat‚Äô, meaning thread. Together, Diplonemidae roughly translates to ‚Äòtwo threads‚Äô, likely referring to the characteristic two flagella of the organism.  History of Knowledge  Primary studies done in the 1900s by Griessmann and Skuja had initially grouped Diplonemidae (or more specifically, the Diplonema and Rhynchopus taxa) with the euglenids. This was due to the two groups sharing many morphological similarities with the euglenids, such as metaboly, locomotion and a microtubule-reinforced feeding apparatus. However, this conclusion was met with some controversy, as diplonemids lacked characteristic features shared by all euglenids, such as possession of pellicle strips and paraxonemal rods on their flagella. Instead, they were placed in the euglenozoan phylum and shared this taxon with the kinetoplastids and euglenids. The inclusion of Rhynchopus and Diplonema in the family Diplonemidae was later confirmed through nuclear 18S rRNA analysis. As of now, Rhynchopus and diplonema are part of the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô diplonemidae subgroup, whilst hemistasia is part of the ‚Äònonclassical‚Äô diplonemidae subgroup. Recently, there had been debates as to whether Diplonemidae were more closely related to the euglenids or kinetoplastids. It was not until analysis of cytosolic heat shock proteins that a sister relationship between the diplonemids and kinetoplastids was proposed. This was further supported through phylogenetic analysis, which discovered that diplonemidae possess a functional splice leader RNA that is characteristic of the kinetoplastids. Additionally, the amino acid tryptophan is encoded by codon TGA in kinetoplastids and diplonemids, whereas in euglenids, the regular codon is used instead. Nevertheless, despite the similarities between kinetoplastids and diplonemids, the two taxa are still distinct form each other. Diplonemidae still lack a kinetoplast, and have a unique bi-flagellated trophic phase not seen in kinetoplastids. Presently, the kinetoplastids are regarded as the sister group to the Diplonemidae. Although there are only three named genera within the Diplonemidae, environmental sequencing performed by the recent TARA Ocean Expedition concluded there are potentially thousands of genera, suggesting that pelagic Diplonemidae are the most diverse planktonic eukaryotes in the oceans.  Habitat and Ecology  Although Diplonemidae are generally predators, some species display parasitic life strategies. Diplonemidae display a rich diversity in marine and freshwater environments, with their relative abundance increasing with depth. The diplonemids that exist in these different environments are genetically distinct, and exhibit slightly different lifestyles. The ‚Äòclassic‚Äô diplonemids (i.e. Diplonema and Rhynchopus) are benthic, whereas the marine diplonemids, which include Hemistasia, are planktonic. There are potentially thousands of unknown marine Diplonemidae species, with this diversity highly stratified in accordance to depth. Although molecular sequencing confirms the existence of these unnamed marine Diplonemidae, information regarding their morphology and lifestyle is absent. As marine Diplonemidae are the most abundant and genetically diverse protists (and potentially eukaryotes) in the sea, there are strong implications that they play a key role in aquatic ecosystems. As of now, this exact role is unknown.  Description of the Organism   Morphology and Anatomy  Classical diplonemids (i.e. Diplonema and Rhynchopus), are colourless and oblong in shape. They are approximately 20 Œºm in length and possess a microtubule layer underneath their plasma membrane. Adjacent to it is a mitochondrion with discoidal cristae. They also possess two flagella of equal length, both of which lack paraxial rods. The two basal bodies originate from a subapical pocket, which merges with an adjacent feeding apparatus. This feeding apparatus is surrounded by many food vacuoles and reinforced by microtubules. Nonclassical Diplonemidae (i.e. Hemistasia) are diverse in size but share many morphological aspects with the classic diplonemids. However, a great majority of these marine Diplonemidae have never been seen, with their existence only confirmed through molecular analysis. Although Diplonemidae do not possess pellicular strips like Euglenids, they still move via metaboly. Diplonemidae also exhibit the compartmentalization of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes into peroxisomes. These organelles are referred to as glycosomes, and is a characteristic feature also shared with their sister taxon, the kinetoplastids.  Life cycles  Diplonemidae are capable of sexual reproduction, as genes involved in meiosis have been found. Although marine diplonemids appear to reproduce sexually, not much is known about Diplonemidae reproduction as Euglenozoans rarely demonstrate sexual processes.  Genetics  Diplonemidae have a very unique mitochondrial DNA arrangement. Although Diplonemidae possess a large mitochondrial genome, these do not contain any intact full-sized genes. Instead, their mitochondrial DNA consists of linear gene fragments of different sizes. Because each fragment is both full of repeats and incomplete, individually they are unable to code for a gene themselves. Instead, fragments are transcribed and spliced together using their own specialized trans splicing machinery. Once spliced together, the transcript undergoes extensive editing to become recognizable RNA. This is accomplished by either Uracil-insertion, nucleotide deanimation, or substitution, which eventually generates a fully mature and translatable transcript. The Diplonemidae genome contains a spliced leader RNA gene, which confirms their use of mRNA spliceosome-dependent trans splicing during nuclear expression. Diplonemids possess the gap3 gene which is specifically found in cyanobacteria and proteobacteria. This is likely due to lateral gene transfer following the divergence of diplonemids from the Euglenoids. As to date, this is one of the most-supported examples of lateral gene transfer from a bacterium to eukaryote and may have implications for diplonemid acquisition of biochemical abilities.  Taxonomy Although presently made up of less than a dozen named species, the existence of thousands of unknown Diplonemidae species has been confirmed. * Genus Diplonema Griessmann 1913 non Don 1837 ** D. aggregata Tashyreva et al. 2018 ** D. ambulator Larsen & Patterson 1990 ** D. breviciliata Griessman 1913 ** D. japonica Tashyreva et al. 2018 ** D. metabolica Larsen & Patterson 1990 ** D. nigricans (Schuster, Goldstein & Hershenow 1968) Triemer & Ott 1990 [Isonema nigricans Schuster, Goldstein & Hershenow 1968] ** D. papillata (Porter 1973) Triemer & Ott 1990 [Isonema papillata Porter 1973] * Genus Flectonema Tashyreva et al. 2018 ** F. neradi Tashyreva et al. 2018 * Genus Lacrimia Tashyreva et al. 2018 ** L. lanifica Tashyreva et al. 2018 * Genus Rhynchopus Skuja 1948 ** R. amitus Skuja 1948 ** R. coscinodiscivorus Schnepf 1994 ** R. euleeides Roy et al. 2007 ** R. humris Tashyreva et al. 2018 ** R. littoralensis Kufferath 1950 ** R. serpens Tashyreva et al. 2018 * Sulcionema Tashyreva et al. 2018 ** S. specki Tashyreva et al. 2018 References Category:Euglenozoa ","title":"Diplonemidae"},{"id":"45705799","text":"The 1848 United States presidential election in Maine took place on November 7, 1848, as part of the 1848 United States presidential election.

In 1955, following North Melbourne's round 11 loss to a weak St Kilda side by seven points, Grambeau and Laurie Icke were dismissed from the club. The pair were notified of the committee's decision by mail, with no reason given. The two players received support from their teammates, who held a club meeting on the Sunday where they unanimously agreed that the action of the committee was unconstitutional. Some of them had earlier considered pulling out of their game against Carlton that weekend, in protest. More than 2000 club supporters held a demonstration after the Carlton game, backing Icke and Grambeau. On the next Tuesday, the two players appeared before the North Melbourne committee and were reinstated on the club's training list, after signing a statement which said that the \\"committee of the North Melbourne Football Club acted correctly in dispensing of our services\\" and expressed a desire to \\"withdraw and apologise for statements made by us to the press\\". The reason for Icke and Grambeau being sacked was not revealed to the public, but was believed to be because the committee felt that they had not tried hard enough in the St Kilda game. Both players went straight back into the North Melbourne team, which played Collingwood in round 13.

Covering an area of , it is based around Bristol Temple Meads railway station, which is being redeveloped by Network Rail. It also contains the area around the existing Temple Quay development, and the Silverthorne Lane and Avon Riverside areas. It includes the site of the planned Bristol Arena, and the site of the University of Bristol's planned Temple Quarter Campus. Establishment The creation of the zone was announced by Chancellor George Osborne in the Budget of March 2011, and it was launched in 2012. The zone offers streamlined planning controls and reduced business rates. Rates generated by the zone are channelled to five other areas in the region, designated Enterprise Areas. These are Avonmouth (focusing on manufacturing and distribution), Bath (media and publishing), Emersons Green including Bristol and Bath Science Park, Filton (high-tech) and Weston-super-Mare (business services). Development of the enterprise zone is coordinated by West of England Local Enterprise Partnership, Bristol City Council, the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and Network Rail. Station and surrounds Network Rail is redeveloping the station, in conjunction with its electrification of the Great Western line which will cut the journey time from Temple Meads to London Paddington station to 80 minutes. Station Approach Road will be turned into a public square and the station's main entrance moved to the north side of the station. In January 2015, the council announced changes to the layout of the roads around the station, with the removal of Temple Circus roundabout and provision of better routes for pedestrians and cyclists. Across Station Approach from the station, the Temple Gate redevelopment by TCN UK is a creative and digital campus for small and medium-sized enterprises. Redeveloped buildings include Bristol and Exeter House and Temple Studios. The latter opened in 2013. Engine Shed's lounge area Engine Shed is a new use for part of the Old Station, Brunel's original building, in partnership with the University of Bristol. Opened in December 2013, it hosts business incubators, including SETsquared and WebStart Bristol, which support a cluster of hi-tech startup companies. Engine Shed leases its office space to the incubators, who in turn sub-let space on more flexible terms to the companies, which are selected for their high growth potential, and high expected benefits for the regional economy. In December 2015, with the building fully occupied, additional space was made available in the form of Boxworks, which was rapidly constructed by ForwardSpace next to Engine Shed using 20 shipping containers. This was intended to be a temporary solution until an Engine Shed 2 is built. Public consultation for Engine Shed 2 took place in November 2016. Temple Quarter Campus In November 2016, the University of Bristol announced that it will build a ¬£300 million Temple Quarter Campus for c. 5,000 students, directly to the east of the station. It will replace an empty sorting office building, formerly operated by Royal Mail but derelict since 1997. The campus, which will include a new business school, digital research facilities and a student village, is expected to open in 2021. It will also host Engine Shed 2. Arena Island The zone's biggest development site, sometimes known as 'Arena Island', is south of the station and across the River Avon. Formerly occupied by the Bristol Bath Road depot, the site was acquired by the Homes and Communities Agency. In February 2014 Bristol Council agreed the financing of the arena, which including funding provided by the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership totals ¬£91 million. The winner of the competition to design the arena, the architectural firm Populous, was announced in March 2015. In the same month, the HCA gave the arena site to Bristol City Council. In 2013 the HCA agreed to fund an ¬£11 million road bridge over the river, to link Cattle Market Road to the site of the planned arena. Construction of the bridge took place from March to September 2015. It has lanes for cars, bicycles and pedestrians. In March 2016, the bridge was named Brock's Bridge, after William Brock (1830‚Äì1907), a local builder and entrepreneur. Temple Quay Valentine Bridge in Temple Quay Temple Quay is an area of mixed-use development on a site to the northwest of the station, where the station's goods yard was formerly located. The development project was initiated in 1989 by Bristol Development Corporation, who originally called it Quay Point. In 1995, the corporation transferred its rights on the site to English Partnerships, and development started in 1998. The developer was Castlemore Securities. By 2002, the development south of Bristol Floating Harbour was largely complete and a new phase was started on the other side of the harbour, called Temple Quay North. Castlemore went into administration in 2009, but development continued in the hands of the administrator, PricewaterhouseCoopers. In 2015, Entrepreneurial Spark, a UK-wide business incubator network, opened a hub on the top floor of the Royal Bank of Scotland's Trinity Quay building in Temple Quay North. Managed by NatWest, the hub provides free space, facilities and guidance for startups. Avon Riverside The Avon Riverside area extends along the A4 Bath Road, and Bristol's so-called 'media mile', as far as the site of Paintworks, an existing mixed-use development by Verve. Phase III of Paintworks will be the development of a 'creative skills hub' for digital and media businesses, in partnership with Creative Skillset.

Biography Dorothea Flock was born in the city of Nuremberg. She was the second wife of Bamberg‚Äôs councilor Georg Heinrich Flock. Their house was in Bamberg, Lange Stra√üe 32. Already his first wife Apolonia had been executed for witchcraft in May 1628. Based on an anonymous accusation Dorothea was arrested in December 1629 and imprisoned for alleged adultery. She escaped from custody but shortly afterwards she was caught again. This time she was accused of witchcraft. Georg Heinrich Flock fled to Protestant Nuremberg to the relatives of his wife. The Hofmanns were a respected, wealthy and influential merchant family there. Together with them Georg Heinrich Flock hoped to free his wife Dorothea, who was heavily pregnant. During the following weeks the family tried to secure Dorothea's release. They objected to the procedure against Dorothea Flock and considered the circumstantial evidence insufficient to imprison her any longer. At least a custody transfer from the prison of the Malefizhaus to the building of the old court was achieved. But also there she lay in heavy chains. With the help of a Nuremberg notary public and the intercessions of patricians of Nuremberg they again appealed to the prince-bishop and to . In addition Georg Heinrich and Dorothea¬¥s sister Magdalena hoped for help from Georg Heinrich¬¥s cousin, who as a high-ranking officer of the imperial army, was commanding a regiment in the Netherlands. He held out the prospect of using his influence with Isabella Clara Eugenia, the Spanish infanta and governor of the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Magdalena won over W√ºrzburg¬¥s guardian of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin to petition to the prince-bishop pleading for mercy for Dorothea Flock. But all measures, further interventions by notaries public as well as the efforts of the Nuremberg council remained unsuccessful. Georg Heinrich Flock had no other option but to turn with a supplication to the Imperial Aulic Council in Vienna. Then the tide seemed to turn: On 18 March 1630, Georg Heinrich obtained for his wife a mandate by which Dorothea should be granted easing of detention until childbirth and the assistance of an advocate; and the prince-bishop was called for mediation \\"so that there is no cause for complaint\\". The prince-bishop did not reply. Therefore, on 23 March 1630, Georg Heinrich again contacted the Imperial Aulic Council, which thereupon strengthened its mandate. Again there was no reaction from Bamberg. Only when on 17 April Duke of F√ºrstenberg, president of the Aulic Council, himself stepped into the case and Georg Heinrich even threatened to appeal to the pope, the prince-bishop replied to the first mandate of 18 March. He extensively took a stand against the allegation, appeased the situation and mentioned that Dorothea in the meantime had given birth to a healthy daughter. He defended his actions and had not changed his opinion in the least. On 28 April he even let Dorothea Flock ‚Äì six weeks after childbirth ‚Äì transfer into the Malefizhaus in Bamberg again. But also the Aulic Council remained determined and wrote another mandate on 11 May. This however reached Bamberg five days too late. Under torture Dorothea Flock had already confessed the crime of witchcraft and was sentenced to death by the court of lay assessors on 14 May. Before execution Dorothea Flock was to be gripped with red-hot pincers, then burnt alive. The remnants of her corpse were to be burnt to powder and ashes because of her alleged misdeeds by witchcraft, her reneging God Almighty and the Holy Trinity. The witch hunters learned of the imminent arrival of the mandate. They accelerated the execution and Dorothea was killed half an hour before the messenger arrived with the Imperial order of her release. Due to these events a resistance circle \\"Hofmann‚Äôs friendship\\" with Georg Heinrich Flock and the Hofmanns was formed in Nuremberg which engaged in agitation against further witch trials. They used the meeting of the electoral princes in Regensburg from July to September 1630 to make public to the participants the numerous infringements of laws in Bamberg.

CBC News, August 6, 2014. first presented in 2002 with a reading at Infinitheatre, Montreal. It is about events following the sudden disappearance of a psychiatrist, Dr. Lawrence, from a mental institution and possible involvement of a young patient of the hospital, Michael, in the disappearance. Michael is a disturbed son of an opera singer and a distant father he has only seen once. The elephant connection is when in their sole meeting together in a nature reserve, the father kills an elephant in front of his son. The incident traumatizes the very young Michael. So does his mother's cold attitude and her distancing herself from him for a singing career. Toby Green, an independent psychiatrist is assigned to investigate Michael's involvement as Michael draws the doctor into a psychological mind game involving his past experiences with parents, with Michael claiming he was the cause of his mother's death as he refused to call an ambulance and sang instead the \\"elephant song\\" to her until she died on the floor. He discusses the circumstances of his forced stay in the hospital, he hints to doctor-patient improper relationships involving him and his supervising doctor, and a bizarre relationship with the head nurse. Michael's ploys include an attempt to negotiate an early release from hospital, etc. with his plot ending in great tragedy when he finally convinces the investigating doctor to hand him a box of chocolates.

When Kabir is in hospital Ananya spots Kabir having good time with Tarini, about whom world talks about being his mistress but are actually very good friends. This leads to misunderstanding between Kabir and Ananya and their fights and misunderstandings continue for a while. At the same time Ronnie proposes Ananya and Ananya politely say no to him stating she just considered him as her best friend. This upsets Ronnie and stops talking to Ananya. Taking advantage of these situations, Malvika plots to remove Ananya from KKN offering her a job in Mumbai with higher raise and post of senior reporter through her friend of Mumbai's news channel. Wanting to stay away from Kabir and their fights and also stop upsetting Ronnie, Ananya decides to grab the job and resigns from KKN.

Knowing how much Kabir and Ananya actually love each other their another colleague Trisha insists Ananya to visit KKN office before she board her flight to receive a farewell and plans to reunite Kabir and Ananya by lying to her about farewell party, as there wasn't anyone supposed to be in office as everyone had gone for a summit which Kabir didn't attend. Kabir and Ananya being alone in office, Kabir proposes to Ananya and opens his heart in front of her, after which they share a kiss. Ananya and Kabir finally realize their love for each other and are brought together and no.of romantic instances start to take place. But then Malvika is not happy about this. She steals the video chip about arms and ammunition smuggling and makes Kabir believe that it was lost due to Ananya's carelessness. Kabir shouts at Ananya in front of every body at office. Kabir goes to drop Ananya and after a brief altercation, she fumes out of the car, during the office hours the cold war continues between the two. To apologize to her, on the insistence of Tarini, Kabir goes to her house and ends up telling Ananya's mother about their relationship, who is now upset; but when Kabir explains her about them she agrees happily. Kabir asks Ananya out on a dinner date and they spend a wonderful and a romantic night together. Meanwhile, at KKN he's offered to be a 2% shareholder but with a 3-year lock-in period. Kabir accepts it after Ananya urges him to and Khalid is relieved. The new Business-Head shows up after the merger deal is closed and everyone is stunned to see that it's Shreya (Ankita Bhargava), Ex-Mrs. Kabir Sharma. Kabir sees through all the trickery and accuses Khalid and KL of conspiring against him to force him to stay. Shreya claims to have joined for purely professional reasons. Although in the beginning Shreya is sweet and polite, especially with Ananya, Kabir doesn't believe her. Disturbed with her presence Kabir decides to tell Ananya truth about his married life with Shreya. He reveals that Kabir had initially written about a scam at Shreya's office to which Shreya tries to resolve this matter cleaverly and challenging her friends that she would make Kabir bow down to her who is all about his self-respect and principles. Shreya belonged to a rich family and Kabir at that time didn't even owned a home and stayed on rent. They both keep meeting again and again regarding work and fall in love and get hitched. Soon after Shreya starts showing her true colours by time to time insulting Kabir in front of her friends about his poor financial status. One day he gets to know about her challenge while at a party with Shreya and her friends. Devastated he lands on Tarini's doorstep who is his intern and a good friend. But in a flow of emotions they both end up spending whole night together crossing all limits of marriage which puts Kabir under guilt for cheating on Shreya and he confesses to her. Seeking this opportunity which she was waiting for Shreya divorces Kabir for being unfaithful to her and defames him and Tarini. Kabir feels responsible for destroying Tarini's life and career and starts supporting her (by making her his stringer) and her younger brother Anurag for their living. Ananya very maturely understands Kabir's side and accepts his love and promises to be with him forever. Meanwhile, Shreya also narrates their marriage story to Ananya's mother but altering few details and keeping Kabir at fault and poisoning her mind that Kabir was always hesitant to commit to her. To which Ananya's mother questions Kabir and ask him to get engaged with Ananya if he truly loves her which he accepts. Just a day before their engagement bomb scare incidents occurs in which a bomb jacket is tied to Ananya and is aired live on news channel. Seeing Kabir standing strong by her side even in time of death, Ananya's mother realises her mistake of not trusting Kabir. After the bomb is defused, the next day Ananya and Kabir get engaged with happy consent of her mother. Shreya also lands up in their engagement realising that Ananya is Sudhir Kashyap's daughter and knowing truth about her father. It is revealed that Shreya is lonely so she came back to India to again continue her lost relationship with Kabir. But by this time Kabir had moved on with Ananya. Soon Malvika resigns (for personal development) and Shreya teams up with Maanav luring him for the position of Co-Editor-in-chief. It is later revealed that RG was responsible for Ananya's father's death and Kabir all the while knew truth about Ananya's father's death, to which she breaks her engagement with Kabir. Kabir had hidden this truth fearing for life of his brother Rajveer's son who had once been kidnapped by RG forcing Kabir to unfollow this case. RG and Shreya team up to kill Ananya and Kabir. In all this conspiracy Ronnie gets killed instead and Maanav realizes that this game is way more dangerous and gets scared. It is later revealed after investigation by Kabir and his colleagues and his stringer, that Shreya suffered from split Bipolar disorder and is still on its medication, which is revealed to the world and Shreya is fired from KKN. With the help of Maanav, Kabir gets sting operation done on Shreya and RG and truth is revealed to the world about conspiracy against Sudhir Kashyap and served justice.

The elegant Queen Anne Victorian was built c. 1832, and extensively altered in the 1880s by David Straw to achieve its present appearance. An electrical fire in 2004 did extensive damage to the building, but it has been largely restored to its 1880s appearance. Its walls feature artwork by the itinerant 19th-century artist Moses Eaton. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Straw House is located at a bend in Golda Court, a residential side street in the main village of Guilford, Maine. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled slate roof, wraparound single-story porch, and three story octagonal tower with a conical slate roof. The walls are finished in a variety of materials including clapboards, decorative cut shingles, and half-timbering. The house was built c. 1830 by John Monroe, and was purchased in 1832 by David Straw, a lawyer who, along with his son David Jr., established one of Maine's first textile mills in 1865. Around 1836 Straw commissioned the itinerant artist Moses Eaton to add stenciled artwork to some of its walls. The building was greatly enlarged in 1894, at which time it acquired its Victorian features, including the tower. In 1976 the property was opened as the Trebor Mansion Inn. The house was damaged by a lightning-struck tree in 1991, and was virtually gutted by an electrically-started fired on January 24, 2004. The restoration of the property to its original condition included fabrication of custom windows, and sourcing of slate for the roof from the same quarry that had provided the original. The Eaton stencilwork was discovered during restoration, and was conserved with assistance from the Maine Historical Society.

It is one of the biggest shopping malls in Paris' inner city. A mix between a department store and a shopping mall, Beaugrenelle is home to 120 shops and restaurants. Another landmark close to the mall is the 37.73-foot high replica of the Statue of Liberty, a gift from the USA to France in 1889.  History  Beaugrenelle Paris‚Äô story began in the 1970s with the development of a new neighborhood. The first Beaugrenelle shopping mall, which opened in 1979, was an integral part of a residential complex built in the typical brutalist style of the time. By 1999, the shopping mall was in decline, consequently a complete renovation project was launched in 2003 by the new owner Gecina. The architecture was largely responsible for this slow, irreversible decline. The neighborhood had been designed according to a utopian vision particular to France: in the 1960s and 1970s, urban planners believed that functional areas, such as shops and living spaces, should be elevated and separated from the traffic. This functionalism also lay behind the design of La D√©fense, La Part Dieu in Lyon and other new towns, and was based on the sanitary principles laid out in the Athens Charter. \\"France, being absolutist and excessively theoretical, was the only country to apply this new type of urban planning concept to the letter,\\" notes Denis Valode. When the decision was taken to redevelop the mall, Apsys, won the competition. Located in France and Poland since 1996, Apsys, an investor-developer, manages a portfolio of 31 shopping centres and pilot 6 projects under development. Its project was to demolish the existing center, extend its perimeter, incorporate it into the city and bring it down to the Seine. Ten years later, Beaugrenelle Paris opened its doors on 23 October 2013.  Architecture   Buildings  Designed by Valode & Pistre, a Paris-based architecture firm known for designing and building Renault Technocentre and Incity Tower in Lyon, the shopping mall extends over six floors. One hundred and twenty stores and restaurants are spread over 50,000 m2 of fashion retail space, divided into three buildings: Magnetic, Panoramic and City. The Magnetic and Panoramic buildings are linked by a covered pedestrian bridge, creating a gateway to the 15th arrondissement from the River Seine. One of the special architectural features of the Beaugrenelle mall is the exoskeleton walkway, an external steel skeleton wrapped round a glass tube. Its form is reminiscent of its illustrious neighbors: the Eiffel Tower and Bir-Hakeim bridge. The mall's main construction materials are metal, resin, double glazing and lacquered metal, giving the building a modern and futuristic atmosphere. Denis Valode and Jean Pistre wanted the mall \\"to fit in with the neighborhood's architectural history, continuing the style of the metal frame architecture of the Bir- Hakeim viaduct and the Eiffel Tower, which are both close by\\". Metal was therefore the obvious material for the latticing framing the building islands and enclosing the walkways. Light is present everywhere thanks to the glass walls and the blue glass dome capping the atrium.  Atrium  The two atria are illuminated by skylights, filling the shopping mall's six floors with natural daylight. Each atrium is covered in a metallic glass roof which changes color according to the time of day and the light conditions, ranging from cooler shades during the day to warmer ones at night. A matching blue mobile, designed by the French artist Xavier Veilhan, adorns one of the atria and creates a link between retail and culture. The 'Grand Mobile' is 15 meters high and was originally created for the Dynamo exhibition at the Grand Palais in 2013.  Cinema  Beaugrenelle Paris is also home to a 10-screen movie theater Path√© designed by the French designer Ora-√Øto. His approach was to engage the senses. The undulating lines on the ceilings and floors help to guide through the various spaces. Strong, contemporary colors, such as ‚ÄòPath√©‚Äô yellow and gray are used throughout, and combined with natural wood. Ora-√Øto also used white and yellow Corian for the ticket counters and service areas.  Green Roof  Sustainability was one of the main concerns regarding the construction of the building. Considering the risks to biodiversity in cities, the architects decided to develop a green roof. Measuring 7,000 m2, it is the biggest green roof in Paris. The roof is home to 40,000 plant species irrigated by rainwater, bees and birds, which benefit from a partnership concluded with the French league for the protection of birds (LPO). The bees are kept in six hives on the roof, producing 50‚Äì100 kg of honey a year. A 700 m2 community garden allows local inhabitants to take care of their production. Beaugrenelle is the first shopping mall to have double environmental certification: HQE1 and Level 2 BREEAM (rated 'Very Good').  Stores  There are 120 shops and restaurants in the mall.  Fashion & more  Beaugrenelle Paris is a mix between a department store and a shopping mall. Its three theme-oriented buildings are home to 61 dedicated fashion outlets, selling everything from high street to luxury brands. There are stores dedicated to women's, men's and children's fashions, as well as lingerie, footwear, jewelry and leather goods. The mall also includes 10 stores dedicated to beauty and well-being products, 12 devoted to household items, and 14 that sell cultural and leisure goods. In addition, Beaugrenelle offers some brands that don't usually feature in shopping malls, such as Guerlain and Baccarat.  Restaurants & bars  The shopping mall also features 11 restaurants and 8 snack bars. A wide range of cuisine from all over the world, including Mexican, Italian, French, Lebanese and Japanese is available. A centralized tax refund service, free Wi-Fi, tourist information, personal shopper and hotel delivery are some of the services available.  Access  Metro lines 6 and 10 have stops close to the mall (10 Javel, 10 Charles Michel and 6 Bir Hakeim), as well as the suburban train line, RER C. There are also a variety of buses that stop here. In addition, the mall has an Autolib station (electric cars), a Velib station (bicycles) and 1100 parking spaces. The Batobus river bus service also have a stop at Beaugrenelle.  Events  Beaugrenelle Paris organizes events every year. The Nuit Blanche event on 6‚Äì7 October 2012 gave visitors an opportunity to visit a work-in-progress site that previously wasn't open to the public. As part of this event, Beaugrenelle hosted an installation, Lumi√®res en vibration by the Argentinian artist Julio Le Parc, featuring various sensory experiences. In 2015 the mall participated to the International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. Named \\"Think Big\\" an exhibition of 16 works of art was displayed in the mall.

Current Phantom drones   Phantom 4 Pro  DJI Phantom 4 Pro, released in November 2016, has a three-axis stabilized camera with a 1-inch 20 MP CMOS sensor. It upgrades its obstacle avoidance with five directional sensors. The Phantom 4 Pro offers two remote controllers, one with a dedicated screen (Phantom 4 Pro+) and one without. It integrates an upgraded Lightbridge HD video transmission system that adds 5.8 GHz transmission support and a maximum downlink video transmission range of 7 km. In addition - DJI released a set of Goggles, which can be used with various DJI equipment, including the Phantom 4 Pro, to allow for First Person View (FPV) flying.  Phantom 4 Advanced  Announced on April 13, 2017, the Phantom 4 Advanced uses the same camera sensor as the Phantom 4 Pro. Designed to replace the original Phantom 4, the Phantom 4 Advanced uses the 2.4GHz frequency band, the rear vision sensors and two infrared sensors in the FlightAutonomy system in comparison to the Phantom 4 Pro model. It was shipped on April 30, 2017. It June 2017 it was priced in line with the original Phantom 4.  Phantom 4 Pro Obsidian  Announced at the 2017 IFA trade show, it gives the option to have the Phantom 4 Pro painted in obsidian black. Some build quality upgrades are included with the camera gimbal being made of magnesium.  Phantom 4 Pro V2.0  The DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0, announced in May 2018, improves on the existing Phantom 4 Pro with an OcuSync transmission system, improved ESCs and low-noise propellers. It was relaunched in January 2020. It uses the same camera as the first iteration of the Phantom 4 Pro. This edition also features expanded Flight Autonomy with 5-direction obstacle sensing and 4-direction obstacle avoidance. The 6-camera navigation system means the aircraft can avoid obstacles in its flight path, whilst flying at speeds of up to 31 mph. It's also the very first DJI drone to feature an infrared sensing system. Phantom 4 RTK The DJI Phantom 4 RTK, released in October 2018, was designed for extremely accurate aerial mapping using real-time kinematic positioning. In addition to RTK, it uses a redundant GNSS module, installed to maintain flight stability in signal-poor regions such as dense cities.  Legacy Phantom drones   Phantom 4  The Phantom 4, released in March 2016, introduces the iconic white body Phantom 4 series design and a safer and better quick release propeller system. It also improves usability by adding obstacle avoidance and an ability to track subjects (ActiveTrack), thanks to its five sensors. Some of its features include GPS, GLONASS, sonar, five separate safety sensors, a camera gimbal, gyroscope, and more. It is slightly bigger and heavier than the Phantom 3 due to a larger battery, but it still maintains a longer flight time and greater top speed. It has a top speed of in 'sport mode'. The controller and camera are very similar to Phantom 3 Pro The maximum video transmission technology on the Phantom 4 is same as the ones on Phantom 3 Pro and Adv, which is Lightbridge 2, it has a maximum FCC flying range of 5 km. On April 13, 2017 DJI announced the launch of the Phantom 4 Advanced and the end of the Phantom 4's lifespan for April 30, 2017.  Phantom 3  The Phantom 3, released in April 2015, adds built- in lightbridge downlink, that gives the controller a maximum range of 4800 meters (3 miles), and the visual positioning system, that allows the Phantom 3 to better maintain its position at lower altitudes and even indoors where GPS is weak or unavailable. The remote for Professional and Advanced models also has 2 antennas. There are five models of the Phantom 3: = Professional = Records in 4K, and includes a 100 W fast charger. Remote Controller with [optional HDMI out] and USB in for tablets and smartphones to connect to the controller. A bigger clamp also allows this remote to hold up to a 9.7inch iPad. = Advanced = Records in 2.7K and includes a 57 W charger. Remote Controller with optional HDMI out and USB in for tablets and smartphones to connect to controller. The remote also is big enough to hold a 9.7 inch iPad. = Standard = The Standard was released in August 2015. It features 2.7K video recording. The standard is the basic model without lightbridge, instead it uses WiFi to transmit video and telemetry with a limited range compared to the Advanced and Professional models, and no vision positioning systems. It includes features, as the other models do, such as Point of Interest, Follow Me, GPS Waypoints, Course Lock and Home Lock. For higher end needs one has to select a Phantom 4 model. = 4K = The 4K was released in early 2016. Although both the controller and the aircraft appear to look similar to the Phantom 3 Advanced/Professional, the system is very much like the Phantom 3 Standard in that it uses 5.8 GHz for control and uses a 2.4 GHz wifi signal for FPV and telemetry. The range is slightly improved. The controller lacks HDMI / USB ports. The aircraft includes the Visual Positioning System module seen on the Professional/Advanced models. = SE = The SE was originally released in China and for several months was unavailable elsewhere in the world. It became available in North America in August 2017. It was aptly named a \\"Special Edition\\" as it is unlike any other aircraft in the Phantom line. Although DJI claims it uses \\"improved ... Wifi\\", the system between the controller and the aircraft is more like DJI's Lightbridge signals. The controller converts the data to wifi to allow communication with a mobile device without an attached cable. The active antennas on the controller which communicate with the Phantom are patch antennas hidden inside the controller - one is strictly for transmission and the other is strictly for receiving - which is how the Lightbridge system works. The visible antenna on the outside of the controller is used only to communicate with the mobile device. It has a maximum transmission range of up to 2.5 mi (4 km) in FCC mode, and it has a 4K video camerahttps://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-phantom-3-se-now-available- in-select-markets-worldwidehttps://www.dji.com/phantom-3-se/info?lang=cn#specs = Vision+ = The Phantom 2 Vision+ In the fall of 2014, the Phantom 2 Vision+ V3.0 was released which included significant improvements such as more powerful 2312/960kv motors vs 2212/920kv, better designed motor internals - such as the double-layer single-wire stator for improved efficiency, impact resistant motor bearings, dial on controller to adjust gimbal pitch, rechargeable lipo battery upgrade on controller, a trainer port on controller, enclosed water-resistant compass with thicker insulated cable, extra shielding for the GPS module, new 9450 prop upgrade (from 9443), prop threads changed from metal to composite (less risk of spin-off), harder less-flexible props. Later releases of the 3.0 included an aerated wifi module case to aid in cooling for reduced failure rate and upgraded ESC v2.1 (featuring 4.06 firmware vice the older 4.02 firmware). The Phantom 2 Vision+, released in July 2014, added a three-axis stabilizer. It had a slightly increased range. It included the same FC200 camera as the earlier released Phantom 2 Vision, but in a completely different enclosure. The wifi module was moved from the camera case to the aircraft's centerboard which unfortunately weakened the aircraft's ability to receive GPS relative to the P2V due to EMF emanating from the module. The wifi patch antennas were moved from the camera case to the sides of the aircraft on either side of the battery. It received a no-fly zone software-implanted, warning the user of places where not to fly. (ex. airports).  Phantom 2  The Phantom 2 The Phantom 2 Vision The (straight) Phantom 2 was released in December 2013 after the Phantom 2 Vision. It uses 2.4 GHz for control and doesn't include a camera. A Zenmuse gimbal could be purchased with the Phantom 2, or it could be added later. The Zenmuse gimbal was made to hold cameras such as the GoPro. Upgrades over the original Phantom include auto-return, increased flight speed, increased flight time and controllable range, increased battery capacity, smartphones, tablets and even some smart glasses compatibility, Wi-Fi module and is available in different performances. Its configuration allows users to remotely tilt the camera and adjust its orientation on two axes for a better level shot. = Vision = Released in October 2013,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlHwhaoUx4g it was the first of the Phantom 2 series to be released, and featured significant upgrades over the original Phantom. It included a one-dimensional gimbal and an HD camera with a 4 GB micro SD card, a built-in anti-vibration mount, advanced Wi-Fi module, a GPS-enabled position holding, return-to-home capability, an improved Naza flight control system, and self-tightening propellers. It is compatible with a ground station and iOS or Android devices. It was the first DJI aircraft to be released with the \\"Intelligent Li-Po battery\\" which enabled flight times of almost 20 minutes. It also featured a \\"Range Extender\\" device on the controller which worked as a relay for the wifi FPV signal between the aircraft and the controller, thereby increasing signal strength and range. = FC40 = The Phantom FC40 The Phantom (Flying Camera) FC40, was an upgrade from the Phantom 1 as it included a gimbal-less camera. The aircraft used 5.8 GHz for control allowing 2.4 GHz to be used for wifi FPV. It is equipped with an iOS/Android app control, Wi-Fi and GPS modules. Using a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connection, it helps its pilot follow in real time via aerial pictures on a mobile device. However, FPV range was limited by the signal strength of the mobile device as the connection between the two was direct. The camera angle is manually set before the flight. The mount can also be used to attached a GoPro camera to the unit as well.  Phantom 1  The Phantom 1, originally known as Phantom, was released in January 2013. It was commonly equipped with a GoPro camera for amateur filmmaking or photography. Its battery life was around 10 minutes with a GoPro. Uses Lithium Polymer batteries. The Phantom 1  Applications  Example aerial video of Snowdonia filmed with a DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ quadcopter Several segments of industry are open to commercial use including drone journalism, hurricane hunting, 3-D landscape mapping, nature protection, farming, search and rescue, aircraft inspection, tornado chasing, and lava lake exploration. Drones are also in entertainment and business. The Fox Broadcasting Company used Phantom 2 Vision+'s to promote 24 during San Diego Comic-Con International 2014. The DJI Phantom has been allegedly used by ISIS in Syria and Iraq to scout, plan for battle, and drop grenades on enemy troops.

Drones have made dramatic appearances at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) for several years. Reception of drones generally A drone enthusiast community called SkyPixel has been created to help drone users. Worldwide, drones are the subject of regulations for safety. For example, a number of incidents - such as a Phantom crash landing at the White House, has prompted authorities in the USA (FAA), the UK (Civil Aviation Authority) and Europe (EASA) to ban them in some locations (including airports) or regulate their use and require permits for commercial operators. 2015 Tokyo Drone Incident led to wide-reaching changes to regulations on drones in Japan. However, in the USA the FAA has granted exemptions for production in Hollywood, aerial surveillance, construction site monitoring, crop scouting in agriculture and photography in real estate.  Market Trends  In 2017, the U.S. FAA estimated 'hobbyist' drones reaching between 2.75 million and 4.5 million units by 2021. As of 2018, DJI controlled an estimated 74% of the global consumer drone market, with no other company controlling more than 5%.

It was first described by the American zoologist Thomas Say in 1840. It is a common species with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description This damselfly ranges in length between about . Most males have a blue thorax, the plates being separated by a few black lines, and also have a color-tipped abdomen, segments eight, nine and ten being bright blue. The remaining segments are dark brown. However the color of the thorax of Argia apicalis is variable and some males can be greyish-black rather than blue. They can change from one phase to the other and back again over the course of several days, with several intervening variations on the way; neither color phase seems to be particularly related to age or sexual maturity. Females exhibit three thoracic color phases: brown, turquoise and grayish-black. Again the phase change often takes place in steps, and none of the phases seems to be associated with a particular age or state of maturity. Distribution Argia apicalis has a wide distribution in North America, its range extending from Ontario in Canada, across the United States except for the extreme southwest, to the state of Nuevo Le√≥n in Mexico. It inhabits a range of habitats including near large and small rivers, streams, lakes and ponds, but is most common in the vicinity of large, muddy rivers. Though it is usually found in woodland, it also occurs in treeless areas. Behavior In tandem Adults are on the wing from mid-summer onwards. Males often patrol small territories over water but females only visit water when ready to mate. Copulation soon follows the arrival of the female, and the pair flies around the pond in tandem, investigating sites for egg-laying. The female begins ovipositing while still linked to the male and often continues to lay after he has flown off. The eggs are laid in mats of willow roots, among floating driftwood, on bits of floating board and on living, but horizontal, Helenium stems. By this time, the male is no longer aggressive towards other males, and several females use the same sites for egg deposition. This species has been much studied, and its behavior is fairly typical of damselfly behavior. The adults hatched over an extended period and first appeared at a study site in Oklahoma in mid-summer. Males visited water on about 40% of their adult days while females merely did so on 20%, both spending the rest of the time elsewhere, mostly in woods. The males arrived at water earlier in the day than females and start patrolling areas, stationing themselves about 2 metres (6 ft) from adjoining males. They darted at invaders and successfully drove them off in most instances although no physical contact occurred. Peak activity was around midday. The arrival of a female in the patrolled territory was greeted with immediate copulation lasting about 16 minutes, with no preliminary display or courtship. There followed a phase of 25 minutes while they explored the pond, an ovipositing phase with the pair in tandem lasting about 60 minutes followed by a further 20 minute egg-laying period by the female alone. Females avoided further sexual activity by flying rapidly away. Marked males had an apparent life expectancy of about 8 days and females 7, though the oldest marked male lived for 33 days. By late afternoon, all the damselflies had departed.

History An iron mission church was opened in 1875, and a parish was assigned out of Holy Trinity Church, Bordesley. The foundation stone for the permanent church on Cooksey Road was laid on 15 September 1882. It was built to the designs of A.E. Dempster and the contractor was Barnsley and Sons, Rylands Street North, Birmingham.The Building News and Engineering Journal, Volume 43. 1882. p368. The nave, north transept and north aisle opened on 28 July 1883. Part of the parish was taken in 1924 to form a new parish for St Gregory the Great's Church, Small Heath. All Saints‚Äô was badly damaged in an air raid during the Second World War and demolished shortly afterwards. The name of All Saints has re-emerged in Small Heath as during the 1990s a re-organisation of churches in Small Heath was undertaken, and St Aidan‚Äôs, St Gregory‚Äôs, St Andrew‚Äôs and St Oswald‚Äôs were amalgamated. The new parish decided to retain only St Aidan‚Äôs Church building, and in 1998 this was renamed All Saints.
