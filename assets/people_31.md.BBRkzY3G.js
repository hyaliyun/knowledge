Design The cartridge is a de novo design and was constructed to outperform popular hunting cartridges like the .30-06 Springfield and 7.92√ó57mm Mauser. When compared with the .30-06 Springfield the .30 R Blaser features an equal maximum chamber pressure of 405 MPa (58,740 psi) piezo pressure - which is fairly high for a rimmed rifle cartridge - but more cartridge case capacity, allowing the use of more propellant. The .30 R Blaser performance does however not reach the power level of .30 caliber magnum cartridges like the .300 Winchester Magnum that feature more cartridge case capacity and higher maximum chamber pressure levels. As a rimmed cartridge the .30 R Blaser is designed for use in break action rifles such as double rifles and combination guns as well as for single shot rifles such as the falling block action rifles. Break action rifles using rimless .30 caliber chamberings like .308 Winchester or .30-06 Springfield can be fairly easy rechambered for the .30 R Blaser. The cartridge was commercially introduced in 1992 by Blaser Jagdwaffen (Blaser hunting weapons) and RWS ammunition. As of 2009, RWS is its only manufacturer. Cartridge dimensions The .30 R Blaser has 4.94 ml (76 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in break action rifles. 400px .30 R Blaser maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm). Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ‚âà 20.01 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 305 mm (1 in 12 in), 4 grooves, √ò lands = 7.62 mm, √ò grooves = 7.82 mm, land width = 4.47 mm and the primer type is large rifle or large rifle magnum depending on the load. According to the official with C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente Pour L'Epreuve Des Armes A Feu Portative) guidelines the .30 R Blaser case can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.C.I.P. TDCC datasheet .30 R Blaser This means that .30 R Blaser chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries are currently (2013) proof tested at PE piezo pressure. Contemporary use The versatility of the .30 R Blaser for hunting all kinds of American and European game and the availability of several factory loadsRWS centerfire rifle cartridges and the fact that it uses standard .30 caliber projectiles all attribute to the .30 R Blaser chambering popularity in break action hunting rifles. Loaded with short light bullets it can be used on small European game like fox or medium game such as roe deer and chamois. Loaded with longer heavy bullets it can be used on medium and big European game like wild boar, fallow deer, red deer, moose and brown bear. The .30 R Blaser offers good penetrating ability due to a fast enough twist rate to enable it to fire relatively long, heavy bullets with a high sectional density. The (former) legal banning of (ex) military service cartridges in countries like Belgium, Italy and France, makes that the .30 R Blaser can be used for hunting in such jurisdictions.

Plot Steve Giardino, an abrasive, workaholic Wall Streeter, and his wife Jackie divorce after twenty-six years of marriage and find themselves thrust back into the dating world in middle age and in search of a new life. Steve's fellow trader, Mel Arons, likes being single and chasing women, encouraging Steve to join him, with disastrous results at first. Jackie, starved for affection, is at first thrilled by the romantic interest of a man called Doc, only to end up smothered by his attentions and in desperate need of some private space. Unwilling to stop smoking and drinking or to eat properly, Steve has a mild heart attack. He ends up falling for his doctor, Kay Hutton, but a rift develops when he insists that he is too old to father her children and begin a new family. Cast * Alan Alda as Steve * Hal Linden as Mel * Ann-Margret as Jackie * John Shea as Doc * Veronica Hamel as Kay * Mary Kay Place as Donna Reception The film received mostly positive reviews upon its release. Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times: \\"A film of Mr. Alda's is guaranteed to make you feel 10 years older, no matter what age you were when you went in. That's not entirely a negative thing, since it does have its soothing side. The middle-aged audience that made The Four Seasons a hit obviously enjoyed the feeling of recognition that comes with Mr. Alda's work, and that same audience may like the equally predictable A New Life [...] almost as well.\\"New York Times Roger Ebert stated: \\"Like ‚ÄúFour Seasons,‚Äù his debut as a writer-director, ‚ÄúA New Life‚Äù is Alda‚Äôs version of various rites of passage. His ambition is not to bring anything new or revealing to his subject matter, but to see it as it is. If you told him you recognized all of the characters, that would be a compliment. The result is a little hard to evaluate. Alda‚Äôs purpose is to show us fairly typical people going through fairly typical things. They live, we watch. On that voyeuristic level, the movie works.\\"Chicago Sun-Times In one notable review from The Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, \\"There's nothing tricky to Alan Alda: no Eddie Murphy worship-me complex, no Woody Allen navel- contemplating, no Steve Martin I'm-brilliant-watch-me-dance routines. He's just a witty Mr. Nice Guy, all positive reinforcement and sincerity. In \\"A New Life,\\" which he wrote and directed and stars in, for a change Alda doesn't play a self-righteous lib a\` le Martin Sheen, which is refreshing. And though \\"New Life's\\" premise‚Äîthe tribulations of a male divorce' -- is hardly groundbreaking, its safe confines provide Alda ample room for his engaging brand of sitcom repartee. [...] Steve has passed the singles physical. Now it's time to try the married version, full of all those b-words‚Äîbirthing, breathing, bonding. How he fares is hardly nail-biting fare, but it leaves you with a favorable impression of Alda‚Äîeven if his openly bleeding heart has made you cringe in the past.\\"Washington Post In another such review, Rita Kempley wrote: \\"Quick, somebody cancel Alan Alda's subscription to Ms. The Schwarzenegger of sensitivity is at it again, razing our consciousness with \\"A New Life,\\" the story of an insensitivo who turns into a giving guy.

Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Background He was born about 1458, second son of Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare and Joan FitzGerald, daughter of James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond.Fitzgerald, Walter. \\"The Fitzgeralds of Lackagh\\", Journal of the Co. Kildare Archaeological Society and Surrounding Districts, Vol. 1, County Kildare Archaeological Society, Kildare, 1895 He married Elizabeth Preston, daughter of Robert Preston, 1st Viscount Gormanston and Janet Molyneux. Through his eldest daughter, Margaret, who married Garrett Wellesley, he was an ancestor of the Duke of Wellington. He resided at Laccagh (the modern spelling of the placename is Lackagh) near Monasterevin, County Kildare, and despite his rebellion against the Crown his descendants were able to retain their estates. Lord Chancellor He became Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1484. After the downfall of the Yorkist dynasty, the new King Henry VII confirmed him in office, but his loyalty to the new regime was deeply suspect. The Anglo-Irish nobility were in general strongly Yorkist in sympathy, while the Fitzgeralds of Kildare were willing to back either the Yorkist or the Tudor dynasty to advance their own power: Henry VII is said to have remarked that they would crown an ape to secure their position. Thomas's father, and his eldest brother Gerald, \\"the Great Earl\\", reached a position of almost absolute power in Ireland, a state tolerated by successive English Kings. Lambert Simnel Lambert Simnel in Ireland In 1487 the impostor Lambert Simnel, who claimed to be Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick, rightful heir of the House of York, appeared in Ireland, in the company of a priest called Richard Symonds, and appealed to the Irish nobility for military aid to gain the English Crown. Simnel bore a strong resemblance to the real Warwick, who was in fact a prisoner in the Tower of London, where he remained until his execution in 1499. Thomas and his brother Gerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, were among Simnel's strongest supporters and were present at his coronation in Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. Thomas resigned the Chancellorship and recruited a force of some 4500 soldiers, including both Old Irish and Anglo- Irish, to supplement a troop of Continental mercenaries sent by the real Warwick's aunt, Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy.Otway-Rurthven, A.

Roderick The Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland 2 Volumes London 1870 His brother was more fortunate: Henry showed remarkable clemency to the surviving rebels, including Kildare, who received a royal pardon, and to Simnel himself, who was given a job in the royal kitchens, and later promoted to the office of Falconer. The Fitzgeralds retained their predominance in Irish politics for another 50 years: another reported remark of King Henry VII was that if all Ireland could not rule the Earls of Kildare, then they must rule all Ireland. However his son Henry VIII came in time to take a very different view: by 1540 the Kildare Fitzgeralds had been ruthlessly crushed, although they later regained some of their old influence.

Following the release of Time Taunts Me, Picker moved back to North Carolina and assembled a band drawn from the University of North Carolina's orchestral program and the pool of players connected with Trekky Records.  All Alone in an Empty House and signing to ANTI-Records  All Alone in an Empty House was originally released on Trekky Records in 2008. The band signed to ANTI-Records on March 1, 2010 and their new label re-released the album on August 10 that year. Reviewing the record, Bob Boilen of NPR said, \\"Take a pinch of the brilliance found in classical music and mix it with [Picker's] own. Lost in the Trees is orchestral folk where the \\"orchestral\\" part isn't an afterthought. This is mighty potent stuff.\\" Keelan H. from Sputnik Music said, \\"Right from the swelling strings of six-minute opener ‚ÄúEmpty House‚Äù, it‚Äôs clear that Lost in the Trees don‚Äôt take their ‚Äúorchestral folk‚Äù label lightly.\\" Time Taunts Me was reissued by Trekky Records on February 4, 2011 with the addition of previously unreleased tracks.  A Church That Fits Our Needs  Emma Nadeau playing accordion at SXSW Music Festival. On March 20, 2012, ANTI- Records released A Church That Fits Our Needs, Lost in the Trees' second record with the label. Picker based the album largely on his mother's suicide in 2008, stating that \\"I wanted to give my mother a space to become all the things I think she deserved to be and wanted to be, and all the beautiful things in her that didn't quite shine while she was alive.\\" Rolling Stone said of the album, \\"Ari Picker tries to make sense of his mother's suicide against a backdrop of rich orchestration, piled generously atop a base of delicate acoustic folk like heaping spoonfuls of vanilla frosting.\\" PopMatters said \\"A Church That Fits Our Needs bursts with the same melodic interplay that makes later Radiohead extraordinary.\\" A Church That Fits Our Needs peaked at No. 9 on Billboard's Heatseeker's Albums.

It was adapted for the cinema in 1921 by Jos√© Buchs, in 1935 as Paloma Fair by Benito Perojo and in 1963 by Jos√© Luis S√°enz de Heredia. The work premiered in Madrid in 1894 with the cast including Emilio Mesejo (Juli√°n), Luisa Campos (Susana), Leocadia Alba (Se√±√° Rita), Don Jos√© Mesejo (tabernero), Manolo Rodr√≠guez (Don Hilari√≥n) and Irene Alba (Casta). The cast was more of actors than singers. The zarzuela's great success for the authors led quickly to a debut in South America where it premiered the same year in Buenos Aires, with a cast including Rogelio Ju√°rez (Don Hilari√≥n), Eliseo San Juan (Juli√°n), Clotilde Perales (Susana), Carmen Ciudad (Casta), Antonia Garc√≠a de Videgain (Se√±√° Rita), Salvador Videgain (Tabernero) and Isabel L√≥pez (T√≠a Antonia). The ambassador of Spain in Argentina recalled all the artistic staff at the premieres in the capital of Buenos Aires in 1894, confirming that La Verbena premiered three months apart in three theaters, the most popular version being the first one in which that took part the Videgain family.

Scene 1 takes place in a square in front of a tavern where people are having separate conversations. Don Hilari√≥n and Don Sebasti√°n discuss the consumption of various products (El aceite de ricino ya no es malo de tomar.). The Tabernero is playing cards with two friends. A man and a woman holding a baby comment on the heat and the baby sleeping. Juli√°n is complaining to Se√±√° Rita that he saw Susanna in a coach and felt she was with a man even though Susanna told him later she was with her sister. After Don Sebasti√°n leaves, Don Hilari√≥n thinks about his planned romantic encounter with Susana and Casta (Tiene raz√≥n don Sebasti√°n). Scene 2 takes place on a street in the barrio de la Latina. A crowd including Susana, Casta and T√≠a Antonia, have gathered around to hear a flamenco singer sing En Chiclana me cri√©. T√≠a Antonia interrupts the singer praising her performance; Susana and Casta try to calm her down. Members of the crowd comment favourably about the performance. After the singing, Susana tells T√≠a Antonia and Casta of her falling out with Juli√°n. Don Hilari√≥n meets the women and they enter a caf√© together. Before entering the caf√©, the Tabernero tells friends that Juli√°n wants to confront Susana over their break up. Next Juli√°n and Se√±√° Rita arrive outside the caf√© where Se√±√° Rita asks Juli√°n what he intends to do (Ya est√°s frente a la casa. ¬øY ahora qu√© vas a hacer?). Juli√°n sees Don Hilari√≥n leaving with Susana, Casta and T√≠a Antonia, and greets him. He then asks Susana where she is going in fancy clothing (¬øD√≥nde vas con mant√≥n de Manila? ¬øD√≥nde vas con vestido chin√©?). Susana gives him a mocking reply which inflames his jealousy. Juli√°n then tries to attack Don Hilari√≥n. The Tabernero and others exit the caf√© to stop the altercation. The crowd disperses after two policemen arrive. Juli√°n tries to pursue Don Hilari√≥n and Susana. Scene 3 occurs in a street in the city centre where couples are dancing. Don Sebasti√°n is enjoying the evening with friends and family, and greets Don Hilari√≥n when he arrives. The latter goes inside because of the cold; he is shaken from his prior encounter with Juli√°n. Juli√°n arrives looking for Don Hilari√≥n and Susana, and briefly mistakes another couple for them. He then has an altercation with T√≠a Antonia who is with her nieces Susana and Casta. An inspector and two policemen appear on scene to question the participants in the disturbance. During questioning, T√≠a Antonia gets into an argument with the inspector and threatens to attack Juli√°n. Two policemen take her away. When Juli√°n tells the inspector he is willing to go to jail, Susana surprises him by saying she would go with him. Don Sebasti√°n presents himself to the inspector to vouch for Juli√°n's good character. The inspector knows Don Sebasti√°n, so decides to dismiss the matter. However, Juli√°n has found Don Hilari√≥n and chases him onto the street, shocking Don Sebasti√°n and others. Don Sebasti√°n expresses understanding when Juli√°n says Don Hilari√≥n was stealing his girl. The inspector requests that there be no more disturbances that evening. Juli√°n and Susana reconcile. Everyone goes back to celebrating the festival.

An inspirational central midfielder, Proctor featured for Croydon/Charlton Athletic on the club level. Club career Proctor represented England at tennis as a youngster, but decided to play football after a break from sport as a teenager. With Croydon, Proctor won the Premier League three times and the FA Women's Cup twice, before Croydon came under the auspices of Charlton Athletic in 2000. She quit Charlton for Brighton in December 2001, in the aftermath of a huge squad bust-up. However, Charlton invoked a ruling which left a \\"distraught\\" Proctor unable to play for Brighton until the following season. The move to struggling Brighton - Proctor was the England captain at the time - was reported as evidence of the enduring amateurism in English women's football. Proctor clarified that her decision was related to her career outside football, having secured a job in the leisure industry which required weekend working. She returned to action for Brighton in 2002-03, but The Seagulls were relegated after winning just one game all season. International career Although not selected for the FIFA Women's World Cup 1995, Proctor played for England in the 1997 UEFA Women's Championship qualification campaign. In September 1996, Proctor started both legs of England's play-off defeat to Spain. Proctor was selected for the 2001 UEFA Women's Championship. She was named captain for England's final group game against Germany, when regular skipper Mo Marley was dropped following the 4-0 defeat to Sweden. After the retirement of several senior players, Proctor retained the captaincy for England's 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification campaign. Manager and former Croydon teammate Hope Powell valued Proctor's experience, stating \\"She is a good motivator and she has a very good relationship with the youngsters.\\" Proctor had missed a friendly against Denmark in August 2001 as she was on holiday on a Greek Island. In the run-up to England's first qualifier in Germany, Proctor had slept in a t-shirt commemorating the England male team's famous 5-1 win in Munich in a bid to bring luck. Despite a strong individual performance, Proctor's England were beaten 3-1 in Kassel. She started qualifiers against the Netherlands and Portugal, before dropping out of the side due to a recurring knee injury. For the return fixture with Portugal, an 18-year-old Fara Williams replaced Proctor in the line-up and scored a free-kick on her first international start. It was also reported that Proctor's protracted transfer from Charlton Athletic to Brighton had placed her international future in doubt. In July 2002 Proctor was recalled for a friendly with Nigeria at Carrow Road, winning her 20th cap. She subsequently withdrew from the squad from the qualification play-off games against Iceland and France due to the death of her mother.

The refinery was established in late 19th century becoming one of the biggest sugar emporiums in the island. It remained operational until 2003 becoming the last sugarcane refinery to cease operations on the island. History=Early years The Coloso origins begin in the 19th century, specifically towards the end of the 1820s when the Ca√±o de las Nasas estate was founded in Aguada. That estate functioned with a cattle-operated sugar mill producing approximately 100 sugar barrels a day. In the late 1860s, Emilio Vad√≠ acquired the estate and changed its name to Coloso. In 1875, he changed it into sugar cane refinery. Peak in operations Aerial view of the Coloso Refinery Upon turning Coloso into a sugarcane refinery, Emilio Vad√≠ mechanized most of the production process. As a result, he produced 1,000 sugar barrels a day. That name increased during the 1870s. In 1879, Vad√≠ made a partnership with German entrepreneur H. Kuster. Still, due to high debts and the crisis in the sugarcane industry in the late 19th century, Kuster & Vad√≠ sold Coloso to Jos√© Arnell Mass√≥ in 1897. After buying Central Coloso, Arnell Mass√≥ consolidated it with other refinery and sugar mills he had acquired between 1885 and 1895. He also transported the machinery from one of those refineries, Central Monserrate, to Coloso. As a result of this, Central Coloso ended up covering 4,370 acres, of which approximately 500 were cultivated annually. Coloso also processed sugar that other farmers grew. In 1902, a total of 20,000 sugar sacks were processed. During the peak crop time, workers at Coloso reached 1,500. In 1904, French investors acquired Coloso and incorporated it under the name of Sucrerie Centrale Coloso de Porto Rico. In 1915, it was bought by West Puerto Rico Sugar Company. In 1921, it became Central Coloso, Inc. At this point, it had around 291 acres. During the next decades, Coloso continued a program of expansion and modernization. In 1952, Coloso had a milling capacity of 5,000 tons of sugar daily. That year, sugar production peaked in the island. In 1961, Coloso reached the highest sugar production tonnage at 73,554 tons. Decline and privatization Central Coloso, Aguada, Puerto Rico The sugar industry started struggling towards the middle of the 20th century due to several reasons: high cost of production, declining sale prices, credit restrictions, and strikes among workers. Another factor was the industrialization of the island, which caused the shift of the local economy to move away from agriculture. Central Coloso continued to be administered as a private industry until 1972 when the Government of Puerto Rico leased it as part of a program to rehabilitate the sugarcane industry. In 1976, the government acquired Central Coloso through the Corporaci√≥n Azucarera de Puerto Rico. This agency was created with the purpose of developing, improving, and intensifying the industry. During the 1980s, most of the sugar mills and refineries in the island had ceased operations, but Coloso maintained a considerable production tonnage. In 1986, sugarcane production was handed down to private companies. In the 1990s, the government started implementing a program of privatization of the Corporaci√≥n Azucarera. In 1998, Coloso became the last operating sugarcane refinery in the island when Central Roig in Yabucoa ceased operations. After that, property and assets were transferred to private companies ending in 2000. Coloso continued to process limited sugarcane until 2003 when it officially ceased operations. Legacy Since 1999, Law #275 declared the Central Coloso industrial complex as a historic monument. In 2000, Law #142 declared the Coloso Valley where the refinery is located as an agricultural reserve. Both the refinery and the valley are currently property of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture.

This was a famous sailing race of the day, and was won by the yacht Atlantic which held the record for nearly a century In 1905 out of eleven contenders, it was won by the yacht Atlantic, which set a time record for the crossing the Atlantic ocean. The race was the subject of the 1905 silent film Start of Ocean Race for Kaiser's Cup, and the book, Atlantic: The Last Great Race of Princes. Second place was won by the yacht Hamburg. Third place went to the RSY Valhalla who despite being by far the largest participant, came in a respectable ‚Äò‚Äôeasy third‚Äô‚Äô. She crossed the Atlantic under sail in 14 days and 2 hours. The yacht Atlantic won the race with a time of 12 days and 4 hours. News of the race was published in the New York Times and the London Times newspapers. A report of the race was also published in the Los Angeles Herald newspaper. The Imperial German cruiser Pfeil greeted the competitors at the end of the race, and the yachts crossed between land and the ship. The Atlantic was captained by Charlie Barr and directed by navigator and tactician Frederick Maxfield Hoyt, who also helped design her and was sailed to victory with a clear lead and the next contender did not come in for another day. This was roughly a 3000 nautical mile race, and Atlantic had averaged about 10 knots across the ocean. The record for sailing monohull on this route stood until 2002. Some of the back history of this type of racing go back to the 1860s, when some sailing yacht clubs raced across the Atlantic ocean. So this kind of thing had some popularity, and yacht racing was also popular among European heads of state. In this case, the Kaiser of Germany wanted to sponsor a race of this type and his entry would be the yacht Hamburg (previously known as Rainbow). He put no restrictions size, rigging, and there was no handicap either. In this type of racing, it was done by a yacht and crew sponsored by the patron and they did not necessarily go on the voyage, rather their boats and ship crews were competed against each other. The yachts were not necessarily stripped down racers, but they were racing their yachts; one contender had amenities such as a grand piano with a dining room for 30, and fireplaces. Even the Atlantic, which was commissioned in 1903 was intended for taking the owner for trips around Europe- fast but also well equipped with steam heating and refrigeration, steam-powered winches, a mahogany interior, and three interior bathrooms supporting a crew of about 40. The race had 11 contenders with different types of sailing vessels. Contenders: *Ailsa *Apache * Atlantic * Endymion *Fleur de Lys *Hamburg *Hildegarde *Sunbeam * Thistle *Utowana *Valhalla Centenary The 2005 Rolex Transatlantic Challenge celebrated the 100th year anniversary of the race, and a new record was set by the Mari-Cha IV.

Shibell (August 14, 1841 ‚Äì October 21, 1908) was a teamster, miner, hotel owner, customs inspector, recorder, and Pima County, Arizona County Sheriff and a contemporary of Wyatt Earp and his brothers. Shibell promised a job as Deputy Sheriff to Earp, but when Earp announced his support for Bob Paul as the next sheriff, Shibell appointed Earp's antagonist Johnny Behan to the position instead. Personal life Charles Alexander Shibell was born on August 14, 1841 to George and Mary Agnes (Byrne) Shibbell in St. Louis, Missouri where he attended public school. He attended Iowa College (later renamed Grinnell College). In 1860, he left Iowa for Sacramento, California, where he got a job as a clerk in a general store. He later moved to the Southwest where he married Mercedes Sais Quiroz in 1868. Mercedes had been kidnapped as a child with Larcena Pennington Page in March 1860 by Apache Indians. She was later traded for Apache prisoners. Mercedes and Charles Shibell had four children: Mamie A., Lillie M., Charles B. and Mercedes A., before his wife died in 1876 at age 26. In 1877, Shibell married Nellie Norton and they had two children, Lionel J. and Orpha. Professional life In 1862, just as the Civil War was beginning, he joined Col. James H. Carleton's California Column. He worked as a civilian teamster and was with the Union forces when they re-captured Tucson, Arizona, from Confederate forces on May 20, 1862. He followed the force to the Rio Grande and remained there until January 1, 1863, when he returned to Tucson. He worked for the federal government transporting supplies from the headquarters at Tucson to Ft. Yuma. In 1864, the troops were ordered to the Rio Grande where they would be mustered out, and Shibell remained in Tucson. In June 1864, he went to work at the Cerro Colorado Mine as a silver miner about southwest of Tucson. In May 1865, he moved to the Sonoita River about south of Tubac, Arizona, participating in the cowboy business before operating his own cattle ranch. His ranch was repeatedly attacked by Apache Indians and he lost cattle on several occasions to the Indians, until two or three of his men were killed. Unable to withstand the Apache's attacks, he left the area in 1867 and returned to Tucson. He became a Customs Inspector for the next two years. He may have been a participant in the Camp Grant Massacre on April 30, 1871, during which 144 Aravaipas and Pinal Indians were killed and mutilated, almost all of them women and children. He then opened a stagecoach stop named Desert Station on the road northwest of Tucson which he maintained through 1872. He also resumed the teamster business that year between Tucson and Yuma. In 1874, Shibell, a lifelong Democrat, developed an interest in politics. In January 1875, he was appointed a Pima County Deputy Sheriff by Tucson Mayor William S. Oury and held the office for two years. He ran for Sheriff in 1876 and held that office for four years, until 1881. He was responsible for enforcing the law for 3,000 citizens spread out over on the extremely remote border with Mexico, a wide-open area on the edge of the American frontier. On August 19, 1878, Shibell and a citizen posse tracked Arizona and New Mexico Territory road-agent William Whitney Brazelton, who was suspected of repeated stagecoach robberies in the Tucson area, to a meeting place where he expected to receive supplies from a confederate named David Nemitz. Nemitz warned that Brazelton \\"would not be taken alive unless by artful strategy.\\" Shibell gave orders to shoot on sight if needed, and Brazelton was killed during the confrontation in a mesquite bosque along the Santa Cruz River approximately three miles south of Tucson. Shortly thereafter, Brazelton's body was photographed by pioneer Tucson photographer Henry Buehman and copies of these were available for sale to the general public. Additionally, John J. Valentine Sr. Wells, Fargo & Co. would, as a direct response to Brazelton's criminal actions in Pima County, send special agent and future sheriff of said county, Bob Paul, to investigate on their behalf.\\" Shibell was reelected Sheriff in 1878. On July 27, 1880, Shibell appointed Wyatt Earp Deputy Sheriff in Pima County, when Tombstone, Arizona was still part of Pima County, making Earp the primary law enforcement officer for most of eastern Pima County. Election overturned Shibell ran for reelection as Pima County Sheriff in the November 2, 1880, election against Republican Bob Paul. The region was strongly Republican and Paul was expected to win. Whoever won would likely appoint someone from the same political party. Republican Wyatt expected he would continue in the job. Shibell was supported in his reelection bid by a loosely organized federation of outlaw Cowboys, mostly Southerners, who strongly opposed Wyatt Earp and the Republicans generally. A cowboy in that time and region was generally regarded as an outlaw. Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers. Elections were held on November 2, and it was expected that Democrat Shibell would be defeated by Republican Bob Paul, who Wyatt had supported during the campaign. Shibell won the election by a 58-vote margin. On November 19, Bob Paul filed suit and accused Shibell of ballot-stuffing in the San Simon precinct, since the precinct delivered a 103 to 1 vote for Shibell in a precinct that contained only about 10 eligible voters. The trial was transferred to Tucson's district court and began in January 17. On January 20, 1881, the Arizona Star reported, \\"There has been some big cheating somewhere, and by some persons. It was clear that there had been reckless counting at Tombstone, fraud at San Simon and a careless election board at Tres Alamos.\\" A recount was held and this time Paul had 402 votes and Shibell had 354. Sixty- two were kept from a closer examination. James Johnson later testified for Bud Paul in the election hearing and said that the ballots had been left in the care of Democrat Phin Clanton. Meanwhile, a week after the election on November 9, 1880, Earp resigned. The position of undersheriff was now open, and Shibell immediately selected Democrat Johnny Behan to serve as Tombstone area undersheriff. In February 1881, the San Simon results were thrown out by the election commissioners, but Shibell filed an appeal. He was finally removed from office in April and replaced by Bob Paul. Operates hotels When his term as Sheriff ended, he bought and ran the Palace Hotel (later renamed the Occidental Hotel). In 1884, he opened a store until 1887 when he was once again appointed deputy sheriff under Sheriff Eugene O. Shaw. He was deputy sheriff until January 1, 1889. On February 22, 1888, Shibell along with U.S. Deputy Marshal William K. Meade and deputies pursued men suspected of robbing a Southern Pacific train deep into Mexico. When they finally notified Mexican authorities of their purpose in Mexico, they were arrested for entering the country illegally. It was during his second appointment as deputy sheriff that Shibell challenged an old friend, a former guide and scout for the U.S. Army named Albert Franklin Banta, the reputed discoverer of Meteor Crater, to track down a fugitive 900 miles into Old Mexico and back. He returned with his prisoner, saying he \\"had one horse shot; missed being assassinated three or four times, but I am here yet, telling the story.\\" In 1888, Shibell was elected as the Pima County Recorder, a position he held until 1902. Shibell died in Tucson on October 21, 1908.

First published in 1534 in conjunction with Desiderius Erasmus' treatise of the same name, Vives's work attempts to teach letter writers how to engage a variety of audiences. Background In 1533, Vives wrote De conscribendis epistolis for Alonso Idi√°quez, secretary to Emperor Charles V of Spain. On the surface, Vives sought to help Idi√°quez avoid what Vives saw as a popular misunderstanding of how successful letters should be written. Because this work was also published, it seems safe to assume Vives wanted to rectify the dictamen on a large scale. Since the early days of the Roman Empire, letter writers had attempted to apply the principles of oratory wholesale to epistolary composition. This approach remained popular well into the Renaissance. The result was a society of writers who did not observe practical decorum in their letters. Vives warns that it is easy for a writer to slip into \\"... impudence or arrogance or loquacity or ostentation or cunning or pedantic affectation or excessive and parasitical flattery or ignorance or imprudence.\\" The current authority on De conscribendis epistolis, Charles Fantazzi traces this epistolary renaissance to the rediscovery of Cicero‚Äôs letters to Atticus, Quintus Cicero, and Brutus. In 1345, these letters were found by Petrarch in the Chapter Library of Verona. Vives frequently cites Cicero as a prime example of a writer who tailored his letters according to the epistolary occasion. Synopsis Vives begins by telling ‚ÄúSe√±or Idi√°quez‚Äù to always consider the rhetorical situation for the letter, primarily evaluating the relationship of the writer to the recipient. The reason is that, as Saint Ambrose told Sabinus, \\"In a letter the image of the living presence emits its glow between persons distant from each other, and conversation committed to writing unites those who are separated from each other.\\" Thus, it is not a speech delivered by an orator in a crowded assembly. Rather, it is a conversation. Vives then gives a history lesson on the letter in an attempt to show that the best letter writers of antiquity understood this conversational aspect of the letter. Vives states that the exordium of the letter is both the hardest to write and the most important part of the letter. It will color the reader‚Äôs reaction throughout the body of the letter. It is important to tailor this section to the recipient: Vives also gives instructions on how to vary the letter‚Äôs style according to genre. He covers letters of petition, instruction, congratulations, consolation, incentive, and shared interests. ‚ÄúWe may write on every subject,‚Äù says Vives, but he focuses his attention on the most popular epistolary genres. Following the pattern Vives sets out in his discussion of the exordium, the bulk of De conscribendis epistolis covers the components of the letter and considerations for composition such as diction and addresses on superscriptions. Throughout this how-to section of the treatise, Vives offers examples and templates, which are ‚Äúsuitable for our use‚Äù in the 1530s, as he puts it.

As a broadcaster on German radio for several months during World War II, he argued that the United States should support Nazi Germany in its war against the Soviet Union. Following the Allied victory over Germany, he was twice arrested by U.S. authorities and investigated for treason, but no charges were brought. Due to his position in eastern Europe as a reporter for many years, Day was able to provide the U.S. government with tips about Soviet espionage agents, which played a part in his charges being dropped. Early life Donald Day was born in Brooklyn, New York, on May 15, 1895, to John I. and Grace Bryant (Satterlee) Day. He had two brothers, Samuel Houston Day and John I. Day II, and two sisters, Grace Delafield Day and Dorothy Day, who was a noted Catholic social activist and is being considered for canonization by the Catholic Church. He followed his father, who was editor of the New York Morning Telegraph, into journalism, and worked for The Day Book, a tabloid newspaper aimed at the working-class market which campaigned on behalf of labor unions and the right of women to vote. In 13 August 1917, Day enlisted in the United States naval aviation and was discharged at the end of World War I. Upon completion of his military service, he returned to New York and worked as a sports reporter for The Morning Telegraph. He later became the editor of the New York World. Reporter in Europe In 1921, Day was invited by the unofficial Soviet representative in New York, Ludwig Martens, to accompany him on his deportation from the U.S. to the Soviet Union and to report on events there. When he arrived in Riga, Latvia, he received a Soviet visa and an offer from the European Director of the Chicago Tribune, Floyd Gibbons, to be that newspaper‚Äôs Northern Europe Correspondent. Day accepted the offer and from August 1921 was the only U.S. reporter in the region. He reported on events in the Baltic States, Finland, and the Soviet Union. His visa for the Soviet Union was withdrawn when he refused to report on the Soviet system in a consistently favorable light. He was unable to comply when faced by the realities of Soviet tyranny and the Communist subversion of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. When he was denied direct access to the Soviet Union, he relied on reports from refugees and correspondents he sent across the border. His experiences made him a committed anti-Communist, which was reflected in his reports, especially those on the forced collectivization of agriculture in the 1920s and the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933. Day's uncompromising reports on the Soviet Union were almost unique at the time, completely unlike those of other Western reporters like Walter Duranty, the Moscow Bureau Chief of the New York Times from 1922 to 1936. Three months before the United States presidential election of 1936, the Tribune headlined one of his stories, \\"Moscow orders Reds in U.S. to back Roosevelt\\". The rival Chicago Times offered $5,000 for proof that the story was true. The reward was never collected. In March 1939, Polish authorities barred Day from verifying reports of the persecution of the country's ethnic German minority, as he was sympathetic to the German position. Day was a war correspondent in the Finnish-Soviet Winter War of 1939‚Äì40. When the Soviets invaded Latvia on 17 June 1940 he was given 24 hours to leave the country. He reported from Riga that the invasion was facilitated by the Russian and Jewish minorities in the country: \\"On June 17 there was a mob at the railway station, waving red rags and screaming in hysterical joy about the arrival of the Russians. The Latvian language could not be heard. The speeches, the shouts, the screams were all in Russian or Yiddish.\\" Following the annexation of the Baltic States by the Soviets, Day relocated to Sweden to continue reporting as the Tribune's Stockholm correspondent. In 1941, Day accompanied Finnish troops as they advanced into Soviet territory and in September 1942 he quit his post to join the Finnish Army. The Tribune demanded he return immediately, and Day decided to stay and try to fight with the Finns. The Finns ultimately rejected his enlistment on account of pressure from the U.S. government. His passport had expired and had not been renewed, so Day then found himself both unemployed and unable to travel freely. Propaganda for Nazi Germany As hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union were drawing to a close, Day was convinced that the West had to be warned of Communist expansion into Eastern Europe behind the advancing Red Army. He relocated in the summer of 1944 to Nazi Germany. He was employed in Berlin as a commentator for the German State Radio (RRG). He was the last American recruited into the RRG's USA Zone. On August 31, 1944, Day began broadcasting from Berlin to American forces in Europe. He continued his broadcasts until April 18, 1945. He was convinced that the Third Reich was the West's only bulwark against Soviet tyranny. His broadcasts denounced President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the United States' alliance with the USSR, and he blamed Jews for Soviet atheistic Communism. Day stated his position as: \\"I also feel that in fighting the Jewish-Bolshevik regime of Russia that Germany is performing a service for Western civilization which will be properly appreciated and recognized in the future.\\"Donald Day, Onward Christian Soldiers: 1920-1942: Propaganda, Censorship and One Man's Struggle to Herald the Truth, p. 203 Day was included on the Nazi list of those to be detained in 1940 following a successful invasion of Great Britain and the conclusion of the war in Europe on Nazi terms. He was paid $3,000 a month as a broadcaster, putting him among the six highest paid employees on the RRG's payroll. Arrest and charges of treason Day was arrested by U.S. occupation forces in Germany in May 1945 and detained, along with Mildred Gillars and Herbert John Burgman, by the Army Counterintelligence Corps at Camp King, Oberursel, until he was conditionally released on December 24, 1946. Day returned home to his wife Edit in Bad T√∂lz, Bavaria. He was rearrested pending treason charges on January 12, 1949, but the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) dropped the case soon after, due to other agencies seeking to get Day's help to identify potential Soviet espionage agents who had entered the United States. As a DOJ memorandum of December 6, 1946, had noted: \\"Donald Day was a broadcaster for the Germans during the last eight or nine months of the war. His broadcasts consisted primarily of extremely anti-Russian statements. He made broadcasts both to the United States and to American troops.\\" A memorandum dated January 22, 1947 said that he \\"sometimes suggested that the United States should not have entered the war and that Germany's cause against Russia was just.\\"Freedom of Information Request: Axis Sally, accessed January 27, 2014 Later life On his release, Day returned to Finland with his wife Edit, whom he had married in Riga in 1940. He was reporting for the Tribune as its Baltic correspondent in late 1962 and was still filing copy for that newspaper in September 1966. He died of a heart attack in Helsinki on October 1, 1966.

Salvia), Tres de la Cruz Roja (1961, by Fernando Palacios) or Historias de la televisi√≥n (1964, by Jos√© Luis S√°enz de Heredia). During this decade, Leblanc formed an artistic partnership with Concha Velasco which was to endure for many years. He was also involved in a comedy trio with Jos√© Luis Ozores and Manolo G√≥mez Bur. In this way, he established his popularity working mainly in comedy roles, on both film and stage. Leblanc found success in theatre with revue productions such as Te espero en el Eslava (1957‚Äì1958) and Ven y ven...al Eslava (1958‚Äì1959), both alongside Nati Mistral. Leblanc's decline began in the mid-70s, after theatrical hits like Paloma palomita palomera and Esta es mi vida (1975), when an old ailment was aggravated, leaving him semi- disabled and unable to continue his acting career. However, before his retirement, Leblanc did some of his best work in El astronauta (1970, by Javier Aguirre) and the remake of Rafael Gil's El hombre que se quiso matar (1973). A true pioneer of television in Spain in the 1950s and 1960s, Leblanc combined his cinema career with comedy specials, various comedic performances and a few programmes by Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola such as Las Gomas (1956), La Goleta (1957), Gran Parada (1963‚Äì1964), El que dice ser y llamarse (1965), En √≥rbita (1967), Cita con Tony Leblanc (1969) and Canci√≥n 71 (1971). After Paloma, Palomita, Palomera 1973 y Esta es mi vida in 1975. Leblanc decided to retire from cinema in 1975 after his starring role in Tres suecas para tres Rodr√≠guez. On 6 May 1983, he was involved in a serious road accident that would truncate his theatrical career. The accident left him temporarily incapacitated. After nearly 15 years of retirement, he was seen by Santiago Segura on television in the Premio Isbert de Teatro award ceremony. Following this, Segura convinced him to accept a role in his film Torrente (1998), which earned Leblanc a Goya Award for Best Supporting Actor. The collection of this award in January 1999 was especially emotional because of the almost miraculous recovery of the actor, who managed to walk after being in a wheelchair for several years. Leblanc agreed to continue in Segura's Torrente saga, with films in 2001, 2005, and 2011. From 2001 to 2008, Tony Leblanc appeared in Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola's series Cu√©ntame c√≥mo pas√≥ for 181 episodes, in the supporting role of Cervan, an old and charming newsagent. Since April 2007, he has also collaborated with Santiago Segura in the comedy program Sab√≠as a lo que ven√≠as, of laSexta channel. Tony Leblanc has also produced, directed and written several films, debuting as director of El pobre Garc√≠a, a comedy starring Lina Morgan and Manolo G√≥mez Bur. He finally abandoned work as a producer and director after failing to achieve commercial success. Tony Leblanc was the author of a successful pasodoble: C√°ntame un pasodoble espa√±ol, written for the revue Un Pasodoble Espa√±ol (1970), by folk artist Lolita Sevilla, following which he continued to collaborate with her in other pasodobles: Las piedras del camino, Te digo sinceramente and Un abanico espa√±ol, the latter with Maestro Quiroga. He wrote his memory\`s in the book This is my life in 2008. On May 10, 2008, Leblanc received a tribute by the municipality of Villaviciosa de Od√≥n, (Madrid), where he lived for 30 years. He died in Villaviciosa de Od√≥n, on 24 November 2012, aged 90, from a myocardial infarction. There is a road in Benidorm named in his honour.

It is an adaptation of eigenvector centrality with the addition that nodes are imbued with importance from external sources. Definition Given a graph with adjacency matrix A_{i,j} the alpha centrality is defined as follows: : \\\\vec{x} = (I-\\\\alpha A^T)^{-1}\\\\vec{e} \\\\, where e_j is the external importance given to node j, and \\\\alpha is a parameter. Motivation To understand alpha centrality one must first understand eigenvector centrality. An intuitive process to compute eigenvector centrality is to give every node a starting random positive amount of influence. Each node then splits its influence evenly and divides it amongst its outward neighbors, receiving from its inward neighbors in kind. This process repeats until everyone is giving out as much as they're taking in and the system has reached steady state. The amount of influence they have at this steady state is their eigenvector centrality. Computationally this process is called the power method. We know that this process has converged when the vector of influence changes only by a constant as follows: :x_i = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} A^T_{i,j}x_j where x_i is the amount of influence that node i carries, A_{i,j} is the adjacency matrix and \\\\lambda happens to be the principal eigenvalue. Alpha centrality enhances this process by allowing nodes to have external sources of influence. The amount of influence that node i receives at every round is encoded in e_i. The process described above should now stop when : x_i = \\\\alpha A^T_{i,j}x_j + e_i \\\\, where \\\\alpha is a constant that trades off the importance of external influence against the importance of connection. When \\\\alpha=0 only the external influence matters. When \\\\alpha is very large then only the connectivity matters, i.e. we reduce to the eigenvector centrality case. Rather than perform the iteration described above we can solve this system for x, obtaining the following equation: : x = (I-\\\\alpha A^T)^{-1}e \\\\, Applications Alpha centrality is implemented in igraph library for network analysis and visualization.

First serving as Beylerbeyi of Ottoman Tunisia, he later achieved the high post of Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire. He was a political reformer during a period of growing European ascendancy. was a pragmatic activist who reacted against poor conditions in Muslim states, and looked to Europe for solutions. He applied the Islamic concept of \\"ma·π£la·∏•ah\\" (or public interest), to economic issues. He emphasized the central role of justice and security in economic development. He was a major advocate of \\"tan·∫ìƒ´mƒÅt\\" (or modernization) for Tunisia's political and economic systems. Abdul Azim Islahi, \\"Economic ideas of a nineteenth century Tunisian statesman: Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi.\\" Hamdard Islamicus (2012): 61-80 online. Youth in Abkhazia & Turkey Of Abkhaz origin, Hayreddin was born in Abkhazia into \\"a family of warrior notables\\". His father Hassan Leffch, a local chieftain, died fighting against a Russian attack on the city of Sukhum. Thereafter as a young orphan Hayreddin was sold into slavery, then still a familiar event for Circassian youth.Bondage was \\"not an unusual fate given that his people had supplied slave markets for centuries.\\" Clancy-Smith (2011) at 320. She gives the date of his birth as 1822. At Istanbul, however, he was eventually traded into a prestigious household, that of the notable Tahsin Bey, a Cypriot Ottoman who was the naqib al-ashraf (head of the Prophet's descendants) and qadi al-'askar (chief judge of the army) of Anatolia, and a poet. Tahsin Bey moved the boy to his country palace at Kanlƒ±ca near the Bosporus, where he became the childhood companion of the Bey's son for a span of years. Khayr al-Din received a \\"first-rate education\\" which included the Islamic curriculum, also the Turkish language, and perhaps French; yet he was not raised as a mamluk. Following \\"the son's tragic premature death\\" his father Tahsin Bey sold Khayr al-Din in Istanbul to an envoy of Ahmed Bey of Tunis. This new uprooting would obviously provoke emotional turmoil in Khayr al-Din, then about 17 years old. Soon he was on board a ship bound for Africa.Clancy-Smith (2011), at chap. 9, \\"Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi and a Mediterranean community of thought\\", 315‚Äì341, at 319‚Äì320. Apparently Prof. Clancy-Smith relies on his memoirs and on Van Krieken (1976).Cf., Brown at 29‚Äì30, in Khayr al-Din (1967). Prof. Brown infers in much more general terms a similar background. Noting that \\"many sources say he was born in 1810\\" Prof. Brown nonetheless states \\"he was probably born between 1820 and 1825.\\" In Tunisia under Ahmad Bey Circa 1840 Hayreddin became situated at the Bardo Palace, in the court of Ahmad Bey (r.1837‚Äì1855), as a mamluk bi-l-saraya [inner palace retainer]. He resumed his high-level studies, mainly at the Bardo Military Academy (al-maktab al-Harbi) a nearby institution newly established by the bey. A key part of his education now was learning to converse in Arabic, also acquaintance with French. At the Husaynid court his abilities were soon recognized, and he was favored with the attention and trust of Ahmad Bey. He rose quickly in the elite cavalry, the nucleus of the bey's new army. Moreover, during the 1840s and 1850s he was sent by the Bey on several key diplomatic missions, e.g., to the Ottoman Porte at Istanbul, which was then pursuing its Tanzimat reforms, and to European capitals, including Paris. His political career thus began auspiciously under this famously modernizing ruler. Portrait of Brigadier General Khair al-Din on horseback In 1846 he accompanied the bey, as part of small staff which included the influential advisor Bin Diyaf, during a two-month state visit to France, after which he was made brigadier general. This trip was of special cultural and political significance in that the orthodox bey traveled for an extended stay to a non-Islamic country in order to acquire familiarity with its modern methods of operation and governance. The trip \\"expanded the cultural space deemed acceptable for Muslim rulers.\\" The French took care to show France to advantage; the small Tunisian party was well received by top government officials and leading private citizens. \\"Having traveled beyond the land of Islam, Ahmad Bey was blessed upon his return to Tunis by the grand mufti.\\"Clancy-Smith (2011) at 320‚Äì322; at 69, 324‚Äì327; quotes at 326.Guellouz, et al. (2010) at 412‚Äì413. Photograph at 412. In 1853 Hayreddin was elevated to the highest military grade, commander of the cavalry; he also then became an aide-de-camp of the bey. Yet shortly thereafter he was sent to Paris to arrange a loan for the bey's regime, but where instead he spend four years attempting to reclaim large sums embezzled by the notable Mahmud bin 'Ayyad, former head of the newly created national bank of Tunis, who with foresight had already secured French citizenship. During his years occupied with negotiations in Paris, Hayreddin also managed to browse libraries and bookshops, to improve his French, asking many questions, and to study European society, industry, and finance.Clancy-Smith (2011) at 329, 326. Hayreddin sent books to his friend Bin Diyaf, including titles by the medieval Tunisian Ibn Khaldun, printed in Arabic, published in Paris. Clancy-Smith (2011) at 324.Cf., Hourani (1970) at 84. Because of the dire financial situation caused in part by the embezzlement of bin 'Ayyad, the bey's loan did not appear prudent to Hayreddin, according to Prof. Abun-Nasr. Nonetheless, the bey had stifled most political opposition to his financial schemes by long cultivation of the urban ulama and the rural tribal leaders. Due to Hayreddin's passive resistance, however, the loan was still being negotiated when Ahmed Bey died in 1855.Abun-Nasr (1971) at 261‚Äì262. As Minister of Marine Upon his return to Tunisia from Paris, Khayr al-Din was appointed Minister of Marine in 1857. He held responsibility for the expanding ports, Tunis and Goulette, as well as distant Sfax. This involved construction to improve harbor facilities in order to handle the increased commercial shipping, as Mediterranean trade grew markedly.Clancy-Smith (2011) at 327‚Äì329. Apparently the number of ships in the Tunisian navy had greatly declined in the face of vessels of modern European design.Brown (1974) at 299‚Äì303. Many Tunisian ships had been lost due to a storm in 1821, and later in a severe defeat at the Battle of Navarino in Greek waters suffered by the Ottoman navy in 1827, ships which were never replaced. Brown (1974) at 142‚Äì144. Immigration into Tunisia began to surge, leading to difficulties with traditional documentation. Hayreddin proposed the issuance of passports. Here also the Ottoman capitulatory agreements, which gave extraterritorial legal rights to Europeans resident or transient in Tunis, complicated the situation. Contraband was another issue.Clancy-Smith (2011) at 178 (contraband), 327‚Äì329 (immigration).Cf., Anderson (1986) at 98‚Äì102, describing fundamental changes induced by influx of Europeans. Public health became a concern of major importance with quarantine procedures imposed regarding a plague of cholera. The Minister of Marine oversaw at Goulette the operation of an arsenal, a prison, and a hospital. During this period in his life, as he would be completing his fortieth year, Hayreddin began to consider Tunisia as his adopted country.Clancy-Smith (2011) at 327‚Äì329, e.g., 328 (adopted country). Personal and family life At about the age of forty, circa 1862, Hayreddin married his first wife, Janina, who was the niece of the Bey (that is, the daughter of the Bey's sister, a Husaynid princess). The wedding was announced officially and celebrated with \\"great pomp\\". The father of Janina was the insider politician Mustapha Khaznadar, originally from Greece, who served for many years as Grand Vizier. Their marriage was blessed with three children. Yet Janina and the son died in 1870; the two surviving daughters grew to adulthood and later married well. A year after Janina's death Hayreddin married two Turkish sisters who both gave birth to sons in 1872. Nonetheless, Hayreddin repudiated both in order to marry Kmar (or Qamar, Ar: \\"Moon\\"). She bore him two sons and a daughter. Kmar later moved with her husband to Istanbul and survived him by several years. \\"It seems probable that Khayr al-Din married the two sisters for the sole purpose of producing male progeny but wed Kmar, his fourth wife, out of love. In any case, his last marriage was monogamous.\\"Clancy-Smith (2011) at 334‚Äì335. After his first wife's death, unmediated discord soon erupted between the son-in-law and the father-in-law.Cf., Perkins (2004) at 32.Clancy-Smith (2011) at 320. Mustafa Khaznadar, although the Grand Vizier and servant of the Bey, could be an avaricious dealer in extortion, and good at it as well, becoming quite wealthy; while Hayreddin was known to be a committed opponent of tyranny and corruption.E.g., Abun-Nasr (1971) at 264‚Äì265. In 1853 Hayreddin had a palace constructed in the suburb of La Manuba, east of Tunis. Here he initially lived with his first wife Janina. This seaside villa lies between the port of La Goulette and Carthage; near where now stands a modern rail station called \\"Kh√©reddine\\" (named after either Barbarossa or al-Tunisi).Perkins (2004) at 2. He apparently also had a \\"grand residence\\" in the madina of Tunis, in the quarter Place du Tribunal, and a third elsewhere.Clancy-Smith (2011) at 329‚Äì330, 335. A contemporary European diplomat who \\"worked with him closely and on friendly terms\\" describes Hayreddin during the years when he served as the bey's chief minister: > \\"He was a stout, burly man, with a somewhat heavy countenance, which was > occasionally lighted up with a very intelligent... expression... . His > manners were considered haughty and overbearing, and... he soon added to the > unpopularity to which his foreign extraction and mode of introduction into > high office would under any circumstances have exposed him. ... It was > difficult to tell his age as he dyed his hair and beard of a hard and deep > black colour... .\\"Hourani (1970) at 86‚Äì87. This was by the British > Ambassador, Henry Layard. After Hayreddin lost his government position at Tunis in 1877, the Ottoman sultan eventually offered him a government position in Istanbul. He then sought to sell his rather large holdings in real estate (\\"three palaces in Tunis and its suburbs, olive groves, and a vast estate called Enfida consisting of 100,000 hectares\\"). Fearful of a politically motivated seizure by his enemies who now ran the Tunis government, he sold his Enfida property to the Soci√©t√© Marseillaise in July, 1880. Yet an adjacent parcel was quickly purchased by a seemingly undisclosed agent, who then claimed pre-emptive rights to purchase the Enfida land, denying it to the French company who had already paid for it. The bey's regime evidently supported the pre-emption claim; the conflict became known as the \\"Enfida affair\\". Ironically, this mischief spurred the French invasion of April, 1881.Abun-Nasr (1971) at 277‚Äì278. In 1878, while serving in the Ottoman Empire, he was given by the sultan a mansion in Istanbul. Hayreddin died in 1890, surrounded by his family in their konuk [villa] located in Kuru√ße≈üme near the Bosporus. His fourth Son Major-General Damat Mehmed Salih Pasha (c. 1876 ‚Äì killed at Istanbul, 24 June 1913) by his wife, Kamar Hanƒ±m, married at the Dolmabah√ße Palace, Istanbul, 29 July 1907 with »òehzade Ahmed Kemaleddin's only daughter M√ºnire Sultan (Dolmabah√ße Palace, Istanbul, 13 November 1880 ‚Äì Nice, France, 7 October 1939, and buried there), and got Sultanzade Ahmed Kemaledin Keredin (18 June 1909 ‚Äì 1987), married and left Issue.Clancy-Smith (2011) at 337‚Äì338. Constitution and Grand Council The reformist constitution promulgated in 1861 established new institutions of government, in particular an advisory and legislative body called the Majlis al-Akbar or Grand Council. The first to serve as its president was Hayreddin, appointed by the bey. Yet strong opposition and factional intrigues of the existing leadership, largely directed by the long- time Grand Vizier, Mustapha Khaznadar, quickly developed which made the situation unworkable for a reformist agenda to prevail. Mustapha was also the father of Janina and the new father-in-law of Hayreddin. Instead of accommodating the powers-that-be, however, Hayreddin left office voluntarily in 1862.Brown at 30‚Äì31, in Khayr al-Din (1967). His book: The Surest Path During his voluntary exile to Europe, he acquired French. There he observed first hand the style and manner of politics of the innovating West. His 1867 book Aqwam al-MasƒÅlik fƒ´ Ma'rifat A·∏•wƒÅl al-MamƒÅlik [The Surest Path to Knowledge regarding the Condition of Countries] makes a comparison between European and Muslim states. In it he proposed strategies for governance and compared European political systems. Also he articulated a path to follow in order to achieve necessary reforms. It counsels a moderate course, adopting selective Western programs and techniques while maintaining Tunisian traditions. He appealed directly to Muslim clerics, the ulama, and stressed that the elite ruling class should serve as stewards of the people's welfare.Guellouz, et al. (2010) at 412‚Äì428. His book (at 414‚Äì418) was translated, e.g., into French (Le plus s√ªr moyen pour conna√Ætre l'√©tat de nations), Turkish, and Italian.Perkins (2004) at 30‚Äì36, book at 33.Brown, editor (1967). International Finance Commission In 1869 he became the first chairman of the International Finance Commission in Tunisia, created to manage government revenue and expenditures. His reforming Vizierate in Tunis Kheireddine Ettounsi on Tunisian 20 dinar note (1992). Later Hayreddin led the Tunisian government as its chief minister (1873‚Äì1877). His last years were spent in Ottoman service, where he was briefly the sultan's grand vizier (1878‚Äì1879).Perkins (1989) at 73‚Äì75. While prime minister under Sadok Bey, Hayreddin establish the Habus Council in 1874 to improve the utility of the extensive lands given to religious trusts. Legal changes were made to existing qanun law so that it might better encourage trade and commerce; the result was later called \\"le code Kha√Øreddine\\" which affected contracts and obligations. Administrative reforms of government institutions were made at Justice and Finance. In foreign affairs, he fostered closer ties with the Ottoman Empire, under the mistaken opinion that it would forestall European interference. Hayreddin also advanced the modernized curriculum at the Zitouna Mosque. Later he worked to establish Coll√®ge Sadiki, a lycee devoted to teaching modern subjects to the next generation of Tunisia's leaders.Guellouz, et al. (2010) at 412‚Äì428, administration at 418‚Äì420, law at 420‚Äì421, Ottomans at 422‚Äì424.Perkins (2004) at 30‚Äì36, Habus Council at 34. A recent evaluation of Hayreddin's Vizierate, in light of the progress in Tunisia during the more than a century since, makes several observations. The first regards his coordination with the Tunisian ulama in order to make the government reforms; the second his familiarity with European political institutions: > \\"Reform in politics necessitates renewal in religious matters, including > rational interpretation of the divine scripture and cognizance by the > learned scholars of Islam of worldly matters and events in order for them to > be able to render contextual understanding of the sacred texts. Khayr al-Din > makes this bold move in the pursuit of reform that emulates Europe. The > subsequent synergy between luminaries within, on the one hand, the state > machinery and, on the other, the Zaytuna mosque university drew a reformist > itinerary that still indelibly inspires the engineering of renewal agendas > in modern day Tunisia.\\"Powel and Sadiki (2010) at 8. > \\"The second idiosyncrasy is the attempt to harmonize the mundane and the > sacred, the 'Eastern' religious knowledge with 'Western' political genius. > The political thought of the Beylic of Tunisia's Grand Vizier, Khayr al-Din > al Tunsi, is paradigmatic of this harmonization.Powel and Sadiki (2010) at > 8, note 1. As Grand Vizier in Istanbul In 1878 Hayreddin was invited by the Ottoman sultan to relocate to Istanbul for government service. He worked initially on the Financial Reform Commission during 1878, being charged with modernization of the empire's tax and budgetary process. Obtaining the sultan's confidence, he soon was appointed Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire for a short period, from 4 December 1878 to 29 July 1879. Quickly he became resented as an outsider by the imperial political class. > \\"Heyreddin Pasha of Tunisia\\" was a \\"maladroit speaker of the [Turkish] > language\\" who \\"made it to the position of grand vizier in 1878. Even though > he had a fair command of written Arabic and French, his underlings could not > resist making fun of his Ottoman Turkish.\\"M. Sukru Hanioglu, A Brief History > of the Late Ottoman Empire (Princeton University 2008) at 35, text and note > 67. To advance his reform policies, Hayreddin enlisted foreign support to triangulate his political position and gain some independence of action. Nonetheless he could accomplish little; furthermore, this strategy led to his alienation of the sultan and his rather rapid dismissal. In 1882 he refused the offer of a second term as Grand Vizier.Shaw and Shaw (1977) at 220. Memoir and latter writings From Hayreddin's letters \\"it seems that in 1878 he would have preferred to return home to Tunis.\\" The French invasion of 1881 and their subsequent protectorate in Tunisia ended such hopes. At the spacious mansion in Istanbul given him by the sultan, Hayreddin remained in retirement during his last decade, but his rheumatoid arthritis made life difficult and his exile brought him some bitterness. Nonetheless, here he composed various written works.See bibliography. Clancy-Smith (2011) at 337‚Äì338. In French he dictated his memoirs to several different secretaries skilled in the language, indicating that the Francophone world was an important target audience, whether in Africa, in Europe, or in the Middle East. He titled his memoirs A mes enfants: ma vie privee et politique [To My Children: My private and political life]. In these memoir and in several other writings, he pointedly defended his reforms while Grand Vizier of Beylical Tunisia.Clancy-Smith (2011) at 338. A close reading of Khayr al-Din, especially his memoirs and later writings (perhaps written frankly, without ulterior intent), shows him to favor traditional government like the Ottomans, opines Prof. Brown: > Khair al-Din \\"was always well within the mainstream of medieval Islamic > political thought, with its emphasis on stewardship, i.e., a rigid > separation between the rulers and the ruled, whose mutual relations were > guided by the parallel of the shepherd and his flock... . It was > stewardship‚Äîa sense of noblesse oblige--rather than a passion for > representative democracy which guided Khayr al-Din. [W]here he had a free > hand, Khayr al-Din had chosen almost all his own ministers from the mamluk > class.\\"Brown, \\"An Appreciation of The Surest Path\\", 1‚Äì64, at 32, in Khayr > al-Din (1967). Prof. Brown then quotes at some length, from Khayr al-Din's memoirs, a passage which describes the pre-existing corruption of the Beyical government as the source of the problem during his years as Grand Vizier. As the reformist solution, Khayr al-Din sought to \\"create a new administrative system, based on justice and equity, to destroy abuses and arbitrary actions\\" and restore \\"the government in its sacred role of protector of the people\\" and so \\"conduct the country on the road to prosperity.\\",Brown at 32‚Äì33 in Khayr al-Din (1967), quoting from the \\"A mes enfants: Ma vie privee et politique\\" (1934) at 193. A more forward-looking portrait of Hayreddin is rendered by Prof. Clancy-Smith, although her contrary portrait does not appear to contradict Prof. Brown's conclusions wholesale. Here, she celebrates the \\"cosmopolitanism of Tunis, which was not an identity so much as a manner of social existence.\\" > \\"In the mamluk tradition at its best, Khayr al-Din gave unwavering loyalty > to the Husaynids [the Beys of Tunis] and sultans [of the Ottoman > Empire]--until their policies violated his notion of just government > informed by his own lived experience, Islamic moral precepts, and chosen > European political principles. ... As prime minister, however, he further > dismantled the mamluk system... . ... As a borderland intellectual, he > operated at multiple points of intersection: between the Maghrib and the > Ottoman Empire; Europe and North Africa; the central Mediterranean corridor > and the sea writ large; the universe of the philosopher-educator and the > statesman. ... [His book] could be recast as a modern expression of the > rihla [trave or pilgrimage] through which Khayr al-Din attempted to > legitimate distant or foreign knowledge.\\"Clancy-Smith (2011) in summarizing > her chapter \\"Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi\\", 315‚Äì341, at 339, rihla at 326. During his last years, Hayreddin also turned to writing memoranda on the reformation of the Ottoman regime addressed to the unreceptive Sultan Abdul Hamit II. In these Hayreddin addressed many subjects, e.g., the civil service (education and renumeration), the legislature (method of election and limitations on its scope of action), and how to hold high officials accountable for their actions. Several of his proposals were taken up later by others pursuing reform.Shaw and Shaw (1977) at 220.

Since 1991, over 300 hundred members of Congress have taken part in efforts \\"that encourage collaborative and visionary leadership practices and foster healing, civility, and respect.\\". Joan M. Mooney serves as its President & CEO. While many Democratic and Republican Congressional Representatives work with the organization, including those on its Congressional Advisory Board, Representative John Lewis, a former leader of the civil rights movement in America, has played a special role in its programs, including its annual Civil Rights Pilgrimage to Alabama. History The Institute was founded in 1991 to \\"provide bipartisan, bridge-building opportunities for political leaders to experience the spiritual power of conscience, courage, and compassion.\\" Plans for the group resulted from an early \\"reflection group\\" that included Rep. Glenn Poshard, Ms. Anne Bartley, Rev. Joe Eldridge, and Rev. Doug Tanner. Convinced of the importance of such opportunities for reflection, Tanner founded the Institute in 1991 \\"with the hope of providing opportunities for meaningful interactions and experiences among those who lead and serve our nation\\", Some of the Institute's earliest efforts were linked to the \\"Common Ground\\" program, providing opportunities for staffers and members to help rebuild churches burned by arsonists in the mid-1990s. In 1997, the organization expanded its programs when then-President Rev. Doug Tanner persuaded Representative Amo Houghton and Representative John Lewis (D-GA) to serve as the co-chairs of the group's Board of Directors. Their involvement brought in many additional members and leaders of Congress interested in dialogue across party, religious, racial, and ideological lines, creating a \\"spiritual community of men and women who seek a better way to do the people's business.\\" Board and Advisors The Board consists primarily of Government Relations professionals, and lawyers specializing in Government Regulation practices, representing such companies as American Airlines, American Bridge, American Values Network, Arent Fox, Aspen Institute, Association of American Publishers, Capital Concerts Inc., Coca-Cola Company, Covidien, Eleison LLC, Escambia Enterprises, Federal City Council, Fluor Corporation, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Goldman Sachs Group, Jewish Funds for Justice, Lightbridge Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Moore Consulting, National Association of Broadcasters, National Democratic Institute, Regions Financial, The First Group, The Memorial Foundation, TwinLogic Strategies, United Health Group, and Williams & Jensen, and others.

The pilgrimages allow men and women from both houses of congress, along with staff members and special guests, to take part in trips that provide information, inspiration, and opportunities for reflection on the lessons to be learned from past struggles, such as the civil rights movement. The annual pilgrimage to Montgomery and Selma Alabama that includes a walk over the famous Edmund Pettus Bridge is an event led by Representative John Lewis, an early civil rights leader. Other special activities include: *The Lewis-Houghton Leadership Awards: recognizing leaders \\"who have exhibited qualities of conscience, courage and compassion in their roles as public servants.\\" * United States-South Africa Faith and Politics Initiative: In May 2003, The Faith & Politics Institute provided program conceptualization, planning, and coordination for the Congressional visit (CODEL) to South Africa, led by Reps.

This visit provided an opportunity to compare lessons learned from America's civil rights movement and South Africa's fight against apartheid, and established links for future dialogue. * Saint Joseph's Day Breakfast: an annual breakfast program, including a speaker and awards ceremony, on Saint Joseph's Day. Because Saint Joseph is recognized by many as the patron saint of the worker, the Institute's St. Joseph's Day breakfast was founded \\"to raise awareness of the spiritual and moral issues that affect economic life in America.\\" * The Congressional Reception: Every other year, this reception acknowledges both those who have supported the Institute's efforts and those who have been inspired by its programs. The Faith & Politics Institute just concluded its annual Congressional Pilgrimage to Alabama that was focused on Art, Architecture, Story & Song, featuring a visit to Montgomery's new Memorial for Peace and Justice and Legacy Museum.

The conflict, which took place in July‚ÄìAugust 1762, began when William Lyttelton, the British governor and commander-in-chief of Jamaica, sent a naval expedition to Nicaragua with the primary objective of capturing the town of Granada. Background Because it represented a potential route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as well as the possibility of expanding their colonization of Central America beyond the Miskito Coast, Nicaragua was a major target of attacks by the British during the 18th century. Due to the economic interests of the British in Central America, the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed on March 16, 1740, between King Edward I of the Miskito Kingdom and King George II of Great Britain of the Great Britain. Under the terms of the treaty, a protectorate was established over the Mosquito Coast and the British supplied modern weapons to the Miskito people. The Miskito Kingdom later aided Britain during the American Revolutionary War by attacking Spanish colonies and gained several victories alongside the British. Between 1739 and 1748, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Bourbon Spanish Empire had been at war over a series of trading disputes in a conflict known as the War of Jenkins' Ear, which was later subsumed by the wider War of the Austrian Succession. Most of these disputes were more or less settled by the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 and the Treaty of Madrid in 1750. When the Seven Years' War broke out in Europe in 1756, Spain did not initially join either of the two coalitions of belligerents. The Spanish policy of neutrality was immediately tested on December 26, 1756, when a British privateer, the Antigallican, captured the French ship Penthievre. When the British captain took both ships into the Bay of Cadiz, the Spanish authorities inpounded both ships. Spain insisted that the captured ship should be returned to France, along with the Antigallican which was awarded as compensation. This outraged the British, but no military action was taken. This incident marked the beginning of a decline in Anglo-Spanish relations. As the Seven Years' War progressed, the neutral Spanish government became concerned that the string of major French losses at the hands of the British had become a threat to Spanish interests. On August 15, 1761, King Charles III of Spain and King Louis XV of France signed the Third Pacte de Famille. This treaty created an alliance between Spain and France and brought Spain into the ongoing war. By an ancillary secret convention, Spain became hurriedly committed to making preparations for war against Britain. The major objectives of Spain were the capture of Gibraltar and Jamaica from Britain. Britain first declared war against Spain on 4 January 1762 and on 18 January 1762, Spain issued their own declaration of war against Britain. The British quickly captured Cuba and the Philippines in early 1762. Also in early 1762, William Lyttelton, the British governor and commander-in-chief of Jamaica, proposed a naval expedition to Nicaragua. The goal was to sail up the San Juan River to Lake Nicaragua and capture the town of Granada, which would effectively cut Spanish America in half as well as provide potential access to the Pacific Ocean. The first and greatest obstacle to success was to capture the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception. The conflict began in June 1762, during the administration of interim Governor of Nicaragua Melchor Vidal de Lorca y Villena. Instigated and aided by the British expeditionary force, a group of Miskito Sambu filibusters attacked cocoa plantations in the Valley of Matina. The following month they raided many undefended settlements in Nicaragua, including Jinotega, Acoyapa, Lovig√ºisca, San Pedro de L√≥vago, the mission of Apompu√° near Juigalpa and Muy Muy, burning and looting the villages as well as capturing some Spanish prisoners. Many of the people they captured were sold as slaves to British merchants and transported to Jamaica. The combined British and Miskito Sambu expeditionary force headed towards the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception on the San Juan River in July. The attacking force consisted of two thousand men and more than fifty boats, while the soldiers at the fortress numbered only around a hundred. To make matters worse, the invaders threatened the region at a time when the commander of the fortress, Don Jos√© de Herrera y Sotomayor, was mortally ill. As he lay on his deathbed, Herrera's daughter Rafaela made a solemn oath to her father that she would defend the fortress at the cost of her life if necessary. The elder Herrera died some time between July 15 and July 17, and Lieutenant Don Juan de Aguilar y Santa Cruz assumed temporary command of the garrison. The battle Flag used in the Spanish coastal fortifications from 1701 to 1785 The expeditionary force arrived at the fortress on July 26, 1762. At 4 o'clock that morning, the lookout on duty heard cannon fire from the east, in the direction of an observation post which was located at the junction of the Bartola and San Juan rivers. Shortly thereafter, the invaders captured the observation post and its defenders. The British commander learned from the Spanish prisoners that the fortress was in disarray due to the recent death of its commander. A few hours later, with his fleet anchored in the river, the British commander sent an envoy to demand the unconditional surrender of the fortress in exchange for the avoidance of further hostilities. The second in command of the garrison, a sergeant, was about to grant the request when the 19-year-old Herrera intervened. Seeing what she perceived as the cowardly attitude of the defenders, Herrera chided: \\"Have you forgotten the duties imposed by military honor? Are you going to allow the enemy to steal this fortress, which is the safeguard of the Province of Nicaragua and of your families?\\" Animated by the spirit of her late father and ancestors and knowing the risk to her honor and virginity with the barbarity of the Miskito Sambu, she strongly opposed the surrender of the fort and insisting that each soldier take his place fighting. She ordered the gates of the fortress to be locked, took the keys and placed sentries. In response to the rejection of their demands, the British formed a skirmish line, believing that this would be sufficient to achieve the desired effect. Herrera, trained in the handling of weapons, fired one of the cannons and managed to kill a British officer with the third volley of cannon fire. Enraged by the death of a British officer, the British hoisted their battle ensign and began a vigorous attack upon the fortress which continued throughout the night. The garrison, energized by Herrera's heroism, mounted a fierce resistance which inflicted great losses to the British men and boats. At nightfall, Herrera ordered the troops to throw some sheets soaked with alcohol into the river on floating branches and set on fire. The current dragged the burning material towards the enemy craft. This unexpected action forced the invading British troops to suspend their attack for the rest of the night and retreat to defensive positions. The next day the British laid siege to the fortress, but with little progress and small casualties on their side. Inspired by Herrera's acts of heroism, Lieutenant Juan de Aguilar, the pro tempore garrison commander, led the defenders to victory in a battle that lasted six days. Herrera handled the cannons of the fortress and the Spanish managed to defend the strategic position but the British finally lifted their siege after being called for service in other more important areas of the Seven Years' War on August 3, 1762. They withdrew to the mouth of San Juan River, where their imposing presence impeded the flow of shipping into the Caribbean Sea for some time. Aftermath Fortunately for the defenders of the fortress, Spain and Britain began peace negotiations (in Fontainebleau on November Spanish ceded Florida to the British. After Spain entered the American Revolutionary War in 1779, Major General John Dalling, the British governor and commander-in-chief of Jamaica, proposed a second naval expedition to Nicaragua. During this expedition, which took place in 1780 and later became known as the San Juan Expedition, Colonel John Polson and Captain Horatio Nelson led a British attack against the fortress. At the time, the Spanish garrison consisted of 228 men under the command of Juan de Ayssa (who later served as Governor of Nicaragua from 1783‚Äì7). The expeditionary force succeeded in capturing the fortress on April 29, 1780, despite the fact that it consisted of only 200 men. The 22-year-old Nelson, in command of , was responsible for leading his men through dense jungle to attack the fortress from a hill in the rear. The British captured the fortress and occupied it for nine months, finally abandoning it in January 1781.

Mr Justice Tugendhat, and called in legal reports Tugendhat J, is a High Court judge in England and Wales. He is the High Court's senior media judge, taking over that role from Mr Justice Eady on 1 October 2010. His appointment was welcomed by some journalists who believed he held \\"more enlightened beliefs\\" than his predecessor. Early life Michael Tugendhat is the son of Dr Georg Tugendhat, an immigrant from Austria who founded a petrochemical refinery, and his wife Marie Littledale. His son is the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, whilst his elder brother Christopher Tugendhat is a Conservative politician, businessman, and author. He is married and has four sons. Education Tugendhat attended Ampleforth College and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he studied philosophy and classics. He won the Henry Fellowship to attend Yale Law School and studied at the Hague Academy of International Law before being called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1969. He then joined Five Raymond Buildings, a set of barristers' chambers specialising in media and entertainment law. Legal career Tugendhat was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1986. He became a Recorder of the Crown Court in 1994 and a deputy judge sitting in the High Court of Justice in 1995. In 2000, he became a judge sitting in the appeal courts of Jersey and Guernsey. He was appointed a High Court Judge, Queen's Bench division, in April 2003. In 2010 he was appointed to be the Judge in Charge of the Queen's Bench jury lists. He is a fellow of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies. He was formerly on the management committee of the Advice on Individual Rights in Europe Centre. Described by The Guardian as \\"Britain's leading expert on privacy law\\", Tugendhat told the Commons' select committee on Culture, Media and Sport: Notable cases=Advocate In 2000 Tugendhat acted for David and Victoria Beckham, who were petitioning the High Court to prevent the publication of a biography of them by Andrew Morton. The Beckhams claimed a portion of the book was derived from confidential information passed on by their former bodyguard, who was already enjoined from making public disclosures about the couple. Tugendhat called the bodyguard's conduct \\"a very bad case of disloyalty and breach of confidentiality\\" but opposing counsel, Geoffrey Robertson QC, argued that Morton and his publisher enjoyed protection of their free speech in this regard. The parties reached an out of court settlement and the book was published. In 2001 he represented The Sunday Times newspaper in its efforts to publish extracts a book by former MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson. The Attorney General sought to compel newspapers to gain the approval of the Government before publishing such sensitive information. The court (Lord Phillips, Lord Justice Tuckey, and Lord Justice Longmore) ruled that, as the information had already been published in Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, it was already in the public domain and so the restraint on publication in the UK could not be justified. Later in 2001 he acted for a number of newspapers including The Times, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Mail, which sought to overturn a blanket ban on publishing unauthorised disclosures by former MI5 agents, including those of David Shayler. The House of Lords ruled that the statutory prohibition on agents revealing secret information was proportional and did not contravene Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Also in 2001 Tugendhat represented internet service provider Demon Internet, which sought to amend a ruling which would hold it responsible if any of its customers used the Demon service to identify the new identities of the killers of James Bulger. The court amended the order to indemnify Demon and other ISPs providing they took \\"all reasonable steps\\" to remove the infringing material. The order remained more onerous than Demon had wished ‚Äì Tugendhat said of it \\"Happy would not be the word, but we have all signed it.\\" In 2002, in the case Theakston v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd, he represented TV presenter Jamie Theakston, who sought to injunct newspapers from publishing a story about Theakston visiting a London brothel, arguing that, as the alleged visit took place in private, The Sunday People's publication of details infringed his right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Denying the petition to impose the injunction, Mr Justice Ouseley ruled \\"It is not inherent in the nature of a brothel that all or anything that transpires within is confidential.\\" In 2003 Tugendhat appeared for actor Michael Douglas and his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones in the case Douglas v Hello! Ltd before the High Court. Douglas and Jones had sold rights to publish photographs of their 2000 wedding to celebrity news magazine OK!, but a paparazzo surreptitiously photographed the proceedings and sold his photographs to OK!'s competitor Hello. Douglas, Jones, and OK! sued Hello's publisher, alleging their privacy had been invaded and claiming ¬£1.75 million in damages. Refuting the claim that the couple's selling photos of their wedding rendered the event \\"not genuinely private\\", Tugendhat argued \\"If Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones could not offer a slice without offering the whole cake, then their own freedom of expression is diminished.\\" The Douglases were successful in their claim; Hello successfully appealed to the Court of Appeals. Hello then appealed to the House of Lords which (in a combined ruling with OBG Ltd v Allan), denied the appeal. Judge In January 2010, he overturned a superinjunction imposed on behalf footballer John Terry which prevented the media from revealing details of his affair with team-mate Wayne Bridge's former girlfriend, Vanessa Perroncel, saying he did not feel the order was \\"necessary or proportionate\\". He also criticised Terry's lawyers for not notifying newspapers of the action they were taking. In June 2010, at an interim hearing in the case of Thornton v Telegraph Media Group, his ruling in favour of the Telegraph Media Group over Lynn Barber's review of Sarah Thornton's book, Seven Days in the Art World, was said to \\"raise the bar for libel claimants.\\" Amongst the allegations made in Barber's review that was the subject of the case, Barber had written that Thornton had given her interviewees copy approval, a practice of which journalists would \\"disapprove.\\" Thornton considered this to be defamatory. Tugendhat accepted the argument of the Telegraph Media Group that there should be a \\"threshold of seriousness\\" for libel claims to prevent trivial claims and that a claimant should be able to demonstrate a \\"substantial effect\\" on their reputation to prove defamation. However, the case went to trial in 2011, at which point Tugendhat ruled in favour of Thornton. During trial it was established that Barber had lied in her evidence to the court about the extent of her knowledge of the accusations published in her book review. It emerged that Barber was fully aware that some of the accusations in her review were completely false, a fact which resulted in Tugendhat awarding Thornton ¬£15,000 in malicious falsehood damages. This was a notable award as it appears to have been the first award of general damages for malicious falsehood. In the same judgment, Tugendhat went on to rule that other accusations in Barber's review were defamatory of Thornton, and awarded the latter a further ¬£50,000 in damages. By doing so, the judge overturned the Telegraph Media Group's \\"offer of amends\\" defence, a first in English legal history. In May 2011 Tugendhat partially lifted a gagging order brought by Sir Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, just hours after details of his alleged extra-marital affair were made public in the House of Lords. Tugendhat varied the injunction to allow publication of Goodwin's name, but not details of the alleged relationship and the name of the woman said to be involved. In November 2012 Tugenhat presided over an attempt by the Metropolitan Police to force claims against them relating to relationships between undercover police officers and unsuspecting women to be held in secret. (See National Public Order Intelligence Unit, Mark Kennedy (police officer), Bob Lambert.) He ruled in January 2013 that parts of these contentious cases (relating to the Human Rights Act) should be heard in a secret Investigatory Powers Tribunal, from which claimants are themselves excluded, and which to which there is no power of appeal. However, he ruled against the Metropolitan Police in relation to parts of the cases brought under common law, which will be held in the High Court rather than in secret. Honours Tugendhat was appointed Knight Bachelor on 20 May 2003 upon his appointment to the High Court. His investiture ceremony took place at Buckingham Palace on 25 June 2003 where he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.

It refers to the required resistance to deformation or permanent damage due to loads applied at the car's ends, either from push-or-pull loads on the buffer, Janney coupler or when rolling at slow speed into a fixed barrier such as a buffer stop. United States Buff strength requirements grew out of best-practice design standards during the latter part of the nineteenth century. By the twentieth century, a design limit of was required by federal approval agencies. This was upped to for certain categories in 1945. Leach, Colin.

Bio Jim Tozzi grew up in Everett, a city to the north of Boston. The most distinctive thing about this town was the smell of freshly roasted peanuts due to the Teddie Peanut Butter factory. The factory's emblem, a grinning cartoon bear with a bucket, would be one of the first influences of advertising on Jim. He went to Everett public school: always an outsider, he preferred drawing weird cartoons and watching monster movies to playing sports. In his early teens, Jim borrowed a super 8 camera from his Aunt and began experimenting. Lacking a tripod, he would tape the camera down onto the kitchen table and animate various toys, Star Wars figures and clay monsters. He also created a live action series starring his little sister as \\"Chico\\" the heavily mustachioed drug dealer who would meet an unlikely demise in every episode. Jim went on to study film and illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design. He continued doing both animated and live action films creating a short film parody of an afterschool special called \\"Sunday School Girls\\" which tackled the subject of what Jesus really looked like. Career Tozzi moved to New York City and started working at Broadcast Arts inking and painting animation cels. He also started directing music videos for obscure alternative bands. One of the first was for Mercury Rev and featured Ron Jeremy as a floating space traveller. Jim approached Nick at Nite with his reel and some promo ideas; he was brought on to TV Land to come up with a new promo campaign. This campaign conceived, written and directed with his wife Vezna Gottwald, developed into the award winning \\"Twip\\" series. \\"Twip\\" was an imaginary product in which its evolution was traced in commercial parodies from the early 1950s through the 1990s.

He gradually moved northwest to the area along the border with Upper Canada by the Great Lakes. In the years before the War of 1812, he was a prominent trader on Mackinac Island, with connections and interests among the Ojibwe on both sides of the border, and business with British Canadians.

Dousman's fulfillment of these conditions resulted in the British and Canadians accepting him as a key ally in their quest to retain control over the Straits of Mackinac area throughout the war. After the War of 1812, Dousman renewed his loyalty to the United States. He was granted new licenses to trade furs by the government on condition that he affiliate his operations with John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company, which had become dominant in this area and ultimately established a monopoly. Dousman became more successful than ever, especially as British Canadians were prohibited from trading on the United States side of the border between the countries, unlike the open conditions before the war. The trader acquired a large farm on the northern third of Mackinac Island. This was developed in the late 19th century as today's Wawashkamo Golf Club. Among the lower-level traders he employed was John Drew, who later became independent. Dousman also pursued other business interests in the area. He owned and operated a sawmill powered by current through the Straits of Mackinac. This structure has been reconstructed in the late 20th century as the centerpiece of Historic Mill Creek State Park. Marriage and family Dousman married and had a family. His son Hercules L. Dousman later became a noted pioneer in what was developed as the state of Wisconsin. Legacy The schooner Michael Dousman, which sailed on the upper Great Lakes from 1843-1853, was named after the trader.

The film was directed by Socheata Poeuv and produced by Charles Vogl. It won the 2007 IDFA \\"Movies That Matter\\" Award, an initiative of Amnesty International, as well as eight other international awards. It was aired on National PBS in 2008. Story synopsis New Year Baby opens with a brief background story. The main character, Socheata, was born in a refugee camp in Thailand, where her family had fled following the Cambodian genocide. Her family left the refugee camp and emigrated to Texas, where they focused on creating a new life for themselves and their children. The story moves to the present, when Socheata returns home for Christmas. Her mother calls a family meeting and reveals a secret that Socheata's entire family had kept from her: her two sisters are not actually her sisters, her brother is her half-brother, and her mother had a husband before Socheata's father. Socheata's family had been melded together in a Khmer Rouge labor camp, assembled from shards of an extended family that was shattered when family members were killed in the Cambodian genocide. After this secret is revealed, Socheata's mother and father invite Socheata and her brother to Cambodia, and Socheata agrees to go to discover what other secrets her family had left behind. As Socheata spends time in Cambodia, more is gradually discovered about her family's past. Her two \\"sisters\\", Mala and Leakhena, are actually her cousins. They were taken to a Khmer Rouge labor camp, along with their mother and father. Their father was taken away when they arrived, and they never saw him again. Their mother died of starvation not long after, leaving them orphans, at which point Socheata's mother adopted them. Socheata's mother had a husband and son when she was taken to the labor camp. After her husband was killed, she continued to care for her son and Mala and Leakhena. She met Socheata's father in the Khmer Rouge labor camp, and they were married by a Khmer Rouge cadre. The film continues with Socheata and her family traveling through Cambodia, visiting sites important to her family's history: the labor camp where her mother and father met, the spot where Mala and Leakhena's mother was buried, the homes of surviving relatives of both sides of her family. The final chapter of the story reveals what happened after the Khmer Rouge fell and the Cambodian genocide ended. Although they were freed from the Khmer Rouge, Mala and Leakhena had been separated from their adopted parents. After searching for months Socheata's father found Mala and Leakhena, and smuggled the entire family through minefields and across the Thai-Cambodian border to the refugee camp where Socheata was born. After visiting the spot where Socheata was born, Socheata and her father go to a Buddhist temple and complete the ritual for a new child that her father had been unable to complete in the refugee camp. The film concludes back in Texas, where Socheata brings out a wedding cake to celebrate the wedding ceremony that her parents had never been permitted to have, and her mother describes how proud and thankful she is for what Socheata's father had done to save their family and create a new life for them in America.

First published in 1977 and regularly updated and restructured, as of 2011 it consists of a general standard, about 10 collateral standards, and about 80 particular standards. General standard The general standard IEC 60601-1 - Medical electrical equipment - Part 1: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance - gives general requirements of the series of standards. 60601 is a widely accepted benchmark for medical electrical equipment and compliance with IEC60601-1 has become a requirement for the commercialisation of electrical medical equipment in many countries. Many companies view compliance with IEC 60601-1 as a requirement for most markets. This standard does not assure effectiveness of a medical device. In the US, evidence of effectiveness is required by the FDA and confirmed through either a Premarket Approval (PMA) or similarity to a predicate device via a 510(k) Premarket Notification. National deviations of this series of standards exist which include country specific requirements;National Deviations to IEC 60601-1 by MDDINational Deviations to IEC60601-1 by Eisner Safety Consultants see e.g. UL or AAMI for US specifics.http://www.aami.org/news/2010/081010.press.606011.html The European EN and Canadian CSA versions of the standard are identical to the IEC standard. Revisions In 2005, the third edition of IEC 60601-1 was published. It was the result of a comprehensive review of the second edition (dating from 1988). Some key changes are: the outline and the numbering scheme of the clauses and subclauses were changed, risk management was made much more relevant and the concept of essential performance was added. Currently (2012), the applicability of the second and third edition is somewhat overlappingRegulatory Strategies for the Third Edition of IEC 60601-1 Retrieved 6 September 2010 depending on the products under consideration and the country/area of application. IEC 60601-1-11 (2010) must now be incorporated into the design and verification of a wide range of home use and point of care medical devices along with other applicable standards in the IEC 60601 3rd edition series. IEC 60601-1 merged to medical device directive 93/42/EEC which covers all IEC standard of electromedical & electrical safety so it is clear that EC cover all Previous IEC standard to medical device directive 93/42/EEC The mandatory date for implementation of the EN European version of the standard is June 1, 2012. The US FDA requires the use of the standard on June 30, 2013, while Health Canada recently extended the required date from June 2012 to April 2013. The North American agencies will only require these standards for new device submissions, while the EU will take the more severe approach of requiring all applicable devices being placed on the market to consider the home healthcare standard.IEC 60601-1-11:2015 redline version Collateral and particular standards Requirements of 60601-1 may be overridden or bypassed by specific language in the standards for a particular product. Collateral standards (numbered 60601-1-X) define the requirements for certain aspects of safety and performance, e.g. Electromagnetic Compatibility (IEC 60601-1-2) or Protection for diagnostic use of X-rays (IEC 60601-1-3). Particular standards (numbered 60601-2-X) define the requirements for specific products or specific measurements built into products, e.g. MR scanners (IEC 60601-2-33) or Electroencephalograms (IEC 60601-2-26).

The Part 9 standard asks manufacturers of medical devices to consider the environmental impacts of their devices throughout the product's entire life cycle and to minimize these where possible. The standard also requires that the manufacturer provide information to the user on how to use the product in the most environmentally sensitive way. The USA, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand have not yet set transition dates for their national versions of this latest edition 60601-1, but the national versions published to date do contain the requirement to also conform with IEC 60601-1-9. However, the European version (EN 60601-1:2006) requires compliance with the new IEC 60601-1-9 collateral standard by September 2009. According to the recent publication of the US national version of the collateral standard for products intended for home use, ANSI/AAMI HA60601-1-11, the application of the standard does not apply to the nursing home environment. In the United States, nursing facilities are considered to be environments providing professional healthcare. The American version of this collateral standard also places greater emphasis on a requirement that states that ‚Äúinspection of the usability engineering file reinforce that the usability engineering process is necessary for validation of the instructions for use.‚Äù Devices typically mandated to use the new standard include oxygen concentrators, body-worn nerve and muscle stimulators, beds, sleep apnea monitors, and associated battery chargers prescribed for use at home. Although In Vitro Diagnostic devices such as blood glucose meters are being used by patients at home, the standard does not apply, as these devices remain under the jurisdiction of the more lenient IEC 61010 series. Critics The 60601 certification process has been criticized for its complexity, cost, and the business risk it raises. This has been more particularly a concern during the transition to the third edition due to the indefinite adoption schedule of the new revision.Op Ed: The 60601-1 Third Edition Is Not Mandatory How Scary Is IEC 60601-1?

As a rookie, he started 12 games at defensive tackle registering 20 tackles, a sack and a fumble recovery, before being placed on the injured reserve list with a left knee injury on December 6. He was released on September 2, 2012. New England Patriots McClain signed with the New England Patriots on September 26, 2012. He was waived on October 2, after being active for one game and not recording any statistics. Houston Texans McClain signed with the Houston Texans as a free agent on October 29, 2012. He played in 16 games and finished with a career-high 21 tackles and a fumble recovery. Dallas Cowboys McClain signed as a free agent with the Dallas Cowboys on March 12, 2014. Although he looked strong and was taking advantage of the added work as Henry Melton recovered from knee surgery during off-season workouts, a high-ankle sprain he suffered in training camp affected his momentum. He played 13 games in a reserve role and finished with 20 tackles (3 for loss), 7 quarterback pressures, one sack and a forced fumble. His best game came against the Washington Redskins, notching 4 tackles, one sack and a forced fumble. In 2015, he missed time during training camp with a bone bruise and hamstring injuries. He registered 4 tackles in the first two regular-season games, before being placed on the injured reserve list with a sprained big toe injury on September 22. In 2016, he was able to earn a starting position over new free agent addition Cedric Thornton. He started in 15 games mostly at the three technique position and was considered the best defensive lineman on the team according to the media and observers. In the season opener against the New York Giants he had 5 tackles (one for loss). His best game came against the Cincinnati Bengals, when he registered 6 tackles (1 for loss), 1.5 sacks and 3 quarterback hurries. He did not play in the last game to rest an ankle injury he suffered against the Detroit Lions and be ready for the playoffs. He finished the season with 41 tackles (3 for loss), 2.5 sacks, 8 quarterback pressures and 2 forced fumbles. Washington Redskins On March 10, 2017, McClain signed a four-year contract with the Washington Redskins.

Columbia River service Teaser was built in 1874 at The Dalles, Oregon, and was intended to run on the middle Columbia river, which was the stretch of navigable river that ran between the Cascades Rapids and Celilo Falls. At that time, all traffic proceeding upriver had to be offloaded onto a portage railroad that went around the impassable Cascades, then run upriver by rail to the Upper Cascades to be loaded onto another steamer to be carried to The Dalles, where another portage railroad existed around Celilo Falls. The reverse had to be followed for downriver traffic. In the 1870s, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company had a monopoly on all traffic on the Columbia River. Teaser was launched as a boat to run in opposition to the monopoly, to make connections over the portage at the Cascades with the newly constructed Otter, running on the lower river. Both Teaser and Otter were too small to mount a serious challenge to the powerful Oregon Steam Navigation Co., but to prevent any competition, the monopoly bought both vessels just the same, and both vessels were sent to Puget Sound. Operations on Puget Sound Transfer of Teaser to Puget Sound meant the vessel had to be taken through the dangerous Cascade Rapids. While this could be done in the right conditions with a skillful pilot, it was considered too risky to have any passengers or cargo on board. Teaser was taken down through the Cascades in 1875 under the command of Capt. J.W. Brazee, with engineer James Carroll and the fireman on board as crew. The vessel was brought around the Olympic Peninsula and arrived at Seattle on July 8, 1875, and was placed on a route out of Snohomish. Capt J. C. Brittain is reported to have owned Teaser when the vessel was on Puget Sound, and used the vessel in connection with the steamers Despatch and Comet to carry the mail, for which he had a contract, to Snohomish, La Conner, Whidbey Island, Fidalgo Island, Bellingham Bay, Semiahmoo Bay, and Lopez, Orcas and San Juan islands.Newell, Inland Sea, at 72, 73, and 82. Sinking and conversion to sailing vessel Teaser is reported to have sunk in an unspecified location in 1879. The vessel was raised and converted into a sailing schooner in 1880.

Its value depends on the concentration of the optic and the refractive index in which the receiver is immersed. Maximizing the acceptance angle of a concentrator is desirable in practical systems and it may be achieved by using nonimaging optics. For concentrators that concentrate light in two dimensions, the acceptance angle may be different in the two directions. Definition Acceptance angle The \\"acceptance angle\\" figure illustrates this concept. The concentrator is a lens with a receiver R. The left section of the figure shows a set of parallel rays incident on the concentrator at an angle Œ± < Œ∏ to the optical axis. All rays end up on the receiver and, therefore, all light is captured. In the center, this figure shows another set of parallel rays, now incident on the concentrator at an angle Œ± = Œ∏ to the optical axis. For an ideal concentrator, all rays are still captured. However, on the right, this figure shows yet another set of parallel rays, now incident on the concentrator at an angle Œ± > Œ∏ to the optical axis. All rays now miss the receiver and all light is lost. Therefore, for incidence angles Œ± < Œ∏ all light is captured while for incidence angles Œ± > Œ∏ all light is lost. The concentrator is then said to have a (half) acceptance angle Œ∏, or a total acceptance angle 2Œ∏ (since it accepts light within an angle ¬±Œ∏ to the optical axis). Transmission curves Ideally, a solar concentrator has a transmission curve cI as shown in the \\"transmission curves\\" figure. Transmission (efficiency) is œÑ = 1 for all incidence angles Œ± < Œ∏I and œÑ = 0 for all incidence angles Œ± > Œ∏I. In practice, real transmission curves are not perfect and they typically have a shape similar to that of curve cR, which is normalized so that œÑ = 1 for Œ± = 0\\\\. In that case, the real acceptance angle Œ∏R is typically defined as the angle for which transmission œÑ drops to 90% of its maximum. For line-focus systems, such as a trough concentrator or a linear Fresnel lens, the acceptance angle is one dimensional, and the concentration has only weak dependence on off-pointing perpendicular to the focus direction. Point focus systems, on the other hand, are sensitive to off-pointing in both directions. In the general case, the acceptance angle in one direction may be different from the other. Acceptance angle as a tolerance budget The acceptance angle Œ∏ of a concentrator may be seen as a measure of how precisely it must track the sun in the sky. The smaller the Œ∏, the more precise the tracking needs to be or the concentrator will not capture the incoming sunlight. It is, therefore, a measure of the tolerance a concentrator has to tracking errors. Optical imperfections However, other errors also affect the acceptance angle. The \\"optical imperfections\\" figure shows this. The left part of the figure shows a perfectly made lens with good optical surfaces s1 and s2 capturing all light rays incident at an angle Œ± to the optical axis. However, real optics are never perfect and the right part of the figure shows the effect of a badly made bottom surface s2. Instead of being smooth, s2 now has undulations and some of the light rays that were captured before are now lost. This decreases the transmission of the concentrator for incidence angle Œ±, decreasing the acceptance angle. Actually, any imperfection in the system such as: *tracking inaccuracy *imperfectly manufactured optics *optical aberrations *imperfectly assembled components *movements of the system due to wind *finite stiffness of the supporting structure *deformation due to aging *other imperfections in the system contributes to a decrease in the acceptance angle of the concentrator. The acceptance angle may then be seen as a \\"tolerance budget\\" to be spent on all these imperfections. At the end, the concentrator must still have enough acceptance to capture sunlight which also has some angular dispersion Œ∏S when seen from earth. It is, therefore, very important to design a concentrator with the widest possible acceptance angle. That is possible using nonimaging optics, which maximize the acceptance angle for a given concentration. Angular aperture of sunlight Figure \\"angular aperture of sunlight\\" on the right shows the effect of the angular dispersion of sunlight on the acceptance angle. Sunlight is not a set of perfectly parallel rays (shown in blue), but it has a given angular aperture Œ∏S, as indicated by the green rays. If the acceptance angle of the optic is wide enough, sunlight incident along the optical axis will be captured by the concentrator, as shown in the \\"angular aperture of sunlight\\" figure. However, for wider incidence angles Œ± some light may be lost, as shown on the right. Perfectly parallel rays (shown in blue) would be captured, but sunlight, due to its angular aperture, is partially lost. Parallel rays and sunlight are therefore transmitted differently by a solar concentrator and the corresponding transmission curves are also different. Different acceptance angles may then be determined for parallel rays or for sunlight. Concentration acceptance product (CAP) For a given acceptance angle Œ∏, for a point-focus concentrator, the maximum concentration possible, Cmax, is given by :C_\\\\mathrm{max} = \\\\frac{n^2}{\\\\sin^2\\\\theta} , where n is the refractive index of the medium in which the receiver is immersed. In practice, real concentrators either have a lower than ideal concentration for a given acceptance or they have a lower than ideal acceptance angle for a given concentration. This can be summarized in the expression :CAP = \\\\sqrt{C} \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\le n , which defines a quantity CAP (concentration acceptance product), which must be smaller than the refractive index of the medium in which the receiver is immersed. For a linear-focused concentrator, the equation is not squaredSee: http://www.powerfromthesun.net/Book/chapter09/chapter09.html . Note that in this derivation theta is the full angle, not the half-angle defined here. :C_\\\\mathrm{max} = \\\\frac{n}{\\\\sin\\\\theta} The Concentration Acceptance Product is a consequence of the conservation of etendue. The higher the CAP, the closer the concentrator is to the maximum possible in concentration and acceptance angle.

Nikita is an American spy drama which premiered on September 9, 2010 on the CW Television Network. The series is based on the French film La Femme Nikita, the film's remake: Point of No Return and a previous series La Femme Nikita. The series stars Maggie Q as Nikita Mears, the title protagonist of the series, as a rogue spy and assassin whose mission is to bring down the secret government agency called Division. Other main cast members include Shane West as Michael, Lyndsy Fonseca as Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Udinov, Aaron Stanford as Seymour Birkhoff, Ashton Holmes as Thom, Tiffany Hines as Jaden, Devon Sawa as Owen Elliot, Noah Bean as Ryan Fletcher, Dillon Casey as Sean Pierce, with Melinda Clarke as Amanda Collins and Xander Berkeley as Percival \\"Percy\\" Rose. Main characters=Nikita Mears Maggie Q at the San Diego Comic-Con. Portrayed by Maggie Q, Nikita Mears, the show's main protagonist and titular character, was a waif who never knew her parents and went from one foster home to another. She later became a felony addicted teenager sentenced to death row. The secret government agency, Division, recruited her and faked her death in order to rescue her from death row. Following her rescue, she was trained as a spy and assassin. Her dreams of serving her country well were broken after Division, the only people she thought she could trust, betrayed her. After a three-year hiding period, Nikita now seeks retribution against Division and vowed to bring the agency down. She is Michael's main love interest throughout the series. In the season three premiere, Michael proposes to Nikita and she accepts saying \\"You had me at give you the damn Glock.\\" Maggie Q performs her own stunts. Michael Bishop Shane West at 2010 CBS Summer Press Tour Party. Portrayed by Shane West, Michael is a Division operative who trained Nikita. Michael is second in command at Division surpassed only by the ruthless Percy. He is a former US Navy intelligence officer. Shane West, the actor who plays Michael, described Michael as \\"confused\\" and \\"torn between his loyalty to Division and his own feeling on where he should be going in his life\\". West also said that \\"Michael's not inherently a bad guy, at all. He's doing some things that I think he started off believing in, and now he's a little unsure\\". It is later revealed that Percy, Division's head, hired Kaseem Tariq to kill Michael, but due to an accident, Michael's wife and daughter died. It was this that Percy used to get Michael into Division saying that he could seek retribution. Michael also serves as Nikita's main love interest throughout the series. In season 2 it is revealed that Michael has a son, Max who he was unaware of. Michael proposes to Nikita in the season three premiere after a grueling first mission with the \\"new\\" Division. She happily accepts and they kiss passionately. Alexandra Udinov Lyndsy Fonseca at the San Diego Comic-Con. Portrayed by Lyndsy Fonseca, Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Udinov is a new recruit in Division. Udinov shares many similarities to Nikita. She is a former street kid who was arrested after a robbery. Udinov, secretly, assists Nikita in her quest to destroy Division by acting as a mole. Alex suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder after she was kidnapped by Russians and sold as a sex slave. In \\"Alexandra\\", the 15th episode of the first season, it is revealed that Alex is the daughter of a Russian oligarch, and the heir to his business empire. After accidentally killing Thom, then framing him as Nikita's mole, she graduated to agent. In the 21st episode, Alex's true identity was recovered by Amanda, and Percy re-activated her kill chip as a deal to use her against Nikita. In the Season 1 finale, Alex faked Nikita's death so that Nikita could stop Percy, resulting in her recapture by Division. Amanda, however, permanently deactivated Alex's killchip and let her escape, persuading her to make her own life without being Nikita's mole. Alex then abandoned Nikita, only to be captured by Oversight, who controls Division, and given an order to find and apprehend Nikita and Michael. In Season 2, Alex becomes a free agent and an independent contractor for Division, working with Amanda to bring down Nikita and Michael in exchange for Division's support in her own mission to bring down Sergei Semak; accepting herself as the Udinov heiress. In the episode \\"Pale Fire\\" Alex is shown to be in Russia hunting down Semak. However, Alex discovers that her mother; who she believed was dead is in fact alive and is now married to Semak. After Oversight's fall, Alex starts to declare a war against Semak in public, and soon she discovers the fact that Amanda is co-working with Ari who has been long-time planning to fight against his boss Semak. After Semak is down and Alex has saved her mother from Gogol, Amanda asked Alex to sign a contract that she was willing to pass Zetrov out to Amanda and Ari, but she refused to give the Zetrov to Amanda and soon turned against Division. In the episode \\"Dead Drop\\" Alex and Sean share their first kiss. Seymour Birkhoff / Lionel Peller Portrayed by Aaron Stanford, Seymour Birkhoff (birth name Lionel Peller) is Division's head technician and is later promoted to head engineer. A talented computer genius and hacker, Birkhoff, as a college student, was originally an infamous cyber criminal known as \\"Shadowwalker\\", responsible for many infamous digital attacks on the government and its agencies; he was caught after trying to gain access into the security systems at The Pentagon from his college dorm room. While in prison, Percy got Birkhoff released and recruited him to Division. Birkhoff was recruited at around the same time as Nikita. Birkhoff is known for his nonconformist nature; despite his work for Division, he maintains pride in his individual work with computers. Despite his fear of Amanda and Percy, Birkhoff is fairly loyal to Division, although at times protests against his more violent duties. In Season 2, Birkhoff, after rescuing Nikita and Michael from a Division ambush, revealed he had escaped Division, like they had, after Percy was relieved of command and Amanda put in charge; and Birkhoff feared her wrath if she ever found out Birkhoff was responsible for decrypting Percy's black box master drive so much that he fled altogether. Initially hesitant to get involved with their efforts to undo all of Division's crimes, Birkhoff, after seeing the effects of a Division mental manipulation program turning a woman; Alicia, who he had quickly grown to care about, into a mindless killer, eventually he teamed up with Nikita and Michael to take down Division and Oversight. Seymour's backstory is further explored in the season four episode \\"Setup.\\" He was born Lionel Peller to father Ronald Peller, a senior NSA computer engineer, and mother Rosemary Peller. He was the third and youngest child in his family (having two older siblings, a brother and sister), and was considered an accident by his parents. As a teenager, he involved himself with hackers and phreakers. His father attempted to enroll him in military school, but upon discovering this, Lionel faked his own death under the guise of a drunken boating accident, thereafter changing his name to Seymour Birkhoff. In the episode, he reveals to Nikita and the others that his father has been kidnapped by Amanda and she has been using a double of him to act as her mole within the NSA. Nikita convinces Seymour to reveal his existence to his father later in the episode. Despite the animosity he feels towards his father, Seymour still cares for him and attempts to use the double to discover his father's location to rescue him alive; this goes awry however when Amanda discovers the deception and orders the double to kill Seymour; this forces Nikita to kill the double, leaving the fate of his father in doubt. Helen \\"Amanda\\" Collins Portrayed by Melinda Clarke, Amanda is the intelligent and beautiful resident psychologist and a master of mental manipulation; she is the official manipulator (as well as torturer) of Division, under the code-name \\"Inquisitor\\". Percy is rumored to have built his entire operation around Amanda's methods and relies on her to get inside people's heads, both during torture and to break them down to believe in Division unconditionally. As an expert manipulator, she can usually tell when people are lying to her and enjoys getting to know the recruits and their secrets. She has a certain fascination for Nikita because she was never able to break her completely. Although she works for Division, she seems to care for some agents and recruits. In Season 2, Amanda has been promoted to Commander of Division and Director of Operations following Percy being relieved of command by Oversight. Amanda, over the course of Season 1, develops a fascination with Alex, similar to Nikita, due to their similar personalities and actions during missions‚Äîultimately resulting in Amanda finding out Alex is Nikita's mole. In Season 2, Amanda and Alex are \\"business partners\\". Amanda wants the black box master drive which Nikita and Michael possess and are threatening to expose Division and Oversight with, Alex wants to kill Sergei Semak; who used Oversight to order her family's deaths. Amanda gives Alex information to further this goal, and Alex promises to get the black box master drive. Amanda captured Nikita and introduced her to a story about how she grew up in a hallucination, Nikita thinking she was Amanda but she was really her twin sister. Amanda's real name was Helen. The other twin sister Helen strapped up in a basement being tested and tortured by her own father. (That's probably how Amanda became an Inquisitor because she was tortured before). In Season 2, it is revealed that Amanda has been promoted to Head of Division, and is holding Percy in an underground cell at Division. However, later on, with Oversight and Division itself hostage, Amanda is forced to release him. In the end of the episode \\"Clean Sweep\\" it is revealed that Amanda has been working with Ari Tasarov throughout her time at Division, and was also involved with Ari romantically. They were secretly plotting to take their bosses down and install Alex as head of Zetrov as a puppet, so that Ari may gain the power from her; however, Alex refuses their demands and stops dealing with them. In \\"Power\\", Amanda goes to Moscow with Ari to attempt to offer Gogol the services of Division. While she's gone, Percy manages to reach Division, telling the agents in charge that Amanda is betraying them. Amanda's aide, Sonya, contacts Birkhoff who, unaware of Percy's presence, plays her a video he'd recorded of Amanda offering Gogol the use of Division agents and her calling the agents considered expendable. When Nikita disrupts the plan, Amanda calls for backup only to have Percy answer and let her know she's now being hunted. She and Ari escape to try and plan revenge. Sean Pierce Portrayed by Dillon Casey, Sean Mason Pierce is a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy and SEAL Team Six operator, with a considerable reputation and record. His mother, Oversight member Senator Madeline Pierce contracts him as an agent at Division, sending him to keep an eye on Amanda. When Sean met Alex, he thought of her as a traitor and completely untrustworthy. Later, after seeing her in action, he acts as a mentor to Alex‚Äîreminding her to see past her own mission in life to bring down Semak. Due to his background, he has a code of honor and is determined to never leave a man behind, unlike Division‚Äîsomething Alex quickly comes to respect. Sean was originally dedicated to terminating Nikita and her team due to their actions endangering his mother, and to this end began seducing Alex as he was aware she was still connected to the rogue agent. In \\"Clean Sweep\\", however, Sean and his mother are both saved by Nikita when the rest of Oversight is killed, and so they team up with Nikita, Michael and Alex in the hopes of destroying Division. Sean works with Nikita and the others, and his relationship with Alex gets closer after his mother's death (an event that was completely devastating to him‚Äîbut he gained some sense of comfort after personally killing the assassin, who worked for Percy). Sean and Alex share their first kiss in \\"Dead Drop.\\" In the Season 2 finale, Sean and Alex begin a romantic relationship. In Season 3, their relationship becomes strained when Sean sees Alex isn't distancing herself from Division, and her continued service was endangering her life. Sean briefly left her, not wanting to witness another person he loved die due to their connection to Division, and it resulted in Alex going off the rails and relapsing into drug use. Later, however, Sean returned to save her life, realizing how much he needs her, and so the two become sexually active. Amanda targets Sean due to his place as a member of Nikita's team, and so destroys his life‚Äîafter assassinating CIA Director Morgan Kendrick with a car bomb, Amanda frames Sean for the assassination, making it look like a delusively paranoid Sean killed Kendrick and his Navy therapist as revenge for the CIA's assassination of his mother. Efforts to clear Sean fail, forcing Division to fake his death. Sean was then forced to remain at Division, his sisters believing him dead and the public believing him a murderer and traitor. In \\"Broken Home\\", Sean was involved in the mutiny at Division, and after a gunfight, succumbed to internal bleeding and died in Alex's arms. Ryan Fletcher Portrayed by Noah Bean, Ryan Thomas Fletcher is a CIA agent and analyst who is known in the agency as a conspiracy theorist regarding Division. Initially a junior analyst and case officer, when Owen Elliot releases information detailing Division's assassination of a Chilean presidential candidate, Ryan reports his suspicions to his superiors. He adds that he has been tracing leads since the Mirko Dadich incident in order to confirm that a government-sanctioned black-ops unit committed these acts. The deputy director, however, a contact of Percy's, agrees to have Ryan framed by Division for the assassination. He allows Ryan to be captured by Chilean rebels, who attempt to force a confession out of him before his own government frames him. Nikita and Owen rescue him. Ryan is informed of the existence of Division: this knowledge gives him leverage so that Division will not kill him. He becomes Nikita's ally, agreeing to help track down the group of officials who sanction Division, and discreetly allows them to escape CIA custody from a plane en route to the United States. On his return, Division frames the deputy director as instigator of Ryan's frame-up and has him killed, clearing Ryan. Later, at Nikita's request, Ryan renditions Birkhoff and brings him to his CIA office for interrogation. Once Division finds out, the CIA is contacted and Ryan is demoted to monitoring Cold War stations. Ryan, who at this time is romantically attracted to Nikita, feels betrayed when they capture Birkhoff, and realizes that revenge is more important to her than his career. Later, by way of apology, Nikita kisses him and promises to \\"make him a hero\\". He is placed in a different department after \\"uncovering\\" information through Nikita, and she gives him information on Birkhoff and Michael. When Ryan later gets intelligence on Emile Voss's dirty bomb, with Nikita's help, they dispel the threat and Ryan personally delivers the weapon to his superiors. He is promoted to clandestine operations, giving him more access. Ryan ultimately has to sacrifice his career: he is able to get Nikita out of CIA custody after she has saved the CIA from being taken over by Division's coup, and Ryan is arrested for again allowing her to escape. But even in prison, he continues to gather clues about how Oversight is funded. In the episode Clawback, Amanda fakes Ryan's so that he can help her take down Oversight. Nikita and his own mother believe that Ryan is dead. After Percy goes rogue and escapes Division and his cage prison, Ryan becomes the replacement prisoner in the cage. Later, Amanda informs Nikita that Ryan is still alive and tells her to recapture Percy‚Äîher price for Ryan's release. On his release, Ryan goes off on his own for a while to gather information for the team and to establish a place for himself to live. He later returns and provides support for the team while they track Percy's developing nuclear program; Ryan serves as the team's intelligence analyst. In the Season 2 finale, Ryan is Nikita's anti-Division team's contact with the US government, liaising with the President himself on how to attack Division safely and in time to stop Percy's plans with his new satellite weapon. After Percy's death, and a peaceful negotiation between the government and Division, Ryan is commended by the President and Vice President. He is to be put in charge of the organization itself, as the new Head of Division. Working alongside Nikita, they would undo Percy's damage, and reform it to combat threats to the country and give second chances to its members, as had been originally intended. During Season 4, Fletcher's dogged insistence that another group is pulling strings compels Ryan (in Episode 5: Bubble) to question Jones, a member of the group behind MDK. He is subsequently captured and eventually commits suicide by throwing himself out a window, knowing his death will force Nikita to realize that her crusade to stop MDK, and Amanda, is not yet over. Owen Elliot / Sam Matthews Portrayed by Devon Sawa, Owen is a former Division \\"cleaner\\" operative who resides in Montreal, Canada as a Guardian- one of the specially chosen few trusted to handle one of Percy's black boxes. Owen, like Nikita, worked for Division and fell in love with a civilian named Emily Robinson (division operatives are forbidden from falling in love). When the black box location is exposed and Owen requests relocation, Percy agrees and personally comes to Montreal with a large team, secretly intending to kill Owen after retrieving the box. When Division agents come after him, Emily is shot and killed by a Division sniper. Owen then turns against Division to avenge her death and joins Nikita on her mission to find and destroy the other Division black boxes and kill Percy. Owen later realizes that he was the \\"cleaner\\" who killed Daniel Monroe, Nikita's civilian fianc√©- a fact he reveals and he later apologizes for; Owen is emotionally weighed down by the number of victims he has taken during his time in service to Division. Owen continues working with Nikita through Season 2, when he disappears again to hunt down and kill the remaining Guardians and destroy their boxes. Owen, without Nikita's knowledge, goes so far as to ally with Gogol under Ari Tasarov's command, agreeing to destroy the black boxes in exchange for Gogol's financing and support for his activities. Owen resurfaces in the episode Guardians where he had tracked down the latest guardian Patrick Miller and planned to raid his home with a Gogol team, but the guardian had left before he could capture him. Having got word of his alliance with Gogol Nikita sneaks into his home and in an sneaks up on him and attacks him and confronts him in an enraged state. After he calmed her down she spends the night and in the morning he cooks her breakfast and they have a heart to heart. They go investigating the Guardian, but in the middle of it all they discuss Nikita's lovelife and she reveals her relationship troubles with Michael to him and he consoles her. He later returns to Gogol only to have them turn on him and he calls Nikita to go confront the Guardian on her own because she would get to him before Gogol having that he himself is currently already incapacitated. He and Nikita are later saved by Michael during a fight. Since there was two tasks at hand in two different locations going to get the black box in the possession of Gogol and defeating the Guardians and destroying their black boxes Nikita told Owen and Michael to team up to go defeat the Guardians while she heads to Gogol believing that it would be easier for them to handle the Guardians if it was the two of them together. In the episode Pale Fire Having partnered up both him and Michael together they were able to find, defeat, and kill a Guardian and find the rest of the guardians and destroy all their black boxes. After the mission was done they gather with Alex and Nikita at the beach house and he tells them he was going to go off by himself once again. Somewhere in the next six months, Owen was caught and imprisoned in Russia. Another Cleaner helped him escape, although she did this on Amanda's orders, who needed information from Owen. Nikita and Division were alerted about his escape, and helped him get back to Division. He was shocked to learn that Percy was dead, and Nikita was now running Division with Ryan. However, after learning that Amanda knew who he was before Division captured him and turned him into an agent. He is now a part of Nikita's team. In the third season episode, \\"Masks,\\" Owen is attacked by Amanda who paralyzes him and causes him to remember his true identity as Sam Matthews, a former Delta Force member. He gets Nikita to help him look up a former comrade only to kill the man in cold blood and capture Nikita. He reveals that Sam was a corrupt soldier who was running a heroin smuggling operation but was betrayed by his fellow members who shot him, leaving him for dead. Nikita can't believe Owen could be this way but he turns her over to Amanda, killing the woman's bodyguards in the process with a sociopathic attitude. Percival \\"Percy\\" Rose Played by Xander Berkeley, Percy Rose is the Head of Division (through Season 1, and the latter part of Season 2). He will stop at nothing to destroy Nikita and protect his empire. As witnessed by his co-workers, Percy is more ruthless than as what he seems, being capable of doing anything in order to achieve what he wants. He has a fair set of skills, including using firearms and self- defense tactics. He is often sardonic and sarcastic, having a notable dark sense of humor. His ambition to eliminate Nikita often drives him into failure, but not before anticipating her every move. In Season 2, Percy has been relieved of command and deposed as head of Division after attempting to overtake Oversight‚Äîhe now resides in a Division jail, miles underground. Amanda, promoted to take Percy's place, makes it clear Percy is only alive as Amanda needs him that way; if he dies, the content of the remaining three black boxes will be published, plunging the world into chaos. In \\"Clean Sweep\\" Percy threatens to release a gas that will kill of all division if Amanda does not agree to let him go. Amanda reluctantly agrees to give Percy his freedom but in exchange she vows that if he ever returns to division she will have him shot dead. In the end of the episode we see Percy is seen talking to Roan and it is hinted that he has a plan to ruin Division. In the season two finale Percy's death comes as he falls trying to kill Nikita. Thom Portrayed by Ashton Holmes, Thom is a Division assassin and Alex's love interest. Thom arrived at Division two years after Nikita and a year before Alex. Originally one of the recruits who were on the brink of becoming full agents, Thom had an unwavering determination to prove himself to Division; as a recruit team leader, Thom took care of the recruits who were struggling with Division's training programs, and when Alex was a new recruit, helped her out when he could. Thom also defended her against Jaden, who he had a short relationship with, and developed feelings for Alex, kissing her at one point, although Alex didn't know how to react and rejected him. In Season 1, Episode 8; Thom graduated and became a full-fledged agent after killing a Gogol asset; an act that was hard for him to bear. Thom later discovered that Alex was working together with Nikita, and tried to take Alex in at gunpoint, but the two fought and Thom is accidentally shot and killed by Alex with his own gun. A heartbroken Alex, who later admits she loved Thom in the end, swears revenge on Division for the situation that resulted in Thom's death, seeing him as one more victim of Division. Posthumously, Alex framed Thom as the mole and he took the fall for Nikita's infiltration. In the Season 1 finale, Alex is exposed as the true mole, a fact everyone knows by the Season 2 premiere, clearing Thom's name. Jaden Portrayed by Tiffany Hines, Jaden is a Division assassin who regularly clashed with Alex. Jaden arrived at Division two months before Alex, having been recruited after murdering her boyfriend while he slept, an action Percy admiringly describes as \\"taking initiative\\". Jaden embraced her new life at Division, and had a brief romance with Thom. Although having similar backgrounds as former street kids, she became resentful of Alex, feeling the latest addition was stealing her thunder. Thom's interest in Alex didn't help matters due to the previous relationship she shared with him. Alex and Jaden's rivalry reaches dangerous levels when they brawl and are reprimanded by Michael. Afterwards, under threat of \\"cancellation\\" (death) if they continued their fights, Jaden maintained an outward cordiality towards Alex, but despite this, Jaden clearly didn't trust Alex and almost found out Alex's secret: that she is Nikita's mole. Alex was able to keep Jaden in line by deciding to frame Jaden for trying to escape Division, acquiring a picture as evidence to blackmail her. After Thom is killed by Alex for working with Nikita, Jaden clearly believed that Alex framed Thom, set him up as the mole, and then killed him. Later, Jaden was appointed a provisional agent, and worked together under Alex on an operation that led to her graduation and appointment as a full-fledged agent, the events of the mission finally cooled relations between them. Shortly after, however, Jaden fought Alex for a final time when she stopped her from reporting Nathan Colville (Alex's boyfriend who had just learned of Division) to Division to have him killed, and during the fight, when Jaden is about to kill Alex, Nathan stepped in and shot Jaden in the stomach, which instantly killed her. After her death, Roan comes to the scene and takes Jaden's body and proceeds to dissolve her body in a tub of hydrofluoric acid. In the debrief with Amanda afterwards, Amanda revealed she had placed a new undetectable earpiece on Jaden without her knowledge; when Alex called Nikita for assistance, mere meters away from Jaden's dead body, Amanda heard and recorded Alex doing it‚Äîexposing her as the mole. Recurring characters=Roan Portrayed by Rob Stewart, Roan is the most notable assassin and \\"cleaner\\" operative in Division. He often works as Percy's right-hand man and never questions his orders. Roan is noted to almost never speak, save for a few terse and literal comments towards others; he is a proficient and calm killer. In the Season 1 finale, Roan tries to \\"clean\\" Nikita's seemingly dead body, when she wakes up and splashed hydrofluoric acid meant for her in his face, leaving him scarred. In Season 2, despite Percy being relieved of command and Amanda's promotion, Roan still works under Amanda's command, and becomes Alex's partner in one mission (where Roan actually became impressed with Alex, according to Amanda in the debrief). Though half of his face is burned now, he has the same deadly skills as before. In \\"Clean Sweep\\" it is revealed that Roan is Percy's mole‚Äîalthough Percy is imprisoned, Roan remains loyal to him, and proceeds to coordinate the remaining black box Guardians' movements; and arranges an attack on Oversight with them, helping Percy escape. After being exposed as the mole, Roan leaves Division and joins Percy on the outside as a rogue agent. He later returns to Division after Percy retakes control of Division from Amanda. Roan works to build Percy's nuclear program, and take control of a satellite weapon for Percy's use. In the Season 2 finale, Roan, after receiving a signal telling him Percy is dead (where he looks momentarily somber; taking off his signature glasses as a simple sign of respect), moved to release plutonium in a public area in the U.S. Before he could, he battled Sean and Alex, and, by accident, electro-shocked himself to death. Ari Tasarov Portrayed by Peter Outerbridge, Ari Tasarov is the leader of the Russian criminal organization Gogol, which seeks to rival and topple Division, and serves as the shadow arm of Sergei Semak. Nikita comes close to assassinating him, but refrains upon seeing Tasarov with his son. He is former KGB and currently serves as Chief of Intelligence (and later Security) of Zetrov. He is cold-hearted, calculating and always attempts to outdo Division operations. Nikita and Tasarov first cross paths during his operation to assassinate U.S. Senator Jack Kerrigan, one of Percy's few trusted government allies; Nikita not only outsmarts Tasarov and foils the assassination attempt, but also ruins Kerrigan's career, rendering him useless to Percy. Satisfied with the result, Tasarov meets with Nikita, offering to work with her to take down Division, also revealing his knowledge of the black boxes. Tasarov and Nikita meet again when Gogol goes after Emile Voss and the dirty bomb he developed; Nikita interferes and they fail to acquire the bomb, which is delivered to Ryan Fletcher. Nikita later comes to Tasarov to ask for his help in getting to Kasim Tariq, the al-Qaeda leader whom Gogol is in partnership with. Tasarov agrees but warns her about striking back at Gogol a third time. After Nikita hits a convoy full of heroin, Kasim goes to St. Petersburg to confront Tasarov about the identity of the \\"Knights of Shi'ra\\". Tasarov simply bluffs his way through before Nikita doublecrosses him again, and captures and kills Kasim. In Season 2, Ari Tasarov creates an alliance with Owen Elliot, a former Division Guardian and associate of Nikita; Tasarov and Owen collaborate to find the remaining black boxes using funding from Gogol. When he questions Owen about Nikita's supposed possession of the black box, Owen denies it and warns Ari that if he moves against Nikita, he will kill him. Owen's threat, however, confirms Tasarov's suspicions, who begins his own efforts to locate Nikita and retrieve the drive; he begins by recruiting Kelly, a disavowed Division agent and Nikita's old Division partner, to infiltrate Nikita's operation and retrieve the box. Under pressure from Sergei Semak, Tasarov ultimately finds out Alex is Anton Kochenko's assassin and the missing Zetrov heiress; Semak realizes she is plotting to retake her father's empire, and insists that she be killed. Ari grows impatient and threatens Owen when he cannot find the black box, doubting his ability to deliver on their business arrangement. Owen then turns to Nikita for help in finding the black box, secretly using Ari's resources. Eventually, however, Ari discovers Owen's true alliance and has him captured. Ari finally retrieves the black box and escapes to Semak's mansion after intercepting a police convoy that holds both Nikita and the black box. In the end of \\"Clean Sweep\\" it is revealed that Ari and Amanda have been working together. Ari murders Semak as he plans to take Zetrov for himself. Eventually, in order to retake Zetrov under the name of her family, Alex convinces the company's board of directors that Ari is not reliable, and the Chairman of the Board of Zetrov fires Ari from the company and Gogol. Ari is forced to go on the run with Amanda. He is last seen with Amanda in a hotel room, although he has been able to acquire one of Percy's black boxes. Nathan Colville Portrayed by Thad Luckinbill, Nathan is Alex's neighbour in their apartment building and love interest following Alex's graduation and Thom's death. Nathan, unaware of Alex's true life and current tenure as a secret government operative, quickly grew interested in her, and soon their relationship took a romantic turn‚Äîsomething Nikita warned Alex that Division would know if she proceeds. Regardless, Alex and Nathan begin a sexual relationship, though Alex, mindful of Nikita's words, feared for his safety. Alex decided to reveal the truth, but her initial attempts to explain left him assuming Alex was indebted to the Mob, until Alex finally explained she wanted to protect him from government assassins. Nathan somewhat didn't believe her and left. He later returned to Alex, just as Jaden was visiting. He sarcastically commented that she must be another government assassin before walking out the door. When Alex and Jaden get into a fight about this, and Jaden is about to kill Alex, Nathan steps in and shot Jaden in the stomach, which instantly kills her. Alex instructs Nathan to immediately pack up and leave as soon as possible, Nathan then fled to hide from Division. Nathan does not return. Sergei Semak Portrayed by Peter J. Lucas, Sergei Semak is the current CEO of Zetrov and head of Gogol, following the death of Nikolai Udinov. Semak, originally Udinov's right-hand man, approached Oversight to have Division target and kill the Udinov family so Semak could take over Zetrov and maintain better relations with the U.S. Under his tenure, Semak expanded Zetrov's operations, influence and corporate reach across the world, making the company a global empire and making him one of its most powerful men, further when he created Gogol to protect Zetrov interests. In Season 2, when Anton Kochenko, a top-level Zetrov executive and the company's spokesperson, is killed, Semak personally becomes involved in the fallout and presses for results and the identity of the assassin from Ari Tasarov; who he \\"promotes\\" to take over his security (following Semak's execution of his predecessor for insubordination). Upon finding out the assassin was Alex; who is the rightful head of Zetrov, Semak immediately orders Tasarov to put together a secret team of agents to locate and kill her‚ÄîSemak, fearing Alex's return would result in his losing control of Zetrov, makes it clear Tasarov's orders are no longer to capture Alex, but to shoot her on sight. Later it is revealed Semak had Katya Udinov, Nikolai's widow, spared from the original attack on the Udinov estate, as part of his deal with Percy‚Äîthe two had been in an affair before Nikolai's death, and the two secretly married in the years after the attack. Semak was later forced to publicly acknowledge Alex and openly fight with her for leadership of Zetrov. It is at this time he is betrayed, shot and killed by Ari, as part of his own plan to take over the company himself. Madeline Pierce Portrayed by Alberta Watson, who also played the same character named Madeline in the former La Femme Nikita series. Madeline is a US Senator and used to be a member of Oversight (until the group was completely taken down in \\"Clean Sweep\\"). She is the mother of Sean Pierce, who is very loyal to her and does whatever it takes to protect her. In \\"Sanctuary\\" Madeline along with her colleagues was captured as hostages by Guardians. The rest of Oversight members were killed according to Percy's order, but Sean and Nikita managed to save her. At the end of the episode Madeline, Sean, Nikita and Michael teamed up for destroying Division. She was later killed in the episode \\"Wrath\\" by a car bomb set by Nicholas Brandt, an old foe of Nikita. Sonya Portrayed by Lyndie Greenwood, Sonya is the British head technician at Division, and Birkhoff's replacement, as well as serving as Amanda's aide. Sonya was later developed as a love interest for Birkhoff. When Birkhoff returned to Division in the Season 2 finale, Sonya and Birkhoff met to commence repairs of the damaged systems, and despite rules of fraternization between Division agents, Birkhoff kissed her in front of the entire operations floor. It was recently revealed that she's from East Africa most likely from a former British colony. Sonya was a kind person to people. She was captured by Ann a rogue Division Cleaner.

The current structure was built in 1925 as the club's third home on the same site. Club history The Columbia Club was originally formed on February 13, 1889, by a group of prominent local Republicans as the Harrison Marching Society as they had supported the presidential campaign of Benjamin Harrison. After the election, the Society acquired a clubhouse on Monument Circle and changed its name to the Columbia Club to continue operation as a private club. Quickly growing its membership, the Club evolved into the premier private club in Indianapolis. The Club is no longer partisan and now numbers in its ranks a great many Democrats and members of other parties. According to the Club, the founders of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (home of the Indianapolis 500) met there to discuss its construction. In 1984, secret meetings were held there to negotiate the move of the Baltimore Colts to Indianapolis. The Club has hosted every Republican president since Benjamin Harrison while in office or as a candidate and serves as temporary living quarters for many Indiana state legislators during the legislative session. In addition to the thousands of business leaders and politicians who have been members, the Club has also included many artists and musicians including Hoagy Carmichael and T.C. Steele. It is located in the Washington Street-Monument Circle Historic District. Building history The current home of the Columbia Club was built on Monument Circle in 1925 by local architecture firm Rubush & Hunter. The club razed their five-story home built in 1898 for the current ten-story structure to accommodate their growing membership and popularity. A smaller club had existed on the site from 1889 to 1898. As one of the most prominent and architecturally significant buildings in downtown Indianapolis, the Columbia Club was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Architectural features The Columbia Club showcases many hallmarks of the Gothic Revival style, including a multi-story oriel window, as well as Tudor influences seen in the window arches. The building also features relief panels carved in Indiana Limestone by Alexander Sangernebo, who made limestone carvings for other historic buildings on Monument Circle. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Inside the Columbia Club are numerous works of Hoosier art and historic artifact, including items from the Benjamin Harrison presidential campaign and part of the Lincoln family china collection. After a 2004 acquisition of paintings from longtime friendly rival, the Indianapolis Athletic Club, the Columbia Club added to its existing collection and now boasts a particularly large gallery of works by members of the Hoosier Group of painters, including T.C. Steele.

A small portion of Cottage Home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places while a larger area is listed on the state and local levels. Known for its preponderance of \\"cottage- style\\" homes built with strong Victorian influences, Cottage Home has historically been a working class neighborhood. Numerous industrial buildings are also scattered throughout the district, providing a base of economic activity. Today, however, many of these buildings are vacant, providing a special challenge to preservation and urban renewal efforts. After a period of urban decay in the 1960s and '70s, common to inner city neighborhoods in Indianapolis, Cottage Home has since stemmed the loss of historic buildings and is now home to a flourishing and diverse community. Key to the area's improvement was the establishment of the Cottage Home Neighborhood Association (CHNA) in 1984, whose efforts halted the razing of residential properties by local businesses, and a renewed interest in restoring the area's homes. The Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house and store are the most architecturally significant buildings in the district, anchoring the district's addition to the National Register in 1990. Cottage Home was further expanded to its largest bounds at the state level in 1995 and local designation of the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house and store followed. In 2008, the state bounds, encompassing 320 parcels and 292 properties, were designated as a Conservation District by the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission. Geography Cottage Home is located on the near east side of Indianapolis. The neighborhood is bordered to the west by the Chatham Arch & Massachusetts Avenue Historic District, to the north by the Windsor Park neighborhood, to the east by Arsenal Technical High School and the Woodruff Place Historic District and to the south by the Holy Cross neighborhood. Most of the district is built on a traditional grid plan, broken up by Pogue's Run cutting across the southeast portion. A map of Cottage Home. The purple outline is the boundary of both the state and local districts. The green outline is the boundary of the National Register district. The blue outline encloses the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe House and Store, which is excluded from the local district. The orange lines mark the locations of historic stone curbs. The red lines mark the locations of historic stone curbs and brick sidewalks. National Register boundaries The originally drawn boundaries of the Cottage Home Historic District, still the current boundaries of the National Register district, are much smaller than the state and locally designated boundaries. Comprising the 700 block of Dorman Street, 1102 to 1130 East St. Clair Street and 802 and 806 North Highland Avenue, 23 properties are included in the National Register district. Anchored by the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house and store, these boundaries also include the Vonnegut & Bohn doubles and sixteen other houses. This area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1990. Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs State and local boundaries Cottage Home received designation as a historic district at the state level on the Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures in 1995 with expanded boundaries. In 2008, the neighborhood worked with the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission to develop a conservation plan and became a locally designated Conservation District, following the boundaries of the state listing. The Cottage Home Conservation District is bounded by a CSX right-of-way between I-70/I-65 and Dorman Street to the west, 10th Street to the north, Oriental Street to the east, and Michigan Street to the south. As the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house and store had already been designated locally by the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission, the local boundaries do not include those two properties, while the state boundaries do. Including the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house and store, Cottage Home contains 320 parcels and 292 buildings, over half of which are residential. History Louisa Magruder sitting in front of her home at 554 Highland Avenue. Prior to development as an Indianapolis neighborhood, the area now known as Cottage Home was part of two farms owned by prominent Indiana citizens. The land south of St. Clair Street belonged to Noah Noble, fifth Governor of Indiana who bankrupted the State with the passage of the Indiana Mammoth Internal Improvement Act. The land north of St. Clair Street belonged to Robert Hanna, who was a member of the Indiana constitutional convention and succeeded Noble's brother James as U.S. Senator upon James's death in 1831. After the railroad reached Indianapolis in 1847, the resulting economic boom pushed the city's boundaries out beyond the Mile Square. By the end of the Civil War, the arsenal, which would later be adapted for use as Arsenal Technical High School, was built on the eastern border of Cottage Home and the streetcar reached St. Clair Street just a few blocks to the west, providing access to jobs for the area's residents. The Noble farm was platted in 1865 and the Hanna farm in 1868, and both additions were annexed to the City of Indianapolis in 1870. After annexation, Cottage Home experienced strong growth in housing. Almost 400 households were located in the area by 1900, nearly three-quarters of which were being rented. Initially, most of the residents of Cottage Home were immigrant families or African American, though that percentage steadily declined into the twentieth century. Among these early residents was Louisa Magruder, daughter of Tom Magruder, the slave of Gov. Noble who is said to be the titular inspiration for Uncle Tom's Cabin. This strong growth in housing and population was accompanied by an expansion in the commercial and industrial sectors, due to the neighborhood's proximity to the railroad and streetcar. By 1915, new construction largely ended, and the architectural character of the area was established. Indianapolis continued to experience strong growth through the 1960s and 70s, but the population of Cottage Home and other inner-city neighborhoods was reduced by migration to the suburbs in the process of urban sprawl. As Cottage Home was within the flood zone of Pogue's Run, residents began to leave for other areas. In addition, I-70/I-65's construction required demolishing homes on the west side of the neighborhood, leaving it bordered with a high-traffic roadway. By the 1980s, more than 100 houses had been demolished in Cottage Home. A renewed interest in historic restoration and the establishment of the Cottage Home Neighborhood Association (CHNA) in 1984 reversed the demolition trend; the area has since lost only six homes to fire or demolition. CHNA led the effort for the unique neighborhood to be designated as a historic district, achieving addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, the State Register in 1995, and city designation in 2008. Today, while infill has been slow, the neighborhood continues as a vibrant and active community. Architecture Cottage Home derives its name from a subdivision in the northern part of the neighborhood. It is also the predominant form of architecture in the district, Queen Anne and Folk Victorian-style cottages. All historic residential properties fall under these styles, with the notable exception of the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house, which combines Romanesque Revival features with Queen Anne architecture. Commercial and industrial buildings in the district were usually built either in the Italianate tradition or the Art Deco style, depending on their age. Residences in Cottage Home are typified by spindlework porches, turned posts, gable ornaments, variegated and fishscale shingling and gingerbread trim, features often found in Queen Anne and Folk Victorian homes. These types of detailing were placed on simple folk homes as an inexpensive way to provide varied design and personalization. This practice was common in Victorian-era working-class neighborhoods such as Cottage Home. Notable features As a working-class neighborhood, Cottage Home comprises primarily modest residential designs, with the notable exception of the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house. A rich history as a thriving Indianapolis neighborhood, however, gives the district additional significance. Below are a few of the most notable properties and features of Cottage Home. Ruskaup- Ratcliffe House and Store The Ruskaup-Ratcliffe House in the early 1890s. The architectural focal point of Cottage Home, the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe House and Store were both built by Frederick Ruskaup. Ruskaup was a German immigrant who came to the United States in 1869 at the age of 25. By 1875, he purchased two lots on Dorman Street in present-day Cottage Home. At 713 Dorman Street, he opened a grocery store and the Ruskaup family lived upstairs. He added as L-shaped addition to the north and east of the store in 1885. The success of his grocery store and many rental properties allowed Ruskaup in 1892 to hire the prominent Indianapolis architecture firm Vonnegut & Bohn to design a house for his family next door at 711 Dorman Street. Descendants of Frederick Ruskaup lived at the house and operated the store until 1957, when it was sold to the Ratcliffe sisters. The properties were sold again in the 1980s to their current owner. The house has been restored and the store has had extensive facade improvements. The Ruskaup grocery store was built in the Italianate style, common to Midwestern buildings in the 1870s. Attic windows and decorative brackets in the cornice line give the store detail accentuating the first-floor stone pilasters and second-story window hoods. The architects combined Romanesque Revival details with Queen Anne architecture to create a unique style for the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe House. As Romanesque Revival drew inspiration from traditional German architecture, it was popular among German immigrants such as Frederick Ruskaup. Vonnegut & Bohn, ethnic German Americans, drew from German influences, as evidenced by their later masterpiece, the Athen√¶um (Das Deutsche Haus). In contrast to the neighboring store, and reflective of the houses being constructed on Dorman Street, the architects drew on the mainstream Queen Anne style for the basic massing of the house. This is shown in the asymmetrical facade, with a wrap-around porch and tower. The Romanesque Revival is expressed in the varied window sizes, stone detailing in the cornice and window hoods, and a stepped front gable. The interior is equally impressive, featuring inlaid floors and a cartouche above the entryways to the stairwell and dining room, all trademarks of Vonnegut & Bohn designs. The original imported stained glass windows were removed from the house in the early 1980s. Vonnegut & Bohn Doubles, 702-720 Dorman Street Another legacy of Frederick Ruskaup, the series of duplexes known as the Vonnegut & Bohn Doubles provide great historic and architectural significance to the National Register district and neighborhood as a whole. In 1888, Ruskaup's business success prompted him to build a series of several duplexes as rental properties. Most of the doubles, as well as two cottages in the 700 block of Dorman Street burned to the ground in October 1890. Ruskaup quickly rebuilt, including brick fire walls in the three southernmost doubles across from his grocery store and future house. The architecture firm of Vonnegut & Bohn was hired to design the houses, who Ruskaup later hired to build his own house. However, in contrast to the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe House and other Vonnegut & Bohn buildings, these duplexes possess a more mainstream Italianate appearance. Symmetrical facades, hipped roofs, and full-length, gabled spindlework porches are common to the Queen Anne style and all five duplexes. The Vonnegut & Bohn Doubles are also notable, along with the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe House, as the oldest extant Vonnegut & Bohn-designed residences in Indianapolis. Dorman Street Saloon, 901 Dorman Street While architecturally plain, the Dorman Street Saloon has long played an important role in the lives of Cottage Home residents. The corner structure was originally built as a house in the early 1870s. Operating as a grocery in the 1910s, the business became a bar in the late 1910s. After the end of Prohibition, it was known as Anacker's 9th Street Tavern, The Mahogany Bar (still knicknamed \\"The Hog\\"), and May's Lounge, the Dorman Street Saloon has served for years as a popular neighborhood meeting place. A popular rumor claims that infamous criminal John Dillinger frequented the Dorman Street Saloon while preparing for his heist of the Massachusetts Avenue State Bank, only a couple blocks away. Kroger Grocery & Bakery Company Building At , the Kroger Grocery & Bakery Company Building is easily the largest building in Cottage Home. In 1929, the expanding Kroger Grocery & Bakery Company constructed this warehouse to meet the growing demands of its Indianapolis stores. Large casement windows and pilasters are among the features of this Art Deco industrial building. Today, the building houses the corporate headquarters of Marian, Inc. and is often used as a meeting place for the Cottage Home Neighborhood Association. Sidewalks and curbs When Cottage Home was built, high-quality brick sidewalks and limestone curbs lined the streets. Today, some of these sidewalks and curbs remain and are cherished by the neighborhood as important features of the historic district. Brick sidewalks remain on portions of Highland Avenue and Dorman Street, including in front of the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house and store. Stone curbs can still be found on portions of Highland Avenue, Dorman Street, Stillwell Street, and Oriental Street. Neighborhood The Cottage Home Neighborhood Association has sponsored an annual block party since 1984, which has several times been named the best block party of Indianapolis by local alt weekly NUVO. Cottage Home also participates in Near East Side Community Organization (NESCO), a coalition of near east side Indianapolis neighborhoods and not-for-profits promoting community development. Residents of Cottage Home are within the bounds of Indianapolis Public Schools, attending Washington Irving Elementary School, Emma Donnan Middle School, and Arsenal Technical High School.

Biography Sen. Harry S. Truman visits his mother in Grandview, Missouri, after being nominated the Democratic candidate for vice president (July 1944) Martha Ellen Young was born in Jackson County, Missouri, on November 25, 1852, to Solomon Young, a successful farmer who also had a business running Conestoga wagon trains along the Overland Trail, and his wife Harriet Louisa Gregg. Members of the family were southern sympathizers in the American Civil War and several relatives served in the Confederate Army. In later life, Martha told of how a band of Union-supporting Jayhawkers destroyed her family's farm one day in 1861, then came again in 1863 when the family was forced to evacuate by General Order 11 and required to move to Platte County, Missouri until after the war. This harsh treatment left Martha with a lifelong resentment for the winning Union side in the war. She was well-known for her Confederate sympathies (a story made the rounds that when she first visited the White House in 1945, she refused to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom, but her family denied this account.) Meyer Berger, \\"Mother Truman-Portrait of a Rebel; She is closer to her son than most mothers. And at 93 she remains an outspoken--and unreconstructed--Southern Democrat.\\", The New York Times, June 23, 1946 (pay site).\\"Mrs. Truman at 9 Saw Strife of 1861\\", The New York Times, July 27, 1947 (pay site). Martha attended the Baptist College for Women in Lexington. She married John Anderson Truman on December 28, 1881 in Grandview, Missouri. Their first son died just a few days after birth. Their second child, another son, was Harry S. Truman, born on May 8, 1884. The child's middle name was the subject of some disagreement between the parents. John Truman wanted it to be Shipp, after his father Anderson Shipp Truman, while Martha wanted it to be Solomon, after her father. In the end, they decided to use only the middle initial 'S' and honor both grandfathers. Two more children followed: John Vivian Truman on April 25, 1886 (who became a district director of the Federal Housing Administration in western Missouri), and Mary Jane Truman on August 12, 1889 (who was a pianist and schoolteacher). All three children worked on the family farm in Grandview. After her husband John Truman died in 1914, Martha took over the farm and ran it with the labor of her children and various hired helpers until the 1930s, when her age and increasing frailty made it impossible. Harry had entered politics after failing in business as the co-owner of a Kansas City haberdashery, rising from Jackson County Judge (county commissioner) to being elected as U. S. Senator. In 1944, he became the vice presidential running mate of Franklin D. Roosevelt. At the time of his selection, Martha Truman told the press that Truman had not wanted the position and that she would have rather seen him stay in the Senate.\\"They Shoved Harry Into It, Says Sen. Truman's Mother\\", Associated Press in St. Petersburg Times, July 22, 1944. On April 12, 1945, President Roosevelt died and Harry Truman was sworn in as president.

Biography The family began in the Americas with a Dutch settler to New Amsterdam, Dirck Jansen Hoogland, who arrived in 1657. He married Annetje Hans Bergen, the daughter of Hans Hansen Bergen and Sarah Rapalje. (Sarah Rapelje was born in Fort Orange (now Albany) 1625 to Joris Jansen Rapalje [1604-1662] and Catalyntje Trico [1605-1689]. Sarah‚Äôs parents had come over from Holland to New Netherland on the first ship to bring the first immigrants to New Netherland in 1624, Sarah was the first woman of European descent born on the island of Manhattan.) Joseph Christoffel Hoagland was born on June 19, 1841 in Ohio to Andrew Hoagland. He had a brother, Cornelius Nevius Hoagland (1828‚Äì1898). In 1865, Joseph Hoagland married Caroline C. Matlack, daughter of John Matlack of Dayton, Ohio. They had three children, Raymond Hoagland (1866‚Äì1927), John A. Hoagland and Fanny L. Hoagland. In 1866 Joseph Christoffel Hoagland, his brother Cornelius Nevius Hoagland and Thomas Biddle organized the Royal Chemical Company, which later became the Royal Baking Powder Company. In 1868 they moved to New York, where John H. Seal and William Ziegler became agents of the company and later shareholders. Joseph C. Hoagland lived on Fifth Avenue, and worked at 171 Dwayne Street where he manufactured a brand that made millions of dollars. A culinary revolution was started by the powder that made cake rise and gave it more flavour. Hoagland excelled in marketing and branding their product with such logos such as \\"absolutely pure\\" that rendered it better advertised than other bakers. By the close of 19th century Royal Baking Powder was on six continents, a truly international brand. Hoagland was one of the \\"kings of New York\\" business world. He had an acrimonious split with his business partner, William Ziegler in 1888. Joseph C. Hoagland died on December 8, 1899.

It was part of the Coast Defenses of Portland, later renamed the Harbor Defenses of Portland, a command which protected Portland's port and naval anchorage 1904-1950. After its closure, it was redeveloped into Fort Williams Park. History=Endicott Period Entrance to Fort Williams, circa 1907 Children look on as a heavy gun is moved to Fort Williams via South Portland's trolley tracks. Battery Blair 12-inch disappearing gun emplacement in 2016 with Portland Head Light A 14-acre purchase near Portland Head Light in 1872 served to establish a sub-post to Fort Preble located at Spring Point. This fortification became known as Fort Williams on April 13, 1899, by order of Army Headquarters (General Order No. 17, Headquarters of the Army, Adjutant General's Office, Washington, D.C.). It was named for Brevet Major General Seth Williams. By 1903, the fort had grown to 90.45 acres.Fort Williams article at FortWiki.com. Retrieved 22 March 2015. The Board of Fortifications, often called the Endicott Board, recommended a comprehensive program of new fortifications in 1885. Fort Williams was one of the results. It first test-fired its guns in 1898, shortly before the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and was complete by 1906. As built, the fort contained three batteries: Battery Sullivan (two 10-inch guns on disappearing carriages), Battery DeHart (three 10-inch disappearing guns), and Battery Hobart (one 6-inch Armstrong gun), all built between 1896 and 1898. Three other 2-gun batteries were added later: Battery Blair, 2 12-inch disappearing guns (1903); Battery Garesch√©, 2 6-inch disappearing guns (1906); and Battery Keyes, 2 3-inch rapid-firing guns (1906), the latter to guard a minefield.Berhow, pp. 346-367 The remains of a wharf for loading mine planters can be seen near Battery Keyes.Berhow, pp. 336-345 An underground bunker for the submarine mine system, later used in Cold War civil defense, is near Battery Hobart. Searchlights were also mounted at some of these batteries; the counterweight for a disappearing searchlight tower (it \\"disappeared\\" when folded down) remains on site. Between 1900 and 1911, most of Fort Williams' support buildings were constructed, including enlisted barracks, non- commissioned officers' quarters, commissioned officers' quarters (Officers' Row), hospital, gymnasium, post exchange, bakery, abattoir, commissary, laundry, chapel, fire station, Fort headquarters, and other buildings including garages and storage sheds. Infrastructure included an electrical substation, a bunkered telephone switchboard, and pumps and underground storage tanks for gasoline and fuel oil. Recreational facilities included a baseball diamond with concrete bleachers, and clubs (the officers' club utilized the already existing Goddard mansion, purchased by the government and added to the property). In 1913, the 6-inch Armstrong gun of Battery Hobart was removed and transferred to Hawaii.Berhow, p. 202 World War I During World War I, the fort was fully manned by artillery companies of the Coast Artillery Corps and Maine National Guard troops. Anti-aircraft guns were added to the defenses during this time. In 1917, the two 10-inch guns of Battery Sullivan and both 6-inch guns of Battery Garesch√© were removed to be shipped to the Western Front in France, but of the four guns only one of the 6-inch guns was actually sent to France. The 10-inch guns were intended to serve as railway artillery, but few guns of this type were so mounted, none saw action in France (though some were mounted there), and the 10-inch railway gun program was abandoned soon after the war.US Army Railway Artillery in WWI A history of the Coast Artillery in World War I states that none of the regiments in France equipped with 6-inch guns completed training in time to see action before the Armistice.History of the Coast Artillery Corps in WWI The three 10-inch guns of Battery DeHart were also dismounted, but were soon remounted. After the war, the 10-inch guns were returned to Fort Williams, but Battery Garesch√© remained disarmed. Interwar A plaque next to one of the fort's remaining buildings states that it housed towed 155 mm guns following World War I. These weapons, based on the French 155 mm GPF gun used by the Coast Artillery in that war, were adopted to introduce mobility to US coast defenses. Circular concrete platforms called \\"Panama mounts\\" were constructed at Fort Baldwin in Phippsburg, Maine and at Biddeford Pool to allow more effective use of these guns.FortWiki article on Biddeford Pool Military Reservation Battery D of the 8th Coast Artillery, with four of these weapons (most likely from Fort Williams) was deployed to Fort Baldwin from early 1942 to 17 January 1944.FortWiki article on Fort Baldwin Another battery of two 155 mm guns was deployed to the Biddeford Pool Military Reservation from 1942 through 1945.Biddeford Pool Military Reservation at FortWiki.com World War II and postwar Fort Williams served as the headquarters of the Harbor Defenses of Portland throughout World War II, by the middle of which the last of the coastal artillery pieces (except Battery Keyes' two 3-inch guns) were removed due to age and obsolescence. In early World War II the major units garrisoning the Harbor Defenses of Portland were the 8th Coast Artillery Regiment of the Regular Army and the 240th Coast Artillery Regiment of the Maine National Guard.Berhow, pp. 467-471 By 1945 the fort was replaced by the 16-inch Battery Steele on Peaks Island and a few other more recent batteries. Fort Williams received its last guns in 1943, in the form of four 90 mm dual- purpose guns of Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat Battery (AMTB) 961, the emplacements for two of which remain a bit south of the lighthouse. With little threat to the East Coast from surface ships by 1944, the coast defenses were drawn down and the Coast Artillery regiments reduced to battalions or their personnel were reassigned. In January 1950, with the dissolution of the Coast Artillery Corps, Fort Williams' mission was officially changed from a harbor defense post to a logistical and administrative support installation for all military units and personnel in the State of Maine. Radar station In 1950-51 Fort Williams hosted a station of the Air Defense Command's Lashup Radar Network. The station was called Site L-2 and had a TPS-1B radar operated by the 657th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron from January-September 1951.Lashup Radar Network at Radomes.org The radar station was deactivated in October 1951 and Fort Williams became an Air National Guard training site.Fort Williams Lashup station at Radomes.org Other Air Force units stationed at Fort Williams included the 127th AC&W; Squadron September 1951-September 1953 and the 677th AC&W; Squadron September 1953-April 1954.Lashup Radar System at FortWiki Closure On Saturday, June 30, 1962, Fort Williams officially closed and was turned over to the General Services Administration to be sold. The property was sold to the Town of Cape Elizabeth on December 1, 1964. Many of the fort's buildings were gradually torn down, though several structures remain, either intact or as preserved ruins. Most of the concrete bunkers and gun emplacements were backfilled, although Batteries Keyes, Hobart, and Garesche survive relatively intact, and the outlines of all the other emplacements are preserved on the surface. One of the two emplacements of Battery Blair was recently partly unearthed again, with its upper surfaces cleaned and painted and interpretive signage added; plans are being made to restore Blair's second emplacement in like manner. Present After proposals ranging from a Coastal Science Park to low-income housing, the Cape Elizabeth Town Council designated Fort Williams on July 23, 1979, as Fort Williams Park. The park has been maintained for residents and non-residents for a small parking fee. Recreational facilities include two tennis courts, a basketball court, baseball diamond, a course for physical fitness, picnic tables and cookout facilities, a picnic shelter, a children's garden, and recreational opportunities for walking, running, and dogwalking. All visitors to Portland Head Light pass through the park, adding to its visibility. The Beach to Beacon 10K is one of the park's largest events of the year.

The 2009 release was Saisse's first on Koch Records. It was produced by Saisse and Roy Hendrickson and was nominated for the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. Overview Philippe Saisse dedicated At World's Edge to his late father Maurice Saisse. This album has African and Latin influences. The album was nominated for the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album but lost to the Joe Zawinul album 75. This was Saisse's first Grammy nomination. The other nominees were Urbanus by Stefon Harris, Sounding Point by Julian Lage, and Big Neighborhood by Mike Stern. Recording Work on the album began in Saisse's Scarsdale, New York basement studio, but he had to relocate to Los Angeles after a flood destroyed the studio. The album's core musicians, drummer Simon Phillips, bassist Pino Palladino, and guitarist Jeff Golub, recorded with Saisse in Los Angeles, but not all of the album was recorded on site. The guest musicians recorded their parts where ever they were, then sent them to Saisse who produced the pieces together. The work was then sent to Tokyo where engineer Goh Hotoda completed the mixing. Selected tracks Saisse's mid-recording forced cross-country move was the inspiration for much of the album. \\"Billy's Blues\\", which features Jason Golley on both trumpet and flugelhorn, was inspired by Saisse's friend Bill Howell. Saisse stayed with Howell prior to his move west, the location of Howell's home was the inspiration for the track \\"Topanga Moon Dance\\". The album opens with \\"From Nowhere to Now Here\\", the piece tells the story of his journey west. The track \\"Assante Sana\\" exemplifies Saisse's world view of music. This Latin flavored piece feature the vocals of Ang√©lique Kidjo from Benin, Africa. Critical reception Jonathan Widran of Allmusic called At World's Edge \\"one of the most exciting and explosive contemporary jazz sets of 2009\\".

Its borders were Devon Avenue on the north, Harlem Avenue on the west, Western Avenue to the east, and North Avenue to the south. This region comprised most of what is now known as the Chicago's Northwest Side including the entirety of the following community areas: Jefferson Park, North Park, Albany Park, Irving Park, Avondale, Hermosa, Belmont-Cragin, Montclare, Portage Park, as well as parts of Forest Glen, West Ridge, Lincoln Square, North Center, Logan Square, West Town, Humboldt Park, Austin, Dunning, the suburb of Norridge, the suburb of Harwood Heights, and Norwood Park. During its brief history it developed from unpopulated wildlife to a largely rural community with a number of suburban villages. However, due to infrastructure limitations, legislative incentives and the lure of better municipal services it, along with numerous adjoining townships, agreed to be annexed into the city of Chicago, creating the largest city in the United States at that time. History The township was founded in 1850.http://genealogytrails.com/ill/cook/jeffersontwp.html In the 1850s, Chicago was still a walkable urban area well contained within a radius of the center. After the City of Chicago incorporated in 1837, the surrounding townships followed suit through 1870. After 1850, Cook County was divided into basic governmental entities, which were designated as townships as a result of the new Illinois Constitution. Illinois's permissive incorporation law empowered any community of 300 resident citizens to petition the Illinois legislature for incorporation as a municipality under a municipal charter with more extensive powers to provide services and tax local residents. Jefferson Township was created by the Illinois General Assembly in 1861 within Cook County. This empowered the township to better govern the provision of services to its increasingly suburban residents. Following the June 29, 1889 elections, several suburban townships voted to be annexed to the city, which offered better services, such as improved water supply, sewerage, and fire and police protection. After the 1889 annexation Chicago was able to leverage efficiencies as the largest United States city in area and second largest in population. The township has no current governmental structure or functions, other than being used by the Cook County Assessor's office for taxation valuation and record keeping purposes.

The Roman Basilica-style church previously served as a Catholic parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo. The church held its final full mass on January 1, 2008 and currently sits secured but deteriorating. History This church is the second to the parish, and was built in response to demand for a larger place of worship. The building, a Roman Basilica style, is based on the design of Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome, being one-third as large. The interior of the church contains 12 granite columns, a coffered ceiling, 15 murals, 26 rondos, and a fresco. In 1930 the nave was raised to 60 ft. and a three-stage, 110 ft. bell tower was added. Moving the Church In October 2008, \\"Mary Our Queen\\" parish in Norcross, Georgia expressed interest in moving the church 900 miles south to serve as their new house of worship. Their $16 million plans call for the church to be completely deconstructed, packed, and trucked south for reassembly for continued use as a Catholic church. During the summer of 2010, \\"Mary Our Queen\\" arranged the removal of a 7 ft, 1600 lb statue of St. Gerard. The statue was broken in two while being transported to their Georgia parish. In July 2016 the 47 beautiful stained glass windows were removed from the church. The windows will be restored by Lynchburg Stained Glass and re- installed at the new \\"Mary Our Queen\\" parish in Georgia.

Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. Although a qualified lawyer, she has never practiced law. After university Bandaranayake entered academia, holding a number of senior positions at the University of Colombo, including Associate Professor of Law and the Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Colombo. She was first appointed to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in 1996, becoming Sri Lanka's first female Supreme Court Judge. Bandaranayake was appointed chief justice in May 2011 following the mandatory retirement of Asoka de Silva. Bandaranayake was controversially impeached by Parliament and then removed from office by President Mahinda Rajapaksa in January 2013. and on 28 January 2015 the government of Sri Lanka, had removed all obstacles for Bandaranayake to hold her position as the 43rd Chief Justice by the President Maithripala Sirisena, on the ground that her 2013 impeachment was unlawful and as such the appointment of Mohan Peiris, her successor, was void Ab initio. This paved the way for Bandaranayake to resume duties on 28 January 2015. She retired from the position just after one day of her reappointment on 29 January 2015 claiming support for a free and fair Judiciary in Sri Lanka. Early life Bandaranayake was born in April 1958 in Kurunegala. She is the daughter of Flora and Wilson Bandaranayake. Her mother was an English trained teacher whereas her father was a Provincial Director of Education. Bandaranayake has a sister, Renuka, who is an engineering graduate from Moratuwa university now living in Perth, Australia. When Bandaranayake was young her father changed jobs on a number of occasions and as result she studied at a number of schools: Ginigathhena Maha Vidyalaya (1962‚Äì65), Hettimulla Bandaranayake Vidyalaya (1965), Tholangamuwa Vidyalaya (1965‚Äì70), Tholangamuwa Central College (1970‚Äì72). She then studied at Anuradhapura Central College where she passed her GCE Advanced Levels in 1976. She then entered the University of Colombo's Faculty of Law, graduating in December 1980 with an upper second Bachelor of Laws honours degree. She obtained a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Colombo in October 1983. In the same year she was awarded the Commonwealth Open Scholarship and the Chevening Scholarship in 1989. She qualified as an attorney at law in September 1983. In March 1986, she obtained a PhD from the law school at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, becoming the first woman in Sri Lanka to obtain this degree in Law from a foreign university. She was also awarded the Fulbright-Hays Fellowship in 1996 and the British Council Assert Award in 1993 and 1994. Bandaranayake is married to a former corporate executive Pradeep Kariyawasam. Shaveen is their only child. Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake, her husband Pradeep Kariyawasam and son. Academic career Bandaranayake became a visiting lecturer at the University of Colombo's Faculty of Law in 1981. She held several positions in the department before being appointed Head of the Department of Law in 1987 and also served on the Judicial Service Commission of Sri Lanka. She served as acting dean of the faculty several times before being appointed dean in 1992. In 1993 she became Associate Professor of Law \\"on merit\\". She acted as vice- chancellor on a number of occasions. Legal career After her admission to the bar, Bandaranayake worked as an attorney-at-law of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. She was controversially appointed to the Supreme Court on 30 October 1996 by President Chandrika Kumaratunga on the recommendation of Mr G. L. Peiris, then Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. She was the first female justice of the Supreme Court. Bandaranayake had never served as a judge and she had never practiced law. Her appointment to the Supreme Court led to protests from lawyers and judges. She soon became the most senior Supreme Court Judge. Bandaranayake served as acting chief justice on 11 occasions. In 2011 President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed Bandaranayake as Chief Justice, succeeding Asoka de Silva who retired on 17 May 2011. She took her oaths before President Rajapaksa on 18 May 2011. Impeachment An impeachment motion against Bandaranayake signed by 117 UPFA MPs was handed to Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa on 1 November 2012. Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa revealed the 14 charges against Bandaranayake on 6 November 2012 which included failing to disclose financial interests, abuse of power and disregarding the constitution. Bandaranayake has denied the charges and refused to resign from her position. An eleven-member parliamentary select committee (PSC) consisting of seven ruling party MPs including Mr.Rajitha Senaratne, Mr. Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Mr.Susil Premjayante and four opposition MPs was appointed to investigate in to the impeachment charges. Impeachment hearings were held on 23 November 2012, 4 December 2012 and 6 December 2012 when Bandaranayake walked out of the hearing. The opposition MPs withdrew from the PSC on 7 December 2012. The PSC's report was presented to Parliament on 8 December 2012. The PSC found that three of five charges against Bandaranayake had been proven and this was enough to remove her from office. She was found guilty of impropriety in a property transaction (1st charge), having undeclared bank accounts (4th charge) and conflict of interest in a legal case involving her husband (5th charge). She was found guilty on the second and third charges; the remaining nine charges were disregarded by the PSC as the others were enough to remove her from office. Opposition MPs rejected the PSC report, saying \\"This was not an inquiry it was an inquisition\\". The PSC's report will now be sent to President Rajapaksa and then Parliament will vote on the impeachment motion in the new year. The Supreme Court ruled on 1 January 2013 that the PSC had no power to investigate allegations against the chief justice and the impeachment was therefore unconstitutional while she was still in the office because she was dismissed from her position on 13 January 2013. Bandaranayake appealed against the PSC and on 7 January 2013 the Court of Appeal quashed the PSC's findings. The impeachment motion against Bandaranayake was debated by Parliament on 10 and 11 January 2013. The motion was passed by Parliament with 155 MPs voting for and 49 MPs voting against it. Bandaranayake was removed from office on 13 January 2013 after President Mahinda Rajapaksa ratified the impeachment motion passed by Parliament. Bandaranayake was replaced as chief justice by former Attorney General Mohan Peiris. and later on 28 January 2015 She was reinstated into her office of the Chief Justice by President Maithripala Sirisena after issuing marching orders on her successor, provided that her impeachment was illegal. Legal grounds for reinstatement What transpired on 28 January 2015 was due to a procedural impropriety on the part of the Parliament, which subsequently became a legal impediment to validity of the executive order by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. This was rectified by his successor, President Maithripala Sirisena. On 6 November 2013, 116 members of Parliament tabled a motion that sought to set up a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate on 14 charges that had been brought against her. Accordingly, the PSC was set up and had several sittings. They concluded their inquiry, finding her guilty of 3 of the 14 charges and reported to the Speaker recommending the removal of Dr. Bandaranayake from the Office of the Chief Justice. The Parliament debated the findings on 9 and 10 January 2013 and decided to vote for the impeachment on 11 January 2013. Due to an error on the part of the government, instead of an address of parliament to the president empowering him to remove the Chief Justice, Parliament on 11 January 2013, voted on a motion of impeachment, that sought to set up a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate 14 charges that had been brought against her, the problem was, that motion had already been voted upon on 6 November 2012. It was this same motion that had been included on the Order Paper two months earlier, when the UPFA controlled Parliament was preparing to impeachment her. On 11 January M. A. Sumanthiran MP, raised the matter and the Speaker adjourned the House for 10 mins to seek clarification. In blatant disregard to Parliamentary Procedure he noted that the original motion seeking to set up a PSC 'would suffice' and proceeded with the vote. Mahinda Rajapaksa ratified the impeachment motion passed by Parliament. However, in accordance with Article 107[2] of the constitution of Sri Lanka, if a judge is found guilty, Parliament must present an address to the President, requesting him to remove the judge.http://www.supremecourt.lk/images/stories/supreme_court/constitution17th.pdf On the contrary what Parliament sent President Rajapakse was the motion of impeachment calling for the setting up of a second PSC and it did not empower President Rajapaksa to remove Dr. Bandaranayake according to the terms of the constitution. In essence, President Mahinda Rajapaksa acted without legal authority to remove Bandaranayake, eroding the sacking of its legal validity. Effectively no vacancy of the office of Chief Justice was created. Based on this technical problem, on 27 January 2015 President Sirisena informed Mohan Peiris that the 2013 impeachment of Dr. Bandaranayake was unlawful and as such the appointment of Mohan Peiris was void Ab initio. This removed all obstacles for Dr. Bandaranayake to hold her position as the 43rd Chief Justice and paved the way for her to resume duties on 28 January 2015. She resigned from the post on the following day and was succeeded by K. Sripavan the most senior judge of the Supreme Court.

Life Sophia Camille Truszkowska was born in Kalisz, Poland in 1825, the eldest of seven children of Joseph and Josephine Rudzi√±ska Truszkowska. Her days as a young student were characterized by schoolwork and reading, as well as daily Mass, and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. At the same time, her compassion for the underprivileged grew as she gained invaluable insight into the social ills and issues of her time from her father, a juvenile court judge. When Sophia was twelve years old, her father was appointed Registrar of Deeds, and the family moved to Warsaw. At the age of sixteen, Sophia contracted tuberculosis.Foley O.F.M., Leonard. \\"Blessed Mary Angela Truszkowska\\", Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons and Feast, (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media The family physician recommended a rest in Switzerland to restore her health. After a year, Sophia returned to Warsaw and left boarding school in order to study privately at home. With access to her father's vast library collection, she continued her study of Latin and her already fluent knowledge of French. She also pursued studies in contemporary philosophy, ethics, and social thought. At one point, Sophia had considered joining a cloistered community of Sisters, but soon joined the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and began ministering as a lay woman to the abandoned children and homeless on the streets of Warsaw. In time, she opened a shelter to give comfort and aid to this vulnerable population. At the suggestion of her spiritual director, Capuchin Franciscan Father Honorat Kozminski, she joined the secular Third Order of St. Francis, taking the name of Angela. In 1855 she rented a small house near the Church of the Virgin Mary for the orphaned girls and elderly women whom she gathered off the streets.\\"Blessed Mary Angela\\", Museum and Archives of Mary Angela Truszkoska It became known as the \\"Institute of Miss Truszkowska\\". Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Felix of Cantalice Sophia, who was now known as Mother Angela, decided to consecrate herself totally to God and forged a new religious community steeped in the values and ideals of Saint Francis of Assisi. Due to an increasing number of women and children, it was necessary for Sophia to find a larger home for the Institute of Miss Truszkowska. Sophia and Clothilde left their homes to live at the Institute and care for the residents there. On the Feast of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, November 21, 1855, Sophia, who was known by her lay tertiary name of Angela, and her cousin Clothilde Ciechanowska, praying before an icon of Our Lady of Czestochowa, solemnly dedicated themselves to do the will of Our Lady's Son, Jesus Christ. For the Felician Sisters, this day is considered the official founding day of the \\"Congregation of the Sisters of St. Felix of Cantalice\\". This new community embodied the active-contemplative model of St. Felix of Cantalice, the first Capuchin Franciscan to be canonized. In 1857, she and several associates took the Franciscan habit. Sophia took the new name of Mary Angela. The Sisters were often called the ‚ÄúSisters of Saint Felix‚Äù or ‚ÄúFelicians‚Äù by the people of Warsaw, becoming known as the \\"Felician Sisters\\", the name that is commonly used today. The sisters expanded their work among the Greek Catholics in Podlasie, where she established a number of houses in which the sisters conducted centers for peasant children. with the outbreak of the January Insurrection (1863) the centers were converted into hospitals where the wounded rebel soldiers received care. Mother Angela was scarcely forty-four years old when she withdrew from active leadership in her Congregation due to increasing deafness.\\"Mother Mary Angela Truszkowska\\", Felician Sisters, Lodi, New Jersey She saw the order grow and expand, including missions to the United States among the sons and daughters of Polish immigrants.

Made up of cavalry companies from three different states, it fought primarily in the Eastern theater as part of the Army of Northern Virginia. Unit history On October 24, 1861, a special order was given merging the 2nd Mississippi Cavalry Battalion, two other Mississippi companies and an Alabama company to join together and form the Jeff Davis Cavalry Legion. The order said, ‚ÄúThe following companies will be organized into a battalion, the designation of which will be the Second Battalion of Mississippi Cavalry, Maj. William T. Martin commanding; Captain Martin's company of Mississippi cavalry, Captain Gordon's company of Mississippi cavalry, Captain Perrin's company of Mississippi cavalry, Captain Stone's company of Alabama cavalry.‚Äù. Led by Colonel Martin, the legion joined what would eventually become the Cavalry Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia. It fought in the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5th, 1862; doing surveillance of the Union movements and gaining knowledge of their dispositions. Reporting to Gen. Jeb Stuart, the report led to a flank maneuver around McClellan's army, in which two squadrons of the legion participated. Later, Stuart wrote that the legion had performed extremely well and helped him greatly. During the Seven Days Battles the legion was ordered to across the Chickahominy River. They took control of South Anna, screening the crossing of Thomas J. Jackson and his troops. After Jackson crossed, the legion went north and fought against the 42nd New York Infantry Regiment. It dislodged the Union from the position and took 3 prisoners. On September 5th, during the Maryland Campaign, the brigade of Wade Hampton crossed the Potomac River in order to retake a battery captured by the Union. The legion operated as rear guard and covered the mountain gap while the rest of the brigade followed Lee's army to Middleton; and at daylight of September 13th the legion was attacked by the pursuing Union forces. It held off the Union troops until it had to give way, buying the Confederates valuable time. \\"Martin and his men fought with their accustomed gallantry,\\" was Hampton's report. When Martin was promoted and transferred in 1863, command of the legion developed on Lt. Col. J. Frederick Waring. The composition of the legion changed several times during the war and in March 1864 it was augmented into a full regiment of 10 companies. When Hampton went to South Carolina, the legion, its brigade now led by Pierce M.B. Young, accompanied him. Serving as part of the Army of Tennessee it fought in the Carolinas Campaign and surrendered with the rest of Johnston's forces in April 1865.

He was one of the five hundred and ninety-one surviving POWs of all military services released in 1973 for return to the United States during Operation Homecoming. Early life and education Guy Gruters was born in 1942 in Sarasota, Florida, but raised in New Jersey, where he spent his childhood trapping muskrat, camping, hunting and Scouting (Eagle Scout rank awarded). He won acceptance to the United States Air Force Academy and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering science (summa cum laude, ranked 7th in his graduating class overall, #1 in Engineering Science) in 1964. He then went on to Purdue University and completed a Master of Science degree in astronautical engineering in less than one year, in 1965. Air Force service Following his graduation from Purdue, he was sent to flight school. After Undergraduate Pilot Training at Moody AFB, Georgia, he received his pilot wings in March 1966. He completed F-100 Super Sabre Combat Crew Training with the 4514th Combat Crew Training Squadron at Luke AFB, Arizona, in October 1966 and then O-1 Bird Dog Forward Air Controller Training in February 1967. Following this, he volunteered for Vietnam and served six years, more than five years of which was as a POW. During his flight operations as a Forward Air Controller in the first 10 months, Guy flew more than 400 combat missions, first for the 173rd Airborne Brigade in the O-1 Bird Dog light observation aircraft and then for the MISTY Fast FACS in the F-100F Super Sabre over North Vietnam. As a co-pilot of the two-seat F-100F, Gruters was shot down twice. The first shoot down required a parachute water landing less than offshore near the North Vietnamese city of ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi while under fire from the North Vietnamese coastal guns in November 1967. While North Vietnamese boats were prevented from intercepting the downed pilots by strafing U.S. F-4 fighter-bombers, First Lieutenant Gruters and Captain Charles Neel were rescued under heavy fire by two USAF HH-3E Jolly Green helicopter crews based away. Gruters was shot down for the second time on December 20, 1967. He and fellow pilot, Colonel Robert R. Craner ejected under inverted after losing all hydraulic control. They were captured and imprisoned in the H·ªèa L√≤ Prison (Hanoi Hilton) among other camps for over five years. Upon their initial incarceration, Gruters and Craner cared for Lance Sijan before Sijan succumbed to wounds and torture in January 1968. Gruters spent 5 years and 3 months as a prisoner of war before his release in 1973. Awards and decorations Guy Gruters' decorations include more than thirty combat awards, with two Silver Stars, two DFCs, two Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star Medal for Valor, the POW Medal, a Presidential Unit Citation, 20 Air Medals and other medals.

The 66ers were a national phenomenon that grew from a small-town team to an organization of accomplished amateur athletes receiving national and worldwide attention. Under the sponsorship of the company's owner, Frank Phillips, the team, which began playing in 1919, participated in the Amateur Athletic Union, the nation‚Äôs premier basketball league before the National Basketball Association. Between 1920 and 1950, some of the strongest basketball teams in the United States were sponsored by corporations‚ÄîPhillips 66, 20th Century Fox, Safeway Inc., Caterpillar Inc., and others. The 66ers were a perennial power in AAU basketball in the 1940s, and 1950s. The team won 11 national championships at the AAU National Tournament between 1940 and 1963, including six consecutive AAU tournament titles, from 1943 to 1948. In 1948, the 66ers combined with Adolph Rupp's \\"Fabulous Five\\" University of Kentucky team to form the U.S. team that won the Olympic basketball tournament. In almost 50 seasons, the 66ers earned 1543 wins against 271 losses. Twelve 66ers and two coaches represented the United States in Olympic tournaments, and three of them were the only amateur players to have ever played on two Olympic basketball teams. The club ceased operations in 1968. History=Team creation Phillips Petroleum was started in 1917, at the start of the oil boom. In 1919 several of Bartlesville‚Äôs local boys were returning from World War I. Some of them found jobs at Phillips and a few decided to form a Phillips basketball team. In 1920 the Phillips team began playing other corporate teams. In 1921, a group of Phillips employees, looking for some way to stay in shape during the winter months, organized a team in the Bartlesville YMCA basketball league. They played in Bartlesville and neighboring towns for several years, strictly small-time. It wasn't long, however, before a rivalry built up with Empire Oil & Gas. 1921-1942: First years in AAU The 66ers joined the Amateur Athletic Union -which featured best basketball players at that time- in 1921. The best player of the team in the 1920s was Paul Endacott who had been a college star at Kansas and was named the Amateur Athletic Union Player of the Year in 1923 (there was no NCAA tournament in those days). Paul Endacott started playing for the 66ers in 1927 being a Phillips employee. By the same year a rivalry with Phillips University of Enid who the national collegiate runner-up started to rise. Phillips 66 didn't field a team for the 1928-29 season. But the following season coinciding with the start of marketing products to the public, the Phillips' brass decided to go all out with its basketball team. Phillips University of Enid coach Lou Wilkie was hired as the first full-time coach in 1929, and several good players many from the disbanded Mid-Continent Oil Co. team were brought in. The 1929-30 team lost in the second round of the National AAU tournament, as did the next year's version. Then, with the Depression raging, Phillips dropped basketball to concentrate on survival. That strategy worked, and by 1936, Phillips was more convinced than ever that a strong basketball team would be good for business. The AAU's annual tournament drew the best players in the world, as well as thousands of fans and dozens of sports writers and broadcasters. During the 1930s, the only professional basketball teams were barnstormers like the House of David and the Harlem Globetrotters. In all those years the 66ers played against teams fielded by various commercial companies, under the sanction of the Amateur Athletic Union. Paul Endacott and young prospect David Perkins were the key players in the 1930s. Phillips gradually made a name for itself, finishing second in the AAU tournament in 1936-37 and again in 1938-39 with a 36-11 record. That season three of those 11 losses came at the hands of the Oklahoma City Parks. When the Parks disbanded after the season, Phillips hired the top two players, Grady Lewis and Bill Martin who earned AAU All-America honors as a guard at Oklahoma. Coaching the team for 2-4 years at the end of the 1930s was G. Harold \\"Smitty\\" Schmidt, who had also played for Phog Allen at the University of Kansas. With Lewis and Martin in the squad, and the likes of Joe Fortenberry and Don Lockard, the 66ers rolled to a 48-5 record and a 39-36 victory over the reigning champions Denver Nuggets in the finals of the 1939-1940 AAU tournament. When the team got back to the Bartlesville station, there was a tremendous number of people out to welcome the champions. The team finished second in the 1940-1941 season. One of its losses came after the season, in a Red Cross benefit game in Tulsa. There, the 66ers lost to Arkansas, led by a skinny 6-8 center John Freiberger who joined the 66ers the next year. But that was the time that the World War II war escalated and with the United States involved, and most of the top players of the 66ers joined the military. Bill Martin joined the Army Air Corps in 1942 and John Freiberger in 1943, thus the team had poor results during the 1941-1942 season. 1943-1946: Beginning of the dynasty Phillips dominated the AAU titles from 1943 to 1948, winning six straight titles and posting a 241-24 record (+909) against all comers. With the World War II war ongoing in 1943 and Phillips being a war-related industry, most of its employees were exempt from the draft. And with other AAU teams weakened the 66ers won AAU titles in 1943-44, 1944‚Äì45 and 1945-1946. 1946-1952: Bob Kurland era In the 1945-46 season, the college basketball was dominated by the first two \\"modern big men George Mikan of the DePaul Blue Demons, and two-time NCAA champion Bob Kurland of the Oklahoma A&M; Aggies. Bob Kurland became a 66er in 1946 and considered the club's greatest player since then. Kurland made the 66ers more popular and powerful than ever. Huge crowds thronged to the Bartlesville high school gym, which only seated 1,400 to see Kurland and the 66ers rolled to a 52-2 record in 1946-47. It was the year that the war had ended, and most of the former players returned, including Freiberger and Martin. Those two teamed up with Bob Kurland and the 66ers rolled to their fourth straight AAU championship in 1946-1947 season. The 66ers achieved a stunning 62-3 record in 1947-48 and won their AAU 5th title in a row. Phillips also dominated the 1948 Olympic trials, beating NCAA champion Kentucky Wildcats, 53-49, in the finals. That put five 66ers Bob Kurland, Cab Renick, Lew Beck, Gordon Carpenter and R.C. Pitts on the Olympic team, and made Phillips coach Bud Browning the head coach over Kentucky's Adolph Rupp. Ironically, it was the second time Rupp had played second fiddle to a Phillips man. He was a back-up to Paul Endacott in their college days at Kansas. The Phillips 66ers' record finished in 1949 after the Oilers lost to the Oakland Bittners in the AAU finals. According to George Durham, the team's publicity director and business manager for 20 years that team generated approximately $545,000 in free publicity during the 1948-49 season. The 66ers won the AAU title again in 1949-50, but that was followed by two bare seasons in 1950-1951 and 1951-1952 where they did not manage to repeat the triumph in the Olympic Trial Games (Peoria Caterpillars won the playoffs). Kurland set a record by being named to his second Olympic team in 1952, but he broke a lot of hearts in Bartlesville by deciding to retire just after the Games. The following year 1953 Clyde Lovellette joined Mikan signing for the Minneapolis Lakers. 1953-1960: Restructure and Olympic triumphs In 1953 a 6‚Äì6 foot forward named Pete Silas signed from the NCAA Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Silas had led the Southeastern Conference in scoring despite competing against such talented players as Cliff Hagen and Frank Ramsey and Louisiana State's Bob Pettit. He made the Armed Forces All-Stars and played on the gold-medal-winning Pan-American Games team in 1955. Despite the fact that Silas was in the Army the 66ers led by a 6-9 scoring-machine forward from Colorado named Burdie Haldorson won the 1956 Olympic Trials playoffs and sent five men to the 1956 Olympics. Haldorson set the team record by scoring 53 points against the Cleveland Pipers in 1960. He also tied Kurland's record by making the Olympic team for the second time in 1960 Olympics. He retired after that and went to work for Phillips' Denver division. 1960-1968: Decline and the end By the time Haldorson retired, AAU basketball was dying a slow death. TV had discovered the NBA, and the pros were starting to stabilize and pay more money than teams like Phillips could. The National Industrial Basketball League, the top amateur loop, disbanded in 1961. The Phillips players were strictly amateurs. They worked during the daytime and practiced at night. They got no special treatment, except for being excused from work at noon on game day. As the pro salaries increased, it got harder to get and keep quality players. But still a few good players came to Bartlesville. Like a 6-1 guard from the lowly Wabash College named Charlie Bowerman, and Gary Thompson from Iowa State. Thompson helped the 66ers win the 1961-1962 AAU tournament, and he was named the MVP. In the 1960s the AAU basketball faced hard times. The Big Ten had always prohibited its teams from playing AAU squads, and in the mid-60s other conferences followed suit. Newspapers started cutting down on space given to AAU teams, partly because of the pro glut and partly because of an attitude that companies should pay for all advertising and publicity. The team cost about $150,000 a year to operate, not including players' salaries. Very little of that was recouped by ticket sales. The highest tickets were $2, but most of the tickets were $1 or 50 cents. The final blow fell in 1967: The ABA was founded. The ABA was on firmer financial footing than the old ABL, and it needed bodies to compete with the established NBA. Seven 66ers jumped to the new league, most notably Darel Carrier and John Beasley, both of whom had excellent ABA careers. The 66ers already had an AAU schedule for 1967-68, so enough players were called out of retirement to form a team to play out the schedule. The 66ers lost their last game ever, 57-52, to the Spokane (Washington) Vaughan Realtors in the quarterfinals of the AAU national tournament. The 66ers fulfilled their other goal: making the Phillips' name and this northeastern Oklahoma town known all over the country. Notable players The Oilers placed a record of 39 players in the AAU's All-America teams and 21 became members of the AAU Basketball Hall of Fame. In the 1930s, these All- Americans included Jay Wallenstrom (1937) and Ray Ebbing (1939).

It is the Anglicized form of the Gaelic \\"√ì Donnghaile\\", \\"√ì\\" meaning male descendant of (\\"N√≠\\" is the female equivalent), and Donnghaile (or Donnghal), a personal name composed of the elements \\"donn\\" (brown), plus \\"gal\\" (valour). The name O‚ÄôDonnelly is derived from the descendants of Donnghaile (Donnghal) (an individual who lived during 10th century in Ireland)The most accurate source for the pedigree of Donnghaile (Donnelly) can be found in O‚ÄôCleary, Michael, et al, Annals of the Four Masters, see O‚ÄòDonovan‚Äòs edition Volume 6, page 2426. Other Irish genealogies (Book of Ballymote and Book of Lecan) have the line of descent of Donnghaile incorrectly stated as the great grandson of Domnall Ilchelgach, High King who died in 561 A.D. who was the great grandson of Domhnall, King of Aileach.King Domhnall served as co-ruler of Cen√©l nEoghain from about 896 A.D. with his paternal half brother Niall Glundub until 911 A.D. when King Domhnall abdicated to ‚Äúenter religious life‚Äù and subsequently died in 915 A.D. Hudson, Benjamin, Prophecy of Berchan,Irish and Scottish High Kings in the Middle Ages, Greenwood Press 1996 page 148. Early ancestors of this surname were a part of Cen√©l nEoghain and the U√≠ N√©ill as descendants from the line of E√≥gan mac N√©ill one of the seven sons of Niall No√≠g√≠allach (an Irish king). It is most commonly found in County Tyrone in mid- and west Ulster. It was so common in Roscommon that at some point, a branch of people with the Donnelly surname took on the name of Briscoe instead. A major stronghold of the (O')Donnelly family was located in Ballydonnelly, today known as Castlecaulfield, United Kingdom. The castle is called both Castle Caulfield and Ballydonnelly, dependent on who one asks. The land in this area traded hands a few times. Toby Caulfield, 1st Baron Caulfeild built a castle where an O'Donnelly residence stood between 1611 and 1619 when he acquired 1,000 acres of the Earls of Tyrone's estates. Patrick Donnelly burned the castle during the Irish Rebellion of 1641. In the 1660s, the Caulfield family was able to restore and re-occupy said castle. Oliver Plunkett and John Wesley both held services in the castle in 1670 and 1767, respectively. However, the castle fell into disrepair around the year 1700. Today, the castle is a State Care Historic Monument in County Tyrone.

Most of which are a part of the programs of the School of Music in the BYU College of Fine Arts and Communications, primarily either in the Department of Bands or the Jazz Studies Department. History The first band at the original Brigham Young Academy (BYA) was organized in about 1900 by Albert Miller (birth name Ernest Ludwig Adelbert Muller, lived 1875‚Äì1906), a German Mormon who was recruited to be on the music faculty at BYA by Anthony C. Lund in 1901. In 1901 Miller recruited as his assistant Robert Sauer, who he had known in Dresden, Germany before immigrating to America. In 1906, after Miller died, Robert Sauer (1873‚Äì1944), a German convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, became the director of the BYU band. Sauer remained the band director until 1942. At the end of Sauer's time as band director, BYU had one band that had 35 instruments. John R. Halliday then became the band director in 1942. During his eight-year tenure, BYU's band department expanded to 3 bands with 225 people playing instruments. Halliday would remain with BYU, with the exception of two years he did post-doctoral studies at the University of Southern California until his retirement in 1976 (when he became president of the Italy Milan Mission) but would spend most of the next 25 years as a director of choirs.BYU L. Tom Perry Special Collections Library biography connected with the findaing aid for the Halliday papers In 1950, Norman Hunt became the director of BYU bands. In 1953, Ralph G. Laycock became the director of BYU bands. Wind Symphony The BYU Wind Symphony has 45-members. Over the years it has performed in many locations across the United States and twenty other countries. It is currently directed by Dr. Donald Peterson. Symphonic Band The BYU Symphonic Band is an audition band with about 75 members. Many members are music-majors but the audition is offered to students from all majors of study. The band performs two concerts per semester.  University Bands  There are two non-audition University Bands. Each group rehearses one night per week during Winter semester in preparation for their annual concert at the end of the semester. Cougar Marching Band Known today as the \\"Power of the Wasatch\\", The BYU Cougar Marching Band was first organized in 1908 by Robert Sauer who wrote the well known tune \\"When It's Springtime in the Rockies\\". Years later, in 1943, the band was found as part of the school¬¥s ROTC. In 1953, control of the band was given to the College of Fine Arts (which still sponsors the band today) with Richard A. Ballou as its director and Grant Elkington as the first drum major. Since then the band has been led under the direction of Elkington, Bruce Bastian, Dan Bachelder, David Blackinton, and Donald Peterson.BYU Athletics Band information page Today the Marching Band is a 225-member band directed by Fred McInnis. Prior to 2008, the band held rehearsals in the parking lot of the Marriott Center and utilized storage space inside Conference Center, which sits adjacent to the Caroline Hemenway Harman Building. The current home of the BYU Marching Band is the Cougar Marching Band Hall, which includes rehearsal space, instrument storage areas, and band staff offices. It was built and completed in 2008 and is located in the southwest corner of LaVell Edwards Stadium.http://www.ldsphilanthropies.org/byu/news-features/presidents- report/marching-band-has-new.html The band rehearses in the west stadium parking lot next to Lavell Edwards Stadium. In 2011 a permanent rehearsal tower, with an integrated sound system and two observation levels, was built in the parking lot for use by the marching band. The band puts on pregame and halftime shows at all home football games and will generally travel with the team versus in state rivals and for postseason bowl appearances. The band has a tradition of marching from the baseball complex into LaVell Edwards Stadium about forty-five minutes before each game begins, stopping in front of the Cougar statue outside the southwest corner of the stadium to play for fans about to enter the stands. Shortly after the conclusion of each game, the band lines up and marches to the same spot outside the stadium to offer a short concert to fans lingering after the game, always concluding with the singing of BYU's traditional \\"College Song\\". The band also performs at the Rocky Mountain Marching Band Invitational, a high school competition hosted by the school the second Tuesday of October each year, and in its own concert towards the end of the season in November in the deJong Concert Hall on campus. ROC Bands BYU has two pep bands that perform at both men's and women's basketball games respectively. Referred to as the ROC (Roar Of Cougars) Bands, named after the BYU Student Sections at athletic events, the pep bands perform at most regular season home games and often travel with the team in post- season tournaments.BYU Marching and Pep Band information page Through their music they help pump up the crowd and create the excitement found in the college hoops atmosphere at the Marriott Center. Jazz ensembles BYU has a large array of Jazz ensembles. Three of these perform music in the Big Band tradition. The premier band in this group is Synthesis which was founded by K. Newell Dayley and is currently directed by Ray Smith. Synthesis has performed at several Jazz festivals in many locations in the US as well as in some other countries.

He chose to re-contest it with the Mana Party in order to seek a new mandate for his views. After generating several days of media interest and criticism Harawira announced on 4 May 2011 that he was delaying his resignation in order to consult his supporters in his electorate. On 11 May 2011 Harawira wrote to the Speaker of the House to resign from Parliament, with effect from 20 May 2011. On 12 May 2011 the Prime Minister John Key announced that the by-election would be held on 25 June. Reception Many politicians and political commentators criticised the by-election because it would occur so close to the 2011 New Zealand general election. Under New Zealand law, a by-election will not be held if there will be a general election within the next six months and 75% of MPs agree not to hold the by- election. So if Harawira had resigned later than 26 May then the by-election may not have occurred. Harawira defended the by-election, which cost an estimated $500,000, by saying \\"It's hardly an expense in terms of democracy.\\" By-elections The New Zealand political blogging community viewed some aspects of the by-election as being very similar to the 1993 Tauranga by- election. That by-election was held on 17 April and the subsequent general election on 7 November, after Winston Peters resigned first from the National Party, following disagreements with its leadership, and then as an MP in order to seek a \\"fresh mandate\\" for his views. The Tauranga by-election was labelled by media and opposing parties as a 'Publicity stunt', as was this by-election. Claire Trevett of The New Zealand Herald saw Harawira's resignation to force the election as \\"a direct echo\\" of Tariana Turia's resignation to force the 2004 Te Tai Hauauru by-election. However, Turia called her by-election 14 months before the 2005 New Zealand general election actually took place at a time when the election date had not been set. Harawira's by-election took place within six months of a general election. Candidates Five candidates stood in the by-election.

It was first described (and classified as Aplodes arizonaria) by Augustus Radcliffe Grote in 1883. It is indigenous to Arizona, New Mexico and the Davis Mountains in Texas. History The family Geometridae contains over 21,000 species and can be found all across the globe. The Geometrinae subfamily contains 2350 species. Many of these species can be identified by the similar emerald green coloration observed in N. arizonaria, which led to the creation of the common name emerald moth. Comparative analysis of Nemoria‚Äôs biogeographic history suggests that the genus originated in South America. Such a close proximity to the United States‚Äô southwest region can explain the present day localization to this area. It has been suggested that Nemoria was introduced many times - the genus is the largest of the New World Geometrinae and is estimated to be around 7.5 million years old. Nemoria is most commonly known for the phenotypic plasticity of its larvae stages in many species. There are now 15 recognized species of Nemoria. Habitat and distribution Nemoria arizonaria is typically restricted to canyon habitats of elevations around 4,000 to 8,000 feet. Within the United States, N. arizonaria seems to originate from Arizona, New Mexico, Mexico, Southern California and the Davis Mountains of Texas, although the summer (aemularia) form has only been found in Arizona. The moth can commonly be found resting on windows and screens throughout the Southwest United States. Seasonal forms The species has two seasonal forms: the summer seasonal form and winter-early-spring form. The summer form can be identified by its white costa. Until recently, this form was thought to have been a separate species from N.arizonaria and was given the name Nemoria aemularia. In 1988, Noel McFarland discovered that N. aemularia adults could be reared from N. arizonaria eggs ‚Äì proving that N.arizonaria and N. aemularia were actually the same moth, but due to seasonal dimorphism could result in substantially different phenotypic forms Seasonal dimorphism is one type of polyphenism observed in the species, the other of which occurs at the larvae stage. Life stages Larvae born in the spring feed on oak catkin (flower) and resemble catkins in appearance while those that feed on oak twigs express a different phenotype, specifically one that resembles a twig. In fact, diet alone regulates the expressed phenotype. The larvae enter the pupa stage after a few weeks and soon develop into adults. The adult dies shortly after mating and laying egg. Feeding As discussed above, larvae feed either on catkins or oak leaves and twigs depending upon the season. Adults, on the other hand, feed on nectar. Studies on Lepidoptera have found that feeding behavior is in fact triggered by sugar-receptor communication with chemosensilla, and that both starch and sucrose compete for taste receptor sites along the sensilla. When starch and sucrose were artificially added to bind to sensilla receptor sites, Lepodoptera stopped food-sucking behavior all together. Even though they were still hungry, their artificially occupied receptor sites signaled otherwise. Adult N. arizonaria is emerald colored, possessing a wide post-medial line - one of the broadest amongst all North American Nemoria species. The species also has a thin, yellow colored terminal line on the wing, with a slight red color between veins. A white fringe outlines its one- inch wingspan. A distinguishing feature between the two seasonal forms is the presence of purple-red markings on the costa of the forewing in the summer form. In this form, the abdomen contains reddish brown markings on the first few segments on the males, while female abdomens have pale red markings. Male and certain females also possess small white spots on the abdomen. Larvae The timing of birth affects the phenotype of these caterpillars: N. arizonaria born in the spring feed on oak catkins and thus develop a cuticle that resembles catkin flower. Those that are born in the summer must eat oak leaves since catkins are no longer abundant at this time of year. These larvae develop to mimic oak twigs instead, acquiring a smooth grey-green appearance. Because catkins contain more nutrition than leaves and twigs, larvae that feed on catkins are larger before they pupate. Those that feed on catkins appear golden with many small projections, a fuzzy coating, and brown dots along its back that mimic catkin stamens. Since these larvae feed on pollen, their heads and mandibles are smaller than those that feed on leaves and twigs, possibly because large mandibles are not necessary for catkin consumption3. Subsequent rearing experiments have shown that only larval diet influence the developmental trigger. Although genotypically similar, these eggs, upon hatching, begin feeding on oak leaves rather than the out of season catkins and develop jaws to accommodate feeding. It has been found that behavioral changes of larval mandibles occur in both H. buttivitta and H. subrotata depending upon usage, however research has not yet proven that this occurs in N. arizonaria. Genetic buffering Genetic buffering seems to explain the complexities between genotypic and phenotypic expression by concealing genetic and environmental variations on observed phenotype ‚Äì allowing for a myriad number of phenotypes for a single genotype. Rutherford explains how different larvae phenotypes of N. arizonaria were possibly developed by attributing the stages and thresholds of genetic variation storage in populations. Under normal situations, genetic buffering is intact, and all individuals with a genotype reflect identical phenotypes. However, when buffering breaks down, the expression of previously silent genes emerge and are allowed to cross, resulting in phenotypic variation from the original form. These phenotypic differences are then subject to selection. Genetic buffering allows for maintaining a certain phenotype while also allowing for the possibility of change. Phenotypic plasticity In a similar vein, phenotypic plasticity allows for phenotypical variation across populations depending upon density, environmental triggers, and the species involved. Phenotypical variation can include both visual and behavioral aspects. Though some responses are reversible, including certain behaviors, in N. arizonaria, once a phenotype is expressed it is unchangeable. Because the fluidity resulting from phenotypic plasticity allows for a species to circumvent predator attack, phenotypic plasticity has influenced natural selection to favor such measures. Although larvae have been observed to be highly plastic, this plasticity is not observed in adults. Because it is thought that phenotypic plasticity has evolved independently multiple times, Nemoria species exhibiting phenotypic plasticity have been placed in several different clades to reflect this evolution. Similarly, Nemoria species that have demonstrated plasticity in adult stages have also been regrouped. Both genetic buffering and phenotypic plasticity have been able to explain the various phenotypes observed in N. arizonaria. Much research has been done on understanding the triggers involved in phenotypic expression. After examining whether the color of light, in addition to diet, may influence phenotypic expression of N. arizonaria, Greene concluded that diet alone influenced morph induction even though light has been proven to affect the phenotype of many other polymorphic larvae. Because the larvae‚Äôs diet allows it to mimic seasonal changes in sync with its residing tree, Greene concludes that this phenotypic variance has been selected for since caterpillars who do undergo these changes are better concealed from predatory birds. Dr. Greene has also discovered that tannin found within oak leaves help facilitate this change of phenotype through experiments where N. arizonaria were fed artificial diets consisting of tannin. In many Lepidoptera species, temperature regulation has a significant impact on the resulting larvae. For example, when Danaus plexippus, was reared in cold environments, more black pigments were observed than when it was reared in warm temperatures. Since coloration affects the absorption of radiant energy, color variation induced by temperature may serve as a form of ectothermic adaption. Despite the varying temperatures observed in ‚Äò‚ÄôN. arizonaria‚Äô‚Äô‚Äôs habitat, no such temperature dependence of larvae have been observed. Although phenotypic plasticity has been an increasingly popular area of study, Nemoria arizonaria is the first known case in which the species‚Äô diet, rather than light or temperature, influences its phenotypic appearance. To fully interpret the impact the environment has on a species‚Äô phenotype and development when studying developmental processes, a more thorough understanding of ecology is necessary. By synergizing both ecology and evolutionary processes, as seen through N. arizonaria studies, a better understanding of how organisms evolve and develop can be reached.

Built on a spur of Klusenberg hill, the castle lies near the Lenne in the M√§rkischer Kreis. The castle was erected by the early Counts of Berg in the early 12th century.Burg Altena, Ruhr Guide retrieved 23 November 2010 Eventually, the House of Berg abandoned Altena and moved their residence to Hamm. History Supposedly, the castle was built by the brothers Adolf and Everhard von Berg around the year 1108 after Henry V granted them land in Sauerland for their loyal services. On Wulfseck Mountain they built their castle, which they named Wulfeshagen, later Altena. This is one of the several legends of the establishment of the county of Altena and the building of the castle. Altena Castle in 2008 Castle and River Lenne in Altena in 2005 After the acquisition of the parish land of Mark near the city of Hamm in 1198, the counts of Altena took Mark Castle as their primary residence and called themselves the Counts of the Mark. They continued to only occasionally inhabit Altena Castle and from 1392 onward it was only used as a residence for the county bailiff (Amtmann). Count Engelbert III of the Mark gave the small settlement at the base of the mountain the rights of liberty (such as self-governance). In 1455 the castle burned down and was only re-erected partially. In Brandenburg- Prussian times the castle became a garrison and was sold to the town of Altena in 1771. In the following years an almshouse and a workhouse was established there. This existed until 1840. From 1766 to 1811 there existed a criminal court and prison in the castle. By 1834 the castle was greatly deteriorated and was to be reconstructed. Due to lack of funds, however, this was not carried out. The Johanniter Orde set up a hospital in the buildings. Due to the 300 year-anniversary of the membership of the County of Mark to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1909 plans for a reconstruction of the castle began. In 1914 this was completed, apart from the outer bailey and lower gatehouse. There was a controversial debate about the modes of reconstruction, where the preference of historic designs over the medieval and early modern architecture was criticised. In 1918 the last works were completed. In 1914, Richard Schirrmann established the world's first youth hostel within the castle, which is still in use today (Jugendherberge Burg Altena). The original rooms are a museum today. The youth hostel continues to run at a location on the lower castle court yard, opened in 1934. Today the castle is symbol of the town of Altena and a tourist attraction. The entry ticket is also valid for the nearby Deutsche Drahtmuseum (German Wire Museum). During the first weekend of August a yearly Medieval Festival takes place in the castle and town. Part of the castle is used as a restaurant.

The program is supported by state and federal funds as a part of Delaware's efforts to maintain air quality. RideShare works in partnership with local and regional agencies towards meeting Federal Air Quality Standards. It helps forms both car pools and van pools. It also offers special programs for students and Delaware employers. History RideShare Delaware was established in 1997 by the Delaware Department of Transportation. Beginning in 2005, RideShare Delaware participates in a joint cross-promotion with Delaware E-ZPass to encourage commuters to both carpool as well as use E-ZPass transponders to reduce the lines at toll plazas. In 2007, Parsons Brinckerhoff, a transportation consulting firm, was hired to administer the program. It is now managed by URS Corporation.  Commuter programs = Real-time RideMatching  Since its founding RideShare Delaware has provided a forum to match people with similar commuting patterns in order to form car pools. Since March 2011, RideShare Delaware has offered an interactive commute tracking database to identify potential carpool partners. Its website pairs up carpool partners, logs and tracks clean commutes, and provides transit information. The RideMatching system provides emission tracking software to calculate and report carbon dioxide emission as well as mileage, fuel and cost reduction for carpoolers, transit riders, vanpoolers, bicyclists and people who walk to work. This information shows commuters how their clean commute reduces cost of their trip to the office, and also quantify how they are positively impacting the region‚Äôs air quality by sharing the ride. In April 2009, RideShare Delaware's enrollment reached 15,000 commuters.  Guaranteed Ride Home program  All registered commuters in the RideShare Delaware database(regardless whether they ride transit, carpool, vanpool, walk or bike) are eligible for the Guaranteed Ride Home (GRH) program. If an emergency arises on a day that a commuter shares the ride to work that prevents the commuter from taking his normal ride home, RideShare Delaware will reimburse the commuter for any necessary taxi or rental car services. This free benefit is limited to five uses per calendar year per registered user.  School Pool  The School Pool program is a free, voluntary program that assists parents by identifying other parents who want to share in the duties of driving their children to and from school. It serves individuals who travel to Delaware schools, even if the user lives in Pennsylvania, Maryland, or New Jersey.  Vanpool Assistance  Delaware RideShare facilitates vanpool commuting. Vanpools serve preformed groups of 7 to 15 passengers. Delaware RideShare identifies potential vanpool participants who share a commuter pattern. If they form a vanpool, the cost of the vanpool will be determined by the number of commuters in the van, distance traveled and total gas costs. Commuters using a vanpool could benefit from employer-offered transit benefits. Offered as an employer subsidy, pre-tax option or combination, employees are entitled to up to $230 a month towards the cost of riding the train, bus or vanpool if offered by their employer. As a result of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission process, approximately 8,000 new employees are being reassigned to the Aberdeen Proving Ground, and Delaware RideShare assists employees relocating to or living in Delaware with establishing a vanpool commute to Aberdeen. Delaware RideShare encourages State of Delaware employees to participate in the Fleet Link State Vanpool program. State employees who vanpool are eligible for emergency ride home trips only through the State Vanpool program. Any group of four or more Delaware employees can start a vanpool by renting a state-owned van for a flat monthly fee that includes gas, tolls and periodic maintenance. Bicycle commuting Delaware RideShare promotes bicycle commuting by producing maps of bicycle commuting route. DART First State also offers bicycle racks on the front of many of its buses for commuters who do not want to bike the entire length of a commute. In addition, bicycle commuters are also eligible for the GRH program.  Employer services  Traffic near Christiana Mall RideShare Delaware provides services to employers in Delaware including consultations, employee surveys, employer referrals, marketing and outreach, density maps, work site events, online ridematching, vanpool formation and support, relocation assistance, and commute incentives.

It is a white solid. This compound features a rare example of a stable, unhindered carbon-selenium double bond. The compound is used in the synthesis of selenium heterocycles. Compared to urea, the oxo-analog of selenourea, few studies have been done on the compound due to the instability and toxicity of selenium compounds. Selenourea is toxic if inhaled or consumed. Synthesis The compound was first synthesized in 1884 by Auguste Verneuil by the reaction of hydrogen selenide and cyanamide: :H2Se + NCNH2 ‚Üí SeC(NH2)2 While this reaction has even found use in industrial synthesis of selenourea, more modern methods concern themselves with synthesis of substituted selenoureas. These can be synthesized using organic isoselenocyanates and secondary amines: :RN=C=Se + NHR‚Ä≤R‚Ä≥ ‚Üí Se=C(NRH)(NR‚Ä≤R‚Ä≥H) Alternatively, a substituted carbodiimide could be used as follows: :RN=C=NR‚Ä≤ Se=C(NRH)(NR‚Ä≤H) Properties X-ray crystallographic measurements on crystals at ‚àí100 ¬∞C give average C=Se bond lengths of 1.86 √Ö, and 1.37 √Ö for C‚àíN. Both the Se‚àíC‚àíN and N‚àíC‚àíN angles were measured at 120¬∞, as expected for an sp2-hybridized carbon. Through these same studies, the existence of Se‚àíH hydrogen bonding in the crystal lattice‚Äîsuggested from the O‚àíH and S‚àíH hydrogen bonding found in crystals of urea and thiourea‚Äîwas confirmed. Both the shortened length of the N‚àíC bond and the longer Se=C bond suggest a delocalization of the lone pair on the amines; the Se=C œÄ-bonding electrons are drawn towards the selenium atom, while the nitrogen's lone pair is drawn towards the carbonyl carbon. A similar effect is observed in urea and thiourea. In going from urea to thiourea to selenourea the double bond is more delocalized and longer, while the C‚àíN œÉ bond is stronger and shorter. In terms of resonance structures, the selenol form (structures II, III) is more prevalent compared to urea and thiourea analogs; however, the lone pair the nitrogen of selenourea delocalizes only slightly more than the lone pair on thiourea (in contrast to a much greater delocalization in going from urea to thiourea).. These minor differences suggest that the properties emergent from the delocalized nitrogen lone pair and destabilization of the C=S and C=Se œÄ bond in thiourea and selenourea will also be similar. :File:Resonance.gif Unlike urea and thiourea, which have both been researched extensively, relatively few studies quantitatively characterize selenourea. While the selone tautomer (I) has been shown to be the more stable form, mainly qualitative and comparative information on selenourea's tautomerization is available. In comparable manner to ketones, selones also tautomerize: :File:Selenourea_Tautomers.gif Since the greater delocalization of the lone pair electrons correlates with the selone product, the equilibrium position of selenourea likely has an equilibrium position comparable to thiourea's (which is lies more to the right that than urea's). Thiourea has been shown to exist predominantly in its thione form at 42 ¬∞C in dilute methanol, with the thionol tautomer almost nonexistent at neutral pH. Reactivity An important class of reactions of selenourea is the formation of heterocycles. Some selenium-containing heterocycles exhibit antiinflammatory and antitumor activity, among other medicinal uses. Using selenourea as a precursor is considered to be the most efficient means of selenium-containing heterocyclic synthesis. Another class of reactions is the complexation of selenourea with transition metals and metalloids. Its ability to act as an effective ligand is attributed to the electron-donating effect of the amino groups and consequent stabilization of the selenium‚Äìmetal œÄ bond. In selenourea complexes only selenium‚Äìmetal bonding has been observed, unlike in the urea and thiourea counterparts, which also bond through the nitrogen atom.

She is best known as the author of Nazism and euthanasia of the mentally ill in Germany (Die T√∂tung Geisteskranker in German), the world's first documentary about the mass killings of disabled and mentally ill persons by the Nazi regime. For a few years before World War II, and permanently beginning in 1967, she lived in Italy, where in the 1970s she was one of the first group analysts. Life and work Alice Ricciardi von-Platen was the youngest of the four daughters of Count Carl von Platen-Hallermund (1870‚Äì1919) and Elizabeth Alten (1875‚Äì1970); she grew up on the Weissenhaus estate in Schleswig-Holstein. Her father died early. She attended the boarding school Schule Schloss Salem, which was then under the leadership of Kurt Hahn. After completing her medical studies in Munich in 1934 and a subsequent clinical internship in a Berlin children's hospital, she spent the years 1936-39 in Florence and 1940 in Rome. She then returned to Germany where her son George was born in 1941 and practised until early 1944 as a supply doctor in Bavaria, and until 1945 as a country doctor in Austria. In that role, she was confronted with the Nazi euthanasia program via accounts from her patients' relations, but she could save only a few patients. After the war, she worked as a volunteer at the psychosomatic clinic of the Heidelberg University, with Viktor von Weizs√§cker, where she continued her training in psychotherapy. From December 1946 she was an official observer of the Nuremberg doctors' trial, and in 1947 she also attended the Hadamar trial (Hadamar Clinic) in Frankfurt am Main in an unofficial capacity. Later in that year she joined professor Zillich at the mental hospital St. Getreu in Bamberg. In 1949 Ricciardi von- Platen moved to London, where she worked ‚Äì under the supervision of Michael Balint ‚Äì in a psychotherapy and marriage counselling centre, and also in a psychiatric hospital. She completed her psychoanalytic and group analytic training and became a member of the Group Analytic Society. Subsequently, she worked at the Tavistock Clinic and the Bexley Hospital, eventually setting up her own psychiatry practice in England. She met the organizational consultant Augusto Baron Ricciardi (1915‚Äì1982), whom she married in 1956 and whom she accompanied to Belgium and Libya. From 1967 until her death in 2008 she lived and worked as a psychoanalyst in Rome and in Cortona (Tuscany). Observer at the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial A sentence of death by hanging is pronounced by a U.S. War Crimes Tribunal upon Adolf Hitler's personal physician, 43-year-old Karl Brandt. Brandt was also Reich Commissar for Health and Sanitation. Ricciardi von-Platen gained international attention as observer at the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial. When the American military government in 1946 announced that they would prosecute the perpetrators of the inhumane experiments on humans and of the deaths of about one hundred thousand mentally ill in order to hold to account those doctors who were responsible, the German Medical Association sent to Nuremberg a committee of observers headed by Alexander Mitscherlich. While Mitscherlich was focused primarily on the human experiments and on legal and political questions of the process, Alice von Platen-Hallermund was focused primarily on the euthanasia of psychiatric patients. She felt that the killing of mentally ill people was a systematic crime which the entire German medical establishment had known about and in which it was deeply involved. Nazism and euthanasia of the mentally ill in Germany Ricciardi von-Platen's book Nazism and euthanasia of the mentally ill in Germany (Die T√∂tung Geisteskranker in German), published in 1948, addressed the complicity of German physicians in the Nazi euthanasia crimes. It was generally ignored at the time. Reflecting in 1993, Ricciardi von-Platen said, regarding the mood of the population of Nuremberg (as cited by Helmut S√∂rgel in the N√ºrnberger Zeitung of April 29, 2000): In March 1947, the observers Alexander Mitscherlich and Fred Mielcke wrote a document entitled The Dictatorship of Human Contempt (Das Diktat der Menschenverachtung) which was published as a newly edited and extended book in April 1960 under the title Medicine without humanity (\\"Medizin ohne Menschlichkeit\\"). Of the three thousand copies printed of Alice's book, only about 20 still exist in libraries. Publications Alice von Platen-Hallermund: Die T√∂tung Geisteskranker in Deutschland.

Plot Leslie (Amy Poehler) feels powerless at work because a policy by Chris (Rob Lowe) forbidding workplace romances is preventing her from dating Ben (Adam Scott). Meanwhile, now that he is staying in Pawnee permanently, Ben decides to move out of the motel where he has been living. Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) offer him a spare room in their house, since their previous roommate moved out and left the house to them. Although the two have been living by themselves for only a week, the house is a complete mess with no everyday items like plates or utensils available. Ben decides to teach a reluctant Andy and April how to properly live like adults. Meanwhile, the parks employees attend an art show exhibiting paintings that will later be hung in government buildings. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) displays his painting of the fictional topless centaur Greek goddess Diaphena, which looks exactly like Leslie. Jerry explains he subconsciously painted Leslie while thinking about powerful women. Instead of being embarrassed, Leslie feels empowered by the painting. Tom, however, is humiliated because a pot-bellied cherub in the painting shares his likeness. The next day, local conservative activist Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt) compares the painting to bestiality, deems it unsuitable for a government setting and demands it be destroyed. Leslie goes on the news program \\"Ya' Heard? with Perd\\" to rouse public support for the painting by portraying it as a depiction of a powerful woman. However, she is undermined when reporter Perd Hapley (Jay Jackson) also has on pornographic film actress Brandi Maxxxx (Mara Marini), who defends the painting by comparing it to pornography. Chris convenes a meeting of the Pawnee Public Arts Commission to rule on whether the painting is acceptable. Despite Leslie's eloquent defense, the commission fears the nudity is offensive and decides to destroy it instead of risking public backlash. Leslie instead steals the painting and runs away. Meanwhile, after cleaning up around the house, Ben gives Andy and April money to buy common household items. Although they almost waste their money on frivolous items (including many As seen on TV items), Andy insists they need to take Ben's advice. April admits she is afraid of growing up because she does not want them to lose their unique personalities, but Andy assures her they will not change. Chris angrily demands Leslie bring the painting to city hall the next day to be destroyed. When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses disappointment that she would give up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, only this time with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot to draw a penis on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris, but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other, then it will eventually happen. Production Mara Marini (pictured) made a guest appearance in \\"Jerry's Painting\\" as porn star Brandi Maxxxx. \\"Jerry's Painting\\" was written by Norm Hiscock and directed by Dean Holland. During its original broadcast, the episode ran for an extended 40 minutes rather than the usual 30 minutes. The extra time was due to an extended episode of The Office that ran before Parks and Recreation: \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", which featured the final appearance of Steve Carell as a regular cast member playing Michael Scott. \\"Jerry's Painting\\" featured a guest appearance by Darlene Hunt as Marcia Langman, a member of the conservative group the Society for Family Stability Foundation. Hunt's character has previously appeared in past Parks and Recreation episodes to object to Leslie's actions: in the second season premiere \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" she condemned Leslie's same-sex wedding ceremony of two male penguins, and in the third season episode \\"Time Capsule\\" she argued against Leslie including the novel Twilight in a Pawnee time capsule because she felt it was anti-Christian. \\"Jerry's Painting\\" also featured Jay Jackson in his recurring role as Pawnee journalist Perd Hapley, and Mara Marini as Hapley's guest, porn star Brandi Maxxxx. Cultural references During one scene at the art show, a character named Orin stands in front of a blank canvas and stares straight ahead without moving. This style of art exhibition is similar to that of Marina Abramoviƒá, a Yugoslavian performance artist who sits or stands silently and immobile at some of her art exhibits. After seeing herself as a goddess in Jerry's painting, Leslie starts responding when people nickname her Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, beauty and sexuality. While speaking to Ben, Tom describes his seduction ritual with women as turning the lights off with the Clapper, a sound-activated electrical light switch, and then putting on music by Boyz II Men, an R&B; vocal group. This was previously demonstrated in the second-season finale \\"Freddy Spaghetti\\", when the group's song \\"On Bended Knee\\" was playing while Tom has his girlfriend at his apartment. While stressing over Chris' policy of not dating co-workers, Ann offers to help Leslie relax by getting her a prescription for Paxil, an antidepressant drug. Ben gives Andy and April cash and instructs them to buy home products at Bed Bath & Beyond, a chain of domestic merchandise retail stores. While there, Andy and April instead start to purchase several \\"as seen on TV\\" items, including Shake Weight dumbbells, Slap Chop kitchen gadgets and a Marshmallow Shooter. During the arts commission meeting, Tom describes himself as a \\"small, slender man\\" similar to actor Taye Diggs. In a different scene, Tom expresses anger that Jerry's painting is \\"killing the Jay-Z vibe\\" he has long been cultivating, a reference to the hip hop artist. Reception=Ratings Nielsen ratings were expected to be high for \\"Jerry's Painting\\" due to a lead-in from Steve Carell's final episode as a regular cast member on The Office. However, in its original American broadcast, the Parks and Recreation episode was seen by an estimated 4.71 million household viewers. This constituted a drop from the previous episode, \\"Soulmates\\", which was seen by 4.88 million households. \\"Jerry's Painting\\" received a 2.8 rating/4 share among all viewers and a 2.3 rating/6 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In its 10 p.m. timeslot, \\"Jerry's Painting\\" was outperformed by the CBS police procedural drama The Mentalist, which was seen by 13.1 million household viewers, and the ABC medical drama Private Practice, which was seen by 6.33 million household viewers. Reviews \\"Jerry's Painting\\" received generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis called the episode \\"one that may just have been the season's best ‚Äî and that‚Äôs saying something when a show is as consistent as this one\\". She called the main plotline about the painting \\"brilliant\\" and said the subplot with Ben, April and Andy was so funny she hoped they had more pairings in the future. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic called \\"Jerry's Painting\\" one of the strongest episodes of the season, and said he enjoyed seeing Leslie's character so empowered. McHatton also praised seeing April and Andy facing adulthood, writing, \\"It's something many of us young adults go through and it was nice to see it reflected\\" in the characters. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic said the show demonstrated how Leslie Knope has developed into a strong and confident character since the \\"daffy, wide-eyed dreamer\\" she was in the first season. He also praised the show's \\"new funniest pairing\\" of Ben, April and Andy, and said the episode demonstrated that \\"even this late in the season, the show can still feel surprising and fresh\\". New York magazine writer Steve Kendell said \\"Jerry's Painting\\" was an excellent episode, and that he appreciated seeing Leslie portrayed in a sexier and more confident way than previous episodes had. Joel Keller of TV Squad said the main story with Leslie was funny, but the subplot was even better. He said it showcased the deadpan comedic talents of Adam Scott, and that April and Andy continue to be an excellent pairing. The A.V. Club writer Claire Zulkey called the episode \\"a pretty simple episode that got funnier and more quotable as the episode rolled on\\". She particularly praised Adam Scott's performance, but said she did not look forward to the romantic pairing of Scott and Amy Poehler because she feels they lack chemistry. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said the episode featured great scenes about government inaction and the way small-time media can make a frenzy out of any minor thing. He also praised the subplot with April and Andy, which he said demonstrated how the two characters getting married hasn't at all changed who they are. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com complimented the writers, who he said are able to make consistently strong episodes because they seem to have a perfect understanding of their characters. He also said \\"Jerry's Painting\\" proved Ben's character has comedic potential beyond being Leslie's romantic interest. Zap2it writer Rick Porter said it was not the best of the season, but still \\"a very solid half-hour of comedy\\" and that \\"the show's batting average this season is remarkably high\\". While Porter praised the main story, he said he found the subplot less entertaining, and did not believe April's character would have acted the way she did or lived in such filthy conditions. Not all reviews were positive. Matt Fowler of IGN said the idea of Jerry subconsciously painting Leslie and Tom was \\"a bit too absurd\\", and that the episode did not feature enough of Ron Swanson. Fowler also said he did not enjoy seeing the normally positive Chris taking on an authoritarian role.

Mediterranean Harbor is the entrance \\"port-of-call,\\" or hub, themed as an Italian port city named Porto Paradiso, complete with Venetian gondolas that guests can board and ride. The majority of places of interest throughout the port are various shops and restaurants.  Theming and layout  Mediterranean Harbor's layout differs from the entry \\"lands\\" of other Disney parks as it is a large \\"V\\" shape rather than a main street that leads to a hub (as found in Disneyland's Main Street, U.S.A. or Disney's Hollywood Studios' Hollywood Boulevard). If followed to the right, the path leads to Mysterious Island, while if followed to the left, the path leads to the American Waterfront. Built into the architecture in this port is the Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta. The hotel itself serves as a full-scale reproduction of the various buildings of Portofino and Venice's ports. The design choice of combining a real hotel within the themed park areas helps to further the illusion that (as either a park or hotel guest) you are in an actual city; since the hotel is a functional building (rather than a 'set facade' -- the general standard in theme park designs) the effect of onlooking hotel guests, that may observe the park from hotel's rooms, balconies, and terraces serve in adding a level of kinetic authenticity in passing for an authentic Italian villa for park visitors, while the hotel guest enjoys the harborside views and novelty of location. Additionally, the Hotel MiraCosta also serves as the southern berm (or border) of the park. Mediterranean Harbor also features attractions such as the Fortress Explorations which is a meticulously themed, large-scale interactive play area for guests that features exploration-themed activities and attractions.

The title of the work alludes to an essay by Friedrich Schiller, On Na√Øve and Sentimental Poetry, that contrasts a creative personality that creates art for its own sake (the \\"na√Øve\\") versus one conscious of other purposes, such as art‚Äôs place in history (the \\"sentimental\\").Naive and Sentimental Music John Adams. Retrieved 2011-04-23. The composer cites both the slowly developing harmonies of Bruckner's Fourth Symphony and the atmosphere of the Sonoma coastline (where the piece was composed) as inspirations for the work.Adams, John. Hallelujah Junction: Composing an American Life, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2008, pp. 255-256. The piece was co- commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Ensemble Modern, the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. It received its first public performance by the Los Angeles Philharmonic conducted by Esa- Pekka Salonen on February 19, 1999. A recording by Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic was subsequently released by Nonesuch Records. Structure The piece has a duration of approximately 48 minutes, and has three movements: I. Na√Øve and Sentimental Music. The first movement opens with a meandering melody over simple chords that subsequently undergoes a variety of symphonic transformations. II. Mother of the Man. This movement consists of slowly evolving harmonies punctuated by chords from an amplified steel guitar. III. Chain to the Rhythm. In a minimalistic vein, the last movement uses rhythmic fragments that gradually build up to a thunderous climax. Instrumentation  The work is scored for 4 flutes (3, 4 double piccolos), 3 oboes (3 doubles English horn), 3 Bb clarinets (3 doubles bass clarinet 2), bass clarinet, 3 bassoons (3 doubles contrabassoon), 4 horns in F, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, 2 tubas, amplified steel string guitar, piano, celesta, keyboard sampler, 2 harps, 5 percussion (including 3 who are principally mallet players), and strings.

Five years later, in its local premiere with the San Francisco Symphony, Joshua Kosman, music critic for the S.F.

Bob was joined in 1879 by Al Sieber and Johnny Behan in a chase for the robber and murderer during the stage holdup near Gillette, Arizona (near present-day Tip Top, Arizona in Yavapai County). Election as Pima County Sheriff With several years of experience as a sheriff in California, Paul ran as a Republican for the office of Pima County Sheriff against Democrat Charles A. Shibell. He was a large man, at 6 foot 6\\", and weighed about 240 pounds. Paul was expected to win, but on November 2, 1880, Shibell was unexpectedly reelected, and he immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for the Tombstone region of Pima County. A week later Bob Paul accused Shibell and his Cowboy supporters Ike Clanton, Curly Bill Brocius, and Frank McLaury of ballot-stuffing and filed suit in the courts. Stagecoach murder While the election decision was being argued in the courts, Bob rejoined Wells Fargo as a shotgun messenger. On the evening of March 15, 1881, the stage-driver of the Kinnear & Company stagecoach carrying US$26,000 in silver bullion (about $ in today's dollars) en route from Tombstone to Benson, Arizona took ill in Contention City and Paul took the reins and the driver's seat. Three Cowboys: Jim Crane, Harry Head & Bill Leonard; attempted to rob the stagecoach near Drew's Station, just outside Contention City, by first stepping into the road and commanding them to \\"Hold!\\" Immediately, Crane fired at the guard's seat killing the popular and well-known driver Eli 'Budd' Philpot. Paul believed that this shot was meant for him because Philpot was in the shotgun messenger seat that he would normally have occupied. This would lead to theories of an assassination attempt. Paul fired his shotgun and emptied his revolver at the robbers, wounding a Cowboy later identified as Bill Leonard in the groin. In the exchange a miner named Peter Roerig, riding in the rear dickey seat, was also killed. Philpot's body lurched forward onto the horses and they spooked running off. Paul was able to bring the stage under control after a mile by jumping onto the tongue at which point they had lost the robbers. Paul returned to the attempted robbery site near Drews Station and joined in with the posse on an 18-day chase that produced Leonard King. King was holding the horses for the robbers and identified them by name. Court awards him office The Arizona Territorial Supreme Court ruled on his election lawsuit in Paul's favor in February, but Shibell appealed, and the decision was not confirmed until April. Paul held the position through 1886. On February 1, 1881 Cochise County was split off from Pima County, relieving him of a large and difficult territory.  Ordered to arrest Wyatt Earp  Two months after the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, on December 28, 1881, three men ambushed Virgil Earp as he walked from Schieffelin Hall back to the Cosmopolitan Hotel, where the Earps had moved for mutual support and protection. Wyatt, believing that Virgil was dying, telegraphed U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake and asked to be named as Virgil's replacement as Deputy U.S. Marshal. Dake agreed. On February 2, the Clantons were put on trial before Judge Stilwell. Ike's hat had been found at the scene and McMaster testified that he had been in Charleston the evening of the shooting. He said that when Ike learned that Virgil had survived the shooting, Ike said he \\"would have to go back and do the job over.\\" However, Charleston constable George McKelvey, saloon owner J. B. Ayers and five others testified that Ike Clanton had been in Charleston and could not have taken part in the shooting. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. On Saturday evening, March 18, 1882, Morgan Earp was waiting for saloon owner Bob Hatch to line up a billiards shot when two bullets were fired through the window of the back door of the saloon. Morgan was shot through the spine and died within the hour. While escorting the maimed Virgil and Morgan's remains to the train in Tucson, Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp, Warren Earp and other deputies found Frank Stilwell lying in wait in the railyard and killed him. Tucson Justice of the Peace Charles Meyer issued arrest warrants for five of the Earps' party. The federal posse returned to Tombstone. Meyer sent a telegram to Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan instructing him to arrest them. The telegraph office manager, a friend of the Earps, delayed its delivery long enough to allow the Earps and their associates to make ready to leave town Tuesday evening. Behan got the telegram in the early evening and told Wyatt he wanted to see him. Wyatt replied \\"Johnny, if you're not careful you'll see me once too often.\\" Ignoring Behan, the well-armed Earp posse rode out of town the same evening of Tuesday, March 21. They headed for the woodcutting camp of Pete Spence in the South Pass in the Dragoon Mountains. When the Cowboys suspected of maiming Virgil and assassinating Morgan Earp went free on the strength of their confederates' alibis, and due to legal technicalities, Wyatt Earp decided he had to take matters into his own hands. He formed a federal posse and sought revenge against those they held responsible. In the next three days they killed Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz, Curly Bill Brocius, and Johnny Barnes. Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan organized a posse to pursue and arrest them, but Paul did not join in. Paul said that the posse led by Behan was mostly hostile to the Earps and that a meeting would mean bloodshed. He stated that the Earps would return to Tucson and turn themselves in. Tucson, where the Earps had killed Stilwell, was in Paul's jurisdiction, but Paul was a friend of the Earps and failed to execute the warrant. The Pima County Supervisors ordered Paul later that year to bring Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday back from Colorado. Paul knew of warrants for the Earp's arrest, but he only served a warrant on Doc Holliday. Colorado Governor Frederick W. Pitkin was persuaded by Earp friend Bat Masterson to prevent Holliday's extradition, and Paul returned empty handed. On May 16, 1882, the sheriff of Arapahoe County, Colorado notified Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan that he had Wyatt and Warren Earp in his custody, along with Doc Holliday. Behan applied to the governor for money to go to Colorado to bring the Earps back, but Governor Fremont instead gave the funds to Pima County Sheriff Bob Paul. Paul had received word on the same day from Denver that the sheriff there had five of the Earp party in custody. When Paul arrived in Denver, he served a warrant for Doc Holiday's arrest on charges that he killed Frank Stilwell in Tucson. Wyatt Earp, also in Denver, feared for Holiday's life if he was returned to Tombstone. He asked his friend and Trinidad, Colorado Sheriff Bat Masterson to help get Holiday released. Sheriff Masterson appealed to Governor Frederick W. Pitkin and succeeded in getting Holiday released from jail. Paul also knew of warrants for the Earp's arrest, but he was a friend of the men and never served the warrants. Prevents lynching In April 1883 in the Old Pueblo in Tucson, local citizens attempted to lynch Joseph Casey, who earlier that day had murdered the jailer Deputy Sheriff Andrew Holbrook.ODMP memorial for Andrew Holbrook Bob Paul cleared the courthouse and almost single-handedly saved Casey's life. Bob served as Pima County sheriff until 1886 and later as a detective for the SPRR during 1888‚Äì90. On that job he was responsible for tracking down the robbers who held up the Stein's Pass railroad in Sonora, Mexico in 1888. In 1890 he was appointed by President Benjamin Harrison as U.S. Marshal for the entire Arizona Territory and held that post until 1893, after which he served as Justice of the Peace in Tucson. He died in 1901. Over the years, Paul's courage, omnipresent shotgun and manhunts into Mexico drew national acclaim. Paul died of cancer on March 26, 1901, in what his obituary called both \\"his first and last sickness\\". He was buried in Tucson's Court Street Cemetery.

The film premiered at the Austin Film Festival October 2009 and had DVD release in February 2010. Plot Justin (Ward Roberts) sits inside a pentagram. He has obvious claw marks on his chest. He cuts his hand and uses a spell from a book to summon the crippled demon Lo (Jeremiah Birkett). Justin orders Lo to search Hell for his girlfriend April (Sarah Lassez), who was abducted by a demon. Lo argues that the task will be impossible, but eventually concedes and asks for information about April. Justin describes his first meeting with the endearing, quirky April; the memory is depicted as a Vaudeville production. The demon Jeez, who abducted April, arrives. It tells Justin that April is actually a murderous demon who abandoned Hell in order to experience human love. Justin denies this despite Lo admitting that it knew April as a demon. Justin insults Lo and both demons leave. The cut on Justin's hand begins to speak and argues with him about April. Lo returns and tells Justin that April is imprisoned and cannot be retrieved. Instead, it presents two damned souls who describe being tortured after April tricked them into selling their souls. Lo reveals that its legs were crushed when April returned to Hell. Justin concludes that Lo helped her escape and was punished. Lo tells him to think about her if he wants to see her again, prompting a flashback of their first Christmas together. Justin gives April a rare edition of Faust. She seems confused by the concept of gift-giving but becomes excited about reading for amusement, which appears to be a novelty to her. April becomes confused when she realizes Justin expected a gift in return. She gives him the only thing she has: a book on demon summoning. She orders him not to open it, and to burn it if she ever leaves. Lo says it was obvious April was a demon. Justin's hand suggests that April was manipulating Justin. Lo tells Justin that his condition will worsen the longer he stays in the circle, and he should undo the spell and leave. A waiter appears and offers Justin a drink. Lo tells Justin that the drink will allow him to travel through Hell to April, asking if Justin thinks she is worth it. Justin downs the drink, and Lo smugly tells him it was poison. Lo leaves and Jeez returns. Jeez says the poison is slow-acting, and if he stops the spell and seeks medical treatment he will survive. Justin refuses to leave without April. Jeez asks what love is. Unable to define it, Justin merely smiles, causing Jeez to leave in irritation. The hand and Justin argue over whether it would be better to live alone or die for April. Justin becomes distressed and decides to cut the hand off, but Lo interrupts him. Lo and Justin argue about April's true nature and whether she is worth the effort Justin is going to. Justin forces a third flashback. Justin comforts April after she wakes up from a nightmare. Jeez appears and attacks April, fatally slashing Justin's chest in the process. April agrees to return to Hell with Jeez if she can save Justin. She leaves Justin the demon summoning book and takes the Faust book with her. Lo admonishes Justin for not burning the book. Justin becomes philosophical about the differences between humans and demons. Lo laughs at this, infuriating Justin. Justin reasserts his control over Lo and orders it to find April. Lo leaves, and Justin begins to cry while looking at a picture of April. April appears in front of Justin and forgives him for not burning the book. Justin affirms his love for her and his determination to bring her back. She kisses him, extracting the poison from his body. She tells Justin that she cannot come with him, because demons would pursue her and put Justin in danger. Justin offers to stay in Hell with her but April refuses. She begins to leave. As she looks back, she becomes Lo, revealing that they were the same person all along. The next day, Justin burns the book. Cast *Ward Roberts as Justin *Sarah Lassez as April *Jeremiah Birkett as Lo *Devin Barry as Jeez *Aaron Gaffey as Waiter *Sarah Larissa Deckert as The Demon Rat *John Karyus as Demon Lord *Liz Loza as June Production Writer/director Travis Betz created the film's experimental concept after watching Jan ≈†vankmajer's Faust and determining that restraining a lone character into one place and having demons interact with him \\"was a very tempting challenge\\". Shot in 3 days, the film has a unique visual element in that there is no scenery and that characters are revealed through lighting as the rest of the set remains in darkness. The film plays out like a real stage play. There are a few characters and the storyline revolves around dialogue between the various demons and Justin. Release=Home media Lo was released on DVD by Synkronized USA on February 9, 2010. Reception Independent Critic gave the film a B (3.0 stars), calling it \\"a love story of the lowest common denominator\\", and noted that while the film did not reach the level of Betz's 2008 film Sunday, it was a \\"more ambitious film\\" in which Betz stretched the limits of what could be done technically on a modest budget, making it \\"a stellar example of how to assemble a quality, technically proficient film with largely convincing special effects on a limited budget.\\" They also praised that despite the viewer's being aware that the entire film takes place within one restricted area, the special effects makeup, the \\"larger-than-life\\" sound design, and \\"deceptively simple\\" production design, the film maintains a simplicity that \\"remains completely captivating.\\" They also noted that the film worked as well as it did because of the director's having assembled a fine cast, with special note that the film's lead Ward Roberts was able to convincingly play both ends of the emotional spectrum and take what could have been a one-dimensional character and bring \\"him vividly to life.\\" They concluded that the film was \\"Warped, original, imaginative and quite funny.\\" Blog Critics relates how the film centers around the main character of Justin sitting in the center of an elaborate pentagram drawn on the floor in his darkened apartment. In describing the characterization of the summoned demons, they write that Lo \\"comes off like a stand-up comic putting down a heckler\\" and that Jeez \\"is at his horrifying best as the lead singer in a lounge act\\". They note that the film's use of flashbacks seems to \\"emphasize artifice as opposed to realism,\\" and that the film has \\"cult potential\\". JoBlo noted from viewing a trailer in 2008, that restraining a lone character into one place and having the demons interact with him \\"seems twisted enough to possibly be an interesting idea,\\" but of the DVD release of the completed film, they wrote that while the concept had originality, \\"it sometimes feels a tad pretentious\\", and that due to the minimalist staging and heavy dialog, the project might have been better if explored on a theatrical stage. They also noted that while the scenes were somewhat predictable, it was \\"sometimes fun to watch the verbal tennis match between the characters,\\" as the leads of Ward Roberts as Justin and Jeremiah Birkett as Lo \\"are good as they try to battle with words about what each player wants.\\" But they also felt the dialog tended to drag and lose momentum. They reviewer was intrigued by the plot's \\"bizarre events\\", and granted that although it \\"sometimes felt as if it was trying too hard,\\" the film for the most part held his attention through clever writing and capable actors. He also spoke well of the character make-up, writing \\"I was impressed with most of the make up effects here. I did find that each of the demon characters looked like something from the past, I still give credit for making it look much better than it could have.\\" Quiet Earth called the 2008 trailer \\"deliciously, and sickly, whimsical\\", but their opinion was modified after viewing the complete film at its debut at the Austin Film Festival. They wrote the film \\"is a modern variation on the \\"Faust\\" story and has its clever moments, but ultimately its reach way exceeds its grasp.\\" They praised the make-up designs of the title demon of 'Lo' and his associate 'Jeez', writing that they were \\"top-notch and highly effective\\". They also praised the acting of Ward Roberts as Justin and Jeremiah Birkett as Lo, writing they did \\"fine work, good enough to distract us from the fact that both of them spend most of the running time sitting or lying in the same spot,\\" but did not think as highly of the rest of the cast, offering that Sarah Lassez as April failed in making her character \\"both weird and lovable\\" and that Devin Barry as a \\"nasally fey\\" Jeez became \\"seriously annoying within seconds.\\" They wrote that the biggest disappointment with the film was \\"it is simply too obviously padded,\\" and every scene suffered from the director's \\"need to make the runtime acceptably feature length.\\" They granted that the film was ambitious and it stood apart from most micro-budget films of its kind \\"by shooting for much artier heights\\", but as technically adept as the project was, it would have been far better had it been released in a shorter version.

The engines, boiler, and whistle were all second hand. The steam whistle had come from a much larger vessel, and blowing the whistle would cause loss of power and a consequent rapid drop in speed due to the amount of steam expended for the blast. This defect allowed the very slow Capital to outrun Old Settler on a number of occasions. Upon completion, Old Settler was placed on the run from the territorial capital, Olympia, to Shelton, Washington. The chief competition on this route at the time, at least in the same class of vessel as Old Settler was the steam scow Capital which was driven by an old threshing machine engine. The harbor at Olympia is deep enough now for ocean-going ships, but this is a result of dredging by the Corps of Engineers. In its natural state, the Olympia harbor was quite shallow, so shallow draft vessels such as Old Settler and Capital had an advantage over other vessels. The boat's original owners ran into financial difficulties and the vessel passed into the hands of Struve, Haines & Leary, a Seattle law firm. The law firm then transferred the vessel to Capt. Simon H. Randolph (d. 1909). For a time Old Settler was operated as a tow boat. Captain Randolph had a reputation for frugality, but even he could not make Old Settler into a profitable vessel. At some point prior to 1895, the boat's machinery was removed and sold to a Seattle printer. The vessel then drifted under a pier in Seattle and sank.

The clocks in the building were made by Pieter van Dormer en Sloterdijck in 1449 and by Gregorius Waghevens in 1514. The current use of the building is mostly for events and visitors. The municipal offices moved in 1975 to the Stadskantoor on the Spuiboulevard.

It is a fault that separates the granite of Lusatia from the Cretaceous sandstones of North Bohemia to the south. It is assumed that there was a fault throw of several hundred metres whereby the northern block was uplifted or upthrust relative to the southern block.  Course  The start of the fault in the west is assessed as being near Oschatz, but it first becomes topographically significant as a steep ledge near Weinb√∂hla. From there it runs eastwards along the northern perimeter of the Dresden Basin and forms the Elbe valley slopes from Radebeul via Dresden to Pirna. From there it continues rather less noticeably along the northern edge of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains via Hohnstein and Hinterhermsdorf. In Hohnstein by the so-called Wartenberg Road (Wartenbergstra√üe) is the only geological outcrop where the granite of Lusatia lies immediately above the sandstone. Further east the fault follows the northern boundary of the Lusatian / Zittau Mountains via Ji≈ôet√≠n pod Jedlovou (St. Georgenthal), Waltersdorf and Olbersdorf, where it is most prominent east of the Zittau Mountains. Natural monument of Such√© sk√°ly, Bohemian Paradise Now back on Czech territory, the fault more or less follows the crest line of the Jeschken Mountains. At the Je≈°tƒõd (Jeschken) is the highest point on the fault line, a topographical dominant that is visible from a long way off. The fault then runs eastwards, almost in a straight line, along the Je≈°tƒõd-Koz√°kov Ridge - interrupted by the valleys of the Mohelka and the Jizera - to Koz√°kov in the Bohemian Paradise. In Mal√° Sk√°la is the most notable geological outcrop along the fault, the Such√© sk√°ly. Here the once horizontal sandstone beds were tilted vertically by the pressure of the fault and, today, form an impressive rock formation.

Google Inc. was a decision by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California holding that Google had to reveal the account information of a Gmail user who had been mistakenly sent sensitive information from Rocky Mountain Bank. In August 2009, a Rocky Mountain Bank employee was asked by a customer to forward loan reports to the customer's agent. Instead, the employee mistakenly sent the email to a different account and mistakenly included a file of sensitive loan details from 1,325 individual and business customers. He emailed the Gmail user, asking the user to contact the bank and delete the email. Because the user was unresponsive, the employee asked Google to divulge the user's identity. Pursuant to its privacy policy, Google refused, noting that the bank needed to obtain a court order to obtain the information. After the bank sued Google, judge James Ware ruled that Google had to lock the Gmail account and divulge the user's account information to the bank. If the user had accessed the sensitive email, Google also had to reveal the user's identity. After Google revealed the account information, both parties filed a joint motion requesting that the judge's ruling be vacated. They explained that Google's disclosures mooted the order. The Gmail user had marked the email as spam without opening it and the email had been deleted unread on September 19, 2009. Background In August 2009, an employee of the Wilson, Wyoming-based Rocky Mountain Bank was asked by a bank customer to email loan reports to the customer's agent. However, on August 12, 2009, the employee accidentally emailed the information to an incorrect Gmail account when he misspelled one letter in the email address. His second blunder was including an attachment in the email that had private details for 1,325 individual and business customers. The attachment comprised loan details from 2008, such as \\"customers' names, addresses, Social Security or tax ID numbers, loan numbers, balances, interest rates and principal amounts\\". Upon discovering his mistake, the employee unsuccessfully attempted to rescind his email. He then sent a second email to the Gmail account, ordering the individual to expunge both the email and the attachment and refrain from looking at the attachment's contents. Directing the Gmail user to respond to him to \\"discuss his or her actions\\", the employee received no response. The bank asked Google to divulge the unresponsive account holder's identity. Pursuant to its privacy policy, the company denied the request, telling the bank that it needed to get a court order. To preclude the error from occurring again, the bank added a second tier of security access barriers. It also apprised by telephone and writing all clients whose confidential information was sent in the email. The bank also gave customers the option to have credit monitoring for a year without charge. Legal proceedings Rocky Mountain Bank sued Google to force the company to delete the email account and reveal the account holder's identity. It stressed that speedy action was needed to protect its clients from \\"irreparable\\" and \\"unnecessary\\" danger. The bank attempted to file the case under seal because it wanted to preclude consternation from its customers and a \\"surge of inquiry\\". The motion to seal was denied by U.S. District Court Judge Ronald M. Whyte. Whyte wrote that \\"[a]n attempt by a bank to shield information about an unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information until it can determine whether or not that information has been further disclosed and/or misused does not constitute a compelling reason that overrides the public's common law right of access to court filings\\". The case was later transferred to James Ware of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge placed an ad interim restraining order mandating Google to shut down the Gmail address. Ware forbade Google and the Gmail user from reviewing or dispensing the sensitive information. He also granted the bank's request to have Google reveal if the Gmail user had looked at the sensitive email or \\"otherwise manipulated\\" it and if the account was inactive or recently used. If the account had been recently used, Ware required Google to reveal to the bank the account holder's identity. Following Google's disclosures to the bank in adherence to Ware's order, Rocky Mountain Bank and Google requested in a joint motion that the restraining order be vacated. Telling the judge that the order had been mooted by Google's revelations, the motion requested that Google be allowed to restore the Gmail account. The motion did not enumerate Google's disclosures. In a report filed in late September with the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Google wrote that the confidential email was sent on August 12. Without entering the email, the Gmail user sent it to the account's spam folder. Google noted that the user could no longer access the email since it had been automatically deleted on September 19. Although Google had apprised the user of Rocky Mountain Bank's lawsuit on September 21, the company noted though that \\"with suspension of the Gmail account, the user now will be precluded from retrieving that notice, other communications about this matter or any other e-mail of importance to the user\\". Reactions Opinions on the Internet from privacy advocates were divided. A number of commentators chastised the bank for trying to block the guiltless Gmail user from entering his or her account. Some said that with limited options, the bank had responsibly tried to contact the user to erase the confidential email; when no answer was forthcoming, the bank rightfully attempted to have the account locked.

Life and career Redd Velvet grew up in Monroeville, Alabama singing in her grandfather's church. Early experience singing gospel gave her a powerful, earthy voice compared to Gladys Knight and Mavis Staples. A local choral teacher discovered her at age 12 singing in the school chorus and encouraged her to pursue classical training. At 18 Redd began intense vocal coaching under the tutelage of Mildred Allen, a principal artist with The New York Metropolitan Opera and baritone Andrew Gainey, who encouraged her to pursue a career in classical music. During a visit to \\"Memphis in May\\" in 2009, Redd met songwriter Earl Randall and Hi Records producer Willie Mitchell. Mitchell and Randall heard a demo of Redd's cover of O.V Wright's \\"Searching\\" which had been penned by Randle. On their advice, she relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, and launched her career. Upon her arrival in Memphis she founded Big Daddy's Baddass Band as her backing band and garnered the attention of the local blues community as the first African American woman to lead a band in the Memphis Blues Challenge. She advanced to the finals of the 2010 competition and again made local blues history as the first African-American woman to lead a band to place in the band category. Velvet recorded and released her first album Womanhood 101 in December 2010 on the Banana Pudding Music label she founded when she refused to sign a conventional recording contract. Womanhood 101 was critically acclaimed as the beginning of an interesting and potentially important chapter in contemporary blues by Living Blues Magazine. Although Redd is most noted for her unconventional entry into the music industry, she has also been recognized for her work as both a registered nurse and social activist for causes such as domestic violence, women's rights, and child/sexual abuse. In 2010, Redd Velvet founded Music Heals Memphis, Incorporated, a non profit organization focused on providing health and social services for musicians, promoting racial harmony and the preservation of blues and soul music. The Commercial Appeal proclaimed her the \\"Blues Angel\\" for her work as a nurse and advocate. In March 2011, Redd Velvet became the first blueswoman to create and host a radio talk show. The show was created to meet public demand from loyal followers of her posts on a social networking site. The Little Redd Schoolhouse debuted on March 3, 2011, on WMQM, a Memphis-based radio station. Redd Velvet was nominated as \\"Best New Female Artist of The Year\\" for 2011 by the Jus' Blues Foundation. In 2016 award-winning journalist Toure' wrote an article in Smithsonian Magazine praising Redd velvet for her powerful performances and work to preserve the history and heritage of the blues as an African-American art form. At the urging of Toure' and blues vocalist Teeny Tucker, Redd Velvet created \\"I Am The Blues\\", the only live, interactive blues exhibit showcasing the evolution of blues music from the shores of Africa to the twenty-first century.

The campaign took place between 217 and 219 during the prelude to the Three Kingdoms period. Although Cao Cao's forces had settled in Hanzhong Commandery three years prior after the Battle of Yangping, they were worn out by an overall Fabian strategy employed by Liu Bei's forces, who used targeted attacks to capture strategic locations from the enemy. One of these attacks resulted in the death of Xiahou Yuan, one of Cao Cao's top generals, delivering a huge blow to the morale of Cao Cao's forces. Due to logistical and other issues, Cao Cao was eventually forced to abandon Hanzhong Commandery and order a retreat. Liu Bei emerged victorious in the campaign and occupied Hanzhong Commandery in 219, after which he declared himself \\"King of Hanzhong\\" in autumn of that year. Background In 215, Cao Cao attacked the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery, defeating the latter at the Battle of Yangping. Zhang Lu surrendered and Hanzhong Commandery came under Cao Cao's control. On Liu Bei's side, he had also recently seized control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from Liu Zhang, and was in the midst of a dispute with his ally Sun Quan over Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). Liu Bei felt threatened when he received news that Hanzhong Commandery had fallen to Cao Cao, because Hanzhong was the northern \\"gateway\\" into Yi Province and he was now in danger of losing Yi Province to Cao Cao. Hence, Liu Bei came to a border treaty with Sun Quan, who had seized Changsha (), Guiyang () and Lingling () commanderies in southern Jing Province from him. Liu Bei asked Sun Quan to divert Cao Cao's attention by attacking Hefei and demanded Lingling Commandery back. In return, he recognised Sun Quan's control over Changsha, Jiangxia () and Guiyang commanderies. Strategic difference In Hanzhong Commandery, Sima Yi and Liu Ye urged Cao Cao to use the opportunity to attack Yi Province, but Cao Cao rejected the idea, saying, \\"We should not be discontent. Now that we've already conquered Longyou (referring to present-day eastern Gansu), you're still longing about merging Shu (referring to Yi Province)!\\"(‰∫∫Ëã¶ÁÑ°Ë∂≥ÔºåÊó¢ÂæóÈö¥Âè≥ÔºåË§áÊ¨≤ÂæóËúÄÔºÅ) Jin Shu vol. 1. Cao Cao then left his generals Xiahou Yuan, Zhang He and Xu Huang behind to defend Hanzhong Commandery, and his Chief Clerk () Du Xi to oversee the commandery's military affairs. In 217, Liu Bei's adviser Fa Zheng analysed the reason Cao Cao left Xiahou Yuan to guard Hanzhong Commandery: Hanzhong was still unstable (partly due to the massive relocation enforced by Cao Cao). Fa Zheng also believed Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He were not good commanders, so the pair could not defend Hanzhong Commandery. Hence, Fa Zheng urged Liu Bei to attack Hanzhong Commandery, stating three benefits if the commandery could be taken: ideally it could serve as a base of operations to attack Cao Cao and revive the Han dynasty; if that were not possible one could still attack Yong and Liang provinces from it (Hanzhong Commandery granted access to the two provinces) and expand his territory; and finally Hanzhong Commandery had long-lasting strategical impact on the survival of Liu Bei's regime. Liu Bei agreed with Fa Zheng's analysis and ordered him to plan for the upcoming campaign. The campaign=Initial clashes In 217, Liu Bei followed Huang Quan's strategy, defeated enemy forces led by Pu Hu () and Du Huo (), and seized control of Badong () and Baxi () commanderies. Liu Bei's army then advanced towards Yangping Pass (). At the same time, Liu Bei also sent Zhang Fei, Ma Chao, Wu Lan (), Lei Tong () and Ren Kui () to attack Wudu Commandery (), and they garrisoned at Xiabian County (). During this time, Leiding () of the Di ethnic group led seven tribes to join Liu Bei. As for Cao Cao's side, Xiahou Yuan defended Yangping Pass, Zhang He and Xu Huang respectively guarded Guangshi () and Mamingge (), while Cao Hong and Cao Xiu led a separate force to resist Zhang Fei. In 218, Zhang Fei and Ma Chao's army garrisoned at Gushan (), where they spread news that they were going to blockade the enemy's retreat route. Cao Hong wanted to attack Wu Lan at Xiabian County, but the other officers were suspicious of Zhang Fei's movements. Cao Xiu thought that if Zhang Fei was really planning to seal their retreat route, he should keep his plan covert; now that Zhang Fei had overtly revealed his intention, they should make use of the opportunity to feign retreat and perform a frontal assault. Cao Hong agreed to Cao Xiu's tactic and attacked. Lei Tong and Ren Kui were killed in battle, while Wu Lan fled to join the Di tribes, where he was subsequently killed by a Di leader, Qiangduan. After such a defeat, Zhang Fei and Ma Chao withdrew their army by around April 218. On another front, Liu Bei was facing Xiahou Yuan at Yangping Pass. In around August 218, Liu Bei sent Chen Shi to attack Mamingge, but the latter was defeated by Xu Huang, and some of the fleeing soldiers fell into the deep valleys during their escape. Liu Bei personally led an assault on Zhang He at Guangshi but was unable to overcome his enemy. He then sent an urgent letter to Zhuge Liang in Yi Province's capital, Chengdu, to request for reinforcements. Zhuge Liang vacillated and consulted Yang Hong (), who said, \\"Hanzhong is the throat of Yi Province. This is a critical point of survival and destruction. Without Hanzhong there will be no Shu (Yi Province). A disaster has befallen on the gates of our home. At this moment, the men should go to war, the women should help in transporting supplies, what's there to hesitate about sending reinforcements?\\"(Êº¢‰∏≠ÂâáÁõäÂ∑ûÂíΩÂñâÔºåÂ≠ò‰∫°‰πãÊ©üÊúÉÔºåËã•ÁÑ°Êº¢‰∏≠ÂâáÁÑ°ËúÄÁü£ÔºåÊ≠§ÂÆ∂ÈñÄ‰πãÁ¶ç‰πü„ÄÇÊñπ‰ªä‰πã‰∫ãÔºåÁî∑Â≠êÁï∂Êà∞ÔºåÂ•≥Â≠êÁï∂ÈÅãÔºåÁôºÂÖµ‰ΩïÁñëÔºü) Sanguozhi vol. 41. Zhuge Liang accepted Yang Hong's advice and sent reinforcements to Liu Bei while Liu Bei continued his standoff against Cao Cao's forces. Turn of the tide By October 218, Cao Cao moved from Ye city to Chang'an near Hanzhong Commandery to direct the defence against Liu Bei, but had been held up by internal problems including a major coup d'√©tat and some local uprisings. In the meantime, Liu Bei and Xiahou Yuan had been locked in a stalemate for a year. In December 218, to break the deadlock, Liu Bei crossed the Mian River () south of Yangping Pass and advanced towards Hanzhong Commandery through the mountains. Liu Bei's army set up camp at Mount Dingjun. In response, Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He led their forces out in an attempt to take control of higher ground, and they made camp at Zouma Valley (). During the night, Liu Bei followed Huang Quan's plan and set fire to the enemy camp fences. Xiahou Yuan led a force to defend the southern flank while sending Zhang He to guard the eastern side. Liu Bei launched a direct assault on Zhang He and Zhang started to falter, so Xiahou Yuan despatched half of his forces to support Zhang. At this point, Fa Zheng told Liu Bei that it was an opportune time to attack. Liu Bei ordered his men to shout loudly and beat the drums, and sent Huang Zhong to charge at the enemy. The mettlesome soldiers of Huang Zhong broke through the enemy lines and slew Xiahou Yuan and Zhao Yong, while Zhang He fled with his surviving troops to north of the Han River, where they set up a camp. As Cao Cao's forces had just lost their commander, Xiahou Yuan, a tempest ensued. Du Xi and Guo Huai regrouped their scattered troops and (unofficially) nominated Zhang He to replace Xiahou Yuan. Zhang He accepted and gave orders to his troops, restoring peace and order in his army. The following day, Liu Bei planned to cross the Han River and attack Zhang He, whose officers pointed out they were outnumbered, and suggested to Zhang He to set up camps along the banks of the Han River.(ÂÖ∂ÊòéÊó•ÔºåÂ§áÊ¨≤Ê∏°Ê±âÊ∞¥Êù•Êîª„ÄÇËØ∏Â∞Ü‰ª™‰ºóÂØ°‰∏çÊïåÔºåÂ§á‰æø‰πòËÉúÔºåÊ¨≤‰æùÊ∞¥‰∏∫Èôà‰ª•Êãí‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 26. Guo Huai felt that their forces were displaying weakness to the enemy by doing so, he proposed setting up camp far away from the river to lure the enemy to cross the shallow, during which they counterattack the enemy.(Ê∑ÆÊõ∞Ôºö‚ÄúÊ≠§Á§∫Âº±ËÄå‰∏çË∂≥Êå´ÊïåÔºåÈùûÁÆó‰πü„ÄÇ‰∏çÂ¶ÇËøúÊ∞¥‰∏∫ÈôàÔºåÂºïËÄåËá¥‰πãÔºåÂçäÊµéËÄåÂêéÂáªÔºåÂ§áÂèØÁ†¥‰πü„ÄÇ‚ÄùÊó¢ÈôàÔºåÂ§áÁñë‰∏çÊ∏°ÔºåÊ∑ÆÈÅÇÂùöÂÆàÔºåÁ§∫Êó†ËøòÂøÉ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 26. Zhang He agreed with Guo Huai's idea and moved his camp further away from the river. Liu Bei became suspicious and did not dare to cross the river. In Chang'an, when Cao Cao heard that Xiahou Yuan had been killed in action, he despatched Cao Zhen with an army to reinforce their forces at Yangping Pass. When Cao Zhen arrived, he directed Xu Huang to attack Gao Xiang, an officer under Liu Bei. Xu Huang scored a victory and temporarily restored some morale for Cao Cao's side. Battle of Han River In February 219, Cao Cao personally led an army from Chang'an to Hanzhong Commandery via Xia Valley (). Liu Bei was not worried, as he thought, \\"Even if Cao Cao came, he cannot do anything. I'll definitely take control of the Han River.\\"(ÊõπÂÖ¨Èõñ‰æÜÔºåÁÑ°ËÉΩÁÇ∫‰πüÔºåÊàëÂøÖÊúâÊº¢Â∑ùÁü£„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 32. Hence, Liu Bei gathered his forces and put up a firm defence, refusing to engage Cao Cao's army. Liu Bei focused on the Fabian strategy from this point forward. Later, when Cao Cao's forces were transporting supplies via Beishan (), Huang Zhong led a force to rob the enemy's supplies, but had yet to return on time. Zhao Yun led ten horsemen out of camp in search of Huang Zhong and encountered Cao Cao's army. They were surrounded but Zhao Yun fought his way out and retreated back to camp with the enemy in pursuit. Upon reaching camp, Zhao Yun ordered the gates to be opened, flags and banners to be lowered, and the beating of war drums to be stopped. Cao Cao's men feared an ambush in the camp and turned back. Just then, Zhao Yun ordered his troops to beat the drums loudly and his archers to rain arrows on the enemy. Cao Cao's soldiers were thrown into confusion and trampled on each other as they attempted to flee, while many drowned as they tried to escape across the Han River. As Cao Cao had been in a standoff against Liu Bei for several months and had been facing serious logistics problem, he eventually gave an order, \\"chicken rib\\" (). No one understood what Cao Cao meant when he said \\"chicken rib\\", except his registrar, Yang Xiu. Yang Xiu explained that it was a pity to discard a piece of chicken's rib even though it may not have much meat on it. This was an analogy to the situation Cao Cao was in: Cao Cao knew that he had little chance of defeating Liu Bei, but felt that it was a pity to abandon Hanzhong Commandery. By June 219, Cao Cao retreated back to Chang'an and gave up Hanzhong Commandery to Liu Bei. Aftermath A month after successfully conquering Hanzhong, Liu Bei sent Meng Da to attack Fangling Commandery () via Zigui County. Meng Da defeated and killed Fangling Commandery's Administrator, Kuai Qi (), and took control of the area. Liu Bei later sent his adopted son, Liu Feng, to attack Shangyong Commandery () via the Mian River (). Shangyong Commandery's Administrator, Shen Dan (), surrendered to Liu Feng. In around August 219, Liu Bei declared himself \\"King of Hanzhong\\". On the other hand, after withdrawing, Cao Cao was worried that Liu Bei might attack Wudu Commandery, so he ordered Zhang Ji, the Inspector () of Yong Province, to relocate 50,000 Di people from Wudu Commandery to Fufeng () and Tianshui () commanderies.

Anti-Stratfordians‚Äîa collective term for adherents of the various alternative- authorship theories‚Äîbelieve that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield the identity of the real author or authors, who for some reason‚Äîusually social rank, state security, or gender‚Äîdid not want or could not accept public credit.: Anti-Stratfordian' is the collective name for the belief that someone other than the man from Stratford wrote the plays commonly attributed to him.\\"; . Although the idea has attracted much public interest,. all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory, and for the most part acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims.: \\"...antiStratfordism has remained a fringe belief system\\"; ; : \\"To ask me about the authorship question ... is like asking a palaeontologist to debate a creationist's account of the fossil record.\\"; : \\"I do not know of a single professor of the 1,300-member Shakespeare Association of America who questions the identity of Shakespeare ... antagonism to the authorship debate from within the profession is so great that it would be as difficult for a professed Oxfordian to be hired in the first place, much less gain tenure...\\"; : \\"I have never met anyone in an academic position like mine, in the Establishment, who entertained the slightest doubt as to Shakespeare's authorship of the general body of plays attributed to him.\\"; : \\"Shakespeareans sometimes take the position that to even engage the Oxfordian hypothesis is to give it a countenance it does not warrant.\\"; : \\"There is, it should be noted, no academic Shakespearian of any standing who goes along with the Oxfordian theory.\\"; : \\"...most of the great Shakespearean scholars are to be found in the Stratfordian camp...\\" Shakespeare's authorship was first questioned in the middle of the 19th century,; ; ; ; . when adulation of Shakespeare as the greatest writer of all time had become widespread.: By 1840, admiration for Shakespeare throughout Europe had become such that Thomas Carlyle \\"could say without hyperbole\\" that Shakspeare is the chief of all Poets hitherto; the greatest intellect who, in our recorded world, has left record of himself in the way of literature. Shakespeare's biography, particularly his humble origins and obscure life, seemed incompatible with his poetic eminence and his reputation for genius,. arousing suspicion that Shakespeare might not have written the works attributed to him.. The controversy has since spawned a vast body of literature,. and more than 80 authorship candidates have been proposed,. the most popular being Sir Francis Bacon; Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford; Christopher Marlowe; and William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby.; . Supporters of alternative candidates argue that theirs is the more plausible author, and that William Shakespeare lacked the education, aristocratic sensibility, or familiarity with the royal court that they say is apparent in the works.: \\"These two notions‚Äîthat the Shakespeare canon represented the highest achievement of human culture, while William Shakespeare was a completely uneducated rustic‚Äîcombined to persuade Delia Bacon and her successors that the Folio's title page and preliminaries could only be part of a fabulously elaborate charade orchestrated by some more elevated personage, and they accordingly misread the distinctive literary traces of Shakespeare's solid Elizabethan grammar-school education visible throughout the volume as evidence that the 'real' author had attended Oxford or Cambridge.\\" Those Shakespeare scholars who have responded to such claims hold that biographical interpretations of literature are unreliable in attributing authorship,: \\"Their [Oxfordians'] favorite code is the hidden personal allusion ... But this method is in essence no different from the cryptogram, since Shakespeare's range of characters and plots, both familial and political, is so vast that it would be possible to find in the plays 'self-portraits' of, once more, anybody one cares to think of.\\"; : \\"It has more than once been claimed that the combination of 'biographical-fit' and cryptographical arguments could be used to establish a case for almost any individual ... The very fact that their application has produced so many rival claimants demonstrates their unreliability.\\" ; : \\"in voicing dissatisfaction over the apparent lack of continuity between the certain facts of Shakespeare's life and the spirit of his literary output, anti-Stratfordians adopt the very Modernist assumption that an author's work must reflect his or her life. Neither Shakespeare nor his fellow Elizabethan writers operated under this assumption.\\"; : \\"...deriving an idea of an author from his or her works is always problematic, particularly in a multi-vocal genre like drama, since it crucially underestimates the heterogeneous influences and imaginative reaches of creative writing.\\" and that the convergence of documentary evidence used to support Shakespeare's authorship‚Äîtitle pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records‚Äîis the same used for all other authorial attributions of his era.: \\"The reasons we have for believing that William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon wrote the plays and poems are the same as the reasons we have for believing any other historical event ... the historical evidence says that William Shakespeare wrote the plays and poems.\\"; ; : \\"Apart from the First Folio, the documentary evidence for William Shakespeare is the same as we get for other writers of the period...\\" No such direct evidence exists for any other candidate,: \\"The problem that confronts all such attempts is that they have to dispose of the many testimonies from Will the player's own time that he was regarded as the author of the plays and the absence of any clear contravening public claims of the same nature for any of the other favoured candidates.\\"; . and Shakespeare's authorship was not questioned during his lifetime or for centuries after his death.: \\"No one in Shakespeare's lifetime or the first two hundred years after his death expressed the slightest doubt about his authorship.\\"; : \\"...no suspicions regarding Shakespeare's authorship (except for a few mainly humorous comments) were expressed until the middle of the nineteenth century\\". Despite the scholarly consensus,; : \\"The idea that William Shakespeare's authorship of his plays and poems is a matter of conjecture and the idea that the 'authorship controversy' be taught in the classroom are the exact equivalent of current arguments that 'intelligent design' be taught alongside evolution. In both cases an overwhelming scholarly consensus, based on a serious assessment of hard evidence, is challenged by passionately held fantasies whose adherents demand equal time.\\" a relatively small: \\"Nevertheless, the skeptics who question Shakespeare's authorship are relatively few in number, and they do not speak for the majority of academic and literary professionals.\\" but highly visible and diverse assortment of supporters, including prominent public figures,. have questioned the conventional attribution.; . They work for acknowledgment of the authorship question as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry and for acceptance of one or another of the various authorship candidates.; . Overview The arguments presented by anti-Stratfordians share several characteristics.; ; ; . They attempt to disqualify William Shakespeare as the author and usually offer supporting arguments for a substitute candidate. They often postulate some type of conspiracy that protected the author's true identity,. which they say explains why no documentary evidence exists for their candidate and why the historical record supports Shakespeare's authorship.; : \\"Most observers, however, have been more impressed by the anti-Stratfordians' dogged immunity to documentary evidence\\"; : \\"the challenger would still need to produce evidence in favour of another author. There is no such evidence.\\"; : \\"...those who believe that other authors were responsible for the canon as a whole ... have been forced to invoke elaborate conspiracy theories.\\"; : \\"Paradoxically, the skeptics invariably substitute for the easily explained lack of evidence concerning William Shakespeare, the more troublesome picture of a vast conspiracy of silence about the 'real author', with a total lack of historical evidence for the existence of this 'real author' explained on the grounds of a secret pact\\"; : \\"Some suppose that only Shakespeare and the real author were in the know. At the other extreme are those who believe that it was an open secret\\". Most anti-Stratfordians suggest that the Shakespeare canon exhibits broad learning, knowledge of foreign languages and geography, and familiarity with Elizabethan and Jacobean court and politics; therefore, no one but a highly educated individual or court insider could have written it.; . Apart from literary references, critical commentary and acting notices, the available data regarding Shakespeare's life consist of mundane personal details such as vital records of his baptism, marriage and death, tax records, lawsuits to recover debts, and real estate transactions. In addition, no document attests that he received an education or owned any books.: \\"Not a trace of his library was found. No books, no manuscripts, no letters, no diaries. The desire to get close to Shakespeare was unrequited, the vacuum palpable.\\" No personal letters or literary manuscripts certainly written by Shakespeare of Stratford survive. To sceptics, these gaps in the record suggest the profile of a person who differs markedly from the playwright and poet.; ; ; : \\"Fuelled by scepticism that the plays could have been written by a working man from a provincial town with no record of university education, foreign travel, legal studies or court preferment, the controversialists proposed instead a sequence of mainly aristocratic alternative authors whose philosophically or politically occult meanings, along with their own true identity, had to be hidden in codes, cryptograms and runic obscurity.\\" Some prominent public figures, including Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Helen Keller, Henry James, Sigmund Freud, John Paul Stevens, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Charlie Chaplin, have found the arguments against Shakespeare's authorship persuasive, and their endorsements are an important element in many anti-Stratfordian arguments. At the core of the argument is the nature of acceptable evidence used to attribute works to their authors.: \\"The Shakespeare authorship debate is a classic instance of a controversy that draws its very breath from a fundamental disagreement over the nature of admissible evidence.\\"; ; . Anti-Stratfordians rely on what has been called a \\"rhetoric of accumulation\\",. or what they designate as circumstantial evidence: similarities between the characters and events portrayed in the works and the biography of their preferred candidate; literary parallels with the known works of their candidate; and literary and hidden allusions and cryptographic codes in works by contemporaries and in Shakespeare's own works.; . In contrast, academic Shakespeareans and literary historians rely mainly on direct documentary evidence‚Äîin the form of title page attributions and government records such as the Stationers' Register and the Accounts of the Revels Office‚Äîand contemporary testimony from poets, historians, and those players and playwrights who worked with him, as well as modern stylometric studies. Gaps in the record are explained by the low survival rate for documents of this period.: \\"It is a 'fact' that the survival rate for early modern documents is low and that Shakespeare lived in a world prior to the systematic, all-inclusive collection of data that provides the foundation of modern bureaucracy.\\" Scholars say all these converge to confirm William Shakespeare's authorship.; . These criteria are the same as those used to credit works to other authors and are accepted as the standard methodology for authorship attribution.; ; . Case against Shakespeare's authorship Little is known of Shakespeare's personal life, and some anti-Stratfordians take this as circumstantial evidence against his authorship.. Further, the lack of biographical information has sometimes been taken as an indication of an organised attempt by government officials to expunge all traces of Shakespeare, including perhaps his school records, to conceal the true author's identity.: \\"...on the mysterious disappearance of the accounts of the highest immediate authority over theatre in Shakespeare's age, the Lord Chamberlains of the Household. Ogburn imagines that these records, like those of the Stratford grammar school, might have been deliberately eradicated 'because they would have showed how little consequential a figure Shakspere cut in the company.: \\"Ogburn gives voice to his suspicion that the school records disappeared because they would have revealed William's name did not appear among those who attended it.\\" Shakespeare's background John Shakespeare's house in Stratford-upon-Avon is believed to be Shakespeare's birthplace. Shakespeare was born, brought up, and buried in Stratford-upon- Avon, where he maintained a household throughout the duration of his career in London. A market town of around 1,500 residents about north-west of London, Stratford was a centre for the slaughter, marketing, and distribution of sheep, as well as for hide tanning and wool trading. Anti-Stratfordians often portray the town as a cultural backwater lacking the environment necessary to nurture a genius, and depict Shakespeare as ignorant and illiterate.; ; ; ; . Shakespeare's father, John Shakespeare, was a glover (glove-maker) and town official. He married Mary Arden, one of the Ardens of Warwickshire, a family of the local gentry. Both signed their names with a mark, and no other examples of their writing are extant.. This is often used as an indication that Shakespeare was brought up in an illiterate household. There is also no evidence that Shakespeare's two daughters were literate, save for two signatures by Susanna that appear to be \\"drawn\\" instead of written with a practised hand. His other daughter, Judith, signed a legal document with a mark.. Anti-Stratfordians consider these marks and the rudimentary signature style evidence of illiteracy, and consider Shakespeare's plays, which \\"depict women across the social spectrum composing, reading, or delivering letters,\\" evidence that the author came from a more educated background. Anti- Stratfordians consider Shakespeare's background incompatible with that attributable to the author of the Shakespeare canon, which exhibits an intimacy with court politics and culture, foreign countries, and aristocratic sports such as hunting, falconry, tennis, and lawn-bowling.; : \\"It is characteristic of anti-Stratfordian books that they make a list of what Shakespeare must have been‚Äîa courtier, a lawyer, a traveler in Italy, a classicist, a falconer, whatever. Then a candidate is selected who fits the list. Not surprisingly, different lists find different candidates.\\" Some find that the works show little sympathy for upwardly mobile types such as John Shakespeare and his son, and that the author portrays individual commoners comically, as objects of ridicule. Commoners in groups are said to be depicted typically as dangerous mobs.. Education and literacy The absence of documentary proof of Shakespeare's education is often a part of anti- Stratfordian arguments. The free King's New School in Stratford, established 1553, was about from Shakespeare's boyhood home.. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era and there are no documents detailing what was taught at the Stratford school. However, grammar school curricula were largely similar, and the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree. The school would have provided an intensive education in Latin grammar, the classics, and rhetoric at no cost.; ; ; . The headmaster, Thomas Jenkins, and the instructors were Oxford graduates.; ; . No student registers of the period survive, so no documentation exists for the attendance of Shakespeare or any other pupil, nor did anyone who taught or attended the school ever record that they were his teacher or classmate. This lack of documentation is taken by many anti-Stratfordians as evidence that Shakespeare had little or no education.. Anti-Stratfordians also question how Shakespeare, with no record of the education and cultured background displayed in the works bearing his name, could have acquired the extensive vocabulary found in the plays and poems. The author's vocabulary is calculated to be between 17,500 and 29,000 words.. No letters or signed manuscripts written by Shakespeare survive. The appearance of Shakespeare's six surviving authenticated. signatures, which they characterise as \\"an illiterate scrawl\\", is interpreted as indicating that he was illiterate or barely literate.: \\"...most anti-Stratfordians claim that he was not even literate. They present his six surviving signatures as proof.\\" All are written in secretary hand, a style of handwriting common to the era,. particularly in play writing, and three of them utilize breviographs to abbreviate the surname. Name as a pseudonym Shakespeare's name was hyphenated on the cover of the 1609 quarto edition of the Sonnets. In his surviving signatures William Shakespeare did not spell his name as it appears on most Shakespeare title pages. His surname was spelled inconsistently in both literary and non-literary documents, with the most variation observed in those that were written by hand.. This is taken as evidence that he was not the same person who wrote the works, and that the name was used as a pseudonym for the true author.: \\"The main contention of these anti-Stratfordians is that 'William Shakespeare' was a pen-name, like 'Moli√®re,' 'George Eliot,' and 'Mark Twain,' which in this case cloaked the creative activities of a master scholar in high circles\\". Shakespeare's surname was hyphenated as \\"Shake- speare\\" or \\"Shak-spear\\" on the title pages of 15 of the 32 individual quarto (or Q) editions of Shakespeare's plays and in two of the five editions of poetry published before the First Folio. Of those 15 title pages with Shakespeare's name hyphenated, 13 are on the title pages of just three plays, Richard II, Richard III, and Henry IV, Part 1.. The hyphen is also present in one cast list and in six literary allusions published between 1594 and 1623. This hyphen use is construed to indicate a pseudonym by most anti- Stratfordians,. who argue that fictional descriptive names (such as \\"Master Shoe-tie\\" and \\"Sir Luckless Woo-all\\") were often hyphenated in plays, and pseudonyms such as \\"Tom Tell-truth\\" were also sometimes hyphenated.. Reasons proposed for the use of \\"Shakespeare\\" as a pseudonym vary, usually depending upon the social status of the candidate. Aristocrats such as Derby and Oxford supposedly used pseudonyms because of a prevailing \\"stigma of print\\", a social convention that putatively restricted their literary works to private and courtly audiences‚Äîas opposed to commercial endeavours‚Äîat the risk of social disgrace if violated.; ; . In the case of commoners, the reason was to avoid prosecution by the authorities: Bacon to avoid the consequences of advocating a more republican form of government,: \\"The plays have to be pseudonymous because they are too dangerous, in a climate of censorship and monarchical control, to be published openly.\\" and Marlowe to avoid imprisonment or worse after faking his death and fleeing the country.. Lack of documentary evidence On Poet-Ape\\" from his 1616 collected works is taken by some anti- Stratfordians to refer to Shakespeare. Anti-Stratfordians say that nothing in the documentary record explicitly identifies Shakespeare as a writer;. that the evidence instead supports a career as a businessman and real-estate investor; that any prominence he might have had in the London theatrical world (aside from his role as a front for the true author) was because of his money- lending, trading in theatrical properties, acting, and being a shareholder. They also believe that any evidence of a literary career was falsified as part of the effort to shield the true author's identity.. Alternative authorship theories generally reject the surface meaning of Elizabethan and Jacobean references to Shakespeare as a playwright. They interpret contemporary satirical characters as broad hints indicating that the London theatrical world knew Shakespeare was a front for an anonymous author. For instance, they identify Shakespeare with the literary thief Poet-Ape in Ben Jonson's poem of the same name, the socially ambitious fool Sogliardo in Jonson's Every Man Out of His Humour, and the foolish poetry-lover Gullio in the university play The Return from Parnassus (performed c. 1601). Similarly, praises of \\"Shakespeare\\" the writer, such as those found in the First Folio, are explained as references to the real author's pen-name, not the man from Stratford.. Circumstances of Shakespeare's death Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 in Stratford, leaving a signed will to direct the disposal of his large estate. The language of the will is mundane and unpoetic and makes no mention of personal papers, books, poems, or the 18 plays that remained unpublished at the time of his death. Its only theatrical reference‚Äîmonetary gifts to fellow actors to buy mourning rings‚Äîwas interlined after the will had been written, allowing suspicion to be cast on the authenticity of the bequests.. The effigy of Shakespeare's Stratford monument as it was portrayed in 1656, as it appears today, and as it was portrayed in 1748 before the restoration Any public mourning of Shakespeare's death went unrecorded, and no eulogies or poems memorialising his death were published until seven years later as part of the front matter in the First Folio of his plays., cites James Lardner, \\"Onward and Upward with the Arts: the Authorship Question\\", The New Yorker, 11 April 1988, p. 103: \\"No obituaries marked his death in 1616, no public mourning. No note whatsoever was taken of the passing of the man who, if the attribution is correct, would have been the greatest playwright and poet in the history of the English language.\\"; . Oxfordians think that the phrase \\"our ever-living Poet\\" (an epithet that commonly eulogised a deceased poet as having attained immortal literary fame), included in the dedication to Shakespeare's sonnets that were published in 1609, was a signal that the true poet had died by then. Oxford had died in 1604, five years earlier.; . Shakespeare's funerary monument in Stratford consists of a demi-figure effigy of him with pen in hand and an attached plaque praising his abilities as a writer. The earliest printed image of the figure, in Sir William Dugdale's Antiquities of Warwickshire (1656), differs greatly from its present appearance. Some authorship theorists argue that the figure originally portrayed a man clutching a sack of grain or wool that was later altered to help conceal the identity of the true author.; . In an attempt to put to rest such speculation, in 1924 M. H. Spielmann published a painting of the monument that had been executed before the 1748 restoration, which showed it very similar to its present-day appearance.. The publication of the image failed to achieve its intended effect, and in 2005 Oxfordian Richard Kennedy proposed that the monument was originally built to honour John Shakespeare, William's father, who by tradition was a \\"considerable dealer in wool\\".. Case for Shakespeare's authorship Nearly all academic Shakespeareans believe that the author referred to as \\"Shakespeare\\" was the same William Shakespeare who was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564 and who died there in 1616. He became an actor and shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men (later the King's Men), the playing company that owned the Globe Theatre, the Blackfriars Theatre, and exclusive rights to produce Shakespeare's plays from 1594 to 1642.. Shakespeare was also allowed the use of the honorific \\"gentleman\\" after 1596 when his father was granted a coat of arms.. Shakespeare scholars see no reason to suspect that the name was a pseudonym or that the actor was a front for the author: contemporary records identify Shakespeare as the writer, other playwrights such as Ben Jonson and Christopher Marlowe came from similar backgrounds, and no contemporary is known to have expressed doubts about Shakespeare's authorship. While information about some aspects of Shakespeare's life is sketchy, this is true of many other playwrights of the time. Of some, next to nothing is known. Others, such as Jonson, Marlowe, and John Marston, are more fully documented because of their education, close connections with the court, or brushes with the law.; . Literary scholars employ the same methodology to attribute works to the poet and playwright William Shakespeare as they use for other writers of the period: the historical record and stylistic studies,; : \\"For the evidence that William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon (1564‚Äì1616) wrote the works attributed to him is not only abundant but conclusive. It is of the kind, as Sir Edmund Chambers puts it, 'which is ordinarily accepted as determining the authorship of early literature.; : \\"Even the most partisan anti-Stratfordian or Oxfordian agrees that documentary evidence taken on its face value supports the case for William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon ... as author of the poems and plays\\"; , and they say the argument that there is no evidence of Shakespeare's authorship is a form of fallacious logic known as argumentum ex silentio, or argument from silence, since it takes the absence of evidence to be evidence of absence., They criticise the methods used to identify alternative candidates as unreliable and unscholarly, arguing that their subjectivity explains why at least as many as 80 candidates have been proposed as the \\"true\\" author.: \\"...in my opinion it is the basic unsoundness of method in this and other works of similar subject matter that explains how sincere and intelligent men arrive at such wild conclusions\\"; ; ; . They consider the idea that Shakespeare revealed himself autobiographically in his work as a cultural anachronism: it has been a common authorial practice since the 19th century, but was not during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras.; ; ; . Even in the 19th century, beginning at least with Hazlitt and Keats, critics frequently noted that the essence of Shakespeare's genius consisted in his ability to have his characters speak and act according to their given dramatic natures, rendering the determination of Shakespeare's authorial identity from his works that much more problematic.; . Historical evidence Shakespeare's honorific \\"Master\\" was represented as \\"Mr.\\" on the title page of The Rape of Lucrece (O5, 1616). The historical record is unequivocal in ascribing the authorship of the Shakespeare canon to a William Shakespeare.. In addition to the name appearing on the title pages of poems and plays, this name was given as that of a well-known writer at least 23 times during the lifetime of William Shakespeare of Stratford.. Several contemporaries corroborate the identity of the playwright as an actor,. and explicit contemporary documentary evidence attests that the Stratford citizen was also an actor under his own name.. In 1598, Francis Meres named Shakespeare as a playwright and poet in his Palladis Tamia, referring to him as one of the authors by whom the \\"English tongue is mightily enriched\\".; . He names twelve plays written by Shakespeare, including four which were never published in quarto: The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labour's Won, and King John, as well as ascribing to Shakespeare some of the plays that were published anonymously before 1598‚ÄîTitus Andronicus, Romeo and Juliet, and Henry IV, Part 1. He refers to Shakespeare's \\"sug[a]red Sonnets among his private friends\\" 11 years before the publication of the Sonnets.; . Shakespeare's father was granted a coat of arms in 1596, which in 1602 was unsuccessfully contested by Ralph Brooke, who identified Shakespeare as a \\"player\\" (actor) in his complaint. In the rigid social structure of Elizabethan England, William Shakespeare was entitled to use the honorific \\"gentleman\\" after his father's death in 1601, since his father was granted a coat of arms in 1596.. This honorific was conventionally designated by the title \\"Master\\" or its abbreviations \\"Mr.\\" or \\"M.\\" prefixed to the name (though it was often used by principal citizens and to imply respect to men of stature in the community without designating exact social status).. The title was included in many contemporary references to Shakespeare, including official and literary records, and identifies William Shakespeare of Stratford as the same William Shakespeare designated as the author.. Examples from Shakespeare's lifetime include two official stationers' entries. One is dated 23 August 1600 and entered by Andrew Wise and William Aspley: The other is dated 26 November 1607 and entered by Nathaniel Butter and John Busby: This latter appeared on the title page of King Lear Q1 (1608) as \\"M. William Shak-speare: HIS True Chronicle Historie of the life and death of King LEAR and his three Daughters.\\". Shakespeare's social status is also specifically referred to by his contemporaries in Epigram 159 by John Davies of Hereford in his The Scourge of Folly (1611): \\"To our English Terence Mr. Will: Shake-speare\\";. Epigram 92 by Thomas Freeman in his Runne and A Great Caste (1614): \\"To Master W: Shakespeare\\";; . and in historian John Stow's list of \\"Our moderne, and present excellent Poets\\" in his Annales, printed posthumously in an edition by Edmund Howes (1615), which reads: \\"M. Willi. Shake-speare gentleman\\".. After Shakespeare's death, Ben Jonson explicitly identified William Shakespeare, gentleman, as the author in the title of his eulogy, \\"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us\\", published in the First Folio (1623).. Other poets identified Shakespeare the gentleman as the author in the titles of their eulogies, also published in the First Folio: \\"Upon the Lines and Life of the Famous Scenic Poet, Master William Shakespeare\\" by Hugh Holland and \\"To the Memory of the Deceased Author, Master W. Shakespeare\\" by Leonard Digges.: \\"Throughout the First Folio, the author is called 'Mr.' or 'Maister,' a title exactly appropriate to the social rank of William Shakespeare.\\" Contemporary legal recognition Both explicit testimony by his contemporaries and strong circumstantial evidence of personal relationships with those who interacted with him as an actor and playwright support Shakespeare's authorship.. heraldic arms about the same time he listed him as one of the great poets of his time. The historian and antiquary Sir George Buc served as Deputy Master of the Revels from 1603 and as Master of the Revels from 1610 to 1622. His duties were to supervise and censor plays for the public theatres, arrange court performances of plays and, after 1606, to license plays for publication. Buc noted on the title page of George a Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield (1599), an anonymous play, that he had consulted Shakespeare on its authorship. Buc was meticulous in his efforts to attribute books and plays to the correct author, and in 1607 he personally licensed King Lear for publication as written by \\"Master William Shakespeare\\".; . In 1602, Ralph Brooke, the York Herald, accused Sir William Dethick, the Garter King of Arms, of elevating 23 unworthy persons to the gentry.. One of these was Shakespeare's father, who had applied for arms 34 years earlier but had to wait for the success of his son before they were granted in 1596.. Brooke included a sketch of the Shakespeare arms, captioned \\"Shakespear ye Player by Garter\\".; . The grants, including John Shakespeare's, were defended by Dethick and Clarenceux King of Arms William Camden, the foremost antiquary of the time.. In his Remaines Concerning Britaine‚Äîpublished in 1605, but finished two years previously and before the Earl of Oxford died in 1604‚ÄîCamden names Shakespeare as one of the \\"most pregnant witts of these ages our times, whom succeeding ages may justly admire\\".: \\"...since he had, as Clarenceux King, responded less than three years earlier to Brooke's attack on the grant of arms to the father of 'Shakespeare ye Player' ... Camden thus was aware that the last name on his list was that of William Shakespeare of Stratford. The Camden reference, therefore, is exactly what the Oxfordians insist does not exist: an identification by a knowledgeable and universally respected contemporary that 'the Stratford man' was a writer of sufficient distinction to be ranked with (if after) Sidney, Spenser, Daniel, Holland, Jonson, Campion, Drayton, Chapman, and Marston. And the identification even fulfils the eccentric Oxfordian ground-rule that it be earlier than 1616.\\" Recognition by fellow actors, playwrights and writers The two versions of the title page of The Passionate Pilgrim (3rd ed., 1612) Actors John Heminges and Henry Condell knew and worked with Shakespeare for more than 20 years. In the 1623 First Folio, they wrote that they had published the Folio \\"onely to keepe the memory of so worthy a Friend, & Fellow aliue, as was our Shakespeare, by humble offer of his playes\\". The playwright and poet Ben Jonson knew Shakespeare from at least 1598, when the Lord Chamberlain's Men performed Jonson's play Every Man in His Humour at the Curtain Theatre with Shakespeare as a cast member. The Scottish poet William Drummond recorded Jonson's often contentious comments about his contemporaries: Jonson criticised Shakespeare as lacking \\"arte\\" and for mistakenly giving Bohemia a coast in The Winter's Tale.. In 1641, four years after Jonson's death, private notes written during his later life were published. In a comment intended for posterity (Timber or Discoveries), he criticises Shakespeare's casual approach to playwriting, but praises Shakespeare as a person: \\"I loved the man, and do honour his memory (on this side Idolatry) as much as any. He was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature; had an excellent fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions ...\\". In addition to Ben Jonson, other playwrights wrote about Shakespeare, including some who sold plays to Shakespeare's company. Two of the three Parnassus plays produced at St John's College, Cambridge, near the beginning of the 17th century mention Shakespeare as an actor, poet, and playwright who lacked a university education. In The First Part of the Return from Parnassus, two separate characters refer to Shakespeare as \\"Sweet Mr. Shakespeare\\", and in The Second Part of the Return from Parnassus (1606), the anonymous playwright has the actor Kempe say to the actor Burbage, \\"Few of the university men pen plays well ... Why here's our fellow Shakespeare puts them all down.\\"; . An edition of The Passionate Pilgrim, expanded with an additional nine poems written by the prominent English actor, playwright, and author Thomas Heywood, was published by William Jaggard in 1612 with Shakespeare's name on the title page. Heywood protested this piracy in his Apology for Actors (1612), adding that the author was \\"much offended with M. Jaggard (that altogether unknown to him) presumed to make so bold with his name.\\" That Heywood stated with certainty that the author was unaware of the deception, and that Jaggard removed Shakespeare's name from unsold copies even though Heywood did not explicitly name him, indicates that Shakespeare was the offended author.; . Elsewhere, in his poem \\"Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels\\" (1634), Heywood affectionately notes the nicknames his fellow playwrights had been known by. Of Shakespeare, he writes: ::Our modern poets to that pass are driven, ::Those names are curtailed which they first had given; ::And, as we wished to have their memories drowned, ::We scarcely can afford them half their sound. ... ::Mellifluous Shake-speare, whose enchanting quill ::Commanded mirth or passion, was but Will.; . Playwright John Webster, in his dedication to The White Devil (1612), wrote, \\"And lastly (without wrong last to be named), the right happy and copious industry of M. Shake-Speare, M. Decker, & M. Heywood, wishing what I write might be read in their light\\", here using the abbreviation \\"M.\\" to denote \\"Master\\", a form of address properly used of William Shakespeare of Stratford, who was titled a gentleman.. In a verse letter to Ben Jonson dated to about 1608, Francis Beaumont alludes to several playwrights, including Shakespeare, about whom he wrote, ::... Here I would let slip ::(If I had any in me) scholarship, ::And from all learning keep these lines as clear ::as Shakespeare's best are, which our heirs shall hear ::Preachers apt to their auditors to show ::how far sometimes a mortal man may go ::by the dim light of Nature.; ; . Shakespeare's death‚Äîthe historical perspective The inscription on Shakespeare's monument The monument to Shakespeare, erected in Stratford before 1623, bears a plaque with an inscription identifying Shakespeare as a writer. The first two Latin lines translate to \\"In judgment a Pylian, in genius a Socrates, in art a Maro, the earth covers him, the people mourn him, Olympus possesses him\\", referring to Nestor, Socrates, Virgil, and Mount Olympus. The monument was not only referred to in the First Folio, but other early 17th-century records identify it as being a memorial to Shakespeare and transcribe the inscription.; . Sir William Dugdale also included the inscription in his Antiquities of Warwickshire (1656), but the engraving was done from a sketch made in 1634 and, like other portrayals of monuments in his work, is not accurate.: \\"While Hollar conveyed the general impressions suggested by Dugdale's sketch, few of the details were transmitted with accuracy. Indeed, Dugdale's sketch gave Hollar few details to work with ... As with other sketches in his collection, Dugdale made no attempt to draw a facial likeness, but appears to have sketched one of his standard faces to depict a man with facial hair. Consequently, Hollar invented the facial features for Shakespeare. The conclusion is obvious: in the absence of an accurate and detailed model, Hollar freely improvised his image of Shakespeare's monument. That improvisation is what disqualifies the engraving's value as authoritative evidence.\\" Shakespeare's will, executed on 25 March 1616, bequeaths \\"to my fellows John Hemynge Richard Burbage and Henry Cundell 26 shilling 8 pence apiece to buy them [mourning] rings\\". Numerous public records, including the royal patent of 19 May 1603 that chartered the King's Men, establish that Phillips, Heminges, Burbage, and Condell were fellow actors in the King's Men with William Shakespeare; two of them later edited his collected plays. Anti-Stratfordians have cast suspicion on these bequests, which were interlined, and claim that they were added later as part of a conspiracy. However, the will was proved in the Prerogative Court of the Archbishop of Canterbury (George Abbot) in London on 22 June 1616, and the original was copied into the court register with the bequests intact.. John Taylor was the first poet to mention in print the deaths of Shakespeare and Francis Beaumont in his 1620 book of poems The Praise of Hemp-seed.. Both had died four years earlier, less than two months apart. Ben Jonson wrote a short poem \\"To the Reader\\" commending the First Folio engraving of Shakespeare by Droeshout as a good likeness. Included in the prefatory commendatory verses was Jonson's lengthy eulogy \\"To the memory of my beloved, the Author Mr. William Shakespeare: and what he hath left us\\" in which he identifies Shakespeare as a playwright, a poet, and an actor, and writes: ::Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were ::To see thee in our waters yet appear, ::And make those flights upon the banks of Thames, ::That so did take Eliza, and our James! Here Jonson links the author to Stratford's river, the Avon, and confirms his appearances at the courts of Elizabeth I and James I.. Leonard Digges wrote the elegy \\"To the Memorie of the Deceased Authour Maister W. Shakespeare\\" in the 1623 First Folio, referring to \\"thy Stratford Moniment\\". Living four miles from Stratford-upon-Avon from 1600 until attending Oxford in 1603, Digges was the stepson of Thomas Russell, whom Shakespeare in his will designated as overseer to the executors.. William Basse wrote an elegy entitled \\"On Mr. Wm. Shakespeare\\" sometime between 1616 and 1623, in which he suggests that Shakespeare should have been buried in Westminster Abbey next to Chaucer, Beaumont, and Spenser. This poem circulated very widely in manuscript and survives today in more than two dozen contemporary copies; several of these have a fuller, variant title \\"On Mr. William Shakespeare, he died in April 1616\\", which unambiguously specifies that the reference is to Shakespeare of Stratford.; . Evidence for Shakespeare's authorship from his works Shakespeare's are the most studied secular works in history.; . Contemporary comments and some textual studies support the authorship of someone with an education, background, and life span consistent with that of William Shakespeare.; . King Edward VI Grammar School at Stratford-upon-Avon Ben Jonson and Francis Beaumont referenced Shakespeare's lack of classical learning, and no extant contemporary record suggests he was a learned writer or scholar.; . This is consistent with classical blunders in Shakespeare, such as mistaking the scansion of many classical names, or the anachronistic citing of Plato and Aristotle in Troilus and Cressida.. It has been suggested that most of Shakespeare's classical allusions were drawn from Thomas Cooper's Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae (1565), since a number of errors in that work are replicated in several of Shakespeare's plays,. and a copy of this book had been bequeathed to Stratford Grammar School by John Bretchgirdle for \\"the common use of scholars\\".. Later critics such as Samuel Johnson remarked that Shakespeare's genius lay not in his erudition, but in his \\"vigilance of observation and accuracy of distinction which books and precepts cannot confer; from this almost all original and native excellence proceeds\\".. Much of the learning with which he has been credited and the omnivorous reading imputed to Shakespeare by critics in later years is exaggerated, and he may well have absorbed much learning from conversations.:\\"As has often been pointed out, if Shakespeare had read all the books claimed to have influenced him, he would never have had time to write a word of his own. He probably picked up many of his ideas from conversation. If he needed legal knowledge it was easier to extract this from Inns-of-Court drinkers in the Devil Tavern than to search volumes of precedents.\\" And contrary to previous claims‚Äîboth scholarly and popular‚Äîabout his vocabulary and word coinage, the evidence of vocabulary size and word-use frequency places Shakespeare with his contemporaries, rather than apart from them. Computerized comparisons with other playwrights demonstrate that his vocabulary is indeed large, but only because the canon of his surviving plays is larger than those of his contemporaries and because of the broad range of his characters, settings, and themes.. Shakespeare's plays differ from those of the University Wits in that they avoid ostentatious displays of the writer's mastery of Latin or of classical principles of drama, with the exceptions of co-authored early plays such as the Henry VI series and Titus Andronicus. His classical allusions instead rely on the Elizabethan grammar school curriculum. The curriculum began with William Lily's Latin grammar Rudimenta Grammatices and progressed to Caesar, Livy, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Plautus, Terence, and Seneca, all of whom are quoted and echoed in the Shakespearean canon. Almost uniquely among his peers, Shakespeare's plays include references to grammar school texts and pedagogy, together with caricatures of schoolmasters. Titus Andronicus (4.10), The Taming of the Shrew (1.1), Love's Labour's Lost (5.1), Twelfth Night (2.3), and The Merry Wives of Windsor (4.1) refer to Lily's Grammar. Shakespeare also alluded to the petty school that children attended at age 5 to 7 to learn to read, a prerequisite for grammar school.. John Fletcher and Shakespeare Beginning in 1987, Ward Elliott, who was sympathetic to the Oxfordian theory, and Robert J. Valenza supervised a continuing stylometric study that used computer programs to compare Shakespeare's stylistic habits to the works of 37 authors who had been proposed as the true author. The study, known as the Claremont Shakespeare Clinic, was last held in the spring of 2010.. The tests determined that Shakespeare's work shows consistent, countable, profile-fitting patterns, suggesting that he was a single individual, not a committee, and that he used fewer relative clauses and more hyphens, feminine endings, and run-on lines than most of the writers with whom he was compared. The result determined that none of the other tested claimants' work could have been written by Shakespeare, nor could Shakespeare have been written by them, eliminating all of the claimants whose known works have survived‚Äîincluding Oxford, Bacon, and Marlowe‚Äîas the true authors of the Shakespeare canon.. Shakespeare's style evolved over time in keeping with changes in literary trends. His late plays, such as The Winter's Tale, The Tempest, and Henry VIII, are written in a style similar to that of other Jacobean playwrights and radically different from that of his Elizabethan-era plays.. In addition, after the King's Men began using the Blackfriars Theatre for performances in 1609, Shakespeare's plays were written to accommodate a smaller stage with more music, dancing, and more evenly divided acts to allow for trimming the candles used for stage lighting.. In a 2004 study, Dean Keith Simonton examined the correlation between the thematic content of Shakespeare's plays and the political context in which they would have been written. He concludes that the consensus play chronology is roughly the correct order, and that Shakespeare's works exhibit gradual stylistic development consistent with that of other artistic geniuses.. When backdated two years, the mainstream chronologies yield substantial correlations between the two, whereas the alternative chronologies proposed by Oxfordians display no relationship regardless of the time lag.: \\"If the Earl of Oxford wrote these plays, then he not only displayed minimal stylistic development over the course of his career (Elliot & Valenza, 2000), but he also wrote in monastic isolation from the key events of his day.\\": \\"For the record, I find the traditional attribution to William Shakespeare of Stratford highly improbable ... I really would like Edward de Vere to be the author of the plays and poems ... Thus, I had hoped that the current study might strengthen the case on behalf of the Oxfordian attribution. I think that expectation was proven wrong.\\" Textual evidence from the late plays indicates that Shakespeare collaborated with other playwrights who were not always aware of what he had done in a previous scene. This suggests that they were following a rough outline rather than working from an unfinished script left by an already dead playwright, as some Oxfordians propose. For example, in The Two Noble Kinsmen (1612‚Äì1613), written with John Fletcher, Shakespeare has two characters meet and leaves them on stage at the end of one scene, yet Fletcher has them act as if they were meeting for the first time in the following scene.. History of the authorship question=Bardolatry and early doubt Despite adulatory tributes attached to his works, Shakespeare was not considered the world's greatest writer in the century and a half following his death.. His reputation was that of a good playwright and poet among many others of his era.. Beaumont and Fletcher's plays dominated popular taste after the theatres reopened in the Restoration Era in 1660, with Ben Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays vying for second place. After the actor David Garrick mounted the Shakespeare Stratford Jubilee in 1769, Shakespeare led the field.. Excluding a handful of minor 18th-century satirical and allegorical references, quoted in ; . there was no suggestion in this period that anyone else might have written the works. The authorship question emerged only after Shakespeare had come to be regarded as the English national poet and a unique genius.. By the beginning of the 19th century, adulation was in full swing, with Shakespeare singled out as a transcendent genius, a phenomenon for which George Bernard Shaw coined the term \\"bardolatry\\" in 1901.. By the middle of the century his genius was noted as much for its intellectual as for its imaginative strength.. Since what was known about his life seemed to reveal Shakespeare as an untutored rustic,. uneasiness began to emerge over the dissonance between Shakespeare's reputation and his biography. Although still convinced that Shakespeare was the author of the works, Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed this disjunction in a lecture in 1846 by allowing that he could not reconcile Shakespeare's verse with the image of a jovial actor and theatre manager.: \\"The Egyptian verdict of the Shakspeare Societies comes to mind; that he was a jovial actor and manager. I can not marry this fact to his verse.\\" The rise of historical criticism, which challenged the authorial unity of Homer's epics and the historicity of the Bible, also fuelled emerging puzzlement over Shakespeare's authorship, which in one critic's view was \\"an accident waiting to happen\\".. David Strauss's investigation of the biography of Jesus, which shocked the public with its scepticism of the historical accuracy of the Gospels, influenced the secular debate about Shakespeare.. In 1848, Samuel Mosheim Schmucker endeavoured to rebut Strauss's doubts about the historicity of Christ by applying the same techniques satirically to the records of Shakespeare's life in his Historic Doubts Respecting Shakespeare, Illustrating Infidel Objections Against the Bible. Schmucker, who never doubted that Shakespeare was Shakespeare, unwittingly anticipated and rehearsed many of the later arguments for alternative authorship candidates.; . Open dissent and the first alternative candidate Delia Bacon was the first writer to formulate a comprehensive theory that Shakespeare was not the writer of the works attributed to him. Shakespeare's authorship was first openly questioned in the pages of Joseph C. Hart's The Romance of Yachting (1848). Hart argued that the plays contained evidence that many different authors had worked on them. Four years later Dr. Robert W. Jameson anonymously published \\"Who Wrote Shakespeare?\\" in the Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, expressing similar views. In 1856 Delia Bacon's unsigned article \\"William Shakspeare and His Plays; An Enquiry Concerning Them\\" appeared in Putnam's Magazine.. As early as 1845, Ohio-born Delia Bacon had theorised that the plays attributed to Shakespeare were actually written by a group under the leadership of Sir Francis Bacon, with Walter Raleigh as the main writer,. whose purpose was to inculcate an advanced political and philosophical system for which they themselves could not publicly assume responsibility.. She argued that Shakespeare's commercial success precluded his writing plays so concerned with philosophical and political issues, and that if he had, he would have overseen the publication of his plays in his retirement.. Francis Bacon was the first single alternative author proposed in print, by William Henry Smith, in a pamphlet published in September 1856 (Was Lord Bacon the Author of Shakspeare's Plays? A Letter to Lord Ellesmere).. The following year Delia Bacon published a book outlining her theory: The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded.. Ten years later, Judge Nathaniel Holmes of Kentucky published the 600-page The Authorship of Shakespeare supporting Smith's theory,. and the idea began to spread widely. By 1884 the question had produced more than 250 books, and Smith asserted that the war against the Shakespeare hegemony had almost been won by the Baconians after a 30-year battle.. Two years later the Francis Bacon Society was founded in England to promote the theory. The society still survives and publishes a journal, Baconiana, to further its mission.. These arguments against Shakespeare's authorship were answered by academics. In 1857 the English critic George Henry Townsend published William Shakespeare Not an Impostor, criticising what he called the slovenly scholarship, false premises, specious parallel passages, and erroneous conclusions of the earliest proponents of alternative authorship candidates.. Search for proof Orville Ward Owen constructed a \\"cipher wheel\\" that he used to search for hidden ciphers he believed Francis Bacon had left in Shakespeare's works. In 1853, with the help of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Delia Bacon travelled to England to search for evidence to support her theories.. Instead of performing archival research, she sought to unearth buried manuscripts, and unsuccessfully tried to persuade a caretaker to open Bacon's tomb.; . She believed she had deciphered instructions in Bacon's letters to look beneath Shakespeare's Stratford gravestone for papers that would prove the works were Bacon's, but after spending several nights in the chancel trying to summon the requisite courage, she left without prising up the stone slab.. Ciphers became important to the Baconian theory, as they would later to the advocacy of other authorship candidates, with books such as Ignatius L. Donnelly's The Great Cryptogram (1888) promoting the approach. Dr. Orville Ward Owen constructed a \\"cipher wheel\\", a 1,000-foot strip of canvas on which he had pasted the works of Shakespeare and other writers and mounted on two parallel wheels so he could quickly collate pages with key words as he turned them for decryption.; ; . In his multi-volume Sir Francis Bacon's Cipher Story (1893), he claimed to have discovered Bacon's autobiography embedded in Shakespeare's plays, including the revelation that Bacon was the secret son of Queen Elizabeth, thus providing more motivation to conceal his authorship from the public. A feature in the Chicago Tribune on the 1916 trial of Shakespeare's authorship. From left: George Fabyan; Judge Tuthill; Shakespeare and Bacon; William Selig. Perhaps because of Francis Bacon's legal background, both mock and real jury trials figured in attempts to prove claims for Bacon, and later for Oxford. The first mock trial was conducted over 15 months in 1892‚Äì93, and the results of the debate were published in the Boston monthly The Arena. Ignatius Donnelly was one of the plaintiffs, while F. J. Furnivall formed part of the defence. The 25-member jury, which included Henry George, Edmund Gosse, and Henry Irving, came down heavily in favour of William Shakespeare.. In 1916, Judge Richard Tuthill presided over a real trial in Chicago. A film producer brought an action against a Baconian advocate, George Fabyan. He argued that Fabyan's advocacy of Bacon threatened the profits expected from a forthcoming film about Shakespeare. The judge determined that ciphers identified by Fabyan's analysts proved that Francis Bacon was the author of the Shakespeare canon, awarding Fabyan $5,000 in damages. In the ensuing uproar, Tuthill rescinded his decision, and another judge, Frederick A. Smith, dismissed the case.; ; . In 1907, Owen claimed he had decoded instructions revealing that a box containing proof of Bacon's authorship had been buried in the River Wye near Chepstow Castle on the Duke of Beaufort's property. His dredging machinery failed to retrieve any concealed manuscripts.; . That same year his former assistant, Elizabeth Wells Gallup, financed by George Fabyan, likewise travelled to England. She believed she had decoded a message, by means of a biliteral cipher, revealing that Bacon's secret manuscripts were hidden behind panels in Canonbury Tower in Islington.; . None were found. Two years later, the American humorist Mark Twain publicly revealed his long-held anti- Stratfordian belief in Is Shakespeare Dead? (1909), favouring Bacon as the true author.. In the 1920s Walter Conrad Arensberg became convinced that Bacon had willed the key to his cipher to the Rosicrucians. He thought this society was still active, and that its members communicated with each under the aegis of the Church of England. On the basis of cryptograms he detected in the sixpenny tickets of admission to Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, he deduced that both Bacon and his mother were secretly buried, together with the original manuscripts of Shakespeare's plays, in the Lichfield Chapter house in Staffordshire. He unsuccessfully petitioned the Dean of Lichfield to allow him both to photograph and excavate the obscure grave.. Maria Bauer was convinced that Bacon's manuscripts had been imported into Jamestown, Virginia, in 1653, and could be found in the Bruton Vault at Williamsburg. She gained permission in the late 1930s to excavate, but authorities quickly withdrew her permit.; . In 1938 Roderick Eagle was allowed to open the tomb of Edmund Spenser to search for proof that Bacon was Shakespeare, but found only some old bones.. Other candidates emerge By the end of the 19th century other candidates had begun to receive attention. In 1895 Wilbur G. Zeigler, an attorney, published the novel It Was Marlowe: A Story of the Secret of Three Centuries, whose premise was that Christopher Marlowe did not die in 1593, but rather survived to write Shakespeare's plays.; . He was followed by Thomas Corwin Mendenhall who, in the February 1902 issue of Current Literature, wrote an article based upon his stylometric work titled \\"Did Marlowe write Shakespeare?\\" Karl Bleibtreu, a German literary critic, advanced the nomination of Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, in 1907.. Rutland's candidacy enjoyed a brief flowering, supported by a number of other authors over the next few years.. Anti-Stratfordians unaffiliated to any specific authorship candidate also began to appear. George Greenwood, a British barrister, sought to disqualify William Shakespeare from the authorship in The Shakespeare Problem Restated (1908), but did not support any alternative authors, thereby encouraging the search for candidates other than Bacon.; . John M. Robertson published The Baconian Heresy: A Confutation in 1913, refuting the contention that Shakespeare had expert legal knowledge by showing that legalisms pervaded Elizabethan and Jacobean literature.; . In 1916, on the three-hundredth anniversary of Shakespeare's death, Henry Watterson, the long-time editor of The Courier-Journal, wrote a widely syndicated front-page feature story supporting the Marlovian theory and, like Zeigler, created a fictional account of how it might have happened.. After the First World War, Professor Abel Lefranc, an authority on French and English literature, argued the case for William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, as the author based on biographical evidence he had gleaned from the plays and poems.. J. Thomas Looney's Shakespeare Identified (1920) made Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, the top authorship claimant. With the appearance of J. Thomas Looney's Shakespeare Identified (1920),. Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, quickly ascended as the most popular alternative author.. Two years later Looney and Greenwood founded the Shakespeare Fellowship, an international organisation to promote discussion and debate on the authorship question, which later changed its mission to propagate the Oxfordian theory.. In 1923 Archie Webster published \\"Was Marlowe the Man?\\" in The National Review, like Zeigler, Mendenhall and Watterson proposing that Marlowe wrote the works of Shakespeare, and arguing in particular that the Sonnets were an autobiographical account of his survival.; . In 1932 Allardyce Nicoll announced the discovery of a manuscript that appeared to establish James Wilmot as the earliest proponent of Bacon's authorship,. but recent investigations have identified the manuscript as a forgery probably designed to revive Baconian theory in the face of Oxford's ascendancy.. Another authorship candidate emerged in 1943 when writer Alden Brooks, in his Will Shakspere and the Dyer's hand, argued for Sir Edward Dyer.. Six years earlier Brooks had dismissed Shakespeare as the playwright by proposing that his role in the deception was to act as an Elizabethan \\"play broker\\", brokering the plays and poems on behalf of his various principals, the real authors. This view, of Shakespeare as a commercial go-between, was later adapted by Oxfordians.. After the Second World War, Oxfordism and anti-Stratfordism declined in popularity and visibility.. Copious archival research had failed to confirm Oxford or anyone else as the true author, and publishers lost interest in books advancing the same theories based on alleged circumstantial evidence. To bridge the evidentiary gap, both Oxfordians and Baconians began to argue that hidden clues and allusions in the Shakespeare canon had been placed there by their candidate for the benefit of future researchers.. To revive interest in Oxford, in 1952 Dorothy and Charlton Ogburn Sr. published the 1,300-page This Star of England,. now regarded as a classic Oxfordian text.. They proposed that the \\"fair youth\\" of the sonnets was Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, the offspring of a love affair between Oxford and the Queen, and that the \\"Shakespeare\\" plays were written by Oxford to memorialise the passion of that affair. This became known as the \\"Prince Tudor theory\\", which postulates that the Queen's illicit offspring and his father's authorship of the Shakespeare canon were covered up as an Elizabethan state secret. The Ogburns found many parallels between Oxford's life and the works, particularly in Hamlet, which they characterised as \\"straight biography\\".. A brief upsurge of enthusiasm ensued, resulting in the establishment of the Shakespeare Oxford Society in the US in 1957.. In 1955 Broadway press agent Calvin Hoffman revived the Marlovian theory with the publication of The Murder of the Man Who Was \\"Shakespeare\\".. The next year he went to England to search for documentary evidence about Marlowe that he thought might be buried in his literary patron Sir Thomas Walsingham's tomb.. Nothing was found. A series of critical academic books and articles held in check any appreciable growth of anti-Stratfordism, as academics attacked its results and its methodology as unscholarly.. American cryptologists William and Elizebeth Friedman won the Folger Shakespeare Library Literary Prize in 1955 for a study of the arguments that the works of Shakespeare contain hidden ciphers. The study disproved all claims that the works contain ciphers, and was condensed and published as The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined (1957). Soon after, four major works were issued surveying the history of the anti- Stratfordian phenomenon from a mainstream perspective: The Poacher from Stratford (1958), by Frank Wadsworth, Shakespeare and His Betters (1958), by Reginald Churchill, The Shakespeare Claimants (1962), by H. N. Gibson, and Shakespeare and His Rivals: A Casebook on the Authorship Controversy (1962), by George L. McMichael and Edgar M. Glenn. In 1959 the American Bar Association Journal published a series of articles and letters on the authorship controversy, later anthologised as Shakespeare Cross-Examination (1961). In 1968 the newsletter of The Shakespeare Oxford Society reported that \\"the missionary or evangelical spirit of most of our members seems to be at a low ebb, dormant, or non-existent\\".Quoted in . In 1974, membership in the society stood at 80.. Authorship in the mainstream media The freelance writer Charlton Ogburn Jr., elected president of The Shakespeare Oxford Society in 1976, promptly began a campaign to bypass the academic establishment; he believed it to be an \\"entrenched authority\\" that aimed to \\"outlaw and silence dissent in a supposedly free society\\". He proposed fighting for public recognition by portraying Oxford as a candidate on equal footing with Shakespeare.. In 1984 Ogburn published his 900-page The Mysterious William Shakespeare: the Myth and the Reality, and by framing the issue as one of fairness in the atmosphere of conspiracy that permeated America after Watergate, he used the media to circumnavigate academia and appeal directly to the public.. Ogburn's efforts secured Oxford the place as the most popular alternative candidate. He also kick-started the modern revival of the Oxfordian movement by adopting a policy of seeking publicity through moot court trials, media debates, television, and other outlets. These methods were later extended to the Internet, including Wikipedia.; ; ; ; . Henry Peacham's Minerva Britanna (1612) has been used by Baconians and Oxfordians alike as coded evidence for concealed authorship of the Shakespeare canon.Ross (Oxfordian Myths). Ogburn believed that academics were best challenged by recourse to law, and on 25 September 1987 three justices of the Supreme Court of the United States convened a one-day moot court at the Metropolitan Memorial United Methodist Church, to hear the Oxfordian case. The trial was structured so that literary experts would not be represented, but the burden of proof was on the Oxfordians. The justices determined that the case was based on a conspiracy theory, and that the reasons given for this conspiracy were both incoherent and unpersuasive.. Although Ogburn took the verdict as a \\"clear defeat\\", Oxfordian columnist Joseph Sobran thought the trial had effectively dismissed any other Shakespeare authorship contender from the public mind and provided legitimacy for Oxford.. A retrial was organised the next year in the United Kingdom to potentially reverse the decision. Presided over by three Law Lords, the court was held in the Inner Temple in London on 26 November 1988. On this occasion Shakespearean scholars argued their case, and the outcome confirmed the American verdict.. Due in part to the rising visibility of the authorship question, media coverage of the controversy increased, with many outlets focusing on the Oxfordian theory. In 1989 the Public Broadcasting Service television show Frontline broadcast \\"The Shakespeare Mystery\\", exposing the interpretation of Oxford-as- Shakespeare to more than 3.5 million viewers in the US alone.. This was followed in 1992 by a three-hour Frontline teleconference, \\"Uncovering Shakespeare: an Update\\", moderated by William F. Buckley, Jr.. In 1991 The Atlantic Monthly published a debate between Tom Bethell, presenting the case for Oxford,. and Irvin Leigh Matus, presenting the case for Shakespeare.. A similar print debate took place in 1999 in Harper's Magazine under the title \\"The Ghost of Shakespeare\\". Beginning in the 1990s Oxfordians and other anti- Stratfordians increasingly turned to the Internet to promulgate their theories, including creating several articles on Wikipedia about the candidates and the arguments, to such an extent that a survey of the field in 2010 judged that its presence on Wikipedia \\"puts to shame anything that ever appeared in standard resources\\".. On 14 April 2007 the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition issued an internet petition, the \\"Declaration of Reasonable Doubt About the Identity of William Shakespeare\\", coinciding with Brunel University's announcement of a one-year Master of Arts programme in Shakespeare authorship studies (since suspended). The coalition intended to enlist broad public support so that by 2016, the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, the academic Shakespeare establishment would be forced to acknowledge that legitimate grounds for doubting Shakespeare's authorship exist, a goal that was not successful.; . More than 1,200 signatures were collected by the end of 2007, and as of 23 April 2016, the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death and the self-imposed deadline, the document had been signed by 3,348 people, including 573 self-described current and former academics. On 22 April 2007, The New York Times published a survey of 265 American Shakespeare professors on the Shakespeare authorship question. To the question of whether there is good reason to question Shakespeare's authorship, 6 per cent answered \\"yes\\", and 11 percent \\"possibly\\". When asked their opinion of the topic, 61 per cent chose \\"A theory without convincing evidence\\" and 32 per cent chose \\"A waste of time and classroom distraction\\".. In 2010 James S. Shapiro surveyed the authorship question in Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare? Approaching the subject sociologically, Shapiro found its origins to be grounded in a vein of traditional scholarship going back to Edmond Malone, and criticised academia for ignoring the topic, which was, he argued, tantamount to surrendering the field to anti-Stratfordians.. Shapiro links the revival of the Oxfordian movement to the cultural changes that followed the Watergate conspiracy scandal that increased the willingness of the public to believe in governmental conspiracies and cover-ups,. and Robert Sawyer suggests that the increased presence of anti-Stratfordian ideas in popular culture can be attributed to the proliferation of conspiracy theories since the 9/11 attacks.. In September 2011, Anonymous, a feature film based on the \\"Prince Tudor\\" variant of the Oxfordian theory, written by John Orloff and directed by Roland Emmerich, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. De Vere is portrayed as a literary prodigy who becomes the lover of Queen Elizabeth, with whom he sires Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, only to discover that he himself may be the Queen's son by an earlier lover. He eventually sees his suppressed plays performed through the front man, William Shakespeare, who is portrayed as an opportunistic actor and the movie's comic foil. Oxford agrees to Elizabeth's demand that he remain anonymous as part of a bargain for saving their son from execution as a traitor for supporting the Essex Rebellion against her. Two months before the release of the film, the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust launched a campaign attacking anti-Stratfordian arguments by means of a web site, 60 Minutes With Shakespeare: Who Was William Shakespeare?, containing short audio contributions recorded by actors, scholars and other celebrities,. which was quickly followed by a rebuttal from the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition. Since then, Paul Edmondson and Stanley Wells have written a short e-book, Shakespeare Bites Back (2011), and edited a longer book of essays by prominent academic Shakespeareans, Shakespeare Beyond Doubt (2013), in which Edmondson says that they had \\"decided to lead the Shakespeare Authorship Campaign because we thought more questions would be asked by our visitors and students because of Anonymous, because we saw, and continue to see, something very wrong with the way doubts about Shakespeare's authorship are being given academic credibility by the Universities of Concordia and Brunel, and because we felt that merely ignoring the anti-Shakespearians was inappropriate at a time when their popular voice was likely to be gaining more ground\\". Alternative candidates While more than 80 historical figures have been nominated at one time or another as the true author of the Shakespearean canon, only a few of these claimants have attracted significant attention.. In addition to sole candidates, various \\"group\\" theories have also achieved a notable level of interest.. Group theories Various group theories of Shakespearean authorship were proposed as early as the mid-19th century. Delia Bacon's The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespeare Unfolded (1857), the first book focused entirely on the authorship debate, also proposed the first \\"group theory\\". It attributed the works of Shakespeare to \\"a little clique of disappointed and defeated politicians\\" led by Sir Walter Raleigh which included Sir Francis Bacon and perhaps Edmund Spenser, Lord Buckhurst, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.; . Gilbert Slater's The Seven Shakespeares (1931) proposed that the works were written by seven different authors: Francis Bacon, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, Sir Walter Raleigh, William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, Christopher Marlowe, Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, and Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland.. In the early 1960s, Edward de Vere, Francis Bacon, Roger Manners, William Herbert and Mary Sidney were suggested as members of a group referred to as \\"The Oxford Syndicate\\".. Christopher Marlowe, Robert Greene and Thomas Nashe have also been proposed as participants. Some variants of the group theory also include William Shakespeare of Stratford as the group's manager, broker and/or front man.. Sir Francis Bacon alt=Portrait with side view of a bearded man wearing a tall hat; the face looks out of the picture. Sir Francis Bacon (1561‚Äì1626) The leading candidate of the 19th century was one of the great intellectual figures of Jacobean England, Sir Francis Bacon, a lawyer, philosopher, essayist and scientist. Bacon's candidacy relies upon historical and literary conjectures, as well as alleged cryptographic evidence.. Bacon was proposed as sole author by William Henry Smith in 1856 and as a co-author by Delia Bacon in 1857. Smith compared passages such as Bacon's \\"Poetry is nothing else but feigned history\\" with Shakespeare's \\"The truest poetry is the most feigning\\" (As You Like It, 3.3.19‚Äì20), and Bacon's \\"He wished him not to shut the gate of your Majesty's mercy\\" with Shakespeare's \\"The gates of mercy shall be all shut up\\" (Henry V, 3.3.10).; . Delia Bacon argued that there were hidden political meanings in the plays and parallels between those ideas and Bacon's known works. She proposed him as the leader of a group of disaffected philosopher-politicians who tried to promote republican ideas to counter the despotism of the Tudor-Stuart monarchies through the medium of the public stage.. Later Bacon supporters found similarities between a great number of specific phrases and aphorisms from the plays and those written by Bacon in his waste book, the Promus. In 1883, Mrs. Henry Pott compiled 4,400 parallels of thought or expression between Shakespeare and Bacon.; ; . In a letter addressed to John Davies, Bacon closes \\"so desireing you to bee good to concealed poets\\", which according to his supporters is self-referential.; . Baconians argue that while Bacon outlined both a scientific and moral philosophy in The Advancement of Learning (1605), only the first part was published under his name during his lifetime. They say that his moral philosophy, including a revolutionary politico-philosophic system of government, was concealed in the Shakespeare plays because of its threat to the monarchy.. Baconians suggest that the great number of legal allusions in the Shakespeare canon demonstrate the author's expertise in the law. Bacon became Queen's Counsel in 1596 and was appointed Attorney General in 1613. Bacon also paid for and helped write speeches for a number of entertainments, including masques and dumbshows, although he is not known to have authored a play. His only attributed verse consists of seven metrical psalters, following Sternhold and Hopkins.. Since Bacon was knowledgeable about ciphers,. early Baconians suspected that he left his signature encrypted in the Shakespeare canon. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries many Baconians claimed to have discovered ciphers throughout the works supporting Bacon as the true author. In 1881, C. F. Ashmead Windle, an American, claimed she had found carefully worked-out jingles in each play that identified Bacon as the author.. This sparked a cipher craze, and probative cryptograms were identified in the works by Ignatius Donnelly,. Orville Ward Owen, Elizabeth Wells Gallup,. and Dr. Isaac Hull Platt. Platt argued that the Latin word honorificabilitudinitatibus, found in Love's Labour's Lost, can be read as an anagram, yielding Hi ludi F. Baconis nati tuiti orbi (\\"These plays, the offspring of F. Bacon, are preserved for the world.\\").. Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (1550‚Äì1604) Since the early 1920s, the leading alternative authorship candidate has been Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford and Lord Great Chamberlain of England. Oxford followed his grandfather and father in sponsoring companies of actors, and he had patronised a company of musicians and one of tumblers.. Oxford was an important courtier poet,. praised as such and as a playwright by George Puttenham and Francis Meres, who included him in a list of the \\"best for comedy amongst us\\". Examples of his poetry but none of his theatrical works survive.. Oxford was noted for his literary and theatrical patronage. Between 1564 and 1599, 33 works were dedicated to him, including works by Arthur Golding, John Lyly, Robert Greene and Anthony Munday.. In 1583 he bought the sublease of the first Blackfriars Theatre and gave it to the poet-playwright Lyly, who operated it for a season under Oxford's patronage.. Oxfordians believe certain literary allusions indicate that Oxford was one of the most prominent \\"suppressed\\" anonymous and/or pseudonymous writers of the day.Austin, Al, and Judy Woodruff. The Shakespeare Mystery. PBS, Frontline, 1989. They also note Oxford's connections to the London theatre and the contemporary playwrights of Shakespeare's day, his family connections including the patrons of Shakespeare's First Folio, his relationships with Queen Elizabeth I and Shakespeare's patron, the Earl of Southampton, his knowledge of Court life, his private tutors and education, and his wide- ranging travels through the locations of Shakespeare's plays in France and Italy.. The case for Oxford's authorship is also based on perceived similarities between Oxford's biography and events in Shakespeare's plays, sonnets and longer poems; perceived parallels of language, idiom, and thought between Oxford's letters and the Shakespearean canon; and the discovery of numerous marked passages in Oxford's Bible that appear in some form in Shakespeare's plays.. The first to lay out a comprehensive case for Oxford's authorship was J. Thomas Looney, an English schoolteacher who identified personality characteristics in Shakespeare's works‚Äîespecially Hamlet‚Äîthat painted the author as an eccentric aristocratic poet, a drama and sporting enthusiast with a classical education who had travelled extensively to Italy.. He discerned close affinities between the poetry of Oxford and that of Shakespeare in the use of motifs and subjects, phrasing, and rhetorical devices, which led him to identify Oxford as the author. After his Shakespeare Identified was published in 1920, Oxford replaced Bacon as the most popular alternative candidate.; ; . Oxford's purported use of the \\"Shakespeare\\" pen name is attributed to the stigma of print, a convention that aristocratic authors could not take credit for writing plays for the public stage.. Another motivation given is the politically explosive \\"Prince Tudor theory\\" that the youthful Oxford was Queen Elizabeth's lover; according to this theory, Oxford dedicated Venus and Adonis, The Rape of Lucrece, and the Sonnets to their son, England's rightful Tudor Prince, Henry Wriothesley, who was brought up as the 3rd Earl of Southampton. Oxfordians say that the dedication to the sonnets published in 1609 implies that the author was dead prior to their publication and that 1604 (the year of Oxford's death) was the year regular publication of \\"newly corrected\\" and \\"augmented\\" Shakespeare plays stopped.. Consequently, they date most of the plays earlier than the standard chronology and say that the plays which show evidence of revision and collaboration were left unfinished by Oxford and completed by other playwrights after his death.; . Christopher Marlowe Portrait possibly of Christopher Marlowe (1564‚Äì1593) The poet and dramatist Christopher Marlowe was born into the same social class as Shakespeare‚Äîhis father was a cobbler, Shakespeare's a glove-maker. Marlowe was the older by two months, and spent six and a half years at Cambridge University. He pioneered the use of blank verse in Elizabethan drama, and his works are widely accepted as having greatly influenced those of Shakespeare. Of his seven plays, all but one or two were first performed before 1593. The Marlovian theory argues that Marlowe's documented death on 30 May 1593 was faked. Thomas Walsingham and others are supposed to have arranged the faked death, the main purpose of which was to allow Marlowe to escape trial and almost certain execution on charges of subversive atheism.. The theory then argues that Shakespeare was chosen as the front behind whom Marlowe would continue writing his highly successful plays.. These claims are founded on inferences derived from the circumstances of his apparent death, stylistic similarities between the works of Marlowe and Shakespeare, and hidden meanings found in the works and associated texts. Marlovians note that, despite Marlowe and Shakespeare being almost exactly the same age, the first work linked to the name William Shakespeare‚ÄîVenus and Adonis‚Äîwas on sale, with Shakespeare's name signed to the dedication, 13 days after Marlowe's reported death,. having been registered with the Stationers' Company on 18 April 1593 with no named author.. Lists of verbal correspondences between Marlowe's and Shakespeare's work have also been compiled.. Marlowe's candidacy was initially suggested in 1892 by T. W. White, who argued that Marlowe was one of a group of writers responsible for the plays, the others being Shakespeare, Greene, Peele, Daniel, Nashe and Lodge.. He was first proposed as the sole author of Shakespeare's \\"stronger plays\\" in 1895 by Wilbur G. Zeigler.. His candidacy was revived by Calvin Hoffman in 1955 and, according to Shapiro, a recent surge in interest in the Marlowe case \\"may be a sign that the dominance of the Oxfordian camp may not extend much longer than the Baconian one\\".. William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby (1561‚Äì1642) William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, was first proposed as a candidate in 1891 by James Greenstreet, a British archivist, and later supported by Abel Lefranc and others.. Greenstreet discovered that a Jesuit spy, George Fenner, reported in 1599 that Derby \\"is busye in penning commodyes for the common players\\".; . That same year Derby was recorded as financing one of London's two children's drama companies, Paul's Boys; he also had his own company, Derby's Men, which played multiple times at court in 1600 and 1601.. Derby was born three years before Shakespeare and died in 1642, so his lifespan fits the consensus dating of the works. His initials were W. S., and he was known to sign himself \\"Will\\", which qualified him to write the punning \\"Will\\" sonnets.. Derby travelled in continental Europe in 1582, visiting France and possibly Navarre. Love's Labour's Lost is set in Navarre and the play may be based on events that happened there between 1578 and 1584.; ; . Derby married Elizabeth de Vere, whose maternal grandfather was William Cecil,. thought by some critics to be the basis of the character of Polonius in Hamlet. Derby was associated with William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, and his brother Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery and later 4th Earl of Pembroke, the \\"Incomparable Pair\\" to whom William Shakespeare's First Folio is dedicated.. When Derby released his estates to his son James around 1628‚Äì29, he named Pembroke and Montgomery as trustees. Derby's older brother, Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby, formed a group of players, the Lord Strange's Men, some of whose members eventually joined the King's Men, one of the companies most associated with Shakespeare..

He has also used the pen name Jean-Louis Lagor. During the German occupation of France, Madiran was the private secretary of Charles Maurras and was awarded the Order of the Francisque, the decoration, in the form of a stylised double-headed francisca, that was granted by Vichy France. He contributed to the newspaper Action Fran√ßaise. This was the organ of the movement of the same name and was published from 21 March 1908 to 24 August 1944.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Action Fran√ßaise After the Second World War, he retired to Madiran in southwestern France (whence his pen name) and became noted as a journalist and essayist. In 1948, he published his first book, La Philosophie politique de saint Thomas (The Political Philosophy of Saint Thomas), under the pen name Jean-Louis Lagor and with a preface by Maurras. In 1956, Madiran and Louis Salleron co-founded Itin√©raires, a review of Catholic themes which later became a leading organ for criticism of the reforms within the Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council of 1962‚Äì65. Itin√©raires originally appeared monthly, but after the 1988 Ec√¥ne Consecrations became quarterly. Madiran remained its editor until publication ceased in 1996. He was also one of the founders in 1982, of the daily newspaper Pr√©sent, of which he was editor in chief. This publication is associated with the Front National, but refused to take sides in the conflict between Jean-Marie Le Pen and Bruno M√©gret, whereupon Le Pen called for it to be boycotted. In an article published in Itin√©raires, Madiran declared:Mais si l‚Äôon nous demande de \\"nous situer\\", c‚Äôest-√†-dire de d√©clarer nous-m√™mes ce que nous sommes et o√π nous sommes, alors il faut entendre la r√©ponse qui est la n√¥tre.

(Jean Madiran, ¬´ Notre politique ¬ª, Itin√©raires, n¬∞256, septembre-octobre 1981) :If we are asked to state what we are and what our position is, our answer must be understood. Our answer modifies Fran√ßois Brigneau's formula or rather completes and develops it in its full truth: \\"We are to the right of the far right.\\" This does not mean that we despise indiscriminately everybody and everything that official jargon calls \\"the far right\\".

The plot is about an obese dhampir superhero, set in German-occupied Europe. The entire film is a scene-for-scene spoof of BloodRayne: The Third Reich (directed by Boll himself the previous year) with most of the same cast and crew. The film received negative reviews. Plot In the year 1940, Blubberella is an obese vampire/human hybrid with a hatred of Adolf Hitler, and a soft spot for food. She has been fighting the forces of evil for centuries when she comes face to face with the dictator who has plunged all of Europe straight into a hellish war. However, in the midst of sending Hitler to meet his maker, she instead accidentally grants him the gift of immortality. Now, Hitler is a supervillain with an army of undead Schutzstaffel (SS) officers to do his evil bidding. Destroying him won't be easy. But if there is one hero fat enough to defeat the fiercest army ever to walk the Earth, it is Blubberella. CastReception The film received negative reviews. In an interview with Popzara's Brittany Vincent, Hollister said she took the role because of diminishing opportunity for large actresses to find work in Hollywood. \\"I've been doing this for ten years. While I've been extremely lucky to play some amazing characters, I‚Äôve watched the roles dry up. And I‚Äôve been shut out of even auditioning for many character roles because I'm too large.\\" On taking on the title role of Blubberella, she states \\"This movie would have been done with or without me. It would have been a lot more offensive if I hadn‚Äôt done it. But I didn‚Äôt win the war about the title. I hate the title.\\" In an interview with Entertainment Weekly Hollister discussed the film and insisted her decision to take the role wasn‚Äôt based on money alone: \\"I'm not ashamed of Blubberella... Of course there's fat jokes in the film. If they had put another salami sandwich in my hand, I was going to start killing the crew. But I want people to know we weren't setting out to hate fat people. It's important for me that people know the true story.\\" She went on to say, \\"This movie was made with the best intentions. I truly wanted to make a movie about a fat girl who could kick ass.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * * * * Blubberella review Category:2011 films Category:2011 action comedy films Category:2011 comedy horror films Category:2010s adventure comedy films Category:2011 independent films Category:Blackface minstrel shows and films Category:Eastern Front of World War II films Category:Fictional half-vampires Category:Films about Adolf Hitler Category:Films about Nazi Germany Category:Films directed by Uwe Boll Category:Films set in 1940 Category:Films set in Europe Category:Films shot in Croatia Category:German action comedy films Category:German film remakes Category:German films Category:German independent films Category:2010s parody films Category:Supernatural thriller films Category:Vampire comedy films Category:War adventure films Category:Female characters in film Category:Fictional vampire hunters Category:2010s supernatural horror films Category:Nazi zombie films Category:German parody films ","title":"Blubberella"},{"id":"31635761","text":"The Avogadori de Com√πn, literally \\"public prosecutors\\", were an institution of the Republic of Venice.

Finally, in 1913 the railway construction was completed and the train service from the Probstzella station to Sonnenberg via Lichte-Ost and Lichte (Th√ºringen) could be opened. The railway Sonneberg-Probstzelle survived two World Wars and the GDR period. However, on January 22, 1997 the traffic was ceased, and on July 2006 the final closure of that particular railway section Ernstthal Gr√§fenthal was agreed by the Eisenbahnbundesamt.

Diana wore an ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown, with a 25-foot (7.62 m) train and a 153-yard tulle veil, valued at ¬£151,000 (). It became one of the most famous dresses in the world, and was considered one of the most closely guarded secrets in fashion history. Design The dress was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, who described it as a dress that \\"had to be something that was going to go down in history, but also something that Diana loved\\", and which would be \\"suitably dramatic in order to make an impression\\". Diana Spencer personally selected the designers to make her wedding dress because she was fond of a chiffon blouse they designed for her formal photo session with Lord Snowdon. The woven silk taffeta was made by Stephen Walters of Suffolk. The Emanuels consulted Maureen Baker, who had made the wedding dress of Princess Anne, during their construction of the gown. One observer wrote \\"the dress was a crinoline, a symbol of sexuality and grandiosity, a meringue embroidered with pearls and sequins, its bodice frilled with lace\\". The gown was decorated with hand embroidery, sequins, and 10,000 pearls, centering on a heart motif. An 18-karat gold horseshoe was stitched into the petticoats as a sign of good fortune. The lace used to trim it was antique hand-made Carrickmacross lace which had belonged to Queen Mary. In contrast, the wedding dress of Catherine Middleton, for her marriage to Prince William, Diana's eldest son, incorporated motifs cut from machine-made lace appliqu√©d to silk net. The dress featured \\"lace flounces adorning neckline and sleeves\\". Fittings of the dress posed difficulties because Diana had developed bulimia and dropped from a size 14 to a size 10 in the months leading up to the wedding. Even the seamstress was concerned about her weight loss and feared the dress might not fit as it should. The twenty-five-foot train posed problems. According to writer Andrew Morton, in Diana: Her True Story, the gown's designers realized too late that they had forgotten to allow for the train's length in relation to the size of the glass coach Diana and her father rode in to the ceremony. They found it difficult to fit inside the glass coach, and the train was badly crushed despite Diana's efforts. This accounted for the visible wrinkles in the wedding gown when she arrived at the cathedral. Diana also had a spare wedding dress, which would have acted as a stand-in if the dress' design was revealed before her big day. Reception and influence The dress set wedding fashion trends after the wedding. Large puffed sleeves, a full skirt and \\"soft touch fabrics\\" became popular requests. Copies by other dressmakers were available \\"within hours\\" of the 1981 wedding. Many bridal experts considered the dress a \\"gold standard\\" in wedding fashion in the years after the wedding. Continued appreciation for the dress was not universal. One 2004 bridal magazine listed it as \\"too much dress, too little princess.\\" Nevertheless, Elizabeth Emanuel noted in 2011 that she still received requests for replicas of Diana's dress. In his 2003 memoir, A Royal Duty, Paul Burrell wrote that Diana had wanted the dress to be part of the fashion collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The dress toured for many years with the exhibition \\"Diana: A Celebration\\", though generally it stayed for only part of the exhibit. Althorp House, Northampton was the prime display location for the dress. Diana's dress transferred ownership from her brother to her sons in 2014 because she had requested that her belongings be handed back to them when they both turned 30. Her engagement ring was given to Prince William, while the wedding dress was given to Prince Harry. In 2018, the dress was chosen as one of the \\"Most Influential British Royal Wedding Dresses of All Time\\" by Time magazine.

The municipality, similar to other medieval municipalities, was based on the popular power of the assembly, called Concio in Venice. It represented the patriciate of the city with a system of assemblies including the Great Council, Minor Council, Senate and the Council of Forty.  Overview  Unlike other Italian cities, Venice retained some vestiges of their previous institution of the monarchy embodied by the Doge for setting bounds for power that such assemblies were developing. The leading groups of most the towns gathered at the time around the core of the ancient patrician families, creating a new merchant aristocracy with the Serrata del Maggior Consiglio of 1297 and actually took over the power and ousting the popular assembly. In the name of the Commune, it continued to operate the highest representative body of the state's sovereignty ‚Äì including the Doge, the Minor Council and heads of the Forty ‚Äì until 1423. At this time, the abolition of the Concione ended the last residue of municipal institutions and the supreme body took the name of Serenissima Signoria.

It stars Jayam Ravi and Trisha in the lead roles, while Prakash Raj and Nathan Jones play pivotal roles as antagonists. The film, which began during 2011, had been in its post- production stage for a long period and got released on 24 December 2015, after a huge delay. It got mixed to positive reviews from audience and become an average grosser Plot There are two rival factions of boxing in North Madras: Irumbu Manithar Rasamanickam and Nattu Marunthu Vaathiyar. The IMR boxer Mariappan's son is Arumugam, and the NMV boxer Munusamy's son is Bhooloham. Now, in the present, the IMR boxer is Arumugam (I. S. Rajesh), while the NMV boxer is Bhooloham (Jayam Ravi). Bhooloham has a severe grudge against Arumugam because Mariappan had defeated Munusamy in a boxing match. Unable to bear this loss, Munusamy commits suicide. Bhooloham wants to avenge his father's death by killing Arumugam in the match. This rivalry is being used by Deepak Shah (Prakash Raj), a shrewd TV CEO for making money through his FSC (Future Sports Channel) Independent Boxing Cup. Deepak exploits the boxers' innocence and makes them fight to gain TRPs. In the inaugural Match of IBC, Bhooloham hits Arumugam to the extent that he goes into a coma. Bhooloham later realizes his mistake and becomes a Saamiyar (saintly person). He gets a job in Sindhu's (Trisha Krishnan) (his love interest) college as a waiter. Meanwhile, Deepak, who is hell bent on fixing Bhooloham's match with Destroyer Gurudayal (Arpit Ranka), hatches a conspiracy. Bhooloham, who desperately needs money to fund Arumugam's operation, falls prey to Deepak's plan. As Bhooloham hits Dayal after the match is over, he loses the match. Unable to bear Bhooloham's loss, his coach Rathinam Master (Ponvannan) commits suicide. Meanwhile, Deepak plans to bring Steven George (Nathan Jones) to kill Dayal as to increase TRPs of the channel. When Dayal tries to leave the tournament, Deepak threatens him that he will kill his family. Under pressure, Dayal lodges a complaint against Deepak in the Boxing Union. There, Bhooloham declares that he will fight against Steven, not to show his supremacy, but to expose Deepak's wrongdoings. He reveals that Rathinam was being pressured by Deepak for entering into the ring against Dayal, and when Bhooloham gets defeated, Deepak deceives him. The Union supports Bhooloham, and they make a plan that Steven will declare that he will fight against Bhooloham. The plan succeeds, and Deepak, though reluctant, has to go to the Union Office for signing Bhooloham for the fight. The agreement which Deepak poses against Bhooloham is partially rejected by Bhooloham, and Bhooloham poses a counter- agreement against Deepak. Deepak, though reluctant, is forced to sign on the agreement created by Bhooloham and the Boxing Union. After signing the agreement, Deepak tells Steven that he will give Steven his lifetime earnings in a single match if he kills Bhooloham using a foul punch. Steven agrees to this condition and practices hard for the match. The match happens, and surprisingly to Deepak's shock, Bhooloham wins the match as he does not stop the match when Steven hits the foul punch. After the match, Bhooloham exposes Deepak's wrongdoings. As a result, the Future Sports Channel is sealed for lifetime, and Deepak is jailed for his malpractices.

During the making of the Peranmai (2009), an assistant director to S P Jananathan, Kalyanakrishnan, had narrated the story of the film and Jayam Ravi agreed to give priority dates for the film. However delays in production of the former two films resulted in the postponement of the shoot of Bhooloham, as his character in Aadhi Bhagavan required him to sport a beard, stopping him from working on the films simultaneously. In July 2011, it was reported that Jayam Ravi underwent a special training course in boxing for his role as a boxer with professional athlete, Prasad, overseeing his progress. Amala Paul was approached by the producers in March 2012 to play the leading female role, but could not allot dates for the film. Subsequently, the team approached Nayantara to play the lead role but her unavailability saw the team agree terms with Trisha to play a role in the film. The film is inspired from the life of a real life Asian boxing champion named Madhan. The makers roped in the Australian actor of Troy fame, Nathan Jones, for a fight sequence. The film primarily shot in late 2012 and early 2013 and the makers worked towards a release date during the summer of 2013, but the film experienced further delays.http://www.sify.com/movies/jayam-ravis-action- packed-bhooloham-news-tamil-nbdl9Djhbifsi.html Producer Aascar Ravichandran was unhappy about the film having more than half an hour dedicated to boxing scenes and put the film on hold, in order to edit the film's content. In early 2015, the Indian Overseas Bank's Sriram Nagar branch filed a petition in The Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), Chennai and requested to an interim stay on the film after Aascar Ravichandran failed to repay the loan amount he bought for the production expense of Bhooloham.http://www.sify.com/movies/interim-ban-on- aascar-ravichandran-s-boologam-news-tamil-peomileieccfe.html Soundtrack Music was composed by Srikanth Deva, uniting with Jayam Ravi for the second time after M Kumaran S/O Mahalakshmi. *\\"Bhoologam Adicha\\" - Aslam Mustafa, Sree Tamizh *\\"Ivan Chennai\\" - Haricharan *\\"Maasana Kollaiyila\\" - Mukesh *\\"Tattoo Tattoo\\" - Vaishali, Chinmayi, Abhay Jodhpurkar *\\"Vaangi Vantha\\" - Fefsi Doss *\\"Vanakkam Vanakkam\\" - Naveen Madhav Release The satellite rights of the film were sold to Jaya TV.

She specialized in the lyric soprano repertoire and was particularly known for her portrayals of Puccini heroines. Singing career Born in Modena, Galli began studying singing in her youth. In 1952, at the age of 17, she won the international singing competition in Spoleto. Later that year, she made her professional opera debut at the Teatro Comunale Modena. Her career progressed rapidly, and she was soon heard in major opera houses internationally. She became particularly associated with the operas of Giacomo Puccini, with her signature roles being Mim√¨ in La Boh√®me, Minnie in La fanciulla del West, and the title roles in Manon Lescaut and Tosca. She made her United States debut in 1958 at the New York City Opera as Mim√¨. In 1961 Galli created the role of Catherine in the world premiere of Renzo Rossellini's Uno sguardo dal ponte, which was based on Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge, at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma. She returned to that theatre in April 1962 to perform the role of Thamar in the premiere of Franco Mannino's La stirpe di Davide. The following June she sang the role of the False Angel in the world premiere of Manuel De Falla's oratorio Atl√†ntida which was presented in a staged production at La Scala in Milan. Other roles which she created in world premieres were Nicole in Mannino's Il diavolo in giardino (1963, Teatro Massimo) and Slam in Giacomo Manzoni's Atomtod (1965, La Scala). In her native country, Galli also performed frequently in Italian language operettas. In 1961 she starred in the film adaptation of Carlo Lombardo and Virgilio Ranzato's operetta Il paese dei campanelli which was directed by Vito Molinari. She also made several appearances on Italian television during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. She notably performed the role of Lisa in Mario Lanfranchi's 1956 television film of Vincenzo Bellini's La Sonnambula with Anna Moffo as Amina. On disc she recorded the role of Vivetta in Francesco Cilea's L'arlesiana with fellow singers Ferruccio Tagliavini, Pia Tassinari, and Paolo Silveri in 1957. Later life and career Galli was forced into retirement in 1975 at age 40 after suffering vocal problems which at that time were not fixable by surgery on the vocal cords. However, her association with the opera world continued through a second successful career as a manager of singers in Italy. She managed, among others, Giuseppe Filianoti and Salvatore Licitra. Death Galli lived the last several years of her life in Monte Carlo, Monaco, where she died in 2010, aged 75.

Buhrich's practice, of 40 years, covered commercial and domestic projects. His projects were generally designed in a modernist style and often contained specific interior designs along with the buildings. His most notable and recognized project was the construction of his personal home which is described by Peter Myers as \\"the finest modern house in Australia\\". Personal life In his earlier years Buhrich would have pursued medicine instead of architecture, however, it required Latin. Heavily influence by the Bauhaus style, Hugh wanted to enrol in a university located close to home, however his scholarship would have been rendered invalid as he was required to leave. As a result, he attended an architecture school in Munich, until he was ejected by the Nazis in retaliation for student political activity. Shortly afterward Buhrich decided to move to Berlin where he practiced under Hans Poelzig, an architect, painter and set designer. During this time he met his future wife, Eva Buhrich, who was a fellow student. Buhrich eventually moved to Z√ºrich where he finally finished his degree in the German Free state of Danzig, which is now Gda≈Ñsk. Hugh's wife Eva fled Germany to the Netherlands, however, he could not practice architecture there and was forced to go to London by himself. Hugh and Eva ultimately decided to settle in Australia after debating between emigrating to America, which was too competitive, or to South Africa which required a landing fee and was too expensive. Work life After arriving in Australia, Professor A. S. Hook from the University of Sydney helped Hugh and Eva secure a (shared) architectural job in Canberra. When war broke out, the Buhrichs were dismissed from the job following the return of the original employees. During this time Hugh joined the army and only resumed his practice upon return. Remaining unregistered in New South Wales until 16 November 1971,Architects' Roll of NSW 1969-1972 Hugh restricted himself mainly to furniture and interiors. However, from the 1960s to 1970s, roughly twenty buildings were designed and constructed by Hugh. Unfortunately the vast majority of his work has been demolished but his own house, largely self-built between 1968 and 1972, still stands today and is perhaps the most accomplished of his works. Notable projects Buhrich House II was designed and built between 1968 and 1972. It is located at 375 Edinburgh Road, Castlecrag, and is a reinterpretation of a European modernist aesthetic. The structure stands atop a sandstone ledge overlooking middle harbour and was inhabited by Buhrich for over thirty years. The house was designed and built to accommodate the surrounding landscape and is therefore built at one level. It is meant to give a sense of \\"going downhill\\" towards the waterfront. This was accomplished by sloping the ceiling to the legal minimum height facing the water's edge. Almost every part of this highly inventive building was made for a specific purpose with repetitive simple parts and off-the-shelf materials. The house stands out from many other styles during the time period due to the angularity of the plan and the casual regular and irregular geometries. Described by French critic Fran√ßoise Fromonot as \\"a truly radical building\\" and by Peter Myers as \\"the finest modern house in Australia\\", the Buhrich house provides extraordinary beauty into Hugh's most intensely personal project. The house is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register as of State significance for its historic and aesthetic values, as well as of particular cultural/social importance amongst the architectural community. Point Piper House in Point Piper, New South Wales, was designed by Buhrich and completed in 1961. It was extensively renovated in 2005 by Louise Nettleton Architects with the object of keeping Buhrich's original design elements intact. The renovation was given a Commendation Award by the NSW Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects in 2005.

Life = Family  Sidonie was the daughter of the Duke Henry IV of Saxony (1473‚Äì1541) from his marriage to Catherine (1487‚Äì1561), daughter of the Duke Magnus II of Mecklenburg. Her brothers were Elector Maurice of Saxony and August; her sister Sibylle was from 1540 by marriage Duchess of Saxe-Lauenburg; her sister Aemilia was from 1533 by marriage Margravine of Brandenburg-Ansbach.  Marriage  Sidonie married on 17 May 1545 Duke Eric II of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (1528‚Äì1584), who was ten years her junior. The wedding ceremony was held in Hann. M√ºnden without the usual pomp and circumstance. Initially, they liked each other. Eric had been engaged to Agnes of Hesse. When the marriage was negotiated at the court in Kassel, however, he had met Sidonie. He liked her, and broke off the engagement with Agnes, in order to marry Sidonie. Landgrave Philip I of Hesse predicted: \\"All sorts of things will happen inside this marriage after the kissing month ends.\\"Christoph von Rommel: Geschichte von Hessen, vol. 4, p. 200 Two years into the marriage, in 1547, Duke Eric began his rule and reconverted to the Catholic faith, after the Reformation had been introduced to his Duchy in 1542. Despite her husband's pleas, Sidonie held on to her Lutheran faith. They had financial problems and the marriage remained childless, and soon their relationship took a very unfortunate course. The clashes culminated in her suspicion that her husband wanted to poison her. A Genoese merchant had contacted Sidonie's brother Augustus in 1555 and informed him that Duke Eric I had ordered poison from him on the grounds that \\"Eric was a Christian and his wife would be Lutheran, it was better that one woman part was destroyed, than 20,000 people.\\"Karl von Weber, Sidonie, Herzogin von Braunschweig, geb. Herzogin von Sachsen. ‚Ä† 1575. In: Aus vier Jahrhunderten: Mittheilungen aus dem Haupt-Staatsarchive zu Dresden, Leipzig, 1858, vol. 2, p. 45 Eric turned to a mistress with whom he lived at Calenberg Castle from 1563. Sidonie was refused access to the castle, which was also based on the grounds that she had threatened \\"if she comes into my house, I'll cut the whore's nose off and poke out an eye.\\"Karl von Weber Sidonie, Herzogin von Braunschweig, geb. Herzogin von Sachsen. ‚Ä† 1575. In: Aus vier Jahrhunderten: Mittheilungen aus dem Haupt-Staatsarchive zu Dresden, Leipzig, 1858, vol. 2, p. 46  Charges of witchcraft  Sidonie was from 1564 onwards virtually under house arrest and she protested vigorously to her brother and to the Emperor, who sent councils who tried unsuccessfully to compromise with Duke Eric. In 1564 Eric fell very ill and suspected he was poisoned. Four women suspected of witchcraft were burned as witches in Neustadt am R√ºbenberge. In 1570 mediation by the Emperor, the Elector of Saxony and Duke Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel resulted in a settlement of the disputes between Sidonie and her husband, in which Sidonie would receive Calenberg Castle. Eric, however, did not abide by the settlement. On 30 March 1572, Duke Eric assembled some of his advisers, nobles and deputies of the cities of Hannover and Hameln on Landestrost Castle in Neustadt. He accused Sidonie of witchcraft and of an attempt on his life. He presented evidence obtained by torture from the four women he had executed for witchcraft. Sidonie turned to Emperor Maximilian II and asked for a revision. She secretly left Kalenberg and traveled to Vienna. Emperor Maximilian then decreed that the investigation should be carried out at the imperial court. However, he then turned the case over to the Dukes Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel and William the Younger of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. On 17 December 1573 the case was presented in Halberstadt to the court and a large audience. All witnesses recanted their testimony against Sidonie and on 1 January 1574, the Duchess was acquitted of all charges.  Wei√üenfels Monastery  From Vienna, Sidonie traveled in October 1572 to Dresden to her brother and his wife. Instead of Calenberg castle and the silver Duke Eric had withheld from her, she received, after several settlements, compensation and a pension for life. Elector Augustus gave her the Poor Clares monastery at Wei√üenfels with all income and interest. Sidonie lived there until she died in 1575. Due to Sidonie's resistance, Duke Julius of Brunswick did not succeed in amicably resolving Eric's accusation against Sidonie. In 1573, Sidonie wrote to duke Julius: Duke Eric's difficult because he spewed out accusations, taking, as we speak, not the clothes, but the honor, which is the highest and most precious treasure a poor woman in this world possesses.Karl vom Weber: Aus vier Jahrhunderten: Mittheilungen aus dem Haupt-Staatsarchive zu ‚Ä¶, vol. 2, p. 63 According to her will Sidonie was buried in Freiberg Cathedral. She left significant sums of money to her negotiators in the Halberstadt trial.  Ancestors  Footnotes  References  * Helga-Maria K√ºhn: ‚Äû‚Ä¶ es gefellett mir reychtt woll hyr‚Äú.

Given the rationing of clothing at the time, she still had to purchase the material using ration coupons. The dress was designed by Norman Hartnell. Hartnell's signature was said to be embroidery, and he enjoyed \\"working with soft, floating fabrics, particularly tulle and chiffon, and with plain, lustrous silks\\". The dress was made of Chinese silk, with a high neckline, tailored bodice and a short train. The dress, without straps and with long sleeves, provided a \\"fit and flare silhouette\\".  Design  The wedding was a royal event held following the end of the Second World War. The dress, designed by the Court Designer Norman Hartnell, had a star- patterned fan-shaped bridal train that was in length. The train, symbolic of rebirth and growth after the war, was stated to be inspired by Botticelli's c. 1482 painting of Primavera, particularly the elaborate embroidery motifs of scattered flowers on the rich satin dress and the tulle veil worn by the royal bride. The material used was ivory silk and a diamond fringe tiara secured her veil. The dress was decorated with crystals and 10,000 seed pearls, imported from the United States of America. Hartnell, who had been Court Designer since 1938, claimed it as \\"the most beautiful dress I had so far made\\". On account of the austerity measures following the war, Princess Elizabeth had to use clothing ration coupons to show her entitlement to the dress. The government allowed her 200 extra ration coupons. She was given hundreds of clothing coupons by brides-to-be from all parts of the country to help her acquire the dress. She had to return these coupons as it was illegal for them to have been given away in the first instance. The designs for the dress were approved three months before the wedding. Hartnell's search for suitable designs in London art galleries had led to him to the Botticelli figure. This was the inspiration for the use of ivory silk with flower designs of jasmine, smilax, lilac and white rose-like blossoms added to the train, embellished by white crystals and pearls. These motifs were transferred to drawings to enable embroidery experts to work on them. The dress featured a \\"heart-shaped neckline and long tight sleeves\\". The silk cloth was chosen at the specific directive of her mother, the Queen, who desired an \\"unusually rich, lustrous stiff satin which was made at Lullingstone Castle\\". The silkworms to manufacture the silk were bought from Nationalist China and not from Japan and Italy, which were the UK's enemies during the war. Satin was chosen for the train, and a more flexible material of the same tone as the train was chosen for the dress. However, in spite of the careful choice of the silk, the curator of the London Museum observed 30 years later when the dress was on display at the museum that \\"the choice of silk was not a good one\\" as the fabric had deteriorated. It was also noted that the \\"weight of the embroidery dragged the skirt down, increasing the strain on the weave.\\" Round the hem of the dress, \\"a border of orange blossom was appliqued with transparent tulle outlined in seed pearls and crystal\\". The final design of the dress was kept secret, although much speculation surrounded it. It was said the princess feared that if details were published fashion house copies would make it impossible for her to make last-minute design alterations. The dress was taken to the palace a day before the wedding in a box. On the wedding day, the dress glittered, bejewelled with pearls \\"skilfully combined with flowing lines of wheat ears, the symbol of fertility, and worked in pearl and diamante.\\" Similarities Princess Elizabeth's wedding dress has drawn parallels with both the similarly designed dress worn by Grace Kelly in 1956 and the \\"Westminster d√©cor\\" wedding dress that Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen designed for Catherine Middleton; particular points of similarity have been highlighted in the pleats and silhouette of the skirt. The dress was put on display at St James's Palace and was then exhibited in the major cities and towns of the UK.

The battalion was formed in the Middle East and was assigned to the 4th Parachute Brigade, 1st Airborne Division. As it was still training it was left behind when the rest of the brigade took part in the invasion of Italy. One company later parachuted onto the island of Kos taking prisoner the large Italian garrison. The battalion rejoined the rest of the division in England. The only battle in which the battalion participated was the Battle of Arnhem in September 1944. The battalion sustained very heavy casualties and was disbanded following the battle and the men were used as replacements elsewhere. After the Second World War a reserve 11th Battalion was formed by the Territorial Army in 1947, but it was disbanded nine years later. Formation Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, during the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p.21 On 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando was turned over to parachute duties and on 21 November, re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing, and later became the 1st Parachute Battalion.Shortt & McBride, p.4Moreman, p.91 It was these men who took part in the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, on 10 February 1941.Guard, p.218 The success of the raid prompted the War Office to expand the existing airborne force, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942, and creating the Parachute Regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions into airborne battalions in August 1942.Harclerode, p. 218 The 11th Parachute Battalion was raised in Kibrit Egypt in March 1943.

It comprised three platoons: Mortar Platoon with eight mortars, Machine Gun Platoon with four Vickers machine guns and an Anti-tank Platoon with ten PIAT anti-tank projectors.Guard, p.37 The only combat seen by the battalion in the Mediterranean, was in September 1943. 'A' Company and the mortar and machine gun platoons parachuted onto the island of Kos in the Dodecanese and captured the airfield. The Italian garrison numbered around 4,000 men did not put up any resistance. The company was withdrawn soon after and rejoined the battalion. In December 1943 the battalion rejoined the 4th Parachute Brigade who by this time were in England. Arnhem When the battalion landed outside Arnhem on 18 September they were detached from the brigade and sent to reinforce the 1st Parachute Battalion and the glider-borne infantry of 2nd South Staffords, trying to fight through to the 2nd Parachute Battalion which had captured the northern end of the Arnhem road bridge.Peters, p.154 The two battalions were located in the town about short of the bridge. They were just about to start another attempt to break through to the 2nd Parachute Battalion. With no appreciation of the ground the 11th Battalion was held in reserve playing no part in the attack.Peters, p.164 Under heavy fire the attempt stalled and to relieve the pressure on the assaulting troops, the 11th Battalion was asked to carry out a left flanking attack on the German positions. Orders were being issued for the assault, when the divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart personally intervened, forbidding the battalion to take part in what he now considered a futile attack. The 2nd South Staffords had been decimated with only their 'C' Company surviving as a unit. The 1st Parachute Battalion were in an even worse state and only numbered about 40 men.Peters, p.165 The battalion was gradually worn down withdrawing through the city and casualties mounted. A move to gain some high ground to the north was discovered and the battalion was caught in the open and decimated, with only around 150 men left. One of the casualties being the commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel George Lea.Badsey, p.56 The second in command Major Richard Lonsdale now took command of the battalion and the remnants of the 1st, 3rd Parachute and 2nd South Staffords battalions. Forming them into an ad-hoc force which became known as Lonsdale Force.Peters, p.204 209 They were withdrawn to Oosterbeek where the division was forming a defensive perimeter, digging in on the south eastern side with their right flank on the river.Peters, p.204 Lonsdale addressed the men before the Germans arrived; The defenders were involved in a number of desperate actions, and hand-to-hand fighting keeping the Germans out of the divisions perimeter.Peters, p.209 One of the men Lance-Sergeant John Baskeyfield of the South Staffords anti-tank platoon, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.Peters, pp.209‚Äì210 By 21 September pressure from the German attacks had squeezed the perimeter to less than across.Peters, p.222 On 22 September the bulk of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade were dropped south of the river. This drew off some of the Germans from around the divisional perimeter to confront the new threat. The defenders now had to cope with over 100 German artillery guns firing onto their positions.Peters, p.234 On 24 September the decision was made by Lieutenant-General Horrocks commander XXX Corps to withdraw what was left of the division south of the Rhine.Peters, p.265 On the morning of 25 September units of the 9th SS Panzer Division attacked the battalion in force, attempting to cut the division off from the river.Peters, pp.269‚Äì270 The initial attack was stopped by bayonets and hand grenades. Following attacks were driven off by direct fire from the guns of the 1st Airlanding Light Regiment, Royal Artillery and the 64th Medium regiment, XXX Corps dropping their shells on the battalions positions.Peters, p.270 The remnants of the battalion were evacuated over the night of 25/26 September.Peters, pp.279‚Äì283 The casualties sustained by the battalion were never replaced and it was disbanded after the battle of Arnhem and the men sent to the 1st Parachute Brigade. Territorial Army When the Territorial Army was reformed following the war in 1947, a new 11th Battalion was raised. It was formed by the conversion of the 8th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, and had Euston Baker as its honorary colonel. It was part of the reserve 16th Airborne Division. Following defence cuts if reverted to being the 8th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment in August 1956.

History Kevin Brittingham founded Advanced Armament Corporation in 1994 to manufacture sound suppressors, having previously been a distributor for GEMTECH, another suppressor manufacturer. Under Brittingham's direction, AAC grew to be one of the largest suppressor manufacturers in the U.S., including a number of small military contracts. Of note, one of AAC's chief suppressor designers is Robert Silvers, creator of the PhotoMosaic. In 2009, Brittingham sold the company to Remington Arms. Robert Silvers remained at the company as a leader of research and development. In early 2015 AAC moved locations from Lawrenceville, GA to a new, larger, state of the art facility located in Huntsville, AL. In the bankruptcy auction of Remington Outdoor Company in September 2020, the company was sold to JJE Capital Holdings, LLC.  Products  AAC has been responsible for numerous innovations with regard to sound suppressor development, among them interchangeable pistons to allow suppressors to be exchanged among firearms with different barrel thread patterns, fast-attach rifle suppressors, and the use of lightweight alloys such as titanium. The company produces numerous \\"lifestyle\\" products related to AAC and/or the NFA firearms community, including T-shirts, stickers, etc. AAC's suppressor lineup includes models suitable for virtually every firearm caliber between .22 Long Rifle and .50 BMG. Rimfire models include the Aviator2, and Element2. Centerfire pistol caliber suppressors include the Ti-Rant series and Illusion9 the only true eccentric designed suppressor to utilize factory sights as well as allowing the use of rail mounted accessories on the host firearm, both of which use an interchangeable piston system in their Nielsen device. Centerfire rifle suppressors include the M4-2000 (used by numerous military units including the Navy SEALs), 762-SDN-6, SR series as well as the Cyclone (for .30 caliber precision rifles), and others. The company's Titan-QD Fast-Attach suppressor is used on the US Army's M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle and the Remington MSR (Modular Sniper Rifle). The suppressor eliminates 98 percent of muzzle flash, 60 percent of recoil, and reduces sound by 32 decibels.Army's XM2010 sniper rifle gets full fielding - Armytimes.com, April 25, 2011  Rimfire suppressors  * Element 2: The Element is a premium \\"thread-on\\" suppressor for handguns and rifles chambered in .17 HMR, .22 LR, and .22 WMR. * Aviator 2: All aluminum \\"thread-on\\" suppressor for handguns and rifles chambered in .22 LR that is user serviceable.

Muzzle devices  In 2011, AAC was awarded a $14,201,731 contract for the muzzle brakes that they produce known as the \\"Brakeout\\". This contract was procured via the Navy Electronic Commerce and Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division. In 2016 the BlastOut gives users the ability to redirect muzzle blast forward when shooting unsuppressed.  .300 AAC Blackout  The .300 AAC Blackout cartridge was developed by Advanced Armament Corporation in cooperation with Remington Defense, under the direction of Kevin Brittingham. The round is very similar to the .300 Whisper cartridge created years earlier by SSK Industries, but AAC submitted the cartridge for SAAMI standardization and allows any manufacturer to use the specifications. This has led to far wider adoption than the .300 Whisper, which is proprietary to SSK. This round has the same overall length and width as the popular 5.56√ó45mm NATO round, except it fires a 30 caliber bullet allowing for better barrier penetration and external ballistics from short barrels. These dimensions allow the 300 AAC Blackout to be used in existing magazines designed for M16 or AR-15 rifles. Because the rim of the cartridge is identical, the same bolt and carrier can be used for both cartridges. The only part that needs to be changed to convert an existing AR-15 chambered in 5.56√ó45mm to one chambered in 300 BLK is the barrel. Advanced Armament Corporation builds a number of rifles and receivers for this caliber including the MPW and the AAC Honey Badger PDW.

Hence, with the exception of Dr Fong Kim Heng from People's Action Party who resigned his seat on November, 6 other vacant constituencies are caused by the mass resignation from the members of BS legislators that are divided into 3 phases that triggers 3 different by-elections in the year, namely, January, March and November. The final phase of the resignation by BS legislators was made in 1967 January and hence shortly 3 months after the third by election in 1966 November, a 1967 by election was held, which is the last before 1968 general elections. First 1966 By Election (January) The nomination day was set at 8 January 1966 while the polling day was held 10 days later as the result of the resignation of Lim Huan Boon which translates into the vacation of Bukit Merah constituency. Second 1966 By Election (March) Shortly after the first in January, another 3 BS members, namely S. T. Bani, Chio Cheng Thun and Kow Kee Seng have resigned their seats as a part to boycott the parliament. Hence, it further translates into the vacant of Chua Chu Kang, Crawford and Paya Lebar constituency which sets the nomination day on 1 March 1966. However, all 3 constituencies went uncontested and returned to PAP without conducting a poll. Third 1966 By Election (November) BS members Chia Thye Poh and Lee Tee Tong resigned their seats.

Aftermath of 1966 By Election The aftermath of the boycott of the Parliament sparked off mass arrests under the Internal Security Act (ISA), with notable people includes Chia Thye Poh who was detained under this Act for 22 years without any trial which became the world's second-longest incarcerated political prisoner. It is also meant the downturn of the opposition parties in Singapore as since then, Barisan Sosialis had lost all their credibility and never returned to the parliament by an elected Member of Parliament while the People's Action Party had been winning all the parliamentary seats in the General elections and By elections until 15 years later on the famous 1981 Anson By Election.

Background In the early twentieth century, French troops in Algeria faced numerous incidents, attacks and looting by uncontrolled armed groups in the newly controlled areas to the south of Oran.Historique de la bataille d'El Moungar by the French Ministry of Defence Under the command of General Lyautey, the French army's mission was to protect these areas newly occupied in the west of Algeria, near the poorly defined Moroccan boundaries. This loose boundary, between French Algeria and the Sultanate of Morocco, promoted incursions and attacks by Moroccan tribesmen. On 17 August 1903, the first battle of the South-Oranese campaign took place in Taghit when a contingent of the French Foreign Legion was attacked by more than 1,000 well-equipped Berbers. For three days, the legionnaires repelled repeated attacks of an enemy more than 10 times their number, and inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, forcing them finally into retreat. The battle  A few days after the Battle of Taghit, 148 legionnaires of the 22nd mounted company, from the 2e REI, commanded by Captain Vauchez and Lieutenant Selchauhansen, 20 Spahis and two Mokhaznis were escorting a supply convoy, when they were ambushed at 9:30 am on 2 September by 3,000 Moroccans tribesmen. The half-company had halted to eat, no sentries had been posted and only a few cavalry pickets had been placed. The first volleys wounded or killed half of the detachment. Both officers and most of the non-commissioned officers were killed in the first stage of the fight. At 10:30 am, Quartermaster Sergeant (sergent-fourrier) Tisserand, who commanded the survivors, sent two spahi cavalrymen to Taghit for reinforcements. They immediately left. About forty survivors of the French force gathered on a nearby hill and under a scorching sun, on hot sand and without water, fought off the enemy for more than eight hours. Near the end of the battle, Tisserand, wounded, gave over command to Corporal Detz; the highest ranked man still able. At 5 pm, they were relieved by Captain de Sulbielle, who rode from Taghit with his Spahis. At the sight of the approaching French cavalry, the Moroccans retreated in small groups.Jean-Paul Mahuault, L'√©pop√©e marocaine de la L√©gion √©trang√®re, 1903-1934, ou, Trente ann√©es au Maroc, L'Harmattan, 2005. Aftermath Total French losses were 38 dead and 46 wounded. A presidential decree granted to all survivors of the battle the Colonial Medal, and Tisserand was promoted to lieutenant. In spite of the courage shown by the legionnaires, the heavy losses suffered by the half-company and indications that inadequate precautions had led to the initial success of the ambush, caused serious concern. The commander of the Ain Sefra military region was replaced and Brigadier General Hubert Lyautey appointed in his place.

Life He was not born at Creich, Fife, where his ancestors had lived for seven generations. His father was a captain in the royalist forces at the time of the taking of Dundee by George Monck in 1651. Sage was educated at Creich parish school and St Salvator's College, St Andrews, where he graduated M.A. on 24 July 1669. Having been parish schoolmaster at Ballingray, Fife, and then Tippermuir, Perthshire, he entered on trials before Perth presbytery on 17 December 1673, and gained testimonial for license on 3 June 1674. He became tutor and chaplain in the family of James Drummond of Cultmalundie, Perthshire. While residing with his pupils at Perth he made the acquaintance of Alexander Rose, then minister of Perth. He visited Rose at Glasgow in 1684, and was introduced to Rose's uncle, Arthur Ross, then archbishop of Glasgow, who ordained him, and instituted him in 1685 to the charge of the east quarter in Glasgow. He held the clerkship of presbytery and synod. In 1688 Ross, being then primate, nominated him to a divinity chair at St Andrews, but the completion of the appointment was prevented by the abdication of James II. Driven from Glasgow by the Cameronian outbreak, Sage made his way to Edinburgh, and took up his pen in the cause of the extruded clergy. He carried with him nine volumes of the presbytery records, which were only recovered after 103 years according to Hew Scott. In 1693 he was banished from Edinburgh by the privy council for officiating as a nonjuror. He retired to Kinross, and found shelter in the house of Sir William Bruce. But in 1696 Bruce was committed to Edinburgh Castle, and a warrant was issued for the arrest of Sage. He hid himself in Angus, going by the name of Jackson, and giving out that he was come for a course of goat's milk. After a few months he became domestic chaplain, at Falkirk, to Anne, dowager countess of Callendar, and subsequently to Sir John Stewart of Grandtully, Perthshire. On 25 January 1705 Sage was privately consecrated at Edinburgh, along with John Fullarton, as a college bishop (i.e. a bishop without diocese or jurisdiction), as part of the policy of continuing the nonjuring episcopal order, while respecting the right of the crown to nominate to sees. In November 1706 Sage was seized with paralysis while on a visit to Kinross. He recovered sufficiently to take part in a consecration at Dundee on 28 April 1709. He then went to Bath. Moving on to London, he remained there about a year. He died at Edinburgh on 7 June 1711; his intimate correspondent, Henry Dodwell the elder, died on the same day. Sage was buried in the churchyard of Old Greyfriars, Edinburgh. John Gillan in his Life of Sage gives a long Latin inscription intended for his tomb. Works Most of Sage's publications were anonymous, but their authorship was well known; his controversial writings were shrewd. He published: * ‚ÄòLetters concerning the Persecution of the Episcopal Clergy in Scotland,‚Äô 1689, (anon.); Sage wrote the second and third letters, the first was by Thomas Morer, the fourth by Alexander Monro. * ‚ÄòThe Case of the afflicted Clergy in Scotland,‚Äô 1690, (‚ÄòBy a Lover of the Church and his Country‚Äô). * ‚ÄòAn Account of the late Establishment of the Presbyterian Government,‚Äô 1693, (anon.) * ‚ÄòThe Fundamental Charter of Presbytery ‚Ä¶ examin'd,‚Äô 1695; 2nd edit. 1697, (anon.; preface in answer to Gilbert Rule answered in ‚ÄòNazianzeni Querela,‚Äô 1697, by William Jameson (fl. 1689‚Äì1720). * ‚ÄòThe Principles of the Cyprianic Age,‚Äô 1695; 2nd edit. 1717, (by ‚ÄòJ.

Ordered in October 1952, the gown took eight months of research, design, workmanship, and intricate embroidery to complete. It featured the floral emblems of the countries of the United Kingdom and those of the other states within the Commonwealth of Nations, including the English Tudor rose, Scots thistle, Welsh leek, Irish shamrock, Canadian maple leaf, Australian wattle, New Zealand silver fern, South African protea, Indian lotus flower for India, the Lotus flower of Ceylon, and Pakistan's wheat, cotton, and jute. The gown, like Elizabeth's wedding dress and other notable royal dresses of this period, was designed by Norman Hartnell. It was the Queen's wish that the coronation dress should be made of satin, like her wedding dress, with accentuation of regal elegance, but with no undue emphasis on shape. The gown now forms part of the Royal Collection. After the coronation, the dress was worn on several occasions such as when she opened the parliaments in New Zealand (1954), Australia (1954), Ceylon (1954), and Canada (1957). Design The dress was to be a historic masterpiece befitting the occasion, consequently one that would stand out. Like her bridal gown, the costume was designed by Norman Hartnell. Hartnell proposed at least eight different designs; the first, very simple, similar to that worn by Queen Victoria at her Coronation; the second, a modern slim-fitting sheath gown, embroidered in gold; the third, a crinoline style dress of white satin, silver tissue and crusty silver lace; the fourth, white satin embroidered with Madonna and arum lilies and encrusted with pendant pearls; the fifth, a colourful design of violets, roses and wheat, the sixth, white satin with gold, silver and copper embroideries featuring branches of oak leaves with acorns; the seventh, the Tudor Rose of England, appliqued in gold tissue against white satin; and the eighth, similar to the seventh, but incorporating the floral emblems of Great Britain and the Commonwealth. The Queen favoured the last option if Hartnell introduced some colour and made some adjustments; a ninth design was then drawn up and presented to Elizabeth at Sandringham. Later Hartnell secretly added an embroidered extra four-leaved shamrock on the left side of her dress as an omen for good fortune. The final version featured a Tudor rose, embroidered in very pale pink silk, with pearls, gold and silver bullion, and rose diamante; the Welsh leek, embroidered in white silk with leaves of very pale green silk; the Scottish thistle, with pale mauve silk and amethysts and a calyx embroidered in reseda green silk, silver thread, and diamante dewdrops; the Irish shamrock, like the thistle, was embroidered in soft green silk, silver thread, bullion, and diamante. the Canadian maple leaf, made with green silk embroideries with a crystal vein and gold border; the silver fern of New Zealand, embroidered in straight stitches using soft green silk and veined in silver and crystal; the Australian wattle flower, made with a coarse mimosa yellow wool and green and gold foliage; the South African protea, embroidered in shaded pink silk, with green silk leaves and silver outlined petals; the lotus flower of India, made with seed pearls and diamante and mother of pearl embroidered petals; the Lotus flower of Ceylon, made with opals, mother of pearl, diamante, and soft green silk; and the three emblems of Pakistan: wheat, in oat-shaped diamante and fronds of golden crystal, cotton, made in silver with leaves of green silk, and jute, embroidered in green silk and golden thread. In addition to the gown, Hartnell also designed a plain white linen robe called a colobium sindonis, which initially covered the short- sleeved, low-neck gown. Attached to the shoulders was a crimson velvet mantle edged with ermine and featuring two rows of delicately embroidered gold lace and gold filigree. On the Coronation Day, the six maids of honour carried this robe behind the Queen. Making The dress, which was ordered in October 1952, took eight months of research, design and workmanship to make. Its intricate embroidery required many hours of diligent work by the dressmakers. The silk used to make the gown was obtained from Lady Hart Dyke's silk farm at Lullingstone Castle. The dress required the efforts of at least three dressmakers, six embroideresses and the Royal School of Needlework, responsible for the embroidery worked in gold bullion thread. The Robe of State of Crimson Velvet, which was attached to the shoulders of the gown, was hand-woven by Warners of Braintree, Essex, using Lullingstone Castle silk and made by Messrs. Ede & Ravenscroft of Chancery Lane, London.

It is an organic compound with the chemical formula C6H5NH(CH3). The substance is a colorless viscous liquid, Samples turn brown when exposed to air. The chemical is insoluble in water. It is used as a latent and coupling solvent and is also used as an intermediate for dyes, agrochemicals and other organic products manufacturing. NMA is toxic and exposure can cause damage to the central nervous system and can also cause liver and kidney failure.  Use as a fuel additive  N-Methylaniline is a principal component of NMA (monomethylaniline), a non-traditional antiknock agent increasingly used by petroleum refiners and fuel distributors around the world to increase the octane number of gasoline petrol. It is usually added to gasoline in concentration of around 1.3% volume to avoid high gum levels that can cause increased carbon deposits in engine parts . Higher concentrations are permitted by most regulatory agencies if a detergent and a fuel combustion modifier are added to the component to keep gum formation from happening. NMA blended in those concentrations to gasoline / petrol is not more toxic than the hundreds of chemicals that compose this fuel.  Policies on blending NMA in gasoline  China = China has banned the use of most chemical gasoline additives, including NMA, in gasoline standard directive GB17930-2013 dated Dec. 18 2013, which states that ‚ÄúAdditives used in gasoline for motor vehicles should not contain recognised harmful substances and should be used by following up with the recommended safe dosage. Chemicals, such as methylal, aniline-type compounds, halogens and those containing phosphorus and silicon, etc. should not intentionally be added in gasoline.‚Äù = United States = N-Methylaniline as is (neat) does not appear on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs (EPA) List of Registered Gasoline Additives. However, registration can be obtained at higher concentration which maximum authorized dosage depends on a suitable detergent and an effective fuel combustion modifier added to this component. Fuel additives in the United States are regulated under section 211 of the Clean Air Act (as amended in January 1995). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires the registration of all fuel additives which are commercially distributed for use in highway motor vehicles in the United States, and may require testing and ban harmful additives. The EPA also regularly reviews the health and net economic benefits of Clean Air Act policies. The act also requires deposit control additives (DCAs) be added to all gasolines. This type of additive is a detergent additive that acts as a cleansing agent in small passages in the carburetor or fuel injectors. This in turn serves to ensure a consistent air and fuel mixture that will contribute to better gas mileage. = Europe = It appears that only one NMA based product for use as an octane enhancer is registered with ECHA / REACH.

It was then decided they were no longer required in India, so the battalion was renumbered the 156th Parachute Battalion and moved to the Middle East to join the 4th Parachute Brigade, 1st Airborne Division. The battalion fought briefly in the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943 and a year later in the Battle of Arnhem, part of Operation Market Garden, where heavy casualties resulted in the disbanding of the battalion, the few surviving men being distributed amongst the battalions of the 1st Parachute Brigade. Formation Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, during the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p.21 On 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando was turned over to parachute duties and on 21 November, re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing.Shortt & McBride, p.4Moreman, p.91 The battalion was raised in October 1941 from volunteers from all of the 27 British infantry battalions in British India and originally numbered the 151st Parachute Battalion, part of the 50th Indian Parachute Brigade.Conboy and Hannon, p.3 However it was decided in October 1942, that the brigade would only have Indian or Gurkha battalions and the 151st was released and sent to the Middle East.Conboy and Hannon, p.5 The battalion was redesignated 156th Parachute Battalion for no other reason than to confuse German intelligence. Arriving in the Middle East, the battalion together with the 10th and the 11th parachute battalions formed the 4th Parachute Brigade, 1st Airborne Division.Mitcham, p.336 In 1942 a parachute battalion had an establishment of 556 men in three companies (three platoons each) supported by a 3 inch mortar and a Vickers machine gun platoon.Peters, p.55 By 1944 a support company to command the battalions heavy weapons was added. It comprised three platoons: Mortar Platoon with eight mortars, Machine Gun Platoon with four Vickers machine guns and an Anti-tank Platoon with ten PIAT anti-tank projectors.Guard, p.37 Operations The 156th Parachute Battalion's first combat experience was during Operation Slapstick in Italy. The operation was carried out by the 1st Airborne Divisions, 2nd and 4th Parachute Brigades. The battalion sailed from Bizerta on 8 September 1943. The landings at Taranto were unopposed, the Italians surrendering the night before. The 156th Battalion and the 10th Parachute Battalion together captured the town and airfield of Gioia, and in November 1943 the battalion was withdrawn to England.Ferguson, p.13 Arnhem Four men of the 156th Parachute Battalion moving through a shell-damaged house in Oosterbeek September 1944. The 156th Parachute Battalion and the rest of the 4th Parachute Brigade landed to the west of Arnhem on the second day of the battle 18 September 1944. Their objective was to hold a position on the high ground north of Arnhem at Koepel.Peters, p.168 With the 156th Parachute Battalion leading on the right followed by the 10th Battalion on the left. By dawn the following day the battalion was just north of the Utrecht to Arnhem railway line. When they came under attack from German 88 mm guns.Peters, pp.168‚Äì169 Both battalions were ordered to start an assault on the position at 07:00. After repeated attacks the battalion got no further forward. The defenders from the 9th SS Panzer Division had been here for two days and were well dug in.Peters, p.173 The German position included infantry, self propelled guns and armoured cars. The battalion fought all day in the woods but its losses were very heavy, with 'A' Company losing all of its officers. Finally brigade headquarters obtained permission to withdraw south of the rail line into Oosterbeek.Peters, p.174 The battalion started to pull back over the rail line but in the confusion of the withdrawal no orders had been given about where they were to go once south of the rail line. Most of 'B' and 'Support' Companies headed towards Wolfheze while the rest of the battalion headed towards Oosterbeek, the two parts of the battalion were never reunited. The units in Wolfheze and the remnants of the 10th Parachute Battalion now prepared to defend the village.Peters, p.185 Casualties had continued to mount including the commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Richard des Voeux and the second in command who were both killed on 20 September. The battalion was now under command of Major Geoffrey PowellPeters, p.254 The German tactics were to bombard the British positions with tank and mortar fire.Peters, pp.204‚Äì206 The remnants of the battalion were withdrawn into the perimeter formed by the division around Oosterbeek.Peters, p.207 By 21 September pressure from the German attacks had squeezed the perimeter to less than across.Peters, p.222 On 22 September the bulk of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade were dropped south of the river. This drew off some of the Germans from around the divisional perimeter to confront the new threat. The defenders now had to cope with over 100 German artillery guns firing onto their positions.Peters, p.234 By 23 September the battalions position was subjected to constant mortar and artillery fire and incursions by tanks and infantry were becoming more and more frequent. Casualties forced a contraction of the perimeter but first the Germans had to be evicted from the houses behind them which they were to occupy.Peters, pp.247‚Äì254 On 24 September the decision was made by Lieutenant General Horrocks commander XXX Corps to withdraw what was left of the division south of the Rhine.Peters, p.265 The remnants of the battalion were evacuated over the night of 25/26 September.Peters, pp.279‚Äì283 During the battle of Arnhem the battalion's casualties were, 98 dead, 68 were evacuated and 313 became prisoners of war. The casualties sustained were never replaced and the battalion was disbanded after the battle.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in County Sligo unless stated otherwise. Sligo was constituted a county in 1568 by Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Deputy of Ireland, but a sheriff does not appear to have been appointed until the year 1576 at the request of the O'Connor Sligo.

This now-defunct station is located on an altitude of 618.54 m above NN. There are two platforms, three transit tracks, one street connection, one cargo street, one deposit track, and one track to the goods shed. Lichte (Thuringia) east station was also an express train station ()Kursbuch der Deutschen Reichsbahn: Winterfahrplan 1990/91 on the railway line from Sonneberg to Probstzella.  History  This train station was opened in January, 16th 1899. The first name was Bock-Wallendorf. It was the new final destination of the railway line from Probstzella to Schmiedefeld (Lichtetal). Only much later, in October, 31st 1913 this terminal station was enhanced to an express railway station, as the railway line from Probstzella was extended to Lauscha, and Sonneberg. However, with the reduction of goods to be dispatched to, respective exchanged with, the municipality of Lichte and the town Neuhaus am Rennweg, Lichte (Thuringia) east station became less important. In 1963 the piece-goods and parcels dispatch was closed. And in the 1980s the station lost even more importance, because the number of steam locomotives used was declining and finally ceased, and as a result the local water filling station for steam locomotives was closed.Wolfgang Beyer, Emil Ehle: √úber den Rennsteig - Von Sonneberg nach Probstzella. S. 109 Further on the train station was unmanned. However, there was a stop for the semi-fast trains from Sonneberg to Leipzig, in distinction to the Lichte (Thuringia) station next to it. Because of technical deficits the train service was ceased by surprise on January, 22nd 1997. In July, 1st 2006 the German Eisenbahnbundesamt agreed to the discontinuance of the train service. In the meanwhile the Deutsche Regionaleisenbahn rent this rail line. Since 2008 tourist service by usage of rail-cycle draisines on the rail line from Schmiedefeld (Lichtetal) via Lichte (Thuringia) east station to Lichte (Thuringia) station has been established.

The hexafoil design is modeled after the six petal lily, for its symbolism of purity and relation to the Trinity. The hexafoil form is created from a series of compound units, and exists as a more complex variation of the same extruded figure. Other forms similar to the hexafoil include the trefoil, quatrefoil, and cinquefoil.  Creating a hexafoil  A geometrical hexafoil. One common form of the hexafoil has a ring of six tangent circles circumscribed by a larger circle. It may be constructed by compass and straightedge, by drawing six circles at the centers of a regular hexagon, with diameter equal to the side of the hexagon.. The inner circles of the hexafoil have radius 1/3 that of the outer circle containing them, from which it is possible to derive the area and perimeter of the figure as a mathematical exercise.. Hexafoil in leftHexafoil framing in 236x236px Another method of drawing a hexafoil is the vesica piscis method. To do so one takes a ruler and uses it to draw a line. A compass is used to draw a circle. The needle point is put on the point where the perimeter of the circle intersects the horizontal and the drawing point on the center of the circle to draw a curved line that intersects two points of the perimeter of the circle. This makes the vesica piscis shape. The needle point of the compass is then put on the points where the vesica piscis intersects the perimeter of the circle and another semi circle is drawn, terminating at the perimeter. One then continues drawing the semi-circles at the points where they intersect with the circle's perimeter until all points are connected and the shape is a hexafoil.  Architecture  A key component to Gothic architecture is a strong design principal involving geometry and harmony. The hexafoil design is implemented in various Gothic buildings constructed in the 12th through 16th century. The traditional design is used in cloisters, triforiums and stained glass windows of famous buildings such as Notre-Dame, Salisbury Cathedral, and Regensburg Cathedral. Stone cut-out hexafoils are displayed in a plate tracery style in the Salisbury Cathedral, creating a pattern along the triforium.  Religion  The hexafoil form can also be see as a framing design in Bible moralis√©e. They are often rendered in red, blue, gold or vibrant orange and surround biblical scenes in the bible. The hexafoil style of framing was often used in conjunction with architectural framing to provide the text with more depth, creativity, invention, and volume. Old Testament illustrations were surrounded by hexafoil frames while moralization depictions favored architectural frames. Magic Hexafoil designs are known to have links to folk magic practices in various countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, where a six leaf design with concentric circles have been found in homes and occasionally in public buildings to serve as a sign of protection.Mysterious hexafoil markings in Australian homes point to hidden magical past, Nicole Dyer and Damien Larkins, ABC News Online, 2017-02-22 References Category:Gothic architecture Category:Circles Category:Magic (supernatural) ","title":"Hexafoil"},{"id":"31636726","text":"Pansteatitis, or yellow fat disease, is a physiological condition in which the body fat becomes inflamed. Presentations The condition has been found in cats, fish, herons, terrapins and Nile crocodiles, piscivores such as otters, cormorants, Pel's fishing-owls and fish eagles. The disorder is also regularly found in captive-bred animals fed on high fish diets, such as mink, pigs and poultry. It shows as a rubber-like hardening of fat reserves which then become unavailable for normal metabolism, resulting in extreme pain, loss of mobility and death. Causes It is thought to be brought about by any or a combination of a number of factors which include: * Vitamin E deficiency *Microcystin poisoning *Heavy metals and other pollutants such as DDT, PCBs, PCDDs and brominated flame retardants *Ingestion of affected animals *Pathogens as yet unidentified Incidents In 2008 about 170 crocodile deaths in the Olifants Gorge on the Olifants, and in the Letaba Rivers in the eastern part of the Kruger National Park in South Africa, alerted rangers and researchers to a problem that may eventually reach epidemic proportions. Dead and dying bottom-feeding catfish Clarias gariepinus that had ingested toxic pollutants such as heavy metals, had become an easy source of food for the crocodiles, with a resulting transfer of the toxins. With the onset of winter and lower temperatures, metabolism switches to fat reserves, at which time mortality peaks. These particular toxins are from the upper reaches of the river, originating from the industrial and mining complex in the Witbank and Middelburg area. Earlier, in 2007, at the Loskop Dam, higher in the Olifants River, crocodile deaths were linked to a mass die-off of fish after sewage pollution caused cyanobacterial blooms. The affected crocodiles had consumed masses of dead and dying fish. Cyanobacterial blooms (Anabaena spp.) are common in the stagnant water of dams, but do not occur in the flowing water of rivers. High autumnal mortality among migratory herons and caused by cyanobacterial blooms, is seen regularly in brackish impoundments at Chesapeake Bay in the United States. The Massingir Dam in Mozambique, and just downstream of the Olifants Gorge, was constructed in the 1970s, but the country's civil war delayed installation of the sluice gates. The dam wall was raised and sluice gates installed in 2006, causing sediment to back up into the 8 km-long Olifants Gorge.

His audience responded very positively, and continued to ask for more even after the convention was over. Throughout the 1950s, Stafford and Weston developed the act to entertain guests at parties. The couple would pretend to be a bad lounge act. Stafford would sing off-key in a high pitched voice, while Weston would play an untuned piano off key and with bizarre rhythms. Weston's pseudonym, the name of the Calvinist preacher, was chosen by George Avakian, an executive for Columbia Records, who wanted Weston to record his musical misadventures under that name. The more thought Weston gave to the request, the more unsure he was that he could fill an entire album as Jonathan Edwards alone. He enlisted Stafford, who became Jonathan's wife, Darlene, and the off- key vocalist of the duo. Stafford made her first recording as Darlene Edwards in 1957 after finding herself with some spare time after a recording session, and those who heard bootlegs of this track gave it a positive reception. Stafford and Weston subsequently recorded an entire album of songs as the Edwardses later that year, entitling it Jo Stafford and Paul Weston Present: The Original Piano Artistry of Jonathan Edwards, Vocals by Darlene Edwards. By way of a publicity stunt, the Westons claimed they had no personal connection to Jonathan and Darlene and that they were a Trenton, New Jersey lounge act whom they had discovered and who happened to live with them. This led to much speculation throughout the United States as people tried to identify the act, with Time Magazine reporting that Margaret and Harry Truman were strong contenders, before identifying the couple in the article. The 1957 album was followed by an album of \\"pop standards\\" on which the pair put their own interpretation on popular songs. It proved to be a commercial and critical success, becoming the first commercially successful musical parody album. The Westons brought the Edwardses to television in 1958 for a Jack Benny Shower of Stars, and to The Garry Moore Show in 1960. Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris was recorded in 1960, and won an award for that year's Grammy Awards for Best Comedy Album. The album \\"tied\\" with Bob Newhart's \\"Spoken Word Comedy\\" because the Grammys took the unusual decision to issue two comedy awards for 1960.The 1961 Grammy Awards were awarded for music produced in 1960. The 1961 award for Best Comedy Album was the only Grammy Stafford ever won.

It was established as a training airfield in 1912 and saw airline service from 1922 until the 1950s. It was replaced by the Cologne Bonn Airport. The airport buildings from 1935-36 are listed monuments and a rare example of airport architecture from the Interwar Period. From 1951 to 1967 it was operated by the Royal Air Force as RAF Butzweilerhof.  History  Before regular aviation activities at Butzweilerhof started, the area north of Cologne was sporadically used by airships. The military Zeppelin Z II arrived in Cologne in August 1909 and was based in a nearby hangar until it was destroyed in a storm in April 1910. In addition a blimp designed and manufactured 1909 by Clouth Gummiwerke from nearby suburb Nippes was temporarily stored at this hangar.80 Jahre zivile Luftfahrt in K√∂ln; HG: Flughafen K√∂ln/Bonn GmbH und Stiftung Butzweilerhof. K√∂ln, 2006, , German Rumpler Taube taking off from Butzweilerhof in 1913/14  Beginnings and World War I  In 1912 the Air Arm of the Imperial Army (Luftstreitkr√§fte) established an air station at Butzweilerhof and hangars, maintenance facilities as well staff accommodations were built. The station went fully operational in spring 1913 and was used for initial pilot training before and during World War I. Among the pilots receiving their first flying lessons at Butzweilerhof was Manfred von Richthofen.  Interwar period  After the war the Royal Air Force used the airfield primarily in a supply role for British troops. From 1922 Instone Air Line provided a first regular passenger service to London via Brussels. The airfield was returned to the city of Cologne in 1925 and the civil airport was officially opened one year later. In order to fulfil requirements of modern aircraft adjacent property was bought. The enlarged airfield had a circular shape and occupied around 30 hectares. Then mayor of Cologne Konrad Adenauer supported the development of Butzweilerhof into a modern airport, but due to limited financial resources only small progress was made during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Some facilities in use still originated from the imperial air station, while newer ones were basic and partially made of wood. After 1933 the expansion plans were adopted by the new national-socialist government of Cologne and a major expansion project started in 1935. It served as a job creating program for around 1,100 unemployed. In the course of this project a new airport complex consisting of a passenger building, workshops, two hangars and a control tower was erected. The new facilities were opened after only one year of construction time in June 1936, a few weeks prior to the Olympic Games in Berlin. Largest operator was pre-war Deutsche Luft Hansa. Foreign operator such as Imperial Airways, Air France and Sabena accounted for approximately one out of four movements. For some time Butzweilerhof was second in Germany only to Berlin Tempelhof and dubbed Luftkreuz des Westens (Air Junction of the West). Traffic figures reached a peak in 1938 with 6,390 aircraft departures as well as 49,938 arriving and departing passengers.  World War II and Cold War  During World War II Butzweilerhof was predominately used for emergency landings and as field repair station for fighter aircraft. The Royal Air Force moved in again after the war and the airfield became RAF Butzweilerhof. Some airline service was restarted but ceased with the opening of Cologne Bonn Airport. The RAF base closed in the 1960s and some airport facilities were subsequently used by non-flying units of the German Army. The airfield stayed in use until 1996 by army aviation units of the Belgian Armed Forces from nearby barracks.  Airport buildings  Landside portal from 1936 with relief Passenger Hall The airport buildings from 1935-36 were designed by Hans Mehrtens, Chief Building Director of Cologne since 1930. An airport road was built in straight line to the city centre and the airport facilities were positioned directly at its end. The group of buildings is approximately 270 meters long and arranged slightly curved to follow the perimeter of the circular airfield.  Passenger building  The passenger building is a two- storey flat roof construction parallel to the airfield perimeter. The passenger traverses the building through the lobby which is aligned with the former airport road and divides the building into a western and eastern wing. Arriving passengers were looking directly at the distant Cologne Cathedral when leaving the building to the landside. The landside portal of the lobby is decorated with a relief made by the sculptor Willi Meller and features the eagle of the Weimar Republic and three crowns derived from coat of arms of Cologne. Most of the ground level is brought forward towards the tarmac to form roof terraces. The west wing houses a caf√© and a restaurant while the east wing was occupied by airport and airline offices.  Workshops  The workshops (Betriebshof) were located in a horseshoe-shaped one storey building. Staff and maintenance facilities are grouped around an inner courtyard, while several parking garages provided direct airside access for ambulance vehicles and fire engines. The building was heavily altered after the war and several extensions had to be broken-up to recreate the original state.  Hangar I  Hangar I has interior dimensions of 68.4 meters in width and 34.8 meters in depth. It is large enough to accommodate several contemporary Junkers Ju 52/3m with a wingspan of 29 meters and a length of 19 meters. The building was lastly used as repair facility for heavy military vehicles and had the original hangar doors replaced with roll-up doors.  Control Tower  Control Tower The Control Tower completes the airport complex and sets an antipode to the passenger lobby at the opposite end. The tower features strips of ribbon windows in Bauhaus style. The control level on top is glazed all around and had to be reconstructed after its accidental demolition during the war.  Hangar II  A second hangar with roughly the same dimensions as Hangar I was erected in right angle behind the control tower. On two sides the building is surrounded by classrooms that were used for training of flying staff and maintenance personnel. The hangar still features the original hangar doors.  Current days  The premises of the former airfield were primarily used to extend the nearby business park while the airport buildings underwent restoration.  Airport buildings  The airport buildings - listed as monuments since 1988 ‚Äì were extensively renovated between 1995 and 2007 with the intention to use them for cultural activities and an aviation museum. The apron will be converted into a park to form the centre of the new suburb Butzweilerhof.KstA ‚ÄúRestoration works at Butzweilerhof‚Äú 23 August 2009 (German)  Airfield  The former airfield as well as its surroundings were temporarily used for activities such as music festivals and than gradually converted into a business park.

The resulting metal created from this process is more resistant to wear and heat and has been very expensive to produce. However, because of this new process, the markets for these metals has grown to include agricultural and auto industries.  History  There were several men who have been credited with the creation of squeeze casting. Together, the team of scientists devised a new way to combine extremely high temperatures and 15,000 psi(pounds per square inch) of air pressure to reshape molten metal. Along the way, there were many drawbacks to this creation. Some problems they encountered included combining the exact temperature with the correct pressure in order to form the strongest metal. However, even with so many challenges, it was officially patented on the 18th of October, 1994. One of the greatest drawbacks that inventors of squeeze casting have encountered is the configuration of reentrant cavities and internal passages that use the core. One of the possible solutions brought up was creating a core from conventional sand coring. Although this method seemed like a valid solution, the high temperatures from molten metal easily penetrated the core made from sand. Along the way, other inventors have also come up with different methods such as using traditional salt cores, but like sand coring, they are equally, if not more susceptible to stress and cracking. Working on complex processes like squeeze casting, it is easy to focus on one aspect and struggle with another part while working with this metal. For example, it is easy to focus on only weight reduction, and then realize the cost has increased substantially. Other times, costs to produce squeeze casts may drop, all while having the strength of this metal drop proportionally too. But through these surmountable challenges, the many inventors have refined the process even more to devise the process we call squeeze casting.  Creating Squeeze Casts  # Heat metal to melting temperature # Inject into die and add 15,000 psi to shape molten metal # Heat over melting temperature # Extract material and rinse through water # Remove metal produced from die to cool down After getting through these challenges, the real benefits of this processes were discovered. Squeeze casting allows for the addition of an insulating layer around the metal core. This results in a layer that prevents the die cavity's heat from melting the core that is being produced. With the insulating layer intact, the construction of this core allows it to be more easily extracted all while leaving behind the protective-insulating layer. Moreover, through this process, a low cost option of producing squeeze cores that is able to withstand high pressures has been made open to the public.  Market  The product of this process has many practical applications, but most of its uses lie in the defense industry. Squeeze cast parts are most frequently found in military vehicles because of its strength and durability in areas where it is needed most- this product has the strength to carry about 40 tonnes of pressure. Furthermore, other reasons why it is used among so many markets is because it reduces 35% of the weight of most metals. Created just over fifteen years ago, the process continues to get better, to a point where decreasing the price of production has become a priority.  Patents  The patent for this product can be found on the list of google patents. There, it lists a clear description of each part integral to the function and process used to create squeeze cast metals. For example, it describes what temperatures and pressures are required, what function each step serves, and how it relates to the whole process. The original patent holder of squeeze casting was Cmi International Inc., but since then, there have been many patent transfers. All of which, have been companies competing in the same field for a greater share of the market. For example, Gibbs Die Casting Aluminum Corporation, Ube Industries Ltd and Mazda Motor Corporation are all multinational corporations that have contributed and competed for a share of the market. Lastly, even though there are many contenders in the market, most of the companies in this market have been attempting to improve these products by decreasing weight, all while increasing the strength of these metals.

The population was eradicated in 2010 in the course of an environmental restoration program. History A party led by Heurtin, a French farmer (sometimes described as a peasant) from R√©union island, on 18 January 1871 attempted to settle the uninhabited 55 km2 island. After seven months, their attempts to raise sheep and cattle and grow crops had been unfruitful and they departed on 19 August, abandoning their livestock, including five cattle, on the island.Carroll (2003). Over the next century or so a combination of factors caused further ecological devastation of the island, which had already been impacted by the introduction of invasive species of plants and animals, as well as by unrestricted hunting, timber-cutting and wildfire caused by sealers and other visitors. The Amsterdam duck and several species of petrel became extinct, and the breeding population of the endemic Amsterdam Island albatross, previously thought to be a subspecies of the wandering albatross, was reduced to just five pairs.Micol & Jouventin (1995). When the native Phylica arborea (syn. Phylica nitida) forest was almost entirely destroyed, grazing by the increasing numbers of cattle prevented natural regeneration. The original five cattle had grown to about 2000, which occupied an area of 3000 ha, at a density of 0.64 individuals per hectare. The only part of the island the cattle did not unoccupy was the Plateau des Tourbi√®res, over 550 m above sea level. Although the cattle posed a threat to the island's environment, they formed one of the very few herds of feral Bos taurus anywhere in the world. In 1987 a fence was built across the island in order to mitigate the damage the cattle were imposing on the flora and fauna of Amsterdam, as well as to preserve the breed because of scientific interest in its isolation-derived genetic character. During 1988 and 1989 the 1059 cattle south of the fence were culled. Subsequently, the cattle were restricted to the northern part of Amsterdam. About 50-80 mainly adult and subadult males out of a herd of about 350 individuals were shot each year to provide fresh meat for the inhabitants of the Martin-de-Vivi√®s research station, the only settlement on the island.Berteaux & Micol (1992). In 2007, after a study showed that the areas that were not grazed were recolonized by native plants, it was decided to kill all of the remaining cattle on the island. An association of people who had been wintering on the island tried to oppose the decision, but in vain.

The blast, from a bomb left in a bag, destroyed the Argana cafe in Jemaa el-Fnaa square, a popular tourist spot. At least 20 people were injured. Most of the dead were tourists, including one group of French students. Casualties 17 people were killed, of which fourteen died on the site, while three more succumbed to their injuries the next day. 25 people were injured, four seriously, including Russian computer hacker Roman Seleznev. The casualties were eight French nationals, including a girl of 10 years, originally from northern France,Morocco bombing will not go unpunished: France (AFP) an Israeli-Canadian woman and her Moroccan husband, another Moroccan citizen, a Briton (Peter Moss, 59, from London who was a former writer for the newspaper The Jewish Chronicle), a Dutchman, a Swiss and a Portuguese. The Swiss and the Portuguese were the companions of two Ticino natives injured in the same attack. Among the injured, 14 were hospitalised and four were repatriated to their country the next day (two Swiss and two Russians), while others left the hospital after receiving the necessary care. One of the Swiss later died while in hospital in Zurich. Responsibility Morocco blamed Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb for the bombing. The group has been fighting an insurgent campaign since 2002.

He had an active singing career in operas, concerts, and musicals from the 1940s through the 1980s. While still performing, he embarked on a second successful career as a voice teacher which led to teaching positions at a variety of institutions, including the Juilliard School, the Eastman School of Music, and the Academy of Vocal Arts. Life and career Born with the name Santo Tortorigi in Brooklyn, Torigi was the son of Italian immigrants to the United States. He studied singing in New York with Eleanor McClellan who was also the teacher of Eileen Farrell. In 1942 he made his Broadway debut as a member of the ensemble in the revival of The Merry Widow, and was heard later that year in the revival of The New Moon. In 1947 he made his professional opera debut with the Rochester Opera as Escamillo in Georges Bizet's Carmen. He then toured the United States with the San Carlo Opera Company in the late 1940s and in 1950 singing the role of Marcello in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me. In the Spring of 1951 he performed the role of Figaro in The Barber of Seville in Los Angeles and with both the Cincinnati Zoo Opera and the St. Louis Municipal Opera. In 1951 Torigi made his debut with the New York City Opera (NYCO) as Silvio in Pagliacci. He performed regularly at the NYCO for the next 18 years; notably singing in the company premieres of Gian Carlo Menotti's The Consul (1952, John Sorel) and Gaetano Donizetti's Don Pasquale (1955, Malatesta). Other roles Torigi sang at the NYCO included Marcello, Sharpless in Madama Butterfly, and Germont in La traviata among others. His final performance with the company was as Silvio de Narni in Alberto Ginastera's Bomarzo in October 1969 (which had been recorded in 1967). He had previously created that role in the world premiere of Bomarzo at the Washington National Opera in 1967. Torigi was also active on Broadway and with several other American opera companies during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1955 he made his debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago as Schaunard in La boh√®me. In 1956 he was an alternate for Robert Weede as Tony in the original Broadway production of Frank Loesser's The Most Happy Fella. He later portrayed the role of Tony in the show's first National Tour. After retiring from performance, Torigi worked as a vocal coach and voice teacher. He held teaching posts at a variety of institutions, including Juilliard, Eastman, and the AVA. One of his students was musician and voice actor Barry Carl. He retired from teaching in 2003. He died in Sebastopol, California in 2010 at the age of 92.

IST uses the IB PYP (IB Primary Years Programme) until grade 5, IB MYP (IB Middle Years Programme) until grade 10 and the IB DP (IB Diploma Programme) from grades 11 to 12. The school provides education from Nursery to grade 12. Student body IST's student body consists of over 450 students from 32 countries. Facilities IST has two building divisions, Han and Qin Building. IST has: * 400m Athletics track * Full-court soccer field * Gymnasium with 2 basketball court+3 volleyball court * Vertex climbing walls * 500 seats Theatre * Library with over 30,000 sources in many languages * 2 Computer laboratories, 100+ MacBooks, 100+ iMac * Five science laboratories * Music and drama studios and five modern practice rooms * A cafeteria, cafe (barista) and two students lounge * 70+ modern classrooms with projectors and interactive whiteboards  School Services  The International School of Tianjin offers various services for the safety and well-being of students. These include a 24-hour guard and security service, a fleet of buses offering transportation services for students and staff, a fully operational school clinic staffed by a full-time nurse and a school cafeteria service operated by one of the premier international catering companies called Chartwells. Please click on the links above for a more detailed explanation of each of these services.  Student and Campus Safety  IST has a 24-hour guard and security company contracted to secure the school premises and maintain a vigil on people entering the school campus and grounds. The guards are well-trained and monitor the security and safety of the campus round the clock. In order to ensure that your children are safe and accounted for at all times, IST does not allow students to leave the campus during school hours unless accompanied by a teacher, as well as having obtained a signed parental permission slip. Students will only be allowed to leave the school with parents or the student's registered driver if a letter of authorization is received from the student's parents, and permission is granted by the director or relevant principal. IST also keeps daily records of student absences in order to more closely monitor attendance patterns and in an effort to determine if a student is, in fact, absent. Should a student be absent when the class attendance register is taken, the school office will telephone the student's parents in an effort to determine the reason for the failure to arrive. = Identity cards = The school issues ID cards to all persons in the following categories: * Students * Employees * Parents * Drivers * Regular visitors With the exception of students, persons in all the above categories must show their ID card to the security guard at the school gate, and wear it throughout their time on campus. Persons without an ID card must sign in at the security guards‚Äô office, and wear a visitor's ID card. Anyone who loses their card should contact the school's Human Resource Manager to request a replacement card. = Valuables = Valuables are brought on to campus at the student's own risk. Where ever possible, they should be named and easy to identify. Students must give any valuables to a teacher to look after, lock them safely in lockers or keep them on their person when not in use. The school cannot be held responsible for valuables lost, unless in the safekeeping of a supervisor. Loss or damage to the property of students, parents, and visitors The school does not accept liability for loss of, or damage to, the property of students, parents and visitors, including motor vehicles, on the school campus. Students are strongly advised not to bring high-value items to school. = Lost and found = Any lost items that are found on the school campus will be placed in the lost and found cupboard. Students and parents should approach the office personnel should they wish to search the box for lost items. Parents are asked to label their children's personal items, such as clothing, in order to assist the school to identify the owner before the item is placed in the lost and found box. Quarterly displays of lost items will be made to help students to identify their lost property. = Health and safety online documentation = For a complete run-down of health and safety at IST please download and refer to the official school documentation below.  The IST Bus Service  IST's bus service is available to all students, with special drop off times for half‚Äêday Nursery children, and a late bus service for students participating in extra‚Äêcurricular activities. The drop off and pick up points will be developed for areas where five or more children sign up for the bus. The bus will stop at a designated gate for each housing area (i.e. children will not be picked up at their individual houses so that bus runs are as short as possible.) We will do our best to ensure that no child is on the bus for more than 45 minutes, although unfortunately this is not possible for all locations. There is a Chinese helper on each bus and all buses are equipped with seat belts and a mobile telephone. The cost of the service in is RMB 11,000 per year (RMB 5,500 per semester) for city locations and RMB 12,000 per year (RMB 6,000 per semester) for TEDA. Please see the current bus routes attached for your reference but note that the routes and times may be adjusted according to demand.  The School Clinic  IST has a fully operational school clinic staffed by 2 qualified nurses, one full-time and one part-time. In addition, the school has established an emergency access scheme with the Tianjin United Family Hospital (TJUFH) Under this scheme, students are provided access to the hospital for initial treatment in emergency medical situations that occur during school hours and/or at school events. The school covers the cost of this initial treatment only. Parents are responsible for the cost of all medication and for all treatment beyond the initial consultation with the doctor. Parents are therefore strongly advised to arrange medical insurance for their children. Please note that responsibility for the decision to send a sick or injured student to TJUFH lies with the school nurse, whose priority is always the welfare of the individual student. While access to initial treatment is at the school's expense such coverage does not apply before or after school hours or on any day following an accident or injury. If a student becomes too ill to participate in school lessons or activities, the school nurse will telephone the parents to pick the child up from school. Please do not send your child to school if he/she is sick, as your child's recovery will be slower, and other children and adults will be exposed. Students who are sent home sick will be re-admitted to school only after they have been checked by the school nurse.  The School Cafeteria  Healthy foods policy = While recognizing that the selection and provision of snacks and meals for their children to eat at school is a legitimate right of all families, the IST community firmly believes that students at this school should be provided with healthy foods that promote both student health and student learning. To this end the school strongly discourages parents from providing their own children with unhealthy snacks such as candies and soda drinks. In addition, treats for other class members may only be provided if prearranged with a teacher or a member of the administration. Birthdays will be celebrated together on one day per month as designated by the home room teacher. The school also forbids the sale of sweets, chocolates, soda drinks, and other sugar rich and salty foods to students unless formally approved for special occasions by the administration. IST expects teachers and parents to act as role models for students and strongly encourages adults in the building to model healthy eating behaviour. = School lunch service and snacks = The school has contracted with the Chartwells Catering Company to offer a full meal service. To use this service, students may purchase an electronic charge card from the school office. Students may alternatively choose to bring a nutritious lunch and a drink from home and there are microwave ovens available in the cafeteria to heat food. Nursery and Pre-Kindergarten students will be given a snack and fruit juice each day.  ComPOS Online Lunch Card  The catering company has introduced a ‚ÄòComPOS‚Äô online lunch card system to enable parents to check balances on student lunch cards, and to add additional cash to them.

It was a division of Marshall University, then still known as Marshall College. The school was established in 1932, and moved into a permanent facility in what is now Jenkins Hall on the Marshall campus in 1938. The ostensible purpose was that the school was a demonstration or laboratory where teacher education majors could do \\"student teaching\\" and new education theories could be practiced. However, another purpose of the school was that the college found recruiting professors difficult as those with children were unwilling to send them to the public schools of that era. Such college affiliated schools were not uncommon in the south and midwest of that era. West Virginia University operated a similar venture which later became University High School. The school mostly drew students from among the children of professors and the wealthy of the Huntington community. The school fielded teams in various sports, using Marshall's facilities, mascot, and school colors, and competed against both public and private schools. As the quality of the public schools improved, the need for the school was diminished and the university closed it in 1970, and repurposed Jenkins Hall into the general university. The school maintains an active alumni group which erected a memorial to its students killed in World War II in front of Jenkins Hall.

It is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is now ruined, and stands in the grounds of Hartwell House, to the north of the A418 road. History The church was built between 1753 and 1755 to a design by Henry Keene for Sir William Lee. It is an early example of Gothic Revival architecture and was planned to be a feature in the grounds of Hartwell House. The church is now a ruin. On 21 December 1967 it was designated as a Grade II* listed building. Grade II* listing means that it is considered to be a particularly important building of more than special interest. The church was declared redundant on 23 March 1973, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 27 July 1975. When the Trust took over the church it was in poor condition and without a roof. In 2000 repairs were carried out, which included rebuilding the roof in its original design using Westmorland slate, repairing the roof of the east tower, and repairing some of the stonework on the exterior of the church. The interior of the church is not accessible to visitors. Architecture Built in ashlar stone, the building has an octagonal plan with two towers, one at the east end, the other at the west. Its main windows have three lights and contain Y-tracery. Around the summit of the church is a battlemented parapet with crocketted pinnacles and a moulded cornice. Below this is a string course. Between the string course and the parapet are quatrefoil windows. On the north and south sides, and on the outer sides of the towers are rose windows.

The book is an encyclopedia and a guide to the science of contemporary cooking. It is notable for the use of elaborate equipment that many non-professional kitchens lack (sous vide machines, vacuum-chamber sealers, culinary centrifuges, culinary torches, high-precision gram scales) and for its lush photography, particularly its tricky cross-sectional images of ovens, BBQs or woks (and the food being prepared inside), apparently caught in the act of cooking, though this isn't physically possible; each individual part of the apparatus was hand-cut in a nearby metal shop, and the food‚Äîalready cut in half‚Äî was added with hasty, high-speed photography and combined into a finished image in post production. Its six volumes cover history and fundamentals, techniques and equipment, animals and plants, ingredients and preparation, plated dish recipes and a kitchen manual containing brief information on useful topics. At the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards 2010 the book was named \\"the most important cookbook of the first ten years of the 21st century\\" and was introduced into the group's hall of fame. Containing 2,438 pages and weighing in at , the book has been described as the \\"cookbook to end all cookbooks.\\" In 2012, Modernist Cuisine was condensed and adapted as the single-volume Modernist Cuisine at Home, better suited for the home cook, but which continues to feature the scientific recipe layout, with ingredients specified in traditional American volumetric units for convenience, as well as the more precise S.I. units of mass better suited to culinary science. The Modernist Cuisine Team subsequently published the 2,642-page Modernist Bread: The Art and Science (2017) and have announced work in progress on Modernist Pizza (forthcoming).  History  The idea for the book came up when Myhrvold acquired a temperature-controlled water bath for sous vide cooking in 2003. He tried to find information about this new cooking technique, which had been invented in the 1960s and was in use at many restaurants by 2003. He could find only a few articles and one book (in Spanish) on sous vide, however. He posted messages on eGullet, a high-end cooking forum, asking for recipes or sources, but found that the process was poorly understood. Myhrvold has attended Ecole de Cuisine la Varenne, a cooking school in Burgundy, France and has also cooked part-time at Rover's, a French restaurant in Seattle owned by Thierry Rautureau. He is also a scientist, having earned advanced degrees in geophysics, space physics, and theoretical and mathematical physics, done post-doctoral research with Stephen Hawking at Cambridge University, and worked for many years as the chief technology officer and chief strategist of Microsoft. Drawing on his food and science skills, Myhrvold performed experiments and calculations to generate tables of times and temperatures for cooking various foods sous vide. When he posted these tables to eGullet, answering the question that he himself had asked in that forum about one year earlier, someone suggested that he should write a book. In 2006 he began to do so, but soon realized that he could not write the book he wanted himself, and that it would require a team using proper equipment. Myhrvold started buying equipment for the research kitchen in the Intellectual Ventures lab. Much of the equipment was standard cooking equipment, but it also included items such as rotor-stator homogenizers, ultrahigh-pressure homogenizers, freeze-dryers, a 50,000 G centrifuge, ultrasonic baths, and rotary evaporators. The laboratory already included other high-tech and industrial equipment, a 100-ton hydraulic press, a large water-jet cutter, an electrical discharge machine, and automated milling machines. Myhrvold and Wayt Gibbs, an executive editor at Intellectual Ventures who served as the editor-in-chief and project manager for the book, also hired writers and editors, research assistants, photo editors, and an art director. First hired was Chris Young, who had just stopped his work of leading the development kitchen in Heston Blumenthal's restaurant The Fat Duck in England. Young recruited Maxime Bilet, also from The Fat Duck, who led the team of research chefs that developed and tested the 1,522 recipes in the book. Photographer Ryan Matthew Smith joined the team after answering an advert on Craigslist seeking a photo editor. The book team ultimately grew to include more than 50 staff and freelance contributors plus 14 outside experts who reviewed various chapters of the book. At the high point of the project, 36 researchers, chefs, and editors were working simultaneously on the book. Initially the book was planned to be 150 pages on cooking sous vide in water baths and combi ovens, along with some scientific fundamentals relevant to those techniques. It gradually grew in scope, and by late 2009 the book plan had expanded to 1,500 pages, before finally being printed at 2,438 pages. The book cost more than to produce the first printing of 6,000 copies, which sold out shortly after the publication date in March 2011. In April 2011, The Cooking Lab ordered a second printing of 25,000 copies. The Cooking Lab published a less expensive, two-volume sequel, titled Modernist Cuisine at Home, coauthored by Myhrvold and Bilet, in October 2012. The Photography of Modernist Cuisine, with 405 photographs and background details for each, including 127 from the 6-volume set and unpublished ones, was published in 2013.  Structure  Modernist Cuisine consists of five major volumes plus a spiral-bound kitchen manual, which reprints recipes and reference tables from the major volumes on water-resistant paper for use while cooking. # History and Fundamentals, includes a chapter that chronicles the intellectual history of culinary movements, culminating with a detailed history of the Modernist movement as it appeared in cooking beginning in the 1980s. Also in Volume 1 are chapters on microbiology, food safety, food and health, heat and energy, and the physics of food and water. # Techniques and Equipment, includes a chapter on the science and techniques of traditional cooking, which it explains by making extensive use of illustrations and photography. This volume also contains chapters on modern cooking approaches, including baking in combi ovens and water-vapor ovens, cooking sous-vide, and cooking with a wide range of advanced equipment and ingredients, from homogenizers and vacuum pumps to liquid nitrogen and dry ice. # Animals and Plants, contains just two chapters: one on meat and another on plant foods. Scientific fundamentals about these ingredients are presented along with basic cooking techniques, advanced cooking techniques, and many recipes. # Ingredients and Preparations, explains the use of ingredients more commonly associated with Modernist cooking, including thickening and gelling agents, emulsions, and foams. This volume also contains chapters on wine and coffee. # Plated-Dish Recipes, consists primarily of 48 more complex recipes, each of which includes both a main dish and various accompaniments. The index to the set appears in this volume, along with two glossaries and a set of reference tables.  Response  The critical reception was generally positive, citing detail on molecular gastronomic techniques and strong illustrations. However, the book was criticized by reviewers in the New York Times and the New Yorker for being dryly written and of limited utility to cooks without an expensive array of kitchen tools at their disposal. Two years after it was first published, a reviewer in Forbes magazine pronounced Modernist Cuisine and its two successor books \\"this decade's most influential work about food\\" and also likely the most profitable set of books in the genre in recent years.  Awards  In 2010 the book was inducted into the Gourmand Cookbook Hall of Fame. GOURMAND AWARDS 2010 COOKBOOKS In 2012 the book won the James Beard Foundation's \\"Cookbook of the Year\\" and \\"Cooking from a Professional Point of View\\" awards,2012 James Beard Foundation Book Awards and the International Association of Culinary Professionals' \\"Professional Kitchens\\", \\"Design\\" and \\"Visionary Achievement\\" awards. Exhibition The Photography of Modernist Cuisine: The Exhibition opened at Pacific Science Center on October 26, 2013. This is a photo exhibition that features food processes, large scale views, and modern cooking techniques.

S. Army Medical Corps. He was born in Thibodaux, Louisiana and was the son of Justin de La Garde and Aurelia Daspit, both members of colonial French families. Education and early career He attended the Louisiana Military Academy at Alexandria (1866‚Äì68) and matriculated at Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York in 1870 and after two years of continuous attendance was graduated in 1872. After an internship of six months in the hospital for the paralytic and epileptic at Blackwell's Island he won an appointment as junior assistant surgeon in Roosevelt Hospital and was shortly promoted to assistant and then to house surgeon. Army career He left Roosevelt Hospital to accept an appointment as acting assistant surgeon in the Army, effective March 30, 1874, and joined the service at Fort Wallace, Kansas. He spent four years in this status, then at Fort Elliott, Texas, and Camp Robinson, Nebraska. During the winter of 1876-77 he was in the field with General R. S. McKenzie‚Äôs cavalry command in the Powder River Expedition against hostile Sioux, and won the recommendation of General McKenzie for gallantry in the action against Chief Dull Knife‚Äôs band in the Big Horn Mountains on November 25, 1876. On June 6, 1878, he was appointed a first lieutenant in the medical corps from Kentucky where he had established a residence, and spent the next year at Fort Hamilton and Fort Columbus in New York harbor, during which time he studied diseases of the eye and microscopy . He next spent five years in the Indian Territory, first in camp on the North Fork of the Canadian River and then at Fort Reno. While at the latter post he took leave in 1881 and was married in Franklin, Kentucky, to Frances Neely, of a pioneer family, which for generations had furnished physicians to their community. On June 6, 1883, he was promoted to captain. He served at Fort Ellis, Mont. (1884‚Äì86), in the Yellowstone National Park (1886‚Äì87), and at Fort Assinniboine to April 1891, at which time he had completed fifteen years of continuous frontier duty. In the winter of 1889-90 he spent four months in the New York Postgraduate Medical School studying diseases of the eye, one of the first medical officers of the army to become expert in this field. He came east to Fort McHenry, Maryland, in May 1891 and took up studies on bacteriology and pathology at Johns Hopkins University and assembled the equipment for a clinical laboratory for a general hospital which he was ordered to establish and command at the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. He served with this hospital in Jackson Park from February to November 1893, acting also as attending surgeon to all officers and men on duty with the exposition. On July 20, 1892, he was ordered to conduct experiments in cooperation with officers of the Ordnance Department at Frankford Arsenal, Pa., on the effects of small-arm fire with the new calibers and new velocities upon the human body. These experiments, extending over some months, examined the relative effects upon body structures of missiles from the Springfield rifle of .45 caliber which had been the weapon of foot troops of our army since 1874 and a new experimental Springfield rifle of .30 caliber. The results of this work were published in the Report of The Surgeon General for 1893. Previous to this, while at Fort McHenry, he published the result of his experiments which demonstrated the septic quality of bullets, accidentally or purposely contaminated, and the fact that sterilization of bullets did not occur in firing. He presented an enlarged paper on this subject before the military section of the first Pan-American Medical Congress which met in Washington in September 1893. In November 1893 he went to the headquarters of the Department of Colorado at Denver as attending surgeon and accompanied troops on strike duty. In September 1894 he went to Fort Logan, Col., where he spent a year, during which time he was a professor of hygiene at the University of Denver and organized a laboratory for the city of Denver. In October 1895 he was assigned as attending surgeon at Boston, where he took postgraduate work and delivered a number of lectures on military medicine. He was promoted to Major in 1896 and assigned to Fort Robinson, Neb. He accompanied the 9th Cavalry to the Pine Ridge Agency in September 1897 and with the onset of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War went with that regiment to Chickamauga Park and thence to Tampa, Florida, in May 1898. Arrived at Tampa he organized a field hospital which was subsequently known as the Reserve Divisional Hospital of the Fifth Army Corps. He took this hospital to Cuba on the transport Saratoga with command of General Shafter and operated it at Siboney, receiving into it all the wounded from the battle of Santiago de Cuba. While on this duty he was charged with the evacuation of the wounded to the United States, and, upon the appearance of yellow fever, with the establishment of a special hospital for that disease. He was stricken with yellow fever himself on August 5 and was shipped on the transport Catania to Montauk Point, N. Y. Ordered to Washington he was given board duty until December 12, 1898, when he was assigned as surgeon at the United States Soldiers' Home. During the following five years he was given a multitude of varied duties. He was appointed to the board for the examination of candidates for the medical corps and for promotion within the corps. He was a member of the board for revision of the medical supply table and of the board to revise instruction for rendering first aid in emergencies. With the reopening of the Army Medical School in 1901 he lectured to the class on the results of gunshot wounds and gave instruction in optometry. In later sessions, he lectured on the duties of medical officers. He drew the plans upon which the expansion of the hospital at the Soldiers‚Äô Home has since been made and saw much progress toward its completion. While at this hospital he did all of the operative surgery. In 1899 he was elected professor of military surgery at New York University, a post he held for many years. In the summer of 1900, he was sent as a delegate from the United States Army to the Thirteenth International Congress of Medicine and Surgery and to the Congress of Hygiene and Demography which were meeting in Paris, France, at the time. He was a delegate to the meeting of the American Medical Association at New Orleans in 1903. From October 1903 to May 1904 he served as president of a board to study the stopping power of pistols and revolvers, involving tests made in Washington, New York, and Chicago. The results proved the superiority of the .45 caliber weapon which was recommended and adopted. In 1904 Major La Garde was sent to the Panama Canal Zone as superintendent of Ancon Hospital. He reorganized this old French hospital into a modern institution and in addition to its administration was head of the surgical service. After a year, he was ordered to Manila in the Philippine Islands as chief surgeon, Department of the Visayas, with headquarters at Iloilo. He held this post until February 1908, during which time occurred the Pulajan insurrection on the islands of Semar and Leyte, involving hard service for the troops and for the medical service. For additional duty he took command of the base hospital and headed its surgical service. He also did much of the surgical work in the Railroad and Mission hospitals at Iloilo. For his service on this tour he was warmly praised by the Department Commander, General Jesse M. Lee. He was promoted to the grade of lieutenant colonel on March 17, 1906, and returned to the United States in March 1908. He was appointed chief surgeon of the Department of Colorado at Denver and was given the position of lecturer on military surgery at the Denver and Gross Medical College. After a year in Denver he was returned to Washington, ordered to command of the Army Medical School, and appointed president of the faculty. He reached the grade of colonel on January 1, 1910, and was retired from active service on April 15, 1913. Medical work Though filling many administrative posts during his long military service, his first interest was the practice of medicine, with a special bent toward surgery and diseases of the eye. He had a wide knowledge of surgical pathology and was a skillful operating surgeon. In 1883 he performed a successful esophagotomy, a rare operation at that time, which was reported in The American Journal of the Medical Sciences, April 1884. He is best remembered, however, for his work on wound infections from missiles and on the effects of high-velocity bullets upon the human body. He joined the Association of Military Surgeons in 1892, and contributed papers to its meetings. In 1902 on invitation from the College of Physicians of Philadelphia he delivered the Mutter lecture on Poisoned Wounds by the Implements of Warfare. In the same year be contributed the articles on Gunshot Wounds and Gangrene to the Reference Handbook of Medical Sciences. Following his retirement La Garde made his home in Washington and set to work upon his book Gunshot Injuries: How they are Inflicted, their Complications and Treatment, which was published in 1911, with a second edition in 1916. During World War I he was called back to active duty in the office of The Surgeon General and among other duties lectured on treatment of gunshot wounds at various medical training camps. He died from a cerebral hemorrhage on a railroad train en route from Chicago where he had been attending a meeting of the National Board of Medical Examiners of which he was a member and he is interred in Arlington Cemetery.

He was embarked for the Windward Islands on 28 December 1772. On 4 February 1773 his unit was incorporated into the R√©giment de la Guadeloupe, in which he became Sous- Lieutenant of grenadiers on 1 May 1775. Chapuis served in the American War of Independence from 1778 to 1782, becoming lieutenant on 4 February 1779. He obtained a pension of 400 Livres on 1 July 1783 and was appointed Aide-de-Camp to the Governor of Senegal Repentigny, in which role he served until 1 February 1786 when he returned to France. Wars of the French Revolution Elected captain of a free company on 1 August 1792, Chapuis marched at its head to join the Arm√©e du Nord and was elevated to lieutenant colonel commanding the 3rd Battalion of Chasseurs Francs du Nord on 15 September. Seeing service in the Flanders Campaign during 1792-1793, he was made provisional Adjudant General Chef de Brigade (Colonel) by Dampierre on 18 April 1793. On 12 September he was elevated to General de Brigade (major general) and three days later named commandant of the Fortress of Cambrai in place of Nicolas Declaye. Under the command of Pichegru in the spring campaign of 1794 his command was greatly augmented with reinforcements to relieve the siege of Landrecies. Part of this force was driven back to Cambrai in confusion by 400 cavalry under Rudolf Ritter von Otto at Villers en Cauchies 24 April. Two days later on 26 April Chapuis led his entire command of 30,000 against the forces of the Duke of York, but suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Beaumont (or Troisvilles) when he was surprised by a massive outflanking cavalry attack and his entire command routed. Chapuis was wounded with two sabre cuts and captured at the beginning of the action, his orders from Pichegru also falling into the hands of York. Chapuis was exchanged on 23 September 1795 and re-entered France in time to take part in the defence of the Convention of 13 Vend√©miaire Year III. He was reintegrated to his full rank on non-activity on 25 October. From January 1796 he was employed in the Arm√©e des c√¥tes de l'Oc√©an at Noirmoutier, before retiring on 27 January 1801.

The southern terminus of SR 201 is at an interchange with the SR 4 freeway in Dayton. Its northern terminus is at a T-intersection with SR 55 approximately east of Casstown. Route description Phoneton Along its path, SR 201 passes through the eastern portion of Montgomery County and the eastern portion of Miami County. There are no segments of SR 201 that are included as a part of the National Highway System. SR 201 begins in Dayton, within the same interchange complex that also features the southern terminus of SR 202\\\\. Northbound SR 204 begins on a ramp from SR 4 to Troy Street and Valley Street. At the bottom of the ramp, SR 201 reaches Troy Street, also designated as SR 202\\\\. SR 201 travels east along Herman Street before turning north onto Valley Street. The southbound direction of SR 201, designated SR 201-D by the Ohio Department of Transportation, traveled south along Valley Street from the Herman Street intersection, intersected Troy Street (also the southern terminus of SR 202), then traveled north on Keowee Street before turning left onto the ramp to southbound SR 4 ending at the ramp's merge with the freeway. SR 201 follows Valley Street until the intersection with Brandt Street, and then follows Brandt Street northward toward Riverside. After entering Riverside, Brandt Street changes its name to Brandt Pike. SR 201 continues as Brandt Pike (even as it again passes inside Dayton city limits) through Huber Heights until it reaches the unincorporated community of Brandt in Bethel Township, Miami County. From there it loses its alternative name and continues northward, ending near Casstown, at the intersection with SR 55. The portion of SR 201 between Chambersburg Road and Taylorsville Road in Huber Heights is designated \\"U.S.M.C. Lance Corporal Dustin R. Fitzgerald 'Dusty' Memorial Highway\\", in honor of a Wayne High School graduate who died on August 18, 2004 from injuries sustained in a non-combat related vehicle accident in Anbar Province, Iraq. History The SR 201 designation was applied in 1923. It was originally routed from its southern terminus in Dayton to its junction with U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Brandt. SR 201 was extended to the north in 1937, routed from US 40 to SR 55. , SR 201's southern terminus was located in Downtown Dayton. It began at the intersection of Third Street and Patterson Boulevard (with Patterson Boulevard carrying SR 4 and this point also marking the former southern terminus of SR 202) and followed Patterson Boulevard north, First Street east, and Keowee Street north across the Mad River.

Freemasonry was introduced by the Dutch to what is today Indonesia during the VOC era in the 18th century, and spread throughout the Dutch East Indies during a wave of westernisation in the 19th century. Freemasons originally only included Europeans and Indo-Europeans, but later also indigenous people with a Western education. Active freemasonry existed throughout the Dutch East Indies (now: Indonesia) from 1762 to 1962. The first lodge in Asia \\"La Choisie\\" was founded in Batavia by Jacobus Cornelis Mattheus Radermacher (1741‚Äì1783). In July 1772 Abraham van der Weijden established the Lodge La Fidele Sinceritie in Batavia. In 1922 a Dutch Provincial Grand Lodge, under the Grand Orient of the Netherlands, at Weltevreden (Batavia) controlled twenty Lodges in the colony. Fourteen in Java, three in Sumatra and others in places such as Makassar.Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry The lodges in the colony played a role in the social emancipation of the Indo-Europeans, as well as of the so-called Foreign Orientals, such as the ethnic-Chinese and Arabs. Freemasonry also had a significant impact on the Indonesian National Awakening preluding the national revolution. In 1836 the painter Raden Saleh was the first indigenous person to become a freemason and joined the lodge Eendracht maakt Macht in The Hague. The first indigenous member of a lodge in the Dutch East Indies was Abdul Rachman, a descendant of the sultan of Pontianak, in 1844. A famous freemason and Grand Master (Masonic) was the Indo politician Dick de Hoog, who was the main leader of the Indo emancipation movement and president of the Indo European Alliance.Stevens, Th. Vrijmetselarij en samenleving in Nederlands Indie en Indonesie 1764-1962 (Publisher: Verloren, Hilversum) Other prominent Freemasons were the Peranakan tycoon Loa Po Seng and his half-Indo grandson, the politician and parliamentarian Loa Sek Hie. List of lodges (historical) Most lodges were closed during the Japanese occupation, unless otherwise indicated. All lodges in Indonesia were closed when freemasonry was outlawed by Sukarno in 1961.

He was imprisoned from 28 April 2011 to 28 April 2012, allegedly for \\"undermining a judicial decision\\", \\"attempting to influence the judiciary\\", and \\"reporting on untrue criminal offences\\", leading Amnesty International to designate him a prisoner of conscience. Studies and career After receiving his high school diploma in modern literature, Rachid Niny entered The University of Literature and Human Sciences in Mohammedia (Morocco) to specialize in Arabic Literature. When he received his bachelor's degree in 1994, he found himself unemployed. ‚ÄúEl Alam‚Äù, a daily Arabic Newspaper affiliated to The ‚ÄúIstiqlal party‚Äù with which he had collaborated since he was a student, refused to hire him unless he joined the party. He led the local section of qualified unemployed persons' association. In 1992, he collaborated with the ‚ÄúAl Alam‚Äù Newspaper, and then he launched a newspaper in the Amazigh Language called Awal (Words) which stopped after the third number. In 1997, he obtained an accreditation to cover the worldwide Amazigh Congress in the Canary Islands. This enabled him to leave Europe. During three years as an illegal immigrant in Spain, he tried various odds jobs. From this experience, he was inspired to write his book The Diary of a Clandestine. Returning to Morocco, he worked with the Second Moroccan Channel (2M) as TV-program presenter of ¬´ Nostaljia ¬ª. In 2000, he participated in the Assabah newspaper with his daily chronicle Chouf tchouf. Then he decided to create his own newspaper Al Massae in 2006 where he continues his chronicle with the same free critical tone. Incarceration In the afternoon of Thursday, 28 April 2011, Rachid Niny was placed under arrest by the Moroccan Police after being accused of an \\"offence against national and citizens security\\" by Abd-Allah al-Balgh√Æt√Æ, the general prosecutor of the King at Casablanca. His lawyer Khalid Soufy√¢ni called the arrest a political decision which aimed to silence an opponent of official corruption.Une d'al- Massae (Consult√© le 29/04/2011) On 9 June 2011, the Court of First Instance in Ain S‚Äôba‚Äô in Casablanca sentenced Niny to one year in prison for \\"undermining a judicial decision\\", \\"attempting to influence the judiciary\\", and \\"reporting on untrue criminal offences\\". Amnesty International protested Niny's incarceration, declaring him a prisoner of conscience and demanding his immediate release. On 19 January 2012, he was awarded an Oxfam Novib/PEN Award in recognition of \\"writers who have been persecuted for their work and continue working despite the consequences\\". Niny was freed following the completion of his sentence on 28 April 2012. On the day of his release, he spoke to reporters about the need for press freedom in Morocco, stating, \\"I hope that I will be the last journalist to be imprisoned and tried under the criminal law.\\" See also *Ali Anouzla  References  Category:1970 births Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Morocco Category:Living people Category:Moroccan journalists Category:People from Ben Slimane Category:Moroccan editors Category:Moroccan writers Category:Moroccan expatriates in Spain Category:Imprisoned journalists Category:Oxfam Novib/PEN Award winners Category:Moroccan prisoners and detainees ","title":"Rachid Niny"},{"id":"31637290","text":"Parvathapur (parvatha = mountain, pur = settlement) is a suburb of Hyderabad, located in Medchal district in Telangana, India.

Elcoat was born in the small village of Elton but lived most of his life in Stockton-on-Tees. He was one of the original directors when Stockton F.C. turned professional and formed a limited company in 1892. The new company also promoted other sports including tennis, baseball and lacrosse. Elcoat became involved in baseball within the local area; acting as an umpire and was also chairman of the Cleveland and South Durham Baseball Association. In 1895 he was appointed secretary-manager of Stockton after the incumbent was sacked for failing to provide documents to the club's accountant. In March 1898 he was offered the post of secretary-manager of Woolwich Arsenal. He accepted the offer on 30 March 1898 and started on 11 April 1898. Between 1986 and 2011 it had been mistakenly accepted that William's younger brother George was Woolwich Arsenal's manager. Elcoat's tenure at Woolwich Arsenal was quite short - he resigned on 20 February 1899 citing difficulties with the club's board of directors. The club was renowned for its high turnover of players and Elcoat maintained this by buying 13 players and selling 11 during his 10 months at the club. Following his resignation he moved back to Stockton. He died in 1912 aged 52. Whilst he resided in Norton on his return to Stockton, he had a road named after him in the village, Elcoat Road which still stands today.

It is one of the most revered shrines for Muslims in India and is equally revered by Hindus and Muslims. The dargah shrine was built by Ibrahim Lodhi, an Afghan ruler of Delhi.Piran Haridwar Official website. He was the Sufi Saint of Chishti Order in the 13th century, a successor to Baba Farid (1188‚Äì1280), and the first in the Sabiriya branch of Chishti Order. Allauddin Ali Ahmad Sabir Kaliyari Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari was born in Kohtwaal, a town in the district of Multan in 19 Rabi al-awwal, 592 Hijri (1196). He was the son of Jamila Khatun, who was the elder sister of Baba Fareed. After the death of his father, Syed Abul Rahim, his mother brought him to Pakpattan in 1204 to Baba Fareed. Baba Fareed's sister gave custody of Alauddin to him and asked him to take care of the boy, who later made him his disciple. Baba Fareed made him in charge of the langar. After a very long time Alauddin's mother came to see him and found him very weak. She was angry at her brother and demanded an explanation. Baba Fareed explained that he was made in charge of the kitchen and hence had no shortage of food. When Alauddin was asked he replied, \\"True, I was made in charge of the kitchen, but I was never told I can eat from it\\". When asked how he managed to remain alive, he revealed he went to the jungle in free time and ate whatever he found. He was then given the title Sabir. He reached Kaliyar Sharif in 1253 AD, after being anointed as the protector of Kaliyar Sharif by Baba Fareed, who asked him to go to Kaliyar, he stayed at Kaliyar for the rest of his life, and died here in 13th Rabi al-awwal 690 Hijri (1291). Hazrat sabir was far recognized for his jalal. His studies were basically more spiritual and his main teacher was his peer, his uncle Baba Fareed. Piran Kaliyar Over the centuries, a small town developed around the shrine and came to be known as Piran Kaliyar. In later history, India's first steam engine, Mary Lind, (specially shipped from England moved on rails in India) ran in Roorkee on 22 December 1851, between Roorkee and Piran Kaliyar, two years before the first passenger train ran from Bombay to Thane in 1853.

But Lyco and Orphe, suspecting a love affair between Dionysus and their sister, guarded Carya to prevent her from having intercourse with the god. By doing so they committed a violation of the restrictions imposed by Apollo, so Dionysus, after several warnings and threats, drove the two sisters mad, in which state they ran off to Mount Taygetus, where they were transformed into rocks. Carya was changed by Dionysus into a walnut tree (Greek karya).

The New Patriotic Party is the biggest opposition party in the Parliament of Ghana with 107 members of parliament out of 230. Nominations for the primaries opened on 28 February and closed on 6 March 2011. 73 constituencies had their current members of parliament standing unopposed. At such places, the members were elected by acclamation. A total of 516 persons contested the 220 constituency seats. Application process The NPP set out clear rules in the run up to the primaries. They were as follows: * An aspiring parliamentary candidate had to ensure that he/she met the requirements of qualification and eligibility set out in Article 94 of Ghana‚Äôs 1992 Constitution and articles 3, 11 and 17 of the NPP‚Äôs Constitution 2009. * An aspirant had to satisfy both the Regional Executive Committee (REC) and National Executive Committee (NEC) respectively before filling his or her nomination with the Constituency Executive Committee (CEC). This constituted the pre-qualification process. * The Regional Executive Committee and National Executive Committee would issue a notice of an aspirant‚Äôs eligibility and endorse the aspirant‚Äôs nomination forms in the desired Constituency. * An aspirant after satisfying the pre-qualification process had to then proceed to file his or her nomination with the Constituency Executive Committee. * There shall be an Elections Committee and a Vetting Committee in all affected Constituencies. After the Vetting process, there shall be publication of the aspirants eligible for the Primary election. * An applicant could then pick up nomination forms upon payment of a non-refundable fee of GH¬¢1000. * The applicant then proceeded to the Regional Office for certification and endorsement after payment of a non-refundable fee of GH¬¢2000. The Regional Secretary then endorsed the nomination forms of the aspirant and also issued him/her a letter permitting him/her to proceed for assessment by the National Executive Committee. * An applicant contesting a Constituency with a sitting New Patriotic Party Parliamentarian had to be assessed by the National Executive Committee after the payment of GH¬¢10,000, as National Party Development Fee. * As a function of encouraging more women to aspire to high political office, women candidates will enjoy a rebate of 50% of the fee. * The General Secretary of the Party would then endorse the forms of an eligible aspirant and also issued him/her with a letter permitting him/her to file his/her nomination forms in the desired Constituency and pay a filling fee of GH¬¢3000 to begin the electoral process. Closing of nominations At the close of nomination on Sunday March 6, 2011, 516 applicants picked up nomination forms to commence the process of contesting the April 30 NPP primaries. Suspended primaries Ten out of the 230 constituencies across the country were suspended from holding primaries to elect parliamentary candidates as there had been issues obstructing the run of the elections in those 10 constituencies. Party officials held the view that the decision was strategic, serving the best interest of the party and effected constituencies. The constituencies where primaries were suspended were: *Abuakwa North *Obom- Domeabra *Zebila *Sisala East *Sisala West *Sege *Nkawkaw *Bekwai *Bosome Freho *Talensi Voting day Prior to the start of the elections for the party‚Äôs historic nationwide parliamentary primaries, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo- Addo, the 2012 presidential candidate of the party, and Jake Obetsebi Lamptey, National party Chairman, urged all the aspirants, delegates and other stakeholders to \\"have healthy primaries and continue to show to the country that they were a united force, deserving of their mandate...with competence, maturity, spirit de corps and unity of purpose.\\" Furthermore, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), the ruling party extended its ‚Äúwarmest felicitations‚Äù to the New Patriotic Party as the NPP held its parliamentary primaries to elect candidates for the 2012 general elections. Over 123,000 delegates were expected to elect the party‚Äôs parliamentary candidates for the 2012 general elections. Voting at the 220 constituencies begun at 9 hours GMT and ended at 14 hours GMT in almost all the constituencies. The results=First winner Agnes Asangalisa Chigabatia, who was a former Member of Parliament for Builsa North and current Upper East Regional Chairperson of the party won the right to represent the party in the 2012 parliamentary elections. Mrs. Chigabatia, who had served as a deputy Regional Minister under the John Kufuor administration, polled 171 votes to defeat her two male opponents: Thomas Alonsi, a former District Chief Executive, who polled 116 votes and James Abukasey with 70 votes. Results The results of the primaries started trickling into various news agencies after 14 hours GMT. Like in all nationwide elections, there were hot spots in which many people in the country could not tell who would emerge the winner. In most of such constituencies the NPP's candidate was the incumbent MP. New records The organizing of the NPP primaries was a first in itself as so many constituencies primaries were held on the same day. Another first was seen when Musa Superior won the elections to be the NPP's candidate for the Tamale Central constituency without being in Ghana. Superior polled 278 votes to win the NPP parliament primaries ticket in the election with Iddrisu Sunday and Mohammed Ishmael polling 129 and 38 votes respectively. Another record was set by Frances Asiam who became the first former executive of the NDC to win a primary in the NPP. She was a former women's organizer of the opposition NDC but left the party before the 2008 parliamentary and presidential election to join the NPP. She won the Adenta constituency primaries. The aftermath of the elections Though most contestants were happy with the outcome of the elections, a few like defeated aspirant for the Okaikoi South constituency Vicky Bright challenged the results of the polls.

According to her, the voting process was flawed in that the number of votes cast that were ticked in the electoral register did not tally with the number of votes that were actually cast.

Aired on May 16, 2011, it is the season's 24th episode, and the 78th overall episode of the series. The episode was directed by Robert Duncan McNeill and written by series co-creator Chris Fedak, along with Nicholas Wootton. Despite the episode's eponymous cliffhanger ending, supposedly leading into a fifth season, it was anticipated that Chuck would be cancelled after the fourth season for declining viewership, making \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\" the de facto series finale. However, a fifth and final season was ordered on May 13, 2011. Chuck revolves around the Intersect, a government database designed by Stephen J. Bartowski. In the pilot episode of the series, Stephen's son Chuck (Zachary Levi) receives the database and accidentally uploads it to his brain. Chuck is then forced from his life as an employee at the big-box store Buy More to the spy world. By the fourth season, Chuck is a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent and is engaged to one of his handlers, Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski). In the season, Chuck and his team fulfill Stephen Bartowski's last wish to destroy Volkoff Industries, led by international arms dealer Alexei Volkoff (Timothy Dalton). It is then revealed that Volkoff was actually Hartley Winterbottom, an MI6 scientist who worked with Stephen in the 1980s. In preparation for an undercover assignment as an arms dealer named Alexei Volkoff, Winterbottom became the first person to upload the Intersect. However, the upload malfunctioned, overwriting Winterbottom's personality with that of his cover, and Stephen spent the last 20 years of his life trying to fix his mistake. At the end of \\"Chuck Versus the Last Details\\", Volkoff's daughter Vivian (Lauren Cohan) learns of her father's true identity, and, holding Chuck responsible, poisons Chuck's fianc√©e Sarah with a Volkoff Industries weapon called \\"the Norseman\\". To save Sarah's life and stop Vivian from destroying his and Sarah's wedding, Chuck turns to Alexei for help. To keep secret Volkoff's true identity, the CIA sends its \\"toughest\\" agent, Clyde Decker (Richard Burgi), to stop Chuck. \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. According to the Nielsen ratings system, it drew 4.53 million viewers, with a 1.5/4 rating among those aged 18‚Äì49. Plot Volkoff Industries heiress Vivian Volkoff (Lauren Cohan) decides to make Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Agent Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) suffer, based on the misconception that the CIA forced her father, MI6 scientist Hartley Winterbottom (Timothy Dalton), to upload a government database called the Intersect to his brain, accidentally overwriting his personality with that of his cover identity, arms dealer Alexei Volkoff. Vivian poisons Chuck's fianc√©e Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) with the Volkoff Industries \\"Norseman\\" weapon, and Sarah is rushed into the emergency room. Chuck, his mother Mary (Linda Hamilton), and ally John Casey (Adam Baldwin) set out to find an antidote to the Norseman's effects, but when Chuck breaks into the prison holding Alexei, he discovers that elite agent Clyde Decker (Richard Burgi) has anticipated his move and relocated Alexei. To protect Alexei's true identity and conceal the government's botched experiment, Decker revokes Chuck's clearance to CIA facilities. With General Beckman's (Bonita Friedericy) aid, Chuck intercepts the transport carrying Alexei, only to find that Decker has deprogrammed Alexei and restored his previous identity and memories of Hartley Winterbottom. Hartley administers an antidote, but it fails to cure Sarah. Mary then remembers that Alexei had developed a stronger antidote, but it is stored at the Volkoff Industries Headquarters in Moscow, Russia. As they leave the hospital, Chuck, Casey, Mary, and Hartley are captured by Decker and taken to Castle, a government base under the big-box store Buy More, where Decker suppresses the Intersect in Chuck's mind. Casey helps Chuck and Hartley escape, giving Chuck discs containing clean fabricated identities for him and Sarah. Chuck and Hartley go to Volkoff Industries, and Hartley reveals to Vivian that he went undercover voluntarily, resulting in his transformation into the villainous Volkoff. Chuck gives up the discs from Casey so Vivian and her father can start a new life. Chuck returns with the antidote to Burbank, California, where Decker is waiting for him. A standoff occurs, but as Chuck is backed up by a superior force made up of his friends, family, the C.A.T. Squad (Mini And√©n and Mercedes Mas√∂hn), and Volkoff's Spetsnaz paratroopers, Decker is forced to stand down. Using the information about Alexei as leverage against Decker, Chuck delivers the antidote. The scene then changes to Chuck and Sarah's wedding, after which they receive a wedding present from Hartley. Two weeks later, Chuck returns from his honeymoon to a deserted Castle, where he learns from Decker that he has been manipulated his entire spy career, leading to him receiving the Intersect and facing Fulcrum, the Ring, Daniel Shaw, and Volkoff. It is then revealed that Hartley's gift was all of Volkoff Industries' assets, giving Chuck and Sarah almost a billion dollars. Chuck purchases the Buy More from the government's front company, and he, Sarah, Casey, and Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) set up their own freelance spy operation in Castle to investigate the conspiracy involving Chuck. Morgan then spots a pair of glasses in a box of Chuck's belongings sent from Beckman. Morgan puts them on and accidentally uploads an Intersect. Production \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\" was one of many episodes to be directed by producer Robert Duncan McNeill, and was written by Chris Fedak, who co-created the series, and Nicholas Wootton, both of whom serve as executive producers.\\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\" opening credits. (2011-05-16). Warner Bros. Television. Wootton credited at 07:47. It originally aired in the United States on May 16, 2011, on NBC as the 24th episode of Chuck fourth season and the 78th episode overall. The episode was filmed in April 2011 at North Hollywood Medical Center. Guest stars Linda Hamilton, Timothy Dalton, Lauren Cohan, Mekenna Melvin, Mini And√©n, and Mercedes Mas√∂hn reprised their recurring roles as Mary Bartowski, Alexei Volkoff, Vivian Volkoff, Alex McHugh, Carina Miller, and Zondra, respectively. The episode also introduced Richard Burgi as Clyde Decker, the CIA's \\"toughest\\" agent. Series co-creator Chris Fedak co-wrote this episode. Michael Ausiello had revealed in March 2011 that the fourth-season finale would be titled \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\". Chris Fedak later confirmed that the episode, as the title suggests, would have a cliffhanger ending leading into a fifth season. Fedak stated that cliffhangers tell \\"more story\\", citing The Empire Strikes Back and Batman Begins as examples. The season had suffered two major declines in viewership, one before \\"Chuck Versus the Push Mix\\", and another after three weeks of repeated episodes, and it was predicted that NBC would cancel Chuck before the fourth season ended, making \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\" the de facto series finale. However, a fifth and final season was ordered on May 13, 2011, and is set to premiere October 21, 2011. \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\" is one of the few episodes since season one's \\"Chuck Versus the Helicopter\\" not to feature the series' full credits sequence with the instrumental version of Cake's \\"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\\", instead displaying the main cast credits over action in the episode's second act. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall has called the episode a \\"tying together of everything the character [Chuck] and the show have been about\\", including the use of a recurring spy strategy, \\"The Magnet\\", to fool Decker. As Chuck and Sarah walk to their limousine, clips of their budding romance are shown through archive footage from several earlier episodes, including the pilot episode, \\"Chuck Versus the Intersect\\". Fedak stated in an interview that the inspiration for Volkoff's true identity being a gun-shy British scientist was Dalton's portrayal of Gregory Tuttle, Volkoff's guise as Mary Bartowski's MI6 handler, in \\"Chuck Versus the First Fight\\", his first appearance on the series. Chuck's quest to save Sarah serves as a reversal of \\"Chuck Versus Phase Three\\". Yvonne Strahovski is given limited screen time in the episode due to her character, Sarah, being in a coma. However, the episode is augmented with flashbacks taking place five days before the events of the episode, in which Chuck and Sarah deal with pre- wedding jitters by having their own rehearsal in their apartment. Thus, Chuck and Sarah's wedding vows are given added weight due to Sarah's being said early in the episode, and Chuck's being improvised from Sarah's. Fedak stated in an interview on the day of the episode's airing that \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\" marks a major transition in the series. As of the episode's ending, the main characters of the series are no longer government spies and no longer work for General Beckman; Chuck and Sarah have received an immense wealth; and Chuck has become the leader of a team to investigate a conspiracy involving his spy career. According to Fedak, the episode institutes a storyline in which the series returns to its roots. Morgan will be portrayed by Joshua Gomez much like Chuck was by Zachary Levi in the early seasons of the series: as a newcomer to the spy world due to the presence of the Intersect in his brain. Meanwhile, Chuck will be portrayed as Morgan's protector, much like Casey and Sarah were to him in past seasons. Music and cultural references United States President Ronald Reagan is referenced multiple times in this episode. Fedak revealed that the music for the season finale was completed the Wednesday night before the episode aired. The episode's soundtrack includes the songs \\"Here With Me\\" by Battleme when Chuck and Sarah are anxious about their wedding, \\"Conscience Killer\\" by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club while Chuck intercepts Alexei's transport, \\"Firewood\\" by Typhoon while Chuck and Sarah practice their vows, \\"I'm A Pilot\\" by Fanfarlo while Chuck rushes to administer the antidote, and \\"Sinking Friendships\\" by J√≥nsi during the wedding. Multiple references are made to former United States President Ronald Reagan. Upon seeing Casey's framed photograph of Reagan, Hartley asks, \\"Is he still in charge?\\", to which Casey replies, \\"If only!\\" Casey later comments, \\"That's smart. Real smart. Reagan smart.\\" Adam Baldwin stated that he established Casey's habit of referencing Reagan on the series. The CIA's Nighthawk motorcycle used in the episode alludes to Street Hawk. During Chuck and Sarah's wedding, Morgan, acting as the minister, claims to be ordained by the Intergalactic Federation of Planets, a reference to Star Trek. When Chuck asks him to close the partition in the limo after the wedding, Morgan responds, \\"As you wish!\\", referencing The Princess Bride. In archive footage from \\"Chuck Versus the Balcony\\", Sarah tells Chuck that she did not fall in love with James Bond. After Morgan downloads the Intersect, he says \\"Guys, I know kung fu\\", a reference to The Matrix. The series has featured variations on this line before, when Chuck downloaded versions of the Intersect in \\"Chuck Versus the Ring\\" and \\"Chuck Versus the Leftovers\\". When Sarah asks Chuck what was in the letter from Hartley he responds with \\"Oh boy!\\", a reference to the television show Quantum Leap. Quantum Leap featured Scott Bakula who also played Chuck's father Stephen J. Bartowski. When Clyde Decker video conferences with Chuck at the end of the episode, he says, \\"I guess this is the start of a new chapter, eh, boy?\\" Chuck responds with, \\"I'd watch that boy talk, redneck.\\" This is a reference to Blazing Saddles in which the main character says \\"I'd watch that boy shit, redneck.\\" Reception According to the Nielsen ratings system, \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\" drew 4.53 million viewers, with a 1.5/4 rating among those aged 18‚Äì49. The episode had the most viewers since \\"Chuck Versus the A-Team\\", making it the sixth least-watched episode in Chuck history to that point. The episode received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that \\"as Chuck began laying out his plan to be freelance spies, and as Morgan took out the Intersect sunglasses General Beckman had so thoughtfully hidden in Chuck's going-away box, all I could feel was gratitude: I'm so glad NBC ordered one more season, because that is a show I want to see!\\" Sepinwall praised Timothy Dalton's ability to deliver both a comic and serious performance, writing that, while on other series Volkoff's back-story \\"would be an incredibly dark, tragic storyline\\", Dalton acted well enough that his emotions were not overwhelming. Sepinwall continued that the storyline \\"would have sucked every last bit of joy out of the episode\\" if the character had been portrayed by another Chuck actor. In contrast, Sepinwall wrote that he felt no empathy for Volkoff's daughter, as \\"Lauren Cohan has never managed to make a cohesive and interesting character out of a bunch of jarring personality shifts\\". Brody Gibson of Boom Tron wrote,\\" The writers of Chuck sure know how to pull together a great finale. I was floored.\\" Gibson agreed with Sepinwall on Timothy Dalton's range of acting skills, praising Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski as well. Gibson wrote that Levi deserved an Emmy nomination for a scene in which Chuck surrenders himself to Vivian to plead for the antidote to save Sarah's life. Gibson also praised Levi and Strahovski's performance in Chuck and Sarah's \\"practice wedding\\": \\"These two have always had such great chemistry, you could swear they're actually in love and not just actors pretending.\\" Brittany Frederick of Starpulse.com wrote, \\"It wasn't the whiz-bang finale I was expecting after all the hype, but it was one that was true to what the show stands for, and that's good enough for me.\\" Like Sepinwall and Gibson, Frederick praised the performance by Levi and Dalton, writing, \\"Chuck's heartbreak and desperation were incredibly poignant throughout the bulk of the episode.\\" Like Gibson, Frederick also praised the scene depicting Chuck's surrender to Vivian, calling it \\"sniffle-inducing\\". Frederick continued that Dalton \\"plays Hartley Winterbottom with a great sincerity and vulnerability.\\" Frederick also called it \\"a great reward to the fans that the episode didn't cheat us out of the Chuck/Sarah wedding at all.\\" Frederick wrote, \\"While I'm not blown away by this finale, I still am satisfied with it, because it represents the values we've come to expect from Chuck: the ideas of hope, family, and sticking together in the face of the most adverse of circumstances.\\" Ryan McGee of The Onion A.V. Club rated the episode a B+ on an A+ to F scale, although criticizing its \\"mechanics\\". Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a rating of 9.5 out of 10, a series high alongside season two's \\"Chuck Versus Santa Claus\\" and \\"Chuck Versus the Colonel\\", season three's \\"Chuck Versus the Beard\\" and \\"Chuck Versus the Subway\\", and season five's \\"Chuck Versus the Kept Man\\" and \\"Chuck Versus the Goodbye\\". Goldman wrote, \\"Chuck had more ups and downs than usual this season, but it ended on a very strong note. With Sarah's life in danger, Chuck and all his friends and family proved they would risk everything to save her, and it made for a very compelling, involving hour.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Cliffhanger Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about weddings ","title":"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger"},{"id":"31637491","text":"Georgia Glastris (born August 1, 1992, in Chicago, Illinois, United States) is an American-born figure skater who competes for Greece.

Walker and Machine Gun Walker (October 6, 1917 ‚àí October 7, 2008), was an American police employee and World War II army veteran who is remembered for a violent series of thefts, burglaries, and shootouts with police in Los Angeles County, California, in 1945 and 1946, one of which resulted in a fatality.\\"Crazy Like A Fox\\", Los Angeles Times, June 2, 1947.\\"Man Continues to Fight Police Despite Wounds\\", Los Angeles Times, December 21, 1946. The film He Walked by Night was loosely based on Walker's 1946 crime spree. Early life Not much is known about Walker's early life. He was born Erwin Mathias Walker in 1917 to Weston and Irene Walker and was raised in Glendale, California. He lived with his parents and a sister. Although nearsighted, Walker was a good athlete. He would later be described as \\"gentle, affectionate, considerate above the ordinary for the welfare of others, and [giving] no trouble in any way.\\"People v. Walker, 33 Cal.2d 250, Crim. No. 4833 (December 29, 1948) Walker's father was a Los Angeles County flood control engineer, and his uncle Herbert V. Walker was a prominent Los Angeles lawyer and Chief Deputy District Attorney. Herbert Walker would later become a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge in the 1950s. He actually signed the final ninth death warrant for Caryl Chessman, the \\"Red Light Bandit,\\" in February 1960 on which Chessman was ultimately executed in the gas chamber on May 2, 1960. Walker graduated from the Hoover School and attended the California Institute of Technology for one year, excelling in electronics and radio engineering.Brayton, Tim, Cop Killer, February 8, 2009; retrieved April 30, 2011. Police and military service After he dropped out of Caltech, Walker worked as a radio operator and police dispatcher for the Glendale Police Department. During World War II, he was conscripted by Selective Service despite his poor eyesight because of his radio and electronics skills. Walker was stationed in Brisbane, Australia, where he attended the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) U.S. Army Officer Candidate School (OCS) at Camp Columbia, Wacol.South West Pacific Area OCS, st.net.au; accessed July 4, 2017. In 1944, Walker graduated from OCS and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. In June 1944, Walker received his first duty assignment. In November, he received orders transferring him to Leyte Island in the Philippines, where he was placed in charge of a Signal Corps radar detachment with 85 men.Brayton, Tim, Cop Killer, February 8, 2009; retrieved April 30, 2011. \\\\Walker was apparently well liked by the soldiers who worked with him, and he was reputed to be more than usually considerate of them. In later testimony, Walker related that upon arrival at Leyte, he and another officer, a close friend, selected the emplacement for the radar and took routine security measures but did not post a day guard because of standing orders. Walker was ordered to return to his ship. When he returned to the radar site the next day, he learned that elements of an elite Japanese Army paratroop unit had attacked the radar site at sunrise. He learned that John Brake of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, his closest friend, who was also his commanding officer and fellow Signal Corps OCS graduate, had been bayoneted in the neck and disemboweled in the initial assault. Brake survived, and after years of hospital care, managed to live a productive life, despite being paralyzed from the neck down, until his death in 1989. All other members of the unit who had remained at the initial site were killed and horribly mutilated in the barbaric rituals performed on them by their attackers, including disembowelment while still alive, removal of body parts while still alive, etc. The horror of what Walker and his team found upon their return to the site was enough to cause anyone to lose their minds.Signal Corps OCS records and personal interviews with John Brake. Although Walker and his men were not combat infantrymen, his unit was not reinforced after the initial assault, and the small detachment endured three days and nights of continuous battle with fanatical Japanese paratroopers, who inflicted many casualties. While a subsequent investigation found no dereliction of duty on the part of any of the officers in the detachment, Walker later testified that he felt responsible for what had happened. After the encounter on Leyte, Walker informed his commanding officer that he could not continue to serve and asked to return to the United States. He was released from active duty in the South Pacific in December 1944, but was promoted to first lieutenant in July 1945, three months after his arrival in the United States. According to his own later statements and those of his family, Walker returned from overseas duty deeply disturbed and convinced that he was responsible for the death of soldiers in his unit by not preparing defenses for his position. He later described his guilt over his best friend's death, which he believed might have been prevented if he had ordered his men to dig foxholes. Walker would later claim his guilt was intensified by the anger of the soldiers who had served with him but shunned him thereafter. He never again lived with his family, instead renting an apartment and living alone. His family said that he was morose, melancholy, taciturn, brooding, rough with small children, secretive, and difficult. He took several jobs but always quit them after a short time. He turned down an offer from the Glendale Police Department to return to his old job, reportedly because of the low pay. He was frequently seen with a machine gun. Initial crime spree Early in 1945, still on active duty as an Army First Lieutenant, Walker burglarized an auto repair garage, taking a set of tools, voltmeter, and radio tuner. In August 1945, he entered an Army Ordnance warehouse at night and stole seven 45-caliber Thompson submachine guns, twelve .45-caliber pistols, six .38-caliber revolvers, ammunition, holsters, and magazines.Man Continues to Fight Police Despite Wounds, Los Angeles Times, 21 December 1946: Police found one Thompson in a car Walker had abandoned at a crime scene, and six more stored in his apartment and in other cars at the time of his arrest. Walker was discharged from the Army in November 1945. During his first week of terminal leave, he stole an automobile, changed its license plates, and used it to transfer some of the stolen goods. He next broke into a clothing store and took several pieces of men's clothing. Walker next targeted the warehouses and offices of record and film companies, taking amplifiers, electronic equipment, records, movie projectors, recording turntables, cameras, and other equipment. He rented a garage, fitting it out as an experimental workshop. Using the garage as his base of operations, Walker continued to commit burglaries to pay his living expenses and acquire electronic equipment. His criminal spree eventually totaled more than a dozen armed robberies, safecracking, and burglaries, netting him a sum of approximately $70,000.Coates, Paul, Suspect In Highway Patrolman's Killing Shot and Seized in Battle, latimes.com; retrieved April 30, 2011. Walker later explained that his crimes were motivated by a desire to gather funds and equipment to build an electronic radar gun (which, by shooting a beam, would disintegrate metal into powder) so that he could force the government to pass legislation raising soldiers' pay. That would, in turn, increase the cost of war to a point that it could not profitably be waged.Cop Killer, February 8, 2009; retrieved April 30, 2011. Calling himself Paul C. Norris, Walker contacted Willard W. Starr, a sound engineer who bought and sold motion picture and sound recording equipment out of his home, to sell him a collection of commercial motion- picture equipment. Starr immediately suspected that the motion-picture equipment had been stolen and alerted the police. On April 25, 1946, LAPD Hollywood division detectives Lieutenant Colin C. Forbes, and his partner, Sergeant Stewart W. Johnson, staked out Starr's home to wait for the suspect's arrival. As Walker approached the house, the detectives emerged to confront him.In re Walker, 10 Cal. 3d 764, Crim. No. 16711, Supreme Court of California, February 14, 1974 Some reports refer to the sergeant's last name in the April 1947 shootout as Johnson, others as Jones.Coates, Paul, Suspect In Highway Patrolman's Killing Shot and Seized in Battle; retrieved April 30, 2011. Walker opened fire, and Forbes was hit in the abdomen at pointblank range after his own pistol jammed. Johnson wounded Walker in the stomach and left leg with at least two bullets from his .38-caliber service revolver. Despite his wounds, Walker escaped on foot using the labyrinth of storm drains under the city.Meister, Dick, Too Crazy To Die: The Story of Erwin \\"Machine Gun\\" Walker, The San Francisco Chronicle, April 15, 1998; retrieved April 30, 2011. Forbes and Johnson were both rushed to a hospital, where Forbes was found to have a .45-caliber bullet lodged against his spine. He recovered although doctors were unable to remove the bullet and had to leave it in place.Webb, Jack, and James Ellroy. The badge: true and terrifying crime stories that could not be presented on TV, from the creator and star of Dragnet, New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, (2005) pg. 103; Forbes returned to work each day carrying Walker's .45-caliber slug next to his spine. However, after years of all-night stakeouts and violent encounters with the LAPD, his health continued to deteriorate, and he was eventually forced to retire at the age of 46 on a pension of $300 per month. In May 1946, Walker committed another burglary by stealing rolls of safety- detonating fuse and priming cord. To open safes and break locks, Walker made his own explosive, nitroglycerine, by using fuming nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and glycerine. On June 5, 1946, Walker drove to a meat market at the corner of Los Feliz Boulevard and Brunswick Avenue in Glendale, California. According to Walker's court testimony, after severing the lock on the store with bolt cutters, he then put on his own padlock. Walker then hid the bolt cutters in an adjoining area, got into his car, and drove around the block to see if he had been observed. Not seeing anyone, he retrieved the bolt cutters and returned to his car, again driving around the block. Getting out of his car, Walker said he saw a person with a flashlight in the vicinity of where he had hidden the bolt cutters. He watched the person with the flashlight enter a car and drive it toward him. As the car drew opposite him, Walker recognized the person as a policeman. California Highway Patrol Officer Loren Cornwell Roosevelt, the one-time police chief of Arcadia, California, called Walker to his car and asked what he was doing in the neighborhood. Walker responded that he was going to see a girlfriend. The officer, sitting behind the steering wheel with a flashlight in his left hand and his right hand on the butt of his gun, asked the defendant for his identification. Walker stated that he slowly eased a loaded .45 automatic pistol from under his belt and pointed it at Officer Roosevelt, who drew his own police service revolver in response. Walker testified that he shot Officer Roosevelt twice, ducked, and ran, abandoning his own car and again escaping via the storm drains.People v. Walker, 33 Cal.2d 250, Crim. No. 4833 (December 29, 1948) According to detectives who interviewed him, Walker told a slightly different version of what happened at the time of his arrest, declaring that Officer Roosevelt had shot at him first, which forced Walker to duck and return fire, hitting Roosevelt twice. Walker then elaborated that Roosevelt had asked him to call an ambulance, and Walker responded that he would do nothing for him. The gunfire awoke residents in the area, who called police.Man Continues to Fight Police Despite Wounds, Los Angeles Times, December 21, 1946. According to later newspaper accounts, Officer Roosevelt returned fire but was apparently unable to place a radio call for help because of his wounds. Hit multiple timesOfficer Loren Cornwell Roosevelt profile, odmp.org; retrieved April 30, 2011. by .45-caliber bullets, Officer Roosevelt was rushed to a nearby hospital. Although badly wounded, Officer Roosevelt was able, before his death, to give both a physical description of his assailant and a different account of his encounter with Walker and the subsequent gunfight. Roosevelt told investigators that he was returning to his home in the early morning hours, he began a pursuit of a speeding vehicle on Los Feliz Boulevard, which slowed to a crawl after Roosevelt overtook the vehicle, at which time the driver opened fire without warning. While Walker stated that he shot Officer Roosevelt twice, later newspaper accounts stated that Roosevelt was hit by no fewer than nine .45-caliber bullets. If Officer Roosevelt's account of the shooting is correct, the fact that he was hit nine times at night by .45-caliber bullets strongly indicates that Walker actually shot Roosevelt from his car with a burst of automatic fire from a Thompson submachine gun.United States Army, Basic Field Manual 23-35, Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911 and M1911A1, War Department, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1940): The .45 M1911 army pistols that Walker had stolen held a maximum of eight rounds, and Walker gave no indication that he either reloaded his pistol or used a second handgun during the brief gunfight, claiming only that he shot Roosevelt twice. When Walker was arrested eight months later, police found one of his stolen cars rigged with a loaded Thompson submachine gun fixed in position to fire through the driver's door.United States Army, Basic Field Manual 23-40, Thompson Submachine Gun, M1928A1, War Department, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1947)United States Army, TM 9-215, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, October 10, 1942 (revised 1943): The M1 and M1A1 Thompsons predominantly used by Army forces in World War II utilized box magazines containing 20 or 30 rounds of .45 ammunition. Roosevelt died in hospital a few hours after the shooting. Walker's abandoned car was found to contain bolt cutters, a loaded Thompson submachine gun, a bag of tools, sap, sash cord, bell wire, hacksaw blades, hand drill, electric drill, crescent wrenches, pry bar, extension cord, hammer, pliers, wire cutters, nitroglycerine, adhesive tape, a percussion-type dynamite blasting cap crimped to a white blasting fuse, and a primer cord attached to the percussion cap. Following the fatal shooting of Officer Roosevelt, Walker abandoned safecracking and briefly worked at several jobs. He then experimented with making California license plates and drivers' licenses, which could be used in selling several cars that he had stolen. By December 1946, Walker was robbing liquor stores at gunpoint. Arrest and conviction Acting on a tip, police located Walker living at a duplex apartment at 1831¬Ω N. Argyle Avenue in Los Angeles.\\"Crazy Like A Fox\\", Los Angeles Times, June 2, 1947.Meister, Dick, \\"Too Crazy To Die: The Story of Erwin \\"Machine Gun\\" Walker\\", San Francisco Chronicle, April 15, 1998; retrieved April 30, 2011. At 2 a.m., December 20, 1946, three detectives (Officers Wynn, Donahue, and Rombeau) entered Walker's apartment by using a key provided by the owner. Walker, who had been asleep with a .45-caliber pistol at his bedside table, was caught reaching for a Thompson submachine gun on the bed beside him when the three detectives burst into the living room.\\"Man Continues to Fight Police Despite Wounds\\", Los Angeles Times, December 21, 1946 After a fierce struggle for the submachine gun in which the arresting officers twice shot Walker in the shoulder and broke the butt of a pistol over his head, Walker was finally handcuffed and arrested. According to the detectives, Walker stated: \\"All right, now, you have me. Do a good job.\\"In re Walker, 10 Cal. 3d 764, Crim. No. 16711, Supreme Court of California, February 14, 1974. Detective Donahue asked Walker why he killed the highway patrolman, to which Walker replied that he \\"had to.\\" When asked, \\"Did you shoot the two officers in Hollywood?\\" Walker answered, \\"Yes.\\" The officers saw that Walker was bleeding badly, and they attempted to make him comfortable by covering him and putting a pillow under his head. Officers testified that Walker stayed conscious throughout the arrest and transport to the hospital. Walker's apartment was filled with weapons, ammunition, and license plates; three cars that had been stolen by Walker were found nearby. Walker had apparently been expecting to be stopped by police again, as one of his stolen cars was fitted with a loaded Thompson submachine gun set to automatic fire and fixed in position so as to fire through the driver's door. At the hospital, Walker was found to have scars from bullet wounds, a souvenir of the April gun battle with Forbes' partner, Sergeant Stewart Johnson. Walker stated that he had treated those on his own. Police later obtained additional statements from Walker as he lay wounded on an ambulance stretcher on the way to the Georgia Street Receiving Hospital for emergency treatment.Rasmussen, Cecilian, \\"A Pioneering Public Hospital Checks Out\\", Los Angeles Times, October 2, 2005. Despite his wounds, Walker told one of the detectives that he had been stopped the previous week by two motorcycle patrolmen on Hollywood Boulevard for a minor traffic violation but had been given only a warning: \\"Lucky for them they didn't try to make me get out of the car. I had a submachine gun with me then. You might have had two more dead cops.\\" Detective Wynn would later testify at Walker's trial that on the morning of December 21, 1946, he talked with the petitioner for about an hour at the hospital, and Walker had made statements indicating that he murdered Officer Roosevelt during an attempt to commit a burglary, that Walker had committed the attempted murders of Detectives Forbes and Johnson in addition to various robberies and burglaries, and that his statements were freely and voluntarily made. At the time, Wynn testified that a stenographic reporter named Bechtel came and the conversation was repeated and transcribed in the hospital room at which a doctor and nurse were also present. The detective further testified that he visited Walker two days later at the hospital, where Walker again made admissions. Officer Forbes, who had been seriously wounded by Walker, testified that on December 28, 1946, he talked with Walker at the hospital, and the petitioner made various admissions to him as well. Detective Wynn told the court that on December 30, 1946, he again visited Walker as he was being prepared for transfer from the hospital to jail. Wynn stated that Walker \\"kept asking me for opiates\\" and asked the detective to request some from the doctor. Wynn said he tried to do so but that Walker's doctor refused. In response to a question about his condition, Walker told Wynn that he was \\"a little weak\\" but did not complain about any discomfort. En route to jail, Detective Wynn testified that he told Walker that he would like to film a reenactment of the killing of Highway Patrolman Roosevelt and asked if Walker had any objection to which Walker replied he would like to contact his attorney first, Mr. Gerald Frederick Girard of Hindin, Weiss & Girard in Los Angeles. Walker gave Wynn the attorney's card. Wynn stated that after he tried unsuccessfully to reach Girard, he asked if Walker had any objection to going to Griffith Park and Soledad Canyon to recover articles that Walker had left there. Walker stated \\"he didn't see anything wrong in that.\\" Wynn, Walker, and several officers proceeded to Griffith Park and Soledad Canyon, where the articles were duly recovered, and Walker made additional incriminating statements.\\" After Walker's arrest, his parents claimed a long history of insanity existed in both branches of the family. A great-great-great- grandfather went insane for nine months. A great-great-grand-uncle, great- great-grandfather, and great-grand-aunt also spent time in insane asylums. A great-grandfather committed suicide, as did a grand-aunt. A grandmother was confined at Patton State Psychiatric Hospital, while a grand-aunt had hallucinations. Finally, one of Walker's cousins was mentally retarded, while the cousin's father was a psycho-neurotic. Walker later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At his trial on June 2, 1947, Walker's attorney Gerald Frederick Girard cited Walker's previous excellent record, his war experiences, and a family history of mental illness (Walker's paternal grandfather had been confined to a state mental hospital for 32 years). Walker's parents, Weston and Irene L. Walker, testified in his defense. Mrs. Walker stated that Erwin was kind and affectionate while he was growing up but returned from the war as a depressed loner. However, the trial judge found Walker sane,People v. Walker, 33 Cal.2d 250, Crim. No. 4833 (December 29, 1948): Walker, through his attorneys, had previously waived a jury trial. noting that Walker himself testified at great length in the trial and demonstrating a mentality and scientific learning far above the average: \\"This is a case in which I feel my responsibility very greatly.... The defendant, of course, in his lengthy time on the witness stand here showed a high degree of intelligence. I seldom recall a more intelligent witness, a witness who gave clearer responses to the questions than did Mr. Walker. It is true that he had a war experience that, in the vernacular of the service men, might be termed 'rugged', but without analyzing it or comparing it too much, I would say that perhaps millions of his fellow Americans had experiences that were equally rugged during the war.... A killing in an attempt to perpetrate a burglary is murder of the first degree.... However, I believe that in addition to my finding that the killing of Loren Roosevelt was murder in the first degree as a matter of law, I feel that it was a deliberate killing, a purposeful killing on the defendant's part.\\" Walker was sentenced to death in the gas chamber. After a motion for a new trial and appeal to overturn Walker's conviction and death sentence were rejected in December 1948, Walker's father, Weston, committed suicide by hanging himself with a length of rope. Walker was sent to death row in San Quentin to await execution of his sentence. At San Quentin, he was diagnosed by a prison psychiatrist as having paranoid schizophrenia. On April 14, 1949, thirty-six hours before his scheduled execution, a corrections officer found Walker unconscious after an apparent suicide attempt in which Walker tried to hang himself with a radio headphone cord wrapped around his neck. He was successfully revived, and the execution was postponed indefinitely while a psychiatric examination was performed. Mental health treatment After his attempted suicide, Walker was examined by a psychiatric board, which delivered its report in April 1949. The examining board reported that Walker was agitated by fear of his impending death and was \\"negativistic, mute, fearful, and unresponsive and possibly reacting to hallucinations\\" and frequently lapsed into semi-unconsciousness. The psychiatrists determined Walker \\"does not know the difference between right and wrong,\\" thus making him insane under the legal standard of the day and ineligible for execution. His execution was postponed indefinitely. At his competency hearing, Walker was declared insane by a jury and committed to the Mendocino State Hospital in Talmage, California, where he would remain the next 12 years. When not receiving electroshock therapy and other treatments, Walker spent most of his time at Mendocino reading mostly chemistry textbooks. He remained aloof from the other patients, stating that \\"even dying in the gas chamber might have been preferable to having to be with these creatures.\\" In 1961, Walker was declared sane by a newly l-convened panel of psychiatric examiners. On March 28, 1961, in response to a clemency hearing appeal by Walker, Governor Pat Brown commuted Walker's death sentence to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. Walker was sent to the CMF State Prison Facility, Vacaville to serve out his sentence, where he continued studying chemistry while he worked in a laboratory on the prison campus. While Walker was a patient at Mendocino State Hospital until he was a prisoner at the Vacaville Medical Facility, he was a patient at Atascadero State Hospital, a maximum- security mental hospital located near Atascadero, California. He played the tenor saxophone with various musical groups in the hospital and was a talented musician although, as he said, \\"I have a little difficulty fingering the sax because of nerve damage caused by an old bullet wound.\\" Walker was reportedly well-liked by both patients and staff, and as a result, he was subsequently granted a \\"white card,\\" which permitted him access to hiking trails located outside the hospital building but within the boundaries of institutional property. He was concerned about eventually being sent back to death row and so he put together a back pack with food and escaped, walking several miles through nearby hills. A short time later, he was apprehended when he was discovered by two armed duck hunters near the Cuesta Grade area of Highway 101. Walker was returned to the hospital and his white card privileges revoked, but he re-established himself as a model patient and was recruited to be a mentor in a Senior-Junior Big Brother type program on Ward 21, which housed responsible adult men, mostly military veterans, and dysfunctional teenage boys. Walker continued to do well at Atascadero State Hospital until one day, without notice, he was given just a few minutes to get ready to be transferred back to the state prison system. He took time to make sure that the property he borrowed from other patients was returned and to say goodbye to many of his friends. Habeas corpus petitions and release on parole In 1970, Walker filed a habeas corpus petition with the Supreme Court of California, which was denied without a hearing. Walker filed a similar petition in the Solano County Superior Court and sought to have his 1947 trial set aside on several grounds, including an allegation that his 1946 confession had been made involuntarily. The case made its way on appeal once more to the Supreme Court of California, which decided the case in February 1974. While the Supreme Court failed to overturn Walker's conviction or grant him a new trial, it instructed the lower court to delete that portion of Walker's life sentence that excluded any possibility of parole, allowing him to apply to the California Adult Authority for parole and to have his parole application duly considered. Walker applied for parole in 1974, which was granted, and he was released from Vacaville. After a short stay at a halfway house, Walker was released from further parole restrictions. Immediately after leaving prison, he legally changed his name. After obtaining a job as a chemist, he disappeared from public view. Walker died in 2008. He Walked by Night In 1948, Eagle-Lion Films released a film that was loosely based on Walker's 1946 crime spree in Los Angeles, He Walked by Night. Walker's character, Roy Morgan, was played by actor Richard Basehart. The film was shot in a semidocumentary format on location in and around Los Angeles. In the film, Morgan is shot dead by police in one of the city's underground drainage tunnels as he attempts to shoot his way out of the police dragnet.

In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year.

The episode was written by Amanda Lasher and directed by Liz Friedlander. It originally aired on Monday, April 25, 2011 on the CW. Petty in Pink delves into the deteriorating friendship between Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) and Vanessa Abrams (Jessica Szohr), amends and reflections that Lily Humphrey (Kelly Rutherford) slowly absorbs as her house arrest soon makes her realize, Charlie Rhodes' (Kaylee DeFer) integration into the world of the Upper East Side, the continued dilemma that Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) faces as he continues to hold on to the burdening secret of his legacy as well as the impact it might cause to Raina Thorpe (Tika Sumpter), and the fairytale romance between Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and Louis Grimaldi (Hugo Becker). The episode drew positive reviews from critics with critical praise towards Leighton Meester, Penn Badgley, and Ed Westwick. Plot The opening montage shows Blair Waldorf preparing for her date with Louis, having received the heel that she gave him as a parting gift from Paris. Lily van der Woodsen (Kelly Rutherford) finds herself under house arrest in her apartment, spending time through online shopping and preparing the Pink Party, a cancer awareness charity event. As she makes her preparations, Anne Archibald (Francie Swift) arrives to tell Lily that the gift bags will be prepared at a different venue. Lily soon realizes that her incriminated status has caused her supposed friends to shun her. When Blair decides to skip a class and commands that her minions go take her class take notes for her. She keeps the identity of her date secret until Penelope (Amanda Setton) sends a tip to Gossip Girl that Blair has a secret date. Following a voice mail from Vanessa about Dan and Blair's kiss, Serena (Blake Lively) recruits Charlie to help her find information behind Dan and Blair's kiss, training Charlie in the methods of using Gossip Girl and receives word of Blair's date on her blog. At the loft, Rufus (Matthew Settle) inspires Dan to repair his friendship with Vanessa and leaves Dan, who finds himself on a job writing an article involving a royal that recently arrived in New York. Charlie finds herself on stakeout and sees Dan and Blair having a conversation at the restaurant counter. Charlie informs Serena of Blair and Dan's date but is unaware that Dan had left after Blair forces him out to make her date with Louis. Shortly, Serena arrives at the restaurant and realizes that Blair is dating Louis, shrugging off her suspicions that Dan and Blair are seeing each other. Insisting that she couldn't have mistaken Dan for someone else, Serena praises her work but Charlie excuses herself, saying that she'll be staying to scout out New York University. As Serena leaves, the audience sees Charlie using the Gossip Girl spotted map, looking for Dan. At the Empire Hotel, Raina finds herself troubled over the whereabouts of her mother and enlists that aid of a private investigator. Nate however, suspects something when he sees a change in Chuck's demeanor and follows Raina. Chuck later discovers that Raina is looking for her mother. Around NYU Dan calls Vanessa and patch their differences, inviting her over at the loft. Blair and Louis find themselves being tracked down by Lucien (Dominik Tiefenthaler), Louis' royal adviser, and Blair discovers that Lucien had bribed Dan on the pretense that he was interested in Dan's writing. Blair calls Dan and demands that he meet her at a store. Charlie continues her investigation of Dan and finds him with Blair, who plans her scheme to drive out Louis. Blair persuades Dan to stage a fake relationship at the Pink party thereby convincing Lucien to leave without Louis and for Blair to be able to spend time with him. Charlie takes a photo of Blair presenting a pink tie to Dan and sends it to Serena, who conspires with Eric and Rufus to have the Pink party moved at the van der Woodsen apartment. Serena decides to blackmail a party planner to keep an eye on Dan and Blair. The move complicates Dan and Blair's scheme as they both fear that Serena will find out about their scheme and misunderstand their intentions behind it. Nate and Raina proceed to leave for New Jersey after discovering that Raina's possible mother was there and Chuck decides to accompany them. At a diner, Nate, Chuck and Raina confront a waitress who fits her mother's description but finds a case of mistaken identity. Returning to the Empire Hotel, Chuck enlists the aid of his private investigator to investigate the events that lead to the death of Raina's mother. The transfer of the Pink party draws the ire of Lily's guests, especially Anne, who confronts Lily over the party transfer. Lily realizes that someone had moved the party and that none of the women whom she considered as friends consider her as a friend. Dan and Blair succeed in their scheme but are unaware that Charlie has been filming their kiss and sends it to Gossip Girl, who sends a blast to everyone at the party. Dan finds out that Charlie was responsible as he and Blair look for Serena. Serena tells Louis that Blair has been lying to him and Dan and Blair explain everything to her. Serena finds herself betrayed further conflict rises when Serena raises Blair's jealousy being the reason why she finds herself drawn to Dan until Blair berates Serena's arrogance and her need to be the center of attention. Blair leaves Serena to look for Louis. Unable to take the scrutiny, Lily disobeys her house arrest and goes down to the lobby, waiting for the police to arrive. The police arrive but Lily asks them to shut down the event, at the same time avoiding arrest. Charlie later arrives at Brooklyn to apologize to Dan, adding that everything had happened because of Vanessa's message to Serena. The closing montage shows Blair convincing Louis that she loves him and make their relationship public, Dan shutting out Vanessa and severing ties with her while letting Charlie stay for a drink, Serena calling Louis' driver, and Chuck watching the security tapes that recorded the night of Avery Thorpe's disappearance. Production=Filming Locations The phone call between Dan and Vanessa was filmed in on the 16th Street between Broadway Ave and Fifth Ave. Veselka is used on set to film the scene of a date between Blair and Louis as well as Charlie's look out for a possible affair between Blair and Dan. Fashion New York Magazine praised the Roger Vivier heel that Blair wore from the Paris story arc, calling it a \\"recap-worthy memory.\\" InStyle reported news of the clothing for the cast to wear for a cancer awareness-month themed episode that would host a pink party for the set. Blake Lively and Kaylee DeFer wore differing pink hued dresses of Marchesa and BCBG, respectively while Kelly Rutherford wore Redux gown. Leighton Meester would make another memorable outfit for InStyle wearing a pink dress designed by Oscar de la Renta and a Swarovski necklace. An Oscar de la Renta-designed gown had previously been used for the season's second episode, Double Identity that Meester had worn for the Paris story arc. For the scene involving a phone conversation between Dan and Vanessa, Jessica Szohr was dressed in a Matthew Williamson dress covered by a Christian Cota winter coat.

Corinthian capital. The Roman temple of Vic is an ancient Roman temple located in the uptown area of Vic (Street Pare Xifrer), in the heart of Osona, Catalonia (Spain). History The building dates from the early 2nd century, the golden age of the Roman Empire. Temples were a basic part of every Roman city, yet the location of this one was unknown until the late date of 1882. If it was still in use by the 4th- century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans under the Christian emperors. In the 11th century, the temple was literally covered by the structure of the Castle of els Montcada, which later became the residence of the Veguers and finally, the prison of Vic. It was not until 1882, during the demolition of the old castle, that the workers spotted the Roman temple in very good condition. However the portico is a reconstruction made following the discovery of the columns and capitals. Architecture Despite the many uses it saw, the condition of the temple is enough to let us imagine how it would have been originally.

Twitter accounts have also been used to spread news and opinions about the conflict, using pictures from mobile phones. For example, pro Assad Rana Harbi from Lebanon is one of the most popular persons using tweets to inform about the conflict development (using pictures from mobile phones). Visual media Between January 2012 and September 2013, over a million videos documenting the war have been uploaded, and they have received hundreds of millions of views. The Wall Street Journal states that the \\"unprecedented confluence of two technologies‚Äîcellphone cams and social media‚Äîhas produced, via the instant upload, a new phenomenon: the YouTube war.\\" The New York Times states that online videos have \\"allowed a widening war to be documented like no other.\\" Prominent videos include the rebel commander Abu Sakkar cutting organs from the dead body of a Syrian soldier and putting one of them in his mouth, \\"as if he is taking a bite out of it\\". He called rebels to follow his example and terrorize the Alawite sect, which mostly backs Assad. Propaganda Since the start of the war, all sides have used the media to try to discredit their opponents and show them in their worst possible light. On the other hand, not all situations have been shown in the worst possible light. Syria is ranked the third most repressive country in the world in terms of press freedom by the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the 4th most repressive by Reporters Without Borders. Propaganda has been used by the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), the official government news agency, often refers to the FSA and ISIS as \\"armed gangs\\" or \\"terrorists\\"‚Äîwhile other media sources maintain that only part of the opposition are 'extremists'. President Assad has characterized the opposition as armed terrorist groups with Islamist \\"takfiri\\" extremist motives, portraying himself as the last guarantee for a secular government form. Former employees have said that Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA)'s role was to \\"fabricate, make deceptions and cover up for Bashar al-Assad's crimes\\" and that television interviews sometimes use government supporters 'disguised as locals' who stand near sites of destruction and claim that they were caused by rebel fighters. Al-Jazeera has aolso been accused of biased coverage. The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir cited outtakes of interviews showing that the channel's staff coached Syrian eyewitnesses and fabricated reports of oppression by Syria's government. It refers to leaked internal e-mails suggest that Al Jazeera has become subordinated to the Qatari emir's assertive foreign policy, which supports Syria's rebels and advocates military intervention in the country. In March 2012, Al Jazeera correspondents Ali Hashim and two others resigned from their jobs because of objections over the reporting on the conflict. They reported that Al Jazeera paid $50,000 for smuggling phones and satellite communication tools to Syria's rebels. Hashim concluded, \\"The channel was taking a certain stance. It was meddling with each and every detail of reports on the Syrian revolution.\\" Ahmad Ibrahim, who is in charge of the Al Jazeera's coverage on Syria, is the brother of a leading member of the opposition Syrian National Council. Al Jazeera reportedly put pressure on its journalists to use the term \\"martyr\\" for slain Syrian rebels, but not pro- government forces. In January 2013, a former news editor at Al Jazeera, who was from Syria, and had been at Al Jazeera for \\"nearly a decade\\" was fired without cause given, but in an interview stated their belief that it was linked to his/her resistance of ongoing strong pressure to conform to biased coverage of the Syrian civil war. The former editor stated that the Muslim Brotherhood was \\"controlling the Syrian file at Al-Jazeera\\" with both organizations biasing news coverage in favour of the Brotherhood ousting the Syrian government of Assad by force and warning the then-editor \\"the majority [in Syria] is with the Muslim Brotherhood and [taking power] is within our grasp\\" so \\"thank your god if you get a pardon when we become the government.\\" The source named the names of several other former employees who resigned in protest, including director of the Berlin bureau Aktham Sleiman, a Syrian, \\"who was, at the beginning, with the [Syrian] opposition\\" but resisted what the interviewee terms the \\"lies and despicable [political and ethnic] sectarianism\\" and concluded that \\"Al-Jazeera has lied and is still lying\\" about Syria and in favour of armed overthrow and of the Muslim Brotherhood.An exclusive interview with a news editor of Al-Jazeera Channel at AxisOfLoginAn exclusive interview with a news editor of Al-Jazeera Channel at FilmBoxOffice In 2016, it was revealed through emails of Hillary Clinton that Google and Al- Jazeera planned to encourage defections from the Syrian government, through various internet tools that disseminate information. Hoaxes Both sides have been distributing on social media videos and photos of violence, while falsely claiming that the atrocities had been committed by the opposition: later it turned out to be footage from conflicts in other countries. Examples: * A Gay Girl In Damascus, a 2011 blog written by an American posing as a gay girl in Damascus. *\\"Syrian Hero Boy\\", a 2015 viral video showing a Syrian boy rescuing a girl under gunfire, watched online by millions of viewers, was faked by a Norwegian film crew, according to its director. Posted on YouTube, the \\"Syrian Hero Boy\\" video from 00m00s to 1m06s was shot on location in Malta in the summer of 2014 with professional actors, directed by 34-year-old Norwegian Lars Klevberg, who hoped to provoke debates about media distortion and context children in war zones. *In 2011, the 18-year-old Zainab Alhusni was claimed to have been taken in Syrian custody and later killed and mutilated, due to her brother being an activist. Her family held a funeral, but she later turned out to be alive, and had run away from home because her brothers beat her.[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/05/world/meast/syria-woman- alive/ CNN}  Attacks on journalists  It has been maintained that, by October 2012, 'more than hundred professional or citizen journalists' had reportedly been killed in the Syrian Civil War. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 13 journalists were killed in work-related incidents during the first eighteen months of the uprising. N.B. According to the organisation, no journalists were killed in Syria between 1992 and the start of the uprising. During the same period, Reporters Without Borders said a total of 33 journalists were killed. The Sunday Times contributor Marie Colvin was killed by an explosion during the battle of Homs, but at least one, French journalist Gilles Jacquier, was killed by rebel mortar fire. Except for those selected by the Syrian government, journalists have been banned from reporting in Syria. Those who have entered the country regardless have been targeted. Within a month of the protests taking off, at least seven local and international journalists were detained, and at least one of them was beaten. 'Citizen journalist' Mohammed Abdelmawla al-Hariri was arrested in April 2012, tortured in prison, and sentenced to death in May 2012 for giving an interview for Al Jazeera. Jordanian Salameh Kaileh was tortured and detained in deplorable conditions before being deported.  NBC News team kidnapping  On 13 December 2012, NBC News reporter Richard Engel and his five crew members, Aziz Akyava≈ü, Ghazi Balkiz, John Kooistra, Ian Rivers and Ammar Cheikh Omar, were abducted in Syria. Having escaped after five days in captivity, Engel said he believed that a Shabiha group loyal to al-Assad was behind the abduction, and that the crew was freed by the Ahrar ash-Sham group five days later. Engel's account was however challenged from early on. In April 2015, NBC had to revise the kidnapping account, following further investigations by The New York Times, which suggested that the NBC team \\"was almost certainly taken by a Sunni criminal element affiliated with the Free Syrian Army,\\" rather than by a loyalist Shia group.

The dress now belongs to the British Royal Collection and is part of a collection of royal wedding dresses at Kensington Palace in London. Background Mary of Teck at her wedding to Prince George, Duke of York In 1891, the bride's mother, the Duchess of Teck, had declared that her daughter's wedding dress and those of her bridesmaids would be manufactured entirely in Britain. This was likely because the Duchess was president of the Ladies' National Silk Association. Upon the announcement of the engagement of Princess May (as she was usually known) to Prince George, Duke of York in spring 1893, Arthur Silver (of the Silver Studio), was approached to design the gown. Silver had designed the dress for Princess May‚Äôs intended wedding to George's older brother, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in 1892. This ‚ÄòLily of the Valley‚Äô creation had been made public just days before the Duke of Clarence's untimely death in January 1892 but had to be completely abandoned. The design chosen for the York-Teck wedding was ‚ÄòThe May Silks‚Äô; the dress would feature embroidery of the emblems of a rose, shamrock and thistle, and be trimmed with the traditional orange blossom and true lovers knots. Silver, renowned for his Art Nouveau designs, was also said to be much influenced by Japanese art in his designing. In March 1893, the Duchess and Princess visited the Warner & Sons‚Äô factory at Hollybush Gardens in Spitalfields,\\"What the Royal Mary wore\\", The News and Courier (excerpted from the Philadelphia Evening Telegraph), July 9, 1983. London and commissioned them to make the finest white silk with silver-thread by Albert Parchment in time for the July wedding. Design Painting by Laurits Tuxen The dress itself was put together by Linton and Curtis of Albemarle Street. The front of the dress was made of white satin, featuring three small flounces old Honiton lace which had been used on the wedding dress of her mother. The bodice, cut at the throat, was long and pointed and was made of Silver's white and silver brocade, also featuring a small amount of her mother's Honiton lace near the top and on the upper part of the sleeve. The rich satin manteau de cour fell from her shoulders. The train was long and plain (although The Times reported there was none) and the veil of her mother's which she wore was also made of Honiton lace, fastened by diamond pins given as a gift from Queen Victoria. Matching the orange blossom elements to the dress, small wreaths were placed all the way around the bust and on the hair. Princess Mary completed the wedding outfit with a diamond tiara from Queen Victoria; diamond rivi√®re necklace from the Prince and Princess of Wales and diamond earrings and anchor brooch, a wedding gift from Prince George. Out of all of the wedding toilette, the veil was reportedly the only piece that was not worn again after the wedding. The official painters of the royal wedding were Heinrich von Angeli, Laurits Tuxen, and Luke Fildes.

Engraved by S Reynolds after F Lock. Pair of white satin shoes worn by Queen Victoria on her wedding day Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom married her cousin Prince Albert of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha on 10 February 1840. She chose to wear a white wedding dress, which was considered an unusual choice at a time when colours were more usual,Otnes, Cele and Pleck, Elizabeth (2003). Cinderella Dreams: The Allure of the Lavish Wedding, p.31. University of California Press made from heavy silk satin. The Honiton lace used for her wedding dress proved an important boost to Devon lace-making. Queen Victoria has been credited with starting the tradition of white weddings and white bridal gowns, although she was not the first royal to be married in white. Design The lace was designed by William Dyce, head of the then Government School of Design (later known as the Royal College of Art), and mounted on a white satin dress made by Mary Bettans. The plain, cream-colored satin gown was made from fabric woven in Spitalfields, east London, and trimmed with a deep flounce and trimmings of lace hand-made in Honiton and Beer, in Devon. This demonstrated support for English industry, particularly the cottage industry for lace. The handmade lace motifs were appliqu√©d onto cotton machine-made net. Orange blossoms, a symbol of fertility, also trimmed the dress and made up a wreath, which Victoria wore instead of a tiara over her veil. The veil, which matched the flounce of the dress, was four yards in length and 0.75 yards wide. Victoria's jewelry consisted of a necklace and earrings made of diamonds presented to her by the Sultan of Turkey, and a sapphire cluster brooch given to her by Albert a day earlier. The slippers she wore matched the white color of the dress. The train of the dress, carried by her bridesmaids, measured in length. Queen Victoria described her choice of dress in her journal thus: \\"I wore a white satin dress, with a deep flounce of Honiton lace, an imitation of an old design. My jewels were my Turkish diamond necklace & earrings & dear Albert's beautiful sapphire brooch.\\" After the wedding=Reenactments While photography existed in 1840, the techniques were not yet fully developed. A series of photographs taken by Roger Fenton on 11 May 1854 of Victoria and Albert are often described as wedding or reenactment photographs, with the dress identified as her wedding dress. The Royal Collection has refuted these interpretations, stating that the images are the first photographs to show Victoria as a queen, rather than as a wife or mother, and that she and Albert are wearing court dress., cited on In 1847, Victoria commissioned Franz Xaver Winterhalter to paint a portrait of her wearing her wedding clothes as an anniversary present for Prince Albert. The portrait was also copied as an enamel miniature by John Haslem. Queen Victoria's wedding lace Victoria revisited the lace-makers to create the royal christening gown worn by her children, including Albert Edward (the future Edward VII). This gown was worn for the christening of all subsequent royal babies until the baptism of James, Viscount Severn in 2008, when a replica was used for the first time. As a mark of support for the Honiton industry, in addition to often wearing their lace on her and her children's clothes, Victoria insisted her daughters also order Honiton lace for their wedding dresses. Victoria also wore her wedding lace mounted on the dresses she wore to the christenings of her nine children (except for Albert Edward's, for which she wore her Garter robes). She also wore it to the weddings of two of her children, her eldest daughter, Victoria, in 1858, and her youngest son, Leopold, in 1882. Her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was permitted to wear it as part of her wedding gown in 1885. Victoria also wore the lace to the wedding of her grandson George (the future George V) to Mary of Teck in 1893, and for her Diamond Jubilee official photograph in 1897. When Victoria died, she was buried with her wedding veil over her face. In 2012 it was reported that while the dress itself had been conserved and displayed at Kensington Palace that year, the lace was now too fragile to move from storage. Influence Wearing white was quickly adopted by wealthy, fashionable brides. Less than a decade later, Godey's Lady's Book would incorrectly claim that white wedding gowns were an ancient custom reflecting a bride's virginity, writing \\"Custom has decided, from the earliest ages, that white is the most fitting hue, whatever may be the material. It is an emblem of the purity and innocence of girlhood, and the unsullied heart she now yields to the chosen one\\", even though white had been a distinctly uncommon choice for bridal gowns before Victoria's wedding and was not chosen by a majority of brides until decades later. Following the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, comparisons were drawn between the bride's white wedding dress and Queen Victoria's own.

The advantage over previous probes is that the IceMole can change its direction and can be recovered after being used. A driving ice screw allows the probe to drill through soil layers and other contaminations in the ice. History The IceMole is being developed using rapid prototyping. , the probe is in its first prototype and it has been designed to carry out the subsurface investigation of terrestrial glaciers and ice shields. It is planned that future versions of the probe would be suitably adapted for extraterrestrial ice research, e.g. on the polar caps of Mars, the Jovian moon of Europa, or Saturn's moon Enceladus. The robot resulted from a student project at the Fachbereich Luft- und Raumfahrttechnik (Faculty of Aerospace Engineering) at the FH Aachen, led by Prof. Dr. Bernd Dachwald. The excavation is carried out by both drilling and melting of the ice. In a clean ice core, the probe can analyze the surrounding ice with measuring instruments. While drilling, the surrounding ice is not biologically contaminated. , the project objectives are given as: The project requirements also emphasised the need for maximum reliability, robustness, mobility, environmental security and autonomy. IceMole 1 Heated tips in probes have been employed since the 1960s but the probes could only drill straight down, could not be recovered from deep intrusions and were halted by buildup of dirt and sediment, which would not permit heat transfer. To overcome these problems, the IceMole combines a screw with a melting tip. The first prototype IceMole is a pencil-shaped craft that is designed to autonomously deploy and dig itself into ice. It is a square tube of cross section. It has a melting head at the tip which has differential heating in different parts. The robot is powered by a power generator on the surface and is attached by means of a cable, which relays the power supply, communication and data signals. The IceMole utilizes a long screw at its heated head that keeps firm contact while drilling with the ice being melted. The IceMole has separately controllable heating elements that can be manipulated to obtain differential heating. The differential heating permits the gradual change of direction. Interior view of the melting probe IceMole1 The ice screw is located at the tip of the melting head and generates a driving force that presses the melting head against the ice. This enables the IceMole to penetrate soil and mud and also leads to a good conductive heat transfer when in contact with the ice. The thermally isolated ice screw transfers ice into the probe, where it can be analyzed in situ. It is planned that instruments will be fitted in the probe that will analyse the ice and send only the results to the surface. The technical specifications of IceMole1 are given below : The IceMole team has developed the vehicle without a specific payload in mind. The vehicle has an inner chamber in which sensors and other instruments may be housed. In its recent tests, the IceMole carried an off-the-shelf camera. The team is also designing a fluorescence biosensor detector that could search for organic molecules in the ice. IceMole 2 Exterior view of the new design IceMole2 Since October 2010, the IceMole-Team is working on a redesign of the first IceMole. The Improvements are, amongst others, the optimization of the melting head and a completely newly developed gear. The new melting head has 12 separately controlled heating elements. These 12 cartridge heaters are arranged in a ring inside of the melting head. In addition, it has 2 wall heaters on each side in the rear of the probe. With this addition, the IceMole2 maneuverability improves over that of its predecessor. The new gear has been specially developed for this probe. Thus, the transmission has a higher efficiency and is more lightweight. It is planned to test IceMole2 in the summer of 2012. The planned technical specifications of IceMole2: The probe has also been designed to drag a series of containers containing sensors which can be jettisoned on command and deployed permanently in specific locations in the ice. The team hopes to eventually work with other researchers that would use IceMole to drop sensors deep in icy environments. While the power supply for the first field trials on a glacier was provided by an external power generator on the surface, it is also planned that the heating power be provided by an on-board power source. Trials The first field trials were carried out in the area of the Morteratsch Glacier in Switzerland during the summer of 2010. During the trials on the glacier, the following penetration tests have been successfully performed: * melting 45¬∞ upwards for against gravity; * melting horizontally for ; * melting 45¬∞ downwards for , thereby penetrating three obstructing non-ice layers (mud and sand found on the glacier) and driving a curve with a radius of . Image:IceMole_transport.JPGTransport of the equipment to the Morteratsch Glacier by a helicopter. Image:IceMole in action.JPGIceMole moves 45¬∞ upwards against gravity. Image:IceMole melting channel.JPGThe melting channel seen aligned upwards. While IceMole moved at a leisurely per hour during its first trial run, optimal conditions could allow the craft to progress at more than three times that speed. The penetration speed will be increased for the next prototype. The test results show that the IceMole concept is a viable approach to deliver scientific instruments into deep ice and to recover them afterwards. Another advantage of the IceMole with respect to drilling is that biological contamination can be minimized and the process can be made highly autonomous, so that there is no need for an operator on the surface. The results were reported at the 2011 Antarctic Science Symposium in Madison, Wisconsin and the European Geosciences Union 2011 held at Vienna, Austria. The next trial run was scheduled to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2012. Mission scenario for 2012: Dig a vertical \\"U\\" The planned objectives for the field experiment in 2012 are given below. 2014 test at Blood Falls Blood Falls was used as the target for testing IceMole in November 2014. This unusual flow of melt water from below the glacier gives scientists access to an environment they could otherwise only explore by drilling (which would also risk contaminating it). Its source is a subglacial pool, of unknown size, which sometimes overflows. Biogeochemical analysis shows that the water is marine in source originally. One hypothesis is that its source may be the remains of an ancient fjord that occupied the Taylor valley in the tertiary period. The ferrous iron dissolved in the water oxidizes as the water reaches the surface, turning the water blood red. The test returned a clean subglacial sample from the outflow channel from Blood Falls. Subglacial environments in Antarctica need similar protection protocols to interplanetary missions, and the probe was sterilized to these protocols using hydrogen peroxide and UV sterilization. Also, only the tip of the probe sampled the liquid water directly.

Construction The steamboat Comet, whose name was said to have been \\"misleading\\", was built in Seattle in 1871 by Capt. Simon F. Randolph (d.1909). Comet was constructed in an unusual fashion. Randolph built the vessel upside down by picking a flat area of ground, marking out the shape of the boat on the ground, and driving in posts at regular intervals to act as ribs. He then connected the ribs with crossbeams, bent planks around the posts and over the crossbeams, and had the hull complete, although upside down. With the posts still affixed in the ground, the vessel looked like a potlatch house. Randolph then sawed off the posts, and pushed the hull out into the water. He then flipped the hull over using rocks piled on one side as an assist. The resulting hull was right-side up, but full of water. Randolph then beached the hull, pumped out the water with a home-made wooden pump, and the hull was complete. The steam engines Randolph installed were described as \\"non-descript and mismatching\\" and the upper works were said to have been tall and barn-like.Newell, Ships of the Inland Sea, at 69-71, and 82.

Brownfield (b. 1850) until 1876 or later, and was the first steamer to be successful on that route, which included service to farmlands on the Black River. Comet then was shifted to run almost every route out of Seattle. Under Captain Brownfield, Comet was a pioneer vessel on the Nooksack River. Capt. George A. Cushman (d.1891), who built the steamer Lillie, also for the White River route, was in command of Comet for a long time.Wright, ed., Lewis and Dryden Marine History, at 161, 182, 193, 244, 253, 395 .

Together with kango () and gairaigo (), they form one of the three main sources of Japanese words (there is also elaborate Japanese sound symbolism, of mimetic origin). They are also known as . The word \\"yamato kotoba\\" itself is composed of native Japanese words, and hence is an autological word. The synonym wago is instead a kango, and hence a heterological word.  Lexical function  Yamato kotoba form a fundamental part of the Japanese lexicon, similar to native words (from Old English) in English ‚Äì while borrowed words are used for many technical terms (particularly kango, as with Latin and Greek in English), or for modern or stylish purposes (mostly gairaigo, as with French in English), much of the core vocabulary and commonly used everyday words are of native origin. As exhibited in the synonyms yamato kotoba/wago, there are often many synonyms from different origins, usually with differences in usage. Very roughly, kango are generally more formal, often restricted to writing, while yamato kotoba are more casual and more often used in speech, but both types of words are commonly used in both speech and writing. In Japanese names, the family name is generally formed from yamato kotoba, as in (yama-shita, mountain-bottom), (oo-oka, big-hill), and (ko-bayashi, small/little-forest), while given names are quite diverse.  Phonology  Yamato kotoba are generally polysyllabic (often three or more syllables), and more closely follow the CV (consonant-vowel, CVCVCV) pattern of Old Japanese. By contrast, kango are often one or two syllables, and more often have terminal consonants, y≈çon, and long vowels.  Grammatical function  Yamato kotoba function differently grammatically than borrowed words. While borrowed words can be nouns, which can function as verbs via adding the auxiliary verb , or function attributively via -na or -no, with rare exception (such as the verb , from the French word \\"sabotage,\\" or , from \\"(to) google\\"), borrowed words cannot become true Japanese verbs (- or -verbs) or adjectives (-adjectives) ‚Äì these are closed class. Japanese adjectives and grammatical words (notably particles) are also yamato kotoba. Japanese has a great many compound verbs, such as (machi-awaseru, to rendezvous, from + ), which are formed from native verbs, not borrowings. However, in nouns, native Japanese roots and Chinese borrowings (and in some cases more modern European borrowings) can combine.  Numbers  For most purposes, Japanese uses Chinese numbers, rather than native numbers. However, native numbers are often used for counting numbers of items up to 10 ‚Äì as in hitotsu, futatsu, mittsu (one item, two items, three items), notably days on the calendar, and with other Japanese counter words ‚Äì and for various exceptions (fossils). These exceptions include , , , and .  Writing  Yamato kotoba are often written in a mixture of kanji and hiragana. Grammatical words are written using hiragana (there is often a traditional kanji, which is today rarely used), as are the inflectional ends of verbs and adjectives, which are known as okurigana. Content words (nouns, roots of verbs and adjectives) are generally written in kanji with kun'yomi, with the meanings of the kanji used corresponding to the meaning of the word. However, the word may be written in hiragana, particularly if the kanji are uncommon. Further, some yamato kotoba are written using unrelated kanji (used only for their sound value), which is known as ateji, or using kanji whose meaning is correct but whose sounds are not, which is known as jukujikun. Katakana is generally not used for yamato kotoba, but can be used for emphasis (especially for mimetic words), and for legibility when spelling out a word.

After beginning his career as a landscape painter, he became a renowned history painter as well as a confidant to King Louis-Philippe I and an official court painter. He belonged to the Girardet family of artists.Sylvain Bauhofer (1998): Life He was born as Charles Girardet in Le Locle, a part of the French Republic as the eldest son of the lithographer Charles-Samuel Girardet. After 1822, he lived in Paris, where he trained as a painter with Louis Hersent and L√©on Cogniet. On a study trip to Switzerland in 1833‚Äì35, he made the acquaintance of the aristocratic painter Maximilien de Meuron, by whose influence he obtained commissions for two panoramas of Lausanne. In 1836, he presented his first exhibits in the Salon of Paris and started working as a copyist for the French royal court. An alpine landscape presented at the 1837 Salon obtained him a first distinction, and he successfully collaborated with Cogniet on two great battle scenes exhibited at Versailles. He embarked on travels across Europe, filling his sketchbook with landscapes in D√ºsseldorf (1838), Tyrol and Croatia (1839), and Italy (1840). A painting of a Protestant Assembly at Neuchat√™l, Assembl√©e de Protestants surprise par des troupes catholiques (1839‚Äì42), earned him another distinction at the 1842 Salon and regular commissions by the Neuch√¢tel Friends of Art. The Reception of George Catlin's Indian Museum, one of Girardet's works as court painter. In 1839, Girardet illustrated his first book, Roland furieux, followed by Jardin des plantes by Boitard in 1842. After a six-month stay in Egypt, 1844, he continued illustrating works including Thiers's famous Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire, and completed several royal commissions for paintings of state occasions. Drafted into the National Guard, Girardet witnessed the fall of the monarchy in July 1848 and fled to Brienz, Switzerland, where he painted landscapes. In 1850, he returned to France to illustrate a great work edited by Alfred Mame about the history and the monuments of the Touraine. This work obtained a first-class medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1855 and earned Girardet many more commissions by Mame, notably for children's books and pious works. In 1857, he moved his studio to the Montmartre quarter, where he would live until his death, and was admitted as a member of the Royal Academy of Amsterdam. He continued to embark on study trips, such as to the Valais (1858‚Äì1860), Italy (1861‚Äì1862) and Brunnen (1869). In 1870, caught in besieged Paris during the Prussian invasion of France, Girardet damaged his eyesight while sketching the Prussian positions. Seized by anguish, fearing blindness, he died, alone in his apartment, of suffocation. He was unmarried, but had lived many years with a woman painter, Augustine Angelina Kaas, for whom he had provided a pension. His family inherited the remainder of his estate, some 100,000 francs. Work Girardet's art belongs to the tradition of Romanticism and to the popular movement in landscape painting called the \\"School of 1830\\". His landscapes, based on sketches often completed under adverse weather conditions and within one hour, exhibit a rare vivacity and mastery of subtle color, especially after his 1850 stay in Brienz. Unlike his friends and colleagues Maximilien de Meuron and Rodolphe T√∂pffer, he was not enchanted by the snow- capped peaks of the Alps, preferring instead to portray lakes, streams and marshes, notably the rivers Aar, Eure and Marne. Girardet sought official recognition through his historical paintings. Of these, his Assembl√©e de Protestants was his most lasting success; its pathos and deliberate composition are reminiscent of Paul Delaroche's work. Later in his life, deprived of royal patronage by the political upheavals in France, his historical paintings met with little success, and he shifted his attention back to landscape painting, which he continued to exhibit in the Salon until the end of his life. As a man of modest means, Girardet had little leisure to devote to his art and was compelled to earn money mainly as an illustrator. On his many voyages, he drew small ethnographical reports for the illustrated press; these and the illustrations he drew for luxury albums nourished his visual imagination. After 1855, he abandoned the Orientalist themes that had contributed to his success; and in his late period, as a diligent craftsman, he dedicated himself to the themes and formats in vogue with his bourgeois clients. Girardet's success inspired many other French-speaking Swiss artists, and it helped Swiss art and Swiss landscapes gain recognition with a broad international public. Many of his works are exhibited in the Mus√©e d'art et d'histoire of Neuch√¢tel and in the Mus√©e national de Versailles.

The boys were forced to write suicide notes prior to death, forced to eat broken glass and nails, and subsequently buried in the Sooriyakanda mass grave. After a three year trial into the disappearances of the students, the High Court of Ratnapura, found Dayananda Lokugalapaththi and several military personal of the army camp were found guilty of numerous offences under the Penal Code and sentenced to prison terms of ten years. Since the bodies of the students were not discovered, they were not charged of murder. The third accused, Brigadier Liyanage was acquitted on the basis there was no direct evidence against him and his acquittal was not appealed by the State Prosecutor. Based on this judgment, Brigadier Liyanage appeal to the Supreme Court, the denial of his promotion to the rank of Major General after he was recommended by the Commander of the Army following his acquittal by the High Court. The Supreme Court found that promotion of other officers in the chain of command during the incident were promoted, it ordered that the recommendation of the Commander of the Army be carried out and compensation given. The Defence Secretary had later reported that the promotion can not be carried out due to the President of Sri Lanka in her capacity as the Commander in Chief, refused to accept the recommendation for promotion and Liyanage had already retired as a Brigadier. Liyanage's appeal to the Supreme Court on this matter resulted in the court stating that it can do no more.

Life  Titlepage of Luther‚Äôs Das new Testament, printed by Petri in 1525 Petri was born ca. 1454 in Langendorf near Hammelburg. Like his uncle Johannes Petri, he moved to Basel where he resided from around 1480 and worked as a printer. In 1507 he received Basel citizenship rights. The following year he married Anna Selber, a member of a Basel burgher family. His firm began to grow in prominence after he took over the printshop of his uncle Johannes in 1509. Petri was one of the first printers in Basel who worked with illustrators. His books were illustrated by the likes of Urs Graf, Hans Holbein the Younger, and Conrad Schnitt among others. He also employed a number of prominent collaborators as writers, editors and proofreaders including Konrad Pellikan, the young Sebastian M√ºnster, Beatus Rhenanus, Ulrich Hugwald and his relative Johannes Petreius. Petri chiefly printed devotional literature and works of practical theology. After 1517 his printshop was primarily occupied with the publication of texts of the Protestant Reformation. Of the more than 300 publications from the Offizin Adae Petri, there are more than 88 editions of Martin Luther. He also published works of other German reformers like Johannes Bugenhagen, Hartmuth by Cronberg, Philipp Melanchthon, Andreas Karlstadt and a few titles by the Swiss Reformers Huldrych Zwingli, Joachim Vadian and Johannes Oecolampadius. His edition of Jan Hus, which appeared under the title Liber egregius de unitate ecclesiae, cuius autor periit in concilio Constantiensi in 1520, attracted a great deal of attention. Petri was also able to produce a reprint of Luther‚Äôs translation of the Bible with amazing speed. Only a quarter of a year after the edition of the ‚ÄúSeptember Testament‚Äù, Petri's edition appeared in December 1522 under the title Between 1523 and 1524 Petri printed Luther‚Äôs translation of the Old Testament under the title Der ursprunglichen Hebreischen warheit nach auffs trewlichst verdeutscht. Petri died on 15 November 1527. His widow Anna remarried the cartographer, cosmographer, and a Hebrew scholar Sebastian M√ºnster in 1530. His son Heinrich Petri successfully continued the family‚Äôs printing house.  Further reading  * Corsten, Severin, ed. Lexikon des gesamten Buchwesens. vol. 5.

He played college football at Missouri State University. Early years Arkin attended Kapaun Mt. Carmel High School. He became a starter as a sophomore. As a senior, he was a consensus All-state selection as an offensive lineman. As a defensive lineman, he earned All-city consideration, registering 47 tackles and 3 sacks, while helping his team to a sectional championship. He started 28 games in his last three seasons. He also was part of the school's wrestling team. He accepted a football scholarship from Missouri State University. He was the team starter at right guard in his first three years. He started playing left tackle in the last two games of his junior season and was named the full-time starter at that position as a senior. He received All-MVFC honors in four straight years, becoming the third Missouri State player ever to achieve that distinction. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys Arkin was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (110th overall) in the 2011 NFL Draft, with the intention of playing him at offensive guard. He was declared inactive for every game as a rookie. In 2012, he was forced to learn the center position in training camp, after the team suffered a series of injuries. His lack of strength and experience, kept him inactive in 9 games. He was active for 7 contests, although he didn't play a snap despite being healthy. In 2013, the team decided to have him focus on the right guard position. As he has done in previous training camps, he proved to be one of the most durable players on the team and was activated for the first regular season game of his career in the season opener against the New York Giants. He was released on October 26, to make room for Jakar Hamilton and later signed to the team's practice squad. Miami Dolphins On November 5, 2013, he was signed by the Miami Dolphins from the Dallas Cowboys practice squad. The signing was a direct result of the issues the Dolphins where having on their offensive line, after Richie Incognito alleged role in the harassment of teammate Jonathan Martin. He was active in only one game (against the Carolina Panthers). The following season after being tried at center, he was waived on August 30, 2014. Seattle Seahawks On September 3, 2014, the Seattle Seahawks signed him to their practice squad. He was waived five days later. Indianapolis Colts On September 16, 2014, Arkin was signed to the Indianapolis Colts practice squad. On December 31, he was promoted to the active roster when Gosder Cherilus was placed on the injured reserve list. He played in 3 playoff games, mainly on special teams. On September 5, 2015, he was released and signed to the practice squad. He was cut from the practice squad on September 23, and re-signed on October 26. On November 3, he was released to make room for guard Ben Heenan. St. Louis / Los Angeles Rams On November 17, 2015, Arkin was signed to the St. Louis Rams practice squad. On September 6, 2016, he was released and signed to the Rams' practice squad two days later. He was promoted to the active roster on December 15. He appeared in 2 games as a backup offensive guard. He was released by the Rams on May 1, 2017.

One author describes the dress as a symbol of \\"the marital fervor\\" and a major influence on women who strove to \\"emulate Kelly's peau de soie and lace masterpiece\\". It was designed by Helen Rose of MGM. The dress consisted of a bodice with an attached under-bodice and skirt support. There were two petticoats, one being an attached foundation. The wedding attire included a headdress, veil, shoes and the lace- and pearl- encrusted prayer book which she carried down the aisle. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the wedding, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (which now owns the dress) displayed it at the museum between 1 April and 21 May 2006 and reported it to have been arguably its most popular exhibit. Some 50 years on, the dress is still influential; the wedding dress that Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, wore on 29 April 2011 was said to have been inspired by it. Designs Kelly's marriage involved two separate functions, the first, a civil marriage and the second, a religious marriage, held on successive days. Kelly was assisted on her wedding day by Helen Rose, the wedding dress designer and MGM Studios' costume designer, as well as Virginia Darcy, Kelly's MGM hairstylist. ;Designer Because of the close friendship between the two women, Edith Head assumed that she would be asked to design the wedding dress. Instead, Helen Rose, a costume designer in the wardrobe department of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), was selected. The dress was a wedding gift to Kelly from the MGM studio. ;Civil ceremony For the civil ceremony, which was held at the baroque throne room of the palace on 18 April 1956, the dress worn by Kelly was made of taffeta, pale pink in color, covered by cream-colored Alen√ßon lace, designed as a \\"fitted bodice with high rounded collar and a flared skirt\\". She wore kid gloves and the Juliet cap. The dress for the legal civil ceremony was designed by Helen Rose, who also designed the gown for the main religious ceremony. The marriage was legally solemnized, according to the civil code of Monaco, in the presence of 80 guests, which included representatives from 24 nations, and it was performed by Marcel Portanier, Monaco's Minister of Justice. ;Religious ceremony The formal religious wedding ceremony of Kelly and Prince Rainier was held on 19 April 1956 at the St. Nicholas Cathedral. The high mass was conducted by the bishop of Monaco. The bride wore an elegant wedding dress. It was a high-necked, long-sleeved gown with a fitted torso and billowing skirt. Grace Kelly worked closely with Helen Rose to come up with the design for the dress, and the two women looked to costumes in the MGM archives for inspiration. A wedding dress from the MGM film Invitation is particularly similar to Grace's dress. The dress materials included \\"twenty- five yards of silk taffeta, one hundred yards of silk net, peau de soie, tulle and 125-year-old Brussels rose point lace.\\" The Juliet cap that she wore was bejeweled with seed pearls and orange blossoms. The veil, made of tulle, measured 90 yards. Her other wedding adornments included a small Bible and a bouquet of Lilies of the Valley. The material cost and manufacturing cost of the dress was indicated as US$7266.68, excluding the fee of the designer. ;Wedding entourage Kelly's sister, Peggy, was the matron of honor. The wedding entourage consisted of six bridesmaids who all wore yellow organdy dresses designed by Joe Allen Hong of Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and created by Priscilla of Boston. In addition, there were six junior attendants (four girls and two boys) who were dressed in white. Publicity The \\"serenely regal\\" dress was described by the media when the details were disclosed two days before the wedding. While columnist Ilka Chase observed that it was \\"a charming dress but not a superb one\\", the general consensus was that the gown was magnificent. Continuing the idea of a rivalry between European and American clothing in Monaco, The New York Times called it \\"the loveliest example of the American product\\". In a simile given by another reporter, the bridal dress train of was described as \\"flowing like a river of whipped cream among the plush red floor.\\" The wedding announcements, which received wide press coverage, also brought in controversial versions of the claims made by many commercial establishments out to exploit her name such as the Max Factor announcement that it would give the cosmetics to match her wedding dress, and hosiery maker Willy's de Mond announcing that it would give her the pearl-trimmed stockings. All of these claims were denied by Grace. Further acclaim On 1 April 2006, The Philadelphia Museum of Art presented an exhibition titled Fit for a Princess: Grace Kelly's Wedding Dress, that ran until 21 May 2006. The exhibition was in honor of the 50th anniversary of the wedding. Kelly's 1956 wedding gown has come in for praise in recent times because of the striking similarity to it of Catherine Middleton's royal wedding dress. V-shaped necklines and long, white laced sleeves are particularly mentioned. Israeli singer Maya Bouskilla wore a \\"perfect\\" copy of the dress for her June 2011 wedding. It was also the inspiration for Miranda Kerr's wedding dress worn to her 2017 marriage with Evan Spiegel. The dress was designed by Maria Grazia Chiuri of Christian Dior SE.

It is an indication of how much oxygen is removed from the blood in capillaries as the blood circulates in the body. The a-vO2 diff and cardiac output are the main factors that allow variation in the body's total oxygen consumption, and are important in measuring VO2. The a-vO2 diff is usually measured in millilitres of oxygen per 100 millilitres of blood (mL/100 mL).Malpeli, Physical Education, Chapter 4: Acute Responses to Exercise, p. 106. Measurement The arteriovenous oxygen difference is usually taken by comparing the difference in the oxygen concentration of oxygenated blood in the femoral, brachial, or radial artery and the oxygen concentration in the deoxygenated blood from the mixed supply found in the pulmonary artery (as an indicator of the typical mixed venous supply). Put in simple terms: :a-vO2 diff = Ca ‚Äì Cv ::where: ::*Ca = the oxygen concentration of arterial blood (oxygenated blood) ::*Cv = the oxygen concentration of venous blood (deoxygenated blood) The usual unit for a-vO2 diff is millilitres of oxygen per 100 millilitres of blood (mL/100 mL), however, particularly in medical uses, other units may be used, such as micromoles per millilitre (Œºmol/mL). In practice, a-vO2 diff may be determined using the Fick Principle rather than by taking direct blood samples. In order to do so oxygen consumption (VO2) may be measured using a spirometer to detect gaseous concentrations in exhaled air compared to inhaled air, while cardiac output can be determined using a Doppler ultrasound. Arterial blood will generally contain an oxygen concentration of around 20 mL/100 mL. Venous blood with an oxygen concentration of 15 mL/100 mL would therefore lead to typical values of the a-vO2 diff at rest of around 5 mL/100 mL. During intense exercise, however, the a-vO2 diff can increase to as much as 16 mL/100 mL due to the working muscles extracting far more oxygen from the blood than they do at rest. Alternatively, in order to find the efficiency of the lungs in replenishing blood oxygen levels, the a-vO2 diff may instead be taken by comparing blood from the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein; in this case a negative value for a-vO2 diff would be obtained as the oxygen content of the blood would have increased. Impacts of exercise Physical exercise leads to an increase in the arteriovenous oxygen difference in all individuals. As exercise intensities increase, the muscles increase the amount of oxygen they extract from the blood, and this therefore results in further increases in a-vO2 diff.Malpeli, Physical Education, Chapter 11: Chronic Training Adaptations, p. 304. The maximum a-vO2 diff is also usually greater in trained athletes than in untrained individuals. This is a result of aerobic exercise leading to hypertrophy of the slow twitch muscle fibres mainly due to increased capillarisation. The increase in capillary beds in the muscle means that blood supply to that muscle can be greater and diffusion of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other metabolites increases.Malpeli, Physical Education, Chapter 11: Chronic Training Adaptations, p. 307. With training the muscles also improve in their ability to extract oxygen from the blood and process the oxygen, possibly due to adaptations of the mitochondria and an increase in the muscle's myoglobin content. Research has shown that following the commencement of exercise there is a delay in the increase of the a-vO2 diff, and that a-vO2 diff only has a marginal impact in the total change in VO2 in the early stages of exercise. The bulk of the early increase in oxygen consumption after a sudden change in exercise levels results from increased cardiac output. However it has also been found that the increase in the maximal a-vO2 diff resulting from adaptations to a physical training program can account for most of the difference in VO2 max in subjects participating in sub-maximal exercise. In medicine Arteriovenous oxygen difference is also used in other areas of study such as medicine and medical research. For example the a-vO2 diff has been used to measure cerebral blood flow in comatose patients, assisting with their diagnosis and treatment. The a-vO2 diff has also been used to determine the effects of physical training in coronary patients.

The thrombus is then invaded by microorganisms. Ascending infections cause 99% of postpartum SPT. Septic pelvis thrombophlembitis is a cause of post- operative fever from untreated postpartum endometritis. After 48 hours of uncured postpartum endometritis (notably 48 hours of fever that is unaffected by antibiotics), one could diagnose SPT until proven otherwise (with pelvic radiography). Imaging studies can be helpful in patient refractory to broad- spectrum parenteral antibiotics to look for an abscess, retained products, or septic pelvic thrombophlebitis. Septic pelvic thrombophlembitis (SPT) occurs most often in bedridden patients after giving birth, or after having undergone a Caesarean section. The blood often pools in the pelvis as this is the lowest part of the patient while laying in a hospital bed.  Risk factors  The main risk factor of developing SPT is post-partum endometritis, which in turn is most commonly caused by a Caesarean section. Other risk factors for developing endometritis, and subsequently SPT include: * Bacterial vaginosis * Manual removal of the placenta * Prolonged labor * Large amount of meconium in amniotic fluid * Multiple cervical examinations  Symptoms  The symptoms of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis are similar to those of endometritis. Clinical signs include: * fever * pain on palpation of uterus * midline lower abdominal pain * malodorous lochia (vaginal discharge) * tachycardia  Laboratory results  Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis will have elevated CRP and WBC (evidence of inflammation).  Diagnosis  Since septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, other causes of postpartum fever must be considered, such as infection of cesarean section wounds, episiotomy or laceration sites as well as endometritis, endomyometritis, mastitis, and physiologic breast engorgement.  Treatment  With low uterine size retention, treat endometritis and SPT with ice packs, broad-spectrum antibiotics and analgesics. With high uterine size retention, treat the thrombophlebitis with D&C; aspiration under ultrasonogram because of increased risk of placental tissue retention in the myometrium.

Formally chartered in 1854, the town had a popular ferry crossing over the Missouri River for more than three decades. The river changed course, ending the ferry. After a railroad spur bypassed the town, it drew off more commerce. The community rebuilt its school on the river bluff when it was threatened by flooding; this area was also used for the cemetery. The town was completely abandoned by 1920, as flooding had destroyed much of the townsite. The site is at the northern edge of Indian Cave State Park.  History  Founded by \\"half-breeds\\" to serve the Nemaha Half-Breed Reservation, the town grew up around a trading post and was named in 1853 after Joseph Deroin (1819-1858), the trader. Deroin was the son of a M√©tisLawrence Barkwell, \\"DeRoin, Joseph\\", The People of the Metis Nation: D-G/History through Biography, at Scribd.com, p. 10. French Canadian trapper Amable De Rouins and his Otoe wife. The elder De Rouins had traded along the nearby Missouri River for decades, and a trading post was already operating near the townsite when Lewis and Clark came through with their expedition in 1804.Farrar, J. \\"Indian Cave State Park\\" , Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. Retrieved 8/9/08. In 1840, Joseph Deroin set up a trading post along the river's edge at the mouth of the Platte River, at the main village of the Otoe. He married Meek-Ka-Ahu-me, an Omaha woman, and they had a daughter Mary. In 1842, Deroin also married the two M√©tis sisters, Julia and Sus√©e Baskette, who were daughters of an Otoe woman; together he had a total of eight children with them. Joseph and his brother John Deroin each received allotments of land at the Nemaha Reservation, which was established in 1830. Joseph's daughter Mary and his third wife, Sus√©e Baskette Deroin, also were recorded as having allotments there. Joseph was killed in 1858 by a white settler (husband of a M√©tis wife) in a dispute over money owed. Increasingly, white settlers were moving into Otoe and Omaha land, as well as the Nemaha Reservation, and displacing Native residents. They laid out a townsite below the river bluffs in 1856. Although the Native Americans appealed to the US government to remove the interlopers, they were unsuccessful. European American settlers moved in around Deroin's trading post and named the town St. Deroin, hoping to link it to the downriver cities of St. Joseph and St. Louis. From 1854, a ferry service brought passengers from Iowa across the Missouri.\\"Missouri River Commission Triangulation Station - ST. DEROIN - 1890 - Recovery & Remonumentation of a 120-Year-Old Survey Marker\\" , Jerry Penry, April 14, 2006.  Buildings  In addition to the early trading post and ferry service, a U.S. Post Office operated in the town from 1861 to 1910.\\"St. Deroin\\", GhostTowns.com. Retrieved 11/29/11. The town had a subscription school that was started in 1858. Residents built a brick schoolhouse in 1868, when river commerce revived after the end of the American Civil War. In 1912 when the river was rapidly swallowing the town site, the school building was dismantled and reassembled on the higher ground of the river bluffs. Other buildings in town included a hotel and two blacksmith shops. St. Deroin Cemetery In the 1870s, at probably its economic peak, the town had nearly 200 residents and 20 businesses. By 1880, its population had dropped to about 90, and spring floods washed away some buildings on the floodplain. Steamboats became infrequent and, with construction of a railroad spur between Nemaha and Shubert, Nebraska that bypassed St. Deroin, its economic life dried up. After thirty years of ferries at St. Deroin, the Missouri River changed course and made ferrying impossible. The service was moved to Brownville in 1915.  Floods  Since the 1840s, most of the town below the river bluff has been washed away by floods. Today only the cemetery and the St. Deroin School sit on the bluffs above the original location.D.

Subject  New York, 1946: a leading US newspaper company sends Harry Smith, a talented correspondent, to the Soviet Union. His task is to write a scaremongering report about the Soviet belligerent and expansionist intentions in order to further a widespread campaign of propaganda undertaken by the American media and the conservative elite. Harry, a former war correspondent, accepts the attractive deal and sets off to Soviet Russia only to fall in love with a country quite different from the picture shown by the \\"free press\\" in its Cold War adversary. Back in the United States, Harry finds himself torn by a dilemma between his consciousness as an honest journalist, and the menacing pressure of his superiors, forcing him to write a convenient untruth. Keeping its ideological design in mind, The Russian Question remains a sophisticated and objective, if somewhat critical portrayal of American Cold War political society. Unlike many other Soviet propaganda films, Romm's drama takes on an American perspective, only showing the Soviet Union discussed in the movie for a short combination of shots. The bulk of the film is centered on American culture, society, politics, history, economy and way of life.

The term does, however, have broader application, such as in geology (for example, in descriptive and theoretical works), and similarly in astronomy (for example, see \\"Centaur object\\" in the context of 2060 Chiron's close affinity with icy comet nuclei.\\"Centaur object.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite . Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2011.) Basis In taxonomy the basis of any particular type of classification is the way in which objects in the domain resemble each other. A resemblance of a type that seems appropriate to the classification that we propose, we may call an affinity, and when we decide how to classify say, a specimen of rock or butterfly, we justify our decision according to the affinities that we observe. Other resemblances we dismiss as being out of context or at least non-cogent; for example, in deciding whether to classify a lizard as having closer affinities to a snake than to a table, biologists rely on affinities such as the scales, blood, physiology, vertebral anatomy, and reproductive system as being more relevant than the possession of four \\"feet\\". Application and obstacles Analysing and determining the proper classification of an organism, a rock, or an astronomic object according to a particular system is often a difficult and treacherous procedure. Problems in such fields of study have tripped up whole generations of workers in recent centuries. When the position is not clear from an early stage, the first step after beginning to determine, evaluate, and describe the attributes of the object, is to determine the affinities and evaluate their significance. The number of legs might well be a significant affinity in comparing different types of related organisms such as crustaceans, but irrelevant in comparing a ten-limbed cephalopod with a ten-limbed solifugid (including its pedipalps as limbs). Such a comparison would be no more cogent than the foregoing example of the lizard and the table. There are many such examples in nature; we see both a lungfish and a porpoise as having closer (but largely different) affinities to a cow than to a tuna, and a bat as having closer affinities to a banteng than to a bird or a butterfly, although a banteng has no \\"wings\\". These are considerations arising from the principles discussed in articles on Homology (biology) and Analogy (biology). It is clear that there is an element of subjectivity to the recognition of affinities; that is implicit in such dictionary definitions as: \\"\\"Affinity: the closeness of relation between plants as shown by similarity of important organs.\\"Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth & Co. London, 4th ed 1928 That definition is over a century old, but it is typical of the basis on which taxonomists had to work till recently, and in practice still must use; it is not practical to sequence the genome of every specimen. Nucleic acid analyses are eroding many difficulties, but there is a long way to go.

About The search technology provides local search results in more than 1,400 cities. Yandex Search also features ‚Äúparallel‚Äù search that presents results from both main web index and specialized information resources, including news, shopping, blogs, images and videos on a single page. Yandex Search is responsive to real-time queries, recognizing when a query requires the most current information, such as breaking news or the most recent post on Twitter on a particular topic. It also contains some additional features: Wizard Answer, which provides additional information (for example, sports results), spell checker, autocomplete which suggests queries as-you-type, antivirus that detects malware on webpages and so on.

Retrieved 2011-04-30. The search product can be accessed from personal computers, mobile phones, tablets and other digital devices. In addition to web search, Yandex provides a wide range of specialized search services. In 2009, Yandex launched MatrixNet, a new method of machine learning that significantly improves the relevance of search results. It allows the Yandex‚Äô search engine to take into account a very large number of factors when it makes the decision about relevancy of search results.MatrixNet: New Level of Search Quality. Retrieved 2011-04-30. Another technology, Spectrum, was launched in 2010. It allows inferring implicit queries and returning matching search results. The system automatically analyses users' searches and identifies objects like personal names, films or cars. Proportions of the search results responding to different user intents are based on the user demand for these results. With the first release on July 21, 2017, Brave web browser features Yandex as one of its default search engines.  Functionality = Basic Information  The search engine consists of three main components: # An agent is a search robot. He bypasses the network, downloads and analyzes documents. If a new link is found during site analysis, it falls into the list of web addresses of the robot. Search robots are of the following types: spiders - download sites like the user's browsers ; Crawler - discover new, still unknown links based on the analysis of already known documents; indexers - analyze the detected web pages and add data to the index. Many deflated documents are divided into disjoint parts and are cleared from the markup. #Index is a database compiled by search engine indexing robots. Documents are searched in the index. #Search engine. The search request from the user is sent to the least loaded server after analyzing the load of the search system. To provide such an opportunity, Yandex servers are clustered. Then, the user request is processed by a program called \\"Metapoisk\\". Metapoisk analyzes the request in real time: it determines the geographic location of the user, conducts linguistic analysis, etc. The program also determines whether the request belongs to the category of the most popular or recently defined.The issuance of such requests for some time is stored in the memory (cache) of the metasearch, and in case of a match, previously saved results are displayed. If the request is rare and there are no matches in the cache, the system redirects it to the Basic Search program. It analyzes the system index, which is also divided into different duplicate servers (this speeds up the procedure). Then the received information again falls into meta-search, the data is ranked and shown to the user in a final form.  Indexing  In general, Yandex indexes the following file types : html, pdf, rtf, doc, xls, ppt, docx, odt, odp, ods, odg, xlsx, pptx. The search engine is also able to index text inside Shockwave Flash objects (if the text is not placed on the image itself), if these elements are transferred as a separate page, which has the MIME type \`application/x-shockwave-flash\` , and files with the extension .swf Yandex has 2 scanning robots - the ‚Äúmain‚Äù and the ‚Äúfast‚Äù. The first is responsible for the whole Internet, the second indexes sites with frequently changing and updating information (news sites and news agencies). In 2010, the ‚Äúfast‚Äù robot received a new technology called ‚ÄúOrange‚Äù, developed jointly by the California and Moscow divisions of Yandex. Since 2009, Yandex has supported Sitemaps technology.  Server logs  In the server logs, Yandex robots are represented as follows: * \`Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; YandexBot/3.0)\` is the main indexing robot. * \`Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; YandexBot/3.0; MirrorDetector)\` \\\\- a robot that detects site mirrors.

The Yandex search takes into account the morphology of the Russian language, therefore, regardless of the form of the word in the search query, the search will be performed for all word forms. If morphological analysis is undesirable, you can put an exclamation mark (!) Before the word - the search in this case will show only the specific form of the word. In addition, the search query practically does not take into account the so- called stop-words , that is, prepositions, punctuation, pronouns, etc., due to their wide distribution As a rule, abbreviations are automatically disclosing, spelling is correcting. It also searches for synonyms (mobile - cellular). The extension of the original user request depends on the context. Expansion does not occur when a set of highly specialized terms, names of proper names of companies (for example, OJSC ‚ÄúHippo‚Äù - OJSC ‚ÄúHippopotamus‚Äù), adding the word ‚Äúprice‚Äù, in exact quotes (these are queries highlighted with typewriter quotes). Search results for each user are formed individually based on their location, language of a query, interests and preferences based on the results of previous and current search sessions. However, the key factor in ranking search results is their relevance to the search query. Relevance is determined based on a ranking formula, which is constantly updated based on machine learning algorithms. The search is performed in Russian , English , French , German , Ukrainian , Belarusian , Tatar , Kazakh. Search results can be sorted by relevance and by date (buttons below the search results). The page with the search results consists of 10 links with short annotations - ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù. The snippets includes a text comment, link, address, popular sections of the site, pages on social networks , etc. As an alternative to snippets, Yandex introduced in 2014 a new interface called ‚ÄúIslands‚Äù. Yandex implements the ‚Äúparallel searches‚Äù mechanism, when together with a web search, a search is performed on Yandex services, such as Catalog, News, Market , Encyclopedias, Images, etc. As a result, in response to a user‚Äôs request, the system shows not only textual information, but also links to video files, pictures, dictionary entries, etc. A distinctive feature of the search engine is also the technology of \\"intent search\\" that mean a search for solving a problem. Intent search elements are - dialog prompts in case of ambiguous request, automatic text translation, information about the characteristics of the requested car, etc. For example, when you request ‚ÄúBoris Grebenshchikov - Golden City‚Äù, the system will show a form for online listening to music from the Yandex Music service , at the request of \\"st. Koroleva 12 \\" will be shown a fragment of the map with the marked object on it.  Spam and Virus Protection  In 2013, Yandex was considered by some to be the safest search engine at the time and the third most secure among all web resources.. By 2016, Yandex had slipped down to third with Google being first.2016 Q2 Hacked Website Report Sucuri Checking web pages and warning users appeared on Yandex in 2009: since then, on the search results page, next to a dangerous site there is a note ‚ÄúThis site may threaten the security of your computer‚Äù. Two technologies at once are used to detect threats. The first was purchased from the American antivirus Sophos and based on a signature approach: that means, when accessing a web page, the antivirus system also accesses a database of already known viruses and malware. This approach is fast, but practically powerless against new viruses that have not yet entered the database. Therefore, Yandex along with the signature also uses its own antivirus complex, based on an analysis of the behavioral factor. The Yandex program, when accessing the site, checks whether the latter requested additional files from the browser, redirected it to an extraneous resource, etc. Thus, if information is received that the site begins to perform certain actions (cascading style sheets , JavaScript modules are launched and complete programs) without user permission, it is placed in the ‚Äúblack list‚Äù and in the database of virus signatures. Information about the infection of the site appears in the search results, and through the Yandex.Webmaster service the owner of the site receives a notification. After the first check, Yandex does the second, and if the infection information is confirmed a second time, the checks will be more frequent until the threat is eliminated. The total number of infected sites in the Yandex database does not exceed 1%. Every day in 2013, Yandex checks 23 million web pages (while detecting 4,300 dangerous sites) and shows users 8 million warnings. Approximately one billion sites are checked monthly.  Search Ranking  For a long time, the key ranking factor for Yandex was the number of third-party links to a particular site. Each page on the Internet was assigned a unique citation index, similar to the index for authors of scientific articles: the more links, the better. A similar mechanism was implemented in the Yandex and in the Google‚Äôs PageRank. In order to prevent cheating, Yandex uses multivariate analysis, in which only 70 of the 800 factors are affected by the number of third-party links. Today, the content of the site and the presence or absence of keywords there, the ease of reading the text, the name of the domain, its history and the presence of multimedia content play a much greater role. On December 5, 2013, Yandex announced a complete refusal of accounting the link factor in the future.  Search hints  As the user types the query in the search bar, the search engine offers hints in the form of a drop-down list. Hints appear even before the search results appears and allow you to refine the query, correct the layout or typo, or go directly to the site you are looking for. For each user, hints are generated, including on the history of his search queries (My Finds service). In 2012, the so-called ‚ÄúSmart Search Hints‚Äù appeared, which instantly give out information about the main constants (equator length, speed of light, and so on), traffic jams , and have a built-in calculator. In addition, a translator was integrated in the ‚ÄúHints‚Äù (the query ‚Äúlove in French‚Äù instantly gives out amour, affection ), the schedule and results of football matches, exchange rates, weather forecasts and more. You can find out the exact time by asking \\"what time is it.\\" In 2011, Hints in the search for Yandex became completely local to 83 regions of Russia. In addition to the actual search, Hints are built into Yandex search engines. Dictionaries ‚Äù,‚Äú Yandex. Market ‚Äù,‚Äú Yandex. Maps \\"and other Yandex services. The hint function is a consequence of the development of the technology of intent search and first appeared on Yandex.Bar in August 2007, and in October 2008 it was introduced on the main page of the search engine. Available both in the desktop and mobile versions of the site, Yandex shows its users more than a billion search hints per day  History  Changes in the search engine for a long time were not widely represented and remained nameless. And only from the beginning of 2008, when the launch of algorithm 8 SP1 was announced, Yandex announced that henceforth the new ranking algorithms will bear the names of cities.  1990s  The name of the system - Yandex, - was invented together by Arkady Volozh and Ilya Segalovich. The word stands for yet another indexer (or as ‚Äú I am (\\"ya\\" in Russian language) and index )‚Äù. According to the interpretation of Artemy Lebedev , the name of the search engine is consonant with Yandeks, where yang means the masculine beginning, The yandex.ru search engine was announced by CompTek on September 23, 1997 at the Softool exhibition, although some developments in the field of search (Bible indexing, searching for documents on CD-ROM, site search) were carried out by the company even earlier. The first index contained information on 5 thousand servers and occupied 4.5 GB. In the same 1997, the search for Yandex began to be used in the Russian version of Internet Explorer 4.0. It became possible to query in natural language. In 1998, the function ‚Äúfind similar documents‚Äù appeared for each search result. ‚ÄúYandex. Search ‚Äùas of 1998 worked on three machines running on FreeBSD under Apache: one machine crawled the Internet and indexed documents, one search engine, and one machine duplicated the search engine. In 1999, a search appeared in the categories - search, a combination of a search engine and a catalog. The version of the search engine was updated.  2000  On June 6, 2000, the second version of the search engine was presented. A parallel search mechanism was introduced, and along with the issuance, information was offered from large sources. Users were able to limit the search results to the selected topic. The heading ‚ÄúPopular finds‚Äù appeared - words that refine the search. In December 2000, the volume of indexed information reached 355.22 GB.  2001  In 2001, Yandex overtook another Russian search engine, Rambler, in terms of attendance, and became the leading search engine of Runet. Yandex began to understand requests in a natural language that were asked in interrogative form. The system has learned to recognize typos and suggest correcting them. The design has changed.  2002  The number of daily queries to the Yandex search engine exceeded 2 million  2003  Indexing .rtf and .pdf documents was launched. Search results began to be issued including in XML format.  2004  The ranking algorithm has changed. Yandex began indexing documents in .swf (Flash).xls and .ppt formats. At the end of the year, the study ‚ÄúSome Aspects of Full-Text Search and Ranking in Yandex‚Äù was published (authors Ilya Segalovich , Mikhail Maslov ), which revealed certain ranking details in a search engine.  2005  In summer, the so-called ‚Äúfast‚Äù search robot was launched, working in parallel with the actual pages intended for indexing. The base of the \\"fast robot\\" is updated every 1.5‚Äì2 hours. The ranking algorithm has been improved to increase search accuracy. Search capabilities have been expanded with the help of Yandex. Dictionaries ‚Äùand‚Äú Yandex. Lingvo \\". The search engine has learned to understand queries like ‚ÄúWhat is [something] in Spanish‚Äù and automatically translate them. It became possible to limit search results by region.  2006  Since May 2006, site icons have been displayed in the search results. In early December, next to each link in the results of search appeared the item ‚ÄúSaved copy‚Äù, clicking on which, the user goes to a full copy of the page in a special archive database (‚ÄúYandex cache‚Äù).  2007  Ranking algorithm changed again.  2008  In 2008, Yandex for the first time began to openly announce changes in the search algorithm and strarted to name the changes with the names of Russian cities. The name of the ‚Äúcity‚Äù of each subsequent algorithm begins with the letter that the name of the previous one ended with.  Yandex Achievements  The precedent when local search companies are not inferior to American brands is almost unique in the world, if we do not take into account the experience of China, where Google was blocked in 2010, mailboxes of human rights defenders are hacked, and local providers often redirect the address www.google.cn to Baidu. It should also be noted that Russia is the only country in the world, with the exception of the United States, which without protectionist measures has created more than one successful search technology with a significant market share (see also Rambler). According to media expert Mikhail Gurevich, Yandex is a ‚Äúnational treasure‚Äù, a ‚Äústrategic product‚Äù. This fact was also recognized in the State Duma of the Russian Federation, where in May 2012 a bill appeared in which Yandex and VKontakte are recognized by strategic enterprises as national information translators. In 2009, President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev initiated the purchase of a ‚Äúgolden share‚Äù of Yandex by Sberbank in order to avoid an important nationwide company falling into foreign hands. In 2012, Yandex overtook Channel One in terms of daily audience, which made the Yandex a leader in the domestic media market. In 2013, Yandex confirmed this status, overtaking First in terms of revenue. In 2008, Yandex was the ninth search engine in the world, in 2009 the seventh, and in 2013 the fourth. One of the components of this situation is the presence in Russia of a sufficient number of mathematically savvy specialists with a scientific instinct. By 2002, the word Yandex became so common that when Arkady Volozh\`s company demanded to return the yandex.com domain, bought by third parties, the defendant stated that the word \\"Yandex\\" was already synonymous with the search and became a household word in Russia. Since late 2012, the Yandex search engine has outperformed the number of Google users on the Google Chrome browser in Russia. Logo Russian version of logo The Yandex logo appears in numerous settings to identify the search engine company. Yandex has relied on several logos since its renaming, with the first logo created by Arkady Volozh and debuted in 1997–ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–º –Øndex, –º—ã –ø–æ–¥—Ä–∞–∑—É–º–µ–≤–∞–µ–º –Ø–Ω–¥–µ–∫—Å on –Øndex.Site and –Øndex.CD products, even before the announcement of the Yandex search engine.

It comprises the 151st and 152nd episodes of the series overall and the 25th and 26th episodes of the seventh season. It originally aired on NBC on May 19, 2011 in the United States. In the episode, Deangelo's replacement is sought out through a search committee process led by Jim (John Krasinski). Meanwhile, Angela (Angela Kinsey) becomes engaged to her state senator boyfriend, Robert (Jack Coleman), while the rest of the office believes he is gay. The episode was written by show runner and executive producer Paul Lieberstein and was directed by Jeffrey Blitz. The episode featured several guest appearances including one from The Office co- creator Ricky Gervais, his second appearance on the series. The episode also marks the first appearances of Robert California and Nellie Bertram, the former of whom was a series regular in the eighth season while the latter had a recurring appearance in the eighth season and was a series regular in the ninth and final season. \\"Search Committee\\" received mixed reviews from critics with multiple critics commenting on the multiple guest stars. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Search Committee\\" was viewed by an estimated 7.29 million viewers and earned a 3.9 rating/10% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, marking a rise in the ratings from the previous episode and the previous season finale. Synopsis With Deangelo Vickers still in a coma, Dunder Mifflin‚ÄìSabre Scranton is left with Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) as interim regional manager, who does many poor managerial activities, such as having numerous meetings without actually calling anyone and creating meaningless acronyms. Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) puts Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) and Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) into a committee to interview candidates for the manager position, including Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling), and a number of outsiders, including a personal friend of hers, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), who suggests various strange methods for running an office, including a \\"zen garden\\" theme and removal of all official titles for Dunder Mifflin Scranton. Several applicants exhibit odd behavior: one (Will Arnett) refuses to explains his three-step plan, another (Warren Buffett) is concerned about gas price and long distance phone calls, another (Jim Carrey) is adamant on having a vacation to the Finger Lakes, and one named Robert California (James Spader) talks in confusing riddles that both baffle and impress the committee. David Brent (Rick Gervais) also applies, making an appearance via webcam. To stop Creed from calling major clients and telling them the office is about to go out of business, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) distracts him with activities such as having him try to find the differences between two copies of the same picture, and poses as various clients when Creed has Jordan Garfield (Cody Horn) contact them. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), still upset over being demoted by Jo, stops taking care of himself and openly looks through want ads in the office. His attitude changes when Robert disparages the position and the office to a sketchy, uncommitted interviewee (Ray Romano). Dwight becomes incensed that the position might go to someone who does not take it seriously. He demands to be interviewed, and while Jim balks, after Dwight's persistent efforts to acquire an interview (particularly by disguising himself as a French burn victim named Jacques Souvenier), Jo instructs Jim to grant him one, as she likes \\"a little bit of crazy.\\" Jim had earlier firmly shot down Dwight's extensive bribe list for Jim's support, and quickly ends his formal interview. Darryl thinks his popularity with the staff will make him a shoo-in, so he is caught off-guard when he actually must do an interview and submit a resume. Darryl writes up an extensive four-page resume, which Jo derides, though Jim encourages Darryl by saying that the interview and resume are mere formalities for him. When Andy interviews for the manager position, Gabe attempts to sabotage him by asking random trivia questions, which Andy successfully answers, and Gabe ends up screaming at him. Gabe is also dismissive of Kelly during her interview, saying she is not a \\"serious candidate\\". Kelly exacts revenge by telling Jo about Gabe's relationship with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and his harassing behavior after their breakup. In response, Jo, unhappy with Gabe's deep involvement with the Scranton employees, sends him back to Sabre's Florida headquarters, and installs Kelly in Gabe's position on the search committee. Kelly then says she has accepted Dwight's bribery and looks forward to the benefits of his return to the manager's chair, as Toby haltingly says they could give Dwight another trial run and Jim looks on in horror. After Phyllis tells Jim that Kelly and Dwight have \\"pre-fired\\" her, Jim tells Dwight he is not and will not be the manager, and the office begins arguing about who will be selected. The discussion gets out of control, with Ryan (B. J. Novak) preferring a homeless man, Andy declaring he wants the job, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) wanting a \\"smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties,\\" Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) speaking solely for attention, and Darryl's daughter Jada asking out loud if Jim is the guy making him manager. Jim cuts the discussion short and brings the committee back to the conference room to make up their minds. Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) and Erin await the results of a DNA test to see if Erin is the daughter previously given up by Phyllis in high school. The results are negative, but Phyllis holds off on telling Erin after Andy rejects Erin's proposal to start dating again, and continues to show maternal affection toward her. Angela becomes engaged to her state senator boyfriend, Robert. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who strongly believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam. Most of the office thinks so as well. They eventually decide not to tell Angela for a wide range of reasons‚Äînot everyone is sure Robert is gay, Oscar is looking forward to the elegant wedding, and Pam does not think it is anyone's right to blurt out that information. Angela is rude about her nuptial plans, first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley that they might not have room to invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she can borrow the plans for the dream wedding Pam never got to have, before mocking the ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls. Pam is tempted to spill the beans about Robert's sexuality, but smiles sweetly and wishes Angela \\"a very happy wedding\\". Production The Office co-creator Ricky Gervais guest starred and contributed to the script for \\"Search Committee\\" \\"Search Committee\\" was written by showrunner and executive producer Paul Lieberstein, who also plays Toby Flenderson on the show, his 14th writing credit of the series. The episode was directed by Jeffrey Blitz, the ninth episode he has directed for the series. The episode features special guest appearances from Ricky Gervais (as his character David Brent from the original British version of The Office), Catherine Tate, Will Arnett, Ray Romano, James Spader, Jim Carrey, Cody Horn and Warren Buffett. Gervais previously appeared in the episode \\"The Seminar\\", and co-wrote the episodes \\"Pilot\\" and \\"The Convict\\"; he also serves as an executive producer for the series. In addition to appearing in \\"Search Committee\\", Gervais contributed to the episode script. Initially the guest stars were planned to be a secret, before all were revealed to the media. Lieberstein described the moments with the guest stars in the episode as \\"more than a montage. It's a number of scenes. We fit it in. We stuff it in\\". The episode script was initially 75 pages long, 10 pages too long to stay within the episode's time slot; this led to several cuts, a common problem for episodes of the series according to writer, B. J. Novak. The script received several laughs from the cast and producers specifically for lines read by Creed Bratton and Kathy Bates. \\"Search Committee\\" was one of the first episodes not to feature former Office lead actor Steve Carell; the feeling during filming was \\"weird\\" according to Lieberstein. Carell's departure made it possible for more scenes with secondary characters, and also allowed for the \\"very long group scene\\", described as \\"observational and conversational\\" by Novak. The episode features a storyline hinted in \\"Goodbye, Michael\\" in which it is hinted that Phyllis is Erin's birth mother. The rumor was started during an interview with executive producer Greg Daniels with Entertainment Weekly in which he stated \\"A tiny mystery story ‚Äì which I'm not sure anyone‚Äôs going to catch and will come out a few episodes from now ‚Äì is being set up here\\". The episode also marks the third and final appearance of Cody Horn as Jordan Garfield, Deangelo's executive assistant, and the first of three new roles since Carell's departure. The role was originally said to be recurring at first with a chance of her becoming a series regular in the eighth season. She eventually did not return for the eighth season. Immediately after \\"Search Committee\\" first aired, NBC posted Andy, Dwight and Darryl's resume on their official website and allowed fans to vote for who they believed should be the manager. Spader would later join the cast as CEO of Sabre in the eighth season while Tate is currently set to return in the second half of the eighth season as romantic interest for Robert California. In the eighth-season premiere, \\"The List\\", Andy was revealed to be the new manager. Arnett was considered a high possibility to appear on the series, but could not due to his commitment to the NBC comedy series Up All Night. This also marks the eighth and final appearance of Kathy Bates as Jo Bennett. The opening episode of the eighth season would refer to Jo stepping down from her position as Sabre CEO and hiring Robert California to replace her. Cultural references Darryl calls Microsoft and asks whether they still have Clippy, an unpopular feature from Microsoft Office. Phyllis mentions that many babies were born in 1982 due to the release of the 1981 comedy film Porky's. Ryan insults Pam, saying that she would prefer Rachael Ray or the hosts of The View as the new manager. At one point in the episode, Angela says \\"It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I, Naomi Judd?\\", a reference to the country music singer. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast on May 19, 2011, \\"Search Committee\\" was viewed by an estimated 7.29 million viewers and received a 3.9 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10% of all 18- to 49-year- olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\", and a rise from the sixth season finale, \\"Whistleblower\\". The episode became the highest rated scripted program on Thursday and ranked first in its timeslot, beating the season finales for Grey's Anatomy, Bones and The Mentalist. \\"Search Committee\\" was the seventh most-watched scripted show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18‚Äì49. Reviews The episode received generally mixed reviews from critics. Myles McNutt from review website The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, saying that it was \\"a funny episode that managed to be only fitfully satisfying.\\" IGN reviewer Cindy White commented that \\"it's more apparent than ever that 'Goodbye, Michael' should have ended the season, if not the series,\\" and that \\"the show is just spinning its wheels now\\". Despite this, she praised the scenes featuring Creed Bratton and James Spader, believing Bratton's performance consisted of \\"the funniest scenes of the episode\\", and that Spader \\"was given the meatiest part, gamely channeling his dominating boss role from Secretary\\". White ultimately gave the episode a 6.5/10, calling it \\"Okay\\". TV Squad writer Joel Keller criticized the episode for not featuring a true plot, writing that \\"this felt like a series of sketches in search of a plot.\\" The Office co-creator Ricky Gervais also commented on the outlandishness, particularly Warren Buffett's appearance, saying \\"If you're going to jump a shark, jump a big one.\\" He also compared the episode to the Chris Martin episode of Gervais's other series, Extras. The shark quote was repeated multiple times on other media outlets; Gervais eventually commented that \\"I fucking didn't [diss The Office], that's for sure.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix referred to the episode as a \\"bumpy, awkward, great big mess of a finale\\" and a \\"very poorly-executed sweeps stunt\\". He also wrote that the guest stars \\"did not fit comfortably into the world of the show\\". Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis called the episode a \\"major cop out\\" and criticized the writers for having a whole year to figure out how to end the season, but instead waiting to announce the new manager in the fall. She ultimately concluded that \\"I don't love some of the choices the show has made recently\\" and that \\"the show has just been spinning its wheels for the past several weeks\\". Many critics expressed relief that Erin and Phyllis were not mother and daughter. \\"Search Committee\\" was voted the fourth lowest-rated episode out of 24 from the seventh season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the episode was rated 6.93 out of 10. In another poll, \\"Search Committee\\" was voted the thirteenth-highest rated episode out of 24 from the seventh season, according to a \\"Survivor\\" poll by OfficeTally.

She served as a Senator on the Industrial and Commercial Panel from April 2011 to March 2020. Prior to her election to the Seanad she was a member of Dublin City Council from 2009 to 2011 for the South East Inner City electoral area where she was elected on the last count over 200 votes short of a quota. Originally from County Mayo, she studied law in National University of Ireland, Galway and is a practising solicitor. She was the Fine Gael Seanad spokesperson on Arts and Culture. Noone stood for the D√°il in the 2016 general election in the four seater Dublin West constituency but was eliminated after the second count with 1,074 first preference votes. She was later nominated for the Seanad and was elected on the 26th count. After being elected to her second term in Seanad √âireann, she was appointed by the Taoiseach as Deputy Leader of Seanad √âireann in July 2016. In 2017, Noone was chair of the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment, which recommended that it be repealed. Noone was then one of the primary members of Fine Gael who campaigned for a yes vote in the subsequent referendum of 2018, which ultimately lead to the repeal of the amendment in Ireland. She was an unsuccessful candidate for the Dublin Bay North constituency at the 2020 general election, and lost her seat at the 2020 Seanad Election. Controversies In 2015, Noone called for Mixed Martial Arts to be banned in Ireland, calling it a \\"vile so-called sport\\", and announced she had sent a letter to the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Paschal Donohoe asking for his view on the idea. This was met with widespread criticism in Ireland. During an interview with Ryan Tubridy on the matter, it was revealed Noone she had never once seen an MMA match, was not familiar with how the sport operated, and at points seemed to confuse it with professional wrestling, believing the fights to be pre-determined. Following the interview Noone made an about-face, admitting she had \\"jumped the gun\\" on the issue. Later that month, she called for the Irish Sports Council to recognise MMA. In 2018, Noone was accused of being ageist after she described a priest from County Mayo as an \\"octogenarian\\" on her Twitter page. Her comment concerned the priest's homily during Easter Sunday mass at Knock Shrine, County Mayo in which he indirectly outlined the churches anti-abortion stance in the run-up to the referendum on abortion in May 2018. Noone was criticised over censuring the well-established opinions of the Catholic Church on the subject while voluntarily attending the service. She defended her comments before apologising and deleting the comment on Twitter, citing she \\"overreached\\" and that \\"all opinions should be voiced\\".https://twitter.com/catherineanoone/status/981183158283587584?lang=en In the run-up to the 2020 general election, she was criticised for tweeting a photograph of her campaign van parked on a footpath. Among those critical of her actions, and her response to criticism, was disability activist Joanne O'Riordan who accused Senator Noone of making \\"the lives of people with disabilities harder to live\\". Noone initially tweeted that people should \\"get a grip\\" and cease complaining, but then deleted the tweet, and she later apologised. In the same election campaign, she referred to the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar as \\"autistic\\", before denying having said it. Having been made aware that her remarks were recorded, she said that she didn't mean to use the word in that context and gave examples of potentially offensive words that could be used out of context, including \\"special\\" and \\"nigger\\". She then clarified that she would \\"never use the n-word\\", and said it was a bad example. On 28 January 2020 she issued an apology. The apology was not accepted by leading autism and Asperger campaigner Fiona Ferris, the deputy chief executive of AsIAm, an autism charity who called for Noone and other politicians to learn about autism. Ferris added \\"If we go about the attitude that people can say whatever they want and then totally withdraw a statement, I mean, the world would not be a very nice place.\\" Carly Bailey, a candidate in the 2020 election and a parent of a son with autism added in separate comments that \\"her words have hurt a great many people on the autism spectrum and their families.\\" She lost her seat at the 2020 Seanad election and was eliminated on the 14th count.
