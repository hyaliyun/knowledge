It induces mydriasis. It also has been investigated for use in the treatment of congestive heart failure. It acts on D1 and Œ± receptors as an agonist. Ibopamine was first prepared by Casagrande and co-workers. Instilled at 2% concentration, ibopamine exhibits several functions at ocular level such as pre- and post-operative mydriatic activity, D1 dopaminergic activity, etc.  Pharmacokinetics  Due to the esterases existing in the aqueous humour and ocular tissues, ibopamine can be rapidly hydrolysed to epinine which is the active molecule responsible for the mydriatic effect. The epinine, an analogue of dopamine, can stimulate dopamine receptors and to a lesser degree adrenergic receptors. Thus it is believed that epinine is the pharmacologically active moiety. It has been shown that the half-life of ibopamine is short to about 2 minutes in the aqueous humour owing to the fast hydrolysis. So ibopamine can not be found in the aqueous humor after instillation.  Pharmacodynamics  After being hydrolysed to epinine, ibopamine is able to stimulate the alpha-adrenergic and D1 dopaminergic receptors, thereby exhibiting mydriatic effects. In some randomized clinical trials, the D1 dopaminergic activity of ibopamine led to an increased production of aqueous humour and intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open- angle glaucoma (POAG) patients.  Toxicology  At systemic and local levels, ibopamine has been proved to be of low toxicity. It is well tolerated since no obvious changes to the haematological and behavioural parameters have been observed after administration. Ibopamine eye drop at 2% concentration, containing 1 mg of the compound, did not show any significant systemic side- effects and tachyphylaxis phenomena whereas the oral dosage is higher than 400 mg per day.  Clinical Use  A fast and short-lasting mydriasis can be induced by ibopamine without systemic side-effects.

The site is now a retail shopping mall, known as Eglinton Town Centre. History The plant began building Frigidaire refrigerators in 1952 then started as an automotive components manufacturing plant in 1963 before being converted into a van assembly plant. The plant produced GM vans as well as GM and Chevrolet cube van cabs and chassis. In 1986, the one-millionth van was produced at the Scarborough van plant. Around Thanksgiving of 1989, General Motors announced that they would be closing the van plant in Scarborough, and awarding the van contract to Flint Truck Assembly. The last van rolled off the Scarborough line on May 6, 1993. Production was then transferred to Flint Truck Assembly and the process of dismantling the plant began. After three years at Flint, the van division moved to Wentzville Assembly in Missouri, in July 1996.

The couple were unable to marry because of the financial settlement linked to the will of Rembrandt's deceased wife Saskia, but they remained together until Hendrickje's death. In 1654 she gave birth to Rembrandt's daughter Cornelia. In the later years of their relationship Hendrickje managed Rembrandt's business affairs together with the painter's son Titus. Hendrickje is widely believed to have modelled for several of Rembrandt's works and to be depicted in some Tronie portraits. However, her role as Rembrandt's model is disputed by some critics. Life=Youth Hendrickje was born in the garrison city of Bredevoort, Gelderland, the daughter of sergeant Stoffel Stoffelse and Mechteld Lamberts. Sergeant Stoffel Stoffelse was Jager (hunter) for the castle at Bredevoort and so was also nicknamed Jeger, with his children nicknamed 'Jegers', but always officially referred to as 'Stoffels'. Hendrickje had three brothers: Hermen, Berent and Frerick. Hermen and Berent were longtime soldiers in Bredevoort, never serving elsewhere. Berent and Frerick both died young. Hendrickje had a sister, Martijne Jegers, and perhaps also another sister, Margriete. Martijne married Jan Kerstens Pleckenpoel from Lichtenvoorde, who was another soldier in Bredevoort. After his death Martijne remarried, to Berent van Aelten. Hendrickje's father almost certainly died in July 1646, the victim of an explosion of the gunpowder tower in Bredevoort. In January 1647, after the normal mourning time of half a year, his widow Mechteld Lamberts remarried to a neighbour, Jacob van Dorsten, a widower with three young children. As a consequence of her mother's marriage, Hendrickje seems to have been constrained to leave home for Amsterdam. Relationship with Rembrandt Hendrickje obtained work as Rembrandt's housekeeper, and seems to have lived with him from approximately 1647, at first as a maid, but fast becoming much more. This led to an acrimonious fallout with Rembrandt's previous live-in lover Geertje Dircx, who sued Rembrandt for breach of promise in 1649, and demanded maintenance payments from him.Paul Crenshaw, Rembrandt's Bankruptcy: The Artist, His Patrons, and the Art World in Seventeenth-Century Holland, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.41. Hendrickje testified in the case, confirming that a financial agreement had been reached with Geertje.Rembrandt ‚Äî Chronology 1636-1650. Mystudios.com, retrieved June 6, 2011 In the same year Hendrickje returned to Bredevoort for the summer (possibly with Rembrandt accompanying her), and is there mentioned as a witness to a christening in the Bredevoorts church records. The Eighty Years' War was past, and peace was finally reaching even the eastern Netherlands. In 1654, when she was pregnant with Rembrandt's daughter, Hendrickje had to appear before the Council of the Reformed Church for \\"living in sin\\" with Rembrandt, who was a widower and 20 years her senior. She admitted to \\"unwedded cohabitation\\" with Rembrandt and was banned from receiving communion. On 30 October 1654, the couple's daughter Cornelia van Rijn was baptized in the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam. Rembrandt and Hendrickje lived together as common law husband and wife until her death in 1663. Initially, Rembrandt's unwillingness to marry Hendrickje had a pecuniary motive: by marrying her he would have forfeited the inheritance of his first wife Saskia van Uylenburgh. Even with this inheritance he had major financial problems, but without it he would have been bankrupt. But then in 1655, Titus ‚Äì the son he had with Saskia ‚Äì turned 14, and thereby eligible by law to make his will. Rembrandt immediately made sure that Titus installed him as his only heir and by that he outwitted Saskia. Still, he did not marry Hendrickje.Driessen, Christoph (2012): Rembrandts vrouwen, p 185. As Rembrandt's dealer By 1656 Rembrandt was forced to declare bankruptcy. In 1658 he lost his house, and he, Hendrickje, Cornelia and Titus moved into rented property. In the same year, Hendrickje, who got along well with Titus, opened an art shop with Titus‚Äô help where she sold Rembrandt‚Äôs paintings. In order to protect him from his money lenders Hendrickje and Titus became his employers. In this way his former maid Hendrickje Stoffels had become his boss ‚Äì at least officially. Her biographer Christoph Driessen believes that Rembrandt‚Äôs noticeable productivity in the early 1660s was caused by the obvious support Hendrickje was rendering him.Driessen, Christoph (2012): Rembrandts vrouwen, p 213. She was organizing his life for him and prevented his complete downfall after his bankruptcy. In 1663, the plague hit Amsterdam and killed thousands. Hendrickje died suddenly at this time, suggesting that she was a victim of the epidemic. She was buried in the Westerkerk in Amsterdam on 24 July 1663. In Rembrandt's art Bathsheba at Her Bath (1654). Though there are no paintings that are explicitly identified as depictions of Hendrickje, there are a number of portraits, nudes and other images which appear to depict the same woman, who is often assumed to be Hendrickje. A portrait in the National Gallery, London is identified as her \\"based on the knowledge of the sitter's relationship with the artist, and the informality and affection with which she is represented.\\" She is seated wearing a fur wrap and jewellery. There are a number of other portrait-like images that appear to depict the same woman. However, Rembrandt scholar Eric Sluijter is sceptical of attempts to identify Hendrickje in Rembrandt's work, writing that, > If one compares the large number of etchings, drawings and paintings with > the purpose of recognizing Hendrickje it appears more often than not that > there is little mutual resemblance between all the candidates. It is > surprising how, still, in recent art historical literature numerous works > are identified as Hendrickje Stoffels as a matter of course.Sluijter, Eric > Jan, Rembrandt and the Female Nude, Amsterdam University Press, 2006, pp. > 329-331. Sluijter suggests that the broad similarity between the faces of women in Rembrandt's paintings suggest that he tended to portray an \\"ideal type\\". Hendrickje is also traditionally identified as the model for a number of nudes, especially the painting Bathsheba at Her Bath. She would have been 28 at the time of the painting. Sluijter has proposed otherwise, stating that Rembrandt would be very unlikely to portray his partner's own recognisable face on nudes to be sold publicly. In later culture Statue of Hendrickje Stoffels at square 't Zand in Bredevoort She appears in several films and television dramas about the life of Rembrandt. She is a character in the 1936 British film Rembrandt, where she is portrayed by Elsa Lanchester. Gisela Uhlen took the role in the 1942 German film Rembrandt. In the 1999 biopic Rembrandt she is played by Romane Bohringer. In Peter Greenaway's film Nightwatching, she is played by Emily Holmes. In television she appears in Portrait by Rembrandt (1952), played by Jennifer Gray. Vera Veroft depicts her as the central character in the 1963 drama Hendrickje Stoffels. She also appears in the Dutch 2011 series Rembrandt en ik, played by Wendell Jaspers. The novel I Am Rembrandt's Daughter is about Hendrickje's daughter Cornelia. Hendrickje appears in flashback scenes. A LINT-24 train, run by the Dutch transportation firm Syntus, is named after her.

He later moved to Mississippi and settled in Houston, where he studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1840 and established a successful law practice. Featherston was elected as a Democrat to the Thirtieth and Thirty-first Congresses (March 4, 1847 - March 3, 1851).Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands.

Two years later, he married Elizabeth McEwen, the daughter of the town's leading merchant. The couple would raise a large family in Holly Springs. Civil War With the secession of Mississippi, Featherston was appointed to visit neutral Kentucky to try to influence Governor Beriah Magoffin into also leading his state from the Union. With the start of the Civil War in May 1861, Featherston was appointed a captain of Confederate States Army infantry. He soon raised a regiment of infantry (17th Mississippi Infantry Regiment) and became its colonel on June 4, 1861. He fought at the First Battle of Manassas.Sifakis, Stewart.

He led a brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia during the Peninsula Campaign and was wounded during the Seven Days Battles at the Battle of Glendale. He then participated in the fighting at the Second Battle of Manassas, as well as at Antietam and Fredericksburg. He was among a number of generals that General Robert E. Lee removed from command or reassigned when he reorganized his army, along with Nathan G. Evans, Thomas F. Drayton, Roger Pryor, and several others. Featherston asked to be returned to his home state because of the growing Union Army threat there.Sifikas suggests that Featherston may have been prompted to make the request. Transferred to Mississippi in early 1863, Featherston assumed command of a brigade of Mississippians in Major General William W. Loring's Division in the army of General Joseph E. Johnston. Featherston's brigade was at the Battle of Champion Hill so it was not with Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton's main force at Vicksburg and was not surrendered with it. Besides the Vicksburg Campaign, Featherston fought in other major campaigns in the Western Theater of the American Civil War, including the Atlanta Campaign in 1864. Loring's men accompanied the Army of Tennessee during John Bell Hood's Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign, or Tennessee Campaign. In the last weeks of the war in April 1865, Featherston commanded a brigade in the Carolinas Campaign and surrendered with Johnston's army in North Carolina.

He was elected to the State House of Representatives in 1876, where he continued his battle against the former Union general. Featherston's wife Elizabeth died at their home of yellow fever in 1878, as did some of their children (four survived).

Biography Born in Beaufort, South Carolina, Elliott attended Beaufort College and Harvard University. He studied law at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, and was admitted to the bar in Charleston in 1861. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War he entered the Confederate States Army as a lieutenant. He served throughout the war, attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. At the close of the war, he returned to Beaufort, where he developed a law practice. Elliott became involved in politics, serving as a member of the State house of representatives in 1866. He served as delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1876. He was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for election in 1884 to the Forty-ninth Congress. Elliott was elected as a Democrat to the Fiftieth Congress (March 4, 1887 ‚Äì March 3, 1889) from South Carolina's 7th congressional district, but the election was contested by Thomas E. Miller. An African American Republican candidate, he alleged electoral fraud, which was prevalent in these years as Democrats struggled to retain control of government. Elliott presented credentials as a Member-elect to the Fifty-first Congress and served from March 4, 1889, until September 23, 1890. Congress determined fraud had taken place, and declared the election won by Thomas E. Miller, who took his seat in late 1890. Elliott was elected to the Fifty-second Congress (March 4, 1891 ‚Äì March 3, 1893). He was not a candidate in 1892. Due to redistricting by the state legislature, Elliott ran in 1894 from South Carolina's 1st congressional district, a black- majority district. He won, but the election was contested by the Republican candidate George W. Murray, an African-American attorney who alleged widespread cases of fraud in the precincts. Elliott presented credentials as a Member-elect to the Fifty-fourth Congress and served from March 4, 1895, until June 4, 1896. Murray presented extensive documentation to Congress of his complaint, and it determined the contested election in Murray's favor; he was seated at the end of the first session. Over the objections of its black voters and politicians, in 1896 South Carolina ratified a new constitution that effectively disfranchised nearly all black citizens as voters. The Republican Party ceased to be competitive in the state. From 1890 to 1908 all states of the former Confederacy passed similar constitutions to disfranchise blacks and many poor whites; the Democrats ruled a one-party region and gained great power in the US Congress by controlling all the region's apportionment although many of its citizens had been excluded from politics. The one-party state was dominated for decades by Democrats, so the important contests took place in the primaries. Elliott was elected to the Fifty-fifth, Fifty-sixth and Fifty-seventh Congresses (March 4, 1897 ‚Äì March 3, 1903). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1902. He ran unsuccessfully that year to gain legislative election to the United States Senate. In 1906 Elliott was appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt as commissioner of the United States to identify and mark the graves of Confederate dead in the North. He directed the operations of this group until his death in Beaufort, South Carolina, on December 7, 1907. He was interred in St. Helena Churchyard.

Born in Wharton in Wharton County west of Houston, Sweeney earned his Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor from the University of Texas at Austin. In his early political years Sweeney served on the staffs of Republican Senator John G. Tower from 1977‚Äì1978, and former Governor John B. Connally, Jr., from 1979 to 1980, when Connally was seeking the 1980 Republican presidential nomination but finished with only one committed delegate. Sweeney served as the director of administrative operations in the Ronald Reagan White House from 1981‚Äì1983. In this capacity he worked directly with John F.W. Rogers and began a long- term association with another well-known Texan, James A. Baker III, then the White House Chief of Staff. In 1984, he unseated Democratic U.S. Representative William Neff \\"Bill\\" Patman in one of the nation's closest congressional elections. In doing so, Sweeney became the first-ever Republican to represent District 14. In his campaign against Patman, Sweeney highlighted his time at the University of Texas Law School and claimed to had been published in the Texas Law Review. These were later proved to be untrue. In June 1986, a Sweeney staffer charged that she had told to work on his campaign or lose his job. Sweeney in reply said- \\"Most of what we are talking about here is junior staff indiscretions by a young staff.\\" Ex-Congressman Patman said of Sweeney, \\"He's very flexible. I'd think he would vote for a Chinese Communist if it would help his cause.Barone, Michael; and Ujifusa, Grant. The Almanac of American Politics 1988', p. 1167. National Journal, 1987. He was appointed to the House Armed Services Committee and became in 1985 one of six freshmen Republican congressmen from Texas infamously known as the Texas Six Pack, including future House Majority Leaders Dick Armey and Tom DeLay. Sweeney served two terms from 1985‚Äì1989, but was unseated in 1988 by Democrat Greg Laughlin. The prior, sprawling, 22-county District 14 has been divided, primarily by the 2003 Texas redistricting, into five different congressional districts today. After his final unsuccessful campaign, Sweeney entered the private practice of law on Wall Street with the international firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle before later heading two businesses in New Jersey and Texas involved in successful restructurings or turnarounds. In 1997 he began what became a seven-year commitment to humanitarian and missionary work, based out of Cairo but also working in over five different Arab countries. A large number of the 400-plus Christians, Muslims and Coptics trained and funded by the Sweeney family continue to work today in Syria, Tunisia, Bahrain, Lebanon and Sudan primarily with schools, clinics, job training, micro-business and tent making enterprises. In 2004 Sweeney was considered for top positions at the Peace Corps and in helping to organize the first democratic Afghan presidential election, 2004 and the Afghan parliamentary election, 2005; but could not come to terms with the Bush Administration. As of 2011 he operates the Washington-based Paraclete Group which funds large infrastructure projects in developing nations that are typically paired with select in-country charities or international NGO groups. He serves on four non-profit or business boards, and he and his wife split time between Bethesda, Maryland and Houston. He has four children.

Callaway's tenure was marked by outspoken fiscal conservatism and sharp questioning of every federal expenditure. This included vigorous opposition to huge river and harbor appropriations bills such as making the Trinity and Brazos rivers navigable. Callaway came to national attention in 1916 with his opposition to the naval appropriation bill. He believed that a civilian army could repel any invasion, that battleships had been made obsolete by submarines, and that the military expenditures called for by the Preparedness Movement unduly favored munition makers. Some of his strong words against other congressmen on the subject were expunged from the Congressional Record.Miller TL. CALLAWAY, FRANCIS OSCAR. The Handbook of Texas Online. In 1917 he charged that leading business interests were purchasing newspapers to advance the preparedness campaign, which led his colleague J. Hampton Moore to call for an investigation.Special to the New York Times. (February 14, 1917). Moore Asks for Inquiry Into Charges on Preparedness Campaign. New York Times. His opposition to preparedness was a major factor in his loss of the renomination bid to James Clifton Wilson, and he retired to Comanche on March 3, 1917.

It was opened in 1792 and was the first watershed canal allowing boats to pass from the north of France to the south. It is long and has 61 locks. Most of its traffic was generated by now abandoned coal mines at Montceau-les-Mines. Route of the canal History The canal was first suggested during the 16th century, under King Francis I and a detailed plan was prepared by Adam de Craponne in the time of Henry II. But nothing more happened until the Chief Engineer of Burgundy, √âmiland Gauthey obtained building powers in 1783. He selected a route which joined the valleys of the Loire and Sa√¥ne and provided adequate water supplies at the summit. The first stone was laid in 1784 by Prince de Cond√© and despite the intervention of exceptional floods on the Loire in 1790, which totally wrecked a new port in Digoin, and the Revolution, the works were completed in 1792. The canal brought new life to the Charollais and within 20 years of opening, many villages had sprung up along its banks. But the amount of traffic that could be carried towards Paris was limited by the fickle nature of the Loire, and it was estimated that the opening of the Canal Lat√©ral √† la Loire would triple the toll income of the canal. This happened in 1838, five years after the establishment of coal mines at Montceau-les-Mines, and this increased the traffic until in 1936 some 1,622,000 tonnes of coal was carried on the canal. The coal traffic declined during the 1980s, and the mines were closed in 2000. Layout Originally the canal climbed 77.64 m from the Loire to the summit and dropped 130.90 m to the Sa√¥ne, through a total of 80 locks. These were enlarged in 1880-1900 when they were all rebuilt to the Freycinet gauge and the number of locks was reduced. During the 1950s about 5 km of canal in the centre of Chalon was replaced by a new cut upstream of the town with a single 10.76 m deep lock replacing 3 locks.

The series is based on Avalanche Press' Great War at Sea. The two series share many features although they are separate both from a rules standpoint and a scale standpoint (see SOPAC below). Game Mechanics The SWWAS series simulates World War II naval combat using a dual operational/tactical system with the following characteristics: * Each major surface unit (Aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and fleet destroyers) are represented with a single 1\\"/.5\\" rectangular counter containing the ship's statistics (below). * Minor surface warships (escorts) as well as auxiliaries and merchant ships, are portrayed via 1/2\\" square counters with the associated statistics. * Aircraft squadrons (representing from 8‚Äì24 aircraft), as well as the game's various status markers, are also 1/2\\" square counters. The game provides highly abstracted statistics on the various counters for the following: For ships: * Surface gunnery factors, divided into \\"Primary\\" (Battleship-caliber guns of 12‚Äì18\\" bore), \\"Secondary\\" (cruiser guns from 5\\"-10\\" bore) and \\"Tertiary\\" (minor guns from 3\\"‚Äì5\\" caliber) ratings. * Armour * Torpedoes or mines * Anti-aircraft factors * Speed For air units: * Air-to-air combat factors * Air-to-surface combat factors * Land-bombardment factors * Range Each game is played on an operational map divided into a grid of squares, each representing a 36-mile- wide area. Unit counters do not move directly on the operational map, but rather are represented by fleet markers. Players plot their unit's moves, and track damage and fuel consumption, on separate data sheets for their associated fleets. Each provided operational scenario will task each player with specific objectives - run a convoy to a port, prevent that convoy passing, bring the opposing fleet to battle, and so on. When two opposing fleets come into contact on the operational map, combat switches to the tactical map. The tactical map is a grid of hexagons on which individual warship counters can manoeuvre. When units come within range of each other, their gunnery and other factors are translated into numbers of dice rolled to attempt to hit enemy targets. These die rolls are subject to various modifiers for environmental, technical and other factors. Hits, especially those which penetrate armour, will gradually erode the ability of a ship to fight, and ultimately can sink it. Once play on the tactical map terminates it resumes on the operational map until the next time two fleets come into contact. Titles In series=SOPAC SOPAC was the first Second World War at Sea game and extended the Great War at Sea series to World War II. SOPAC was released in 2000 and eventually sold out in 2004. The game had 350 counters, 1 operational map and 20+ scenarios. SOPAC's scale was different from that of the Great War at Sea series because the area on the map could not fit using the earlier scale on the available map size. This means that the two related series' can not use each other's maps. Eastern Fleet Eastern Fleet was the second game in the series and covered the British Eastern Fleet's operations in the Indian Ocean. The game has 210 counters, 1 operational map and 10 scenarios. Midway Midway covers the Battle of Midway as well as other scenarios in that area and period of the war. The game has 490 counters, 1 operational map and 11 scenarios. Bomb Alley Bomb Alley was the fourth game and according to Avalanche Press, \\"the most ambitious\\" (although that title would only last until Leyte Gulf was released). It covered the entire naval campaign in the Mediterranean including the Malta convoys. The game had 840 counters, 2 operational maps and 50 scenarios. The game is out of print, but Avalanche state a replacement is planned. Leyte Gulf Leyte Gulf was the first game produced through Avalanche Press's Classic Wargames program. The game had 2,170 counters, 3 operational maps and 22 scenarios. Leyte Gulf was Avalanche Press's largest and most expensive game and is now out of print. Strike South Strike South covers Japanese operations in 1941 and early 1942, including the invasions of Malaya, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia). The game has 420 counters, 2 operational maps and 15 scenarios. Bismarck Bismarck is the first game in this series set in the Atlantic Ocean and covers the operations of German commerce raiders from 1939 to 1941. The game includes the German battleships Bismarck, Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, and Gneisenau as well as the aircraft carriers Graf Zeppelin (as well as her never-completed sister Peter Strasser). The game has 490 counters, 2 operational maps and 12 scenarios. Cone of Fire Cone of Fire contains both Great War at Sea and Second World War at Sea pieces for South American nations. The game had 490 counters, 6 operational maps and 42 scenarios (21 for each game system). It was produced under the Classic Wargames program released in mid-2007 and is now out of print. Arctic Convoy Arctic Convoy covers the Arctic Convoy operations as Allied, primarily British, convoys tried to fight their way to northern Soviet ports against German opposition. The game has 550 counters, 2 operational maps and 24 scenarios. Coral Sea Coral Sea is the introductory game for the Second World War at Sea series and covers the Battle of the Coral Sea. It uses a small box size and comes with a new edition of the series rules and shares a sheet of counters with Pacific Crossroads. The game has 145 counters, 1 operational map and 4 scenarios. Horn of Africa Horn of Africa covers operations in the area of the Horn of Africa and Red Sea between the Royal Navy and Italian Regia Marina. It comes with 100 counters, one operational map and 25 scenarios. Sea of Iron Sea of Iron covers operations in the Baltic in World War II, covering the German, Russian, Swedish and Polish fleets. It comes with 560 counters, one operational map and 30 scenarios Supplements Like Great War at Sea, Second World War at Sea has spawned several supplements. Distant Oceans Now out of print, Distant Oceans added scenarios to the existing games at the time it was printed as well as featuring several background articles. It featured counter graphics that gamers could use to create counters for the Yugoslav navy, however, newer supplements feature actual counters. Because of this, Distant Oceans will not be reprinted. East of Suez East of Suez was released in early 2007 and featured the British Pacific fleet in both real and fictional operations in 1944 and 1945. Leyte Gulf is required to play all of the scenarios and other games in the series are needed for some of the scenarios. The supplement is no longer available. Black Sea Fleets Black Sea Fleets adds Soviet naval forces to the game, concentrating on the Black Sea. The supplement also contains counters for the Turkish and Romanian fleets and air units. Strait of Magellan Strait of Magellan was a scenario-only supplement featuring 10 scenarios introducing the major powers onto the Cone of Fire maps. It is no longer available. Combined Fleet Combined Fleet was a scenario-only supplement featuring additional scenarios for Coral Sea and Midway. It is no longer available. Imperial and Royal Navy Imperial and Royal Navy was one of a series of alternate history products originally offered by download, with counters to be printed and produced at home, a printed version was briefly offered. The assumption was that Austro-Hungary had survived World War I and had upgraded the KuK fleet for operations in World War II. The supplement had 210 counters and is no longer available, having been replaced by The Habsburg Fleet. The Tsar's Navy The Tsar's Navy was one of a series of alternate history products originally offered by download, with counters to be printed and produced at home. The assumption was that the Revolution had failed, Russia had seized control of the Bosphorus and the Imperial Russian Black Sea Fleet had received greater emphasis than the Soviet Black Sea Fleet did historically. The supplement had 210 counters and 10 scenarios and is no longer available. Spice Islands Spice Islands was one of a series of alternate history products originally offered by download, with counters to be printed and produced at home. The assumption was that the Dutch fleet had been greatly expanded to provide security for the Dutch East Indies. The supplement had 210 counters and 10 scenarios and is no longer available. The Kaiser's Fleet The Kaiser's Fleet was the first supplement based on an alternate history Avalanche call the Second Great War, with World War I assumed to have been brought to a halt in 1916 by US President Woodrow Wilson's peace proposals. This leaves Imperial Germany in existence, along with the Imperial German Fleet, and its patron Kaiser Wilhelm. The Imperial fleet's development is extrapolated to 1940 at which point the Second Great War breaks out between the Central Powers and the Entente, with the Entente reinforced by Poland and later Holland. The supplement had 210 counters and 25 scenarios covering operations in the Atlantic between the Imperial Germans, France and later Britain. The Habsburg Fleet Effectively a second edition of 'Imperial and Royal Navy', this abandoned the prior supplement's background for that of the Second Great War, with the development of the Austro-Hungarian KuK Fleet handled in a similar fashion to that of the Imperial German fleet in The Kaiser's Fleet'. The supplement has 285 counters, expanding on Imperial and Royal Fleet with a further sheet of counters covering British, French, Italian and Turkish, and additional Austro-Hungarian vessels and aircraft. There are 30 scenarios covering operations in the Mediterranean. Royal Netherlands Navy Effectively a second edition of Spice Islands, this abandoned the prior supplement's background for that of the Second Great War, with the development of the Dutch navy handled in a similar fashion to that of the Austro-Hungarian and Imperial German fleets. The supplement has 300 counters, expanding on Spice Islands with a further sheet of counters covering French, British, German and Japanese vessels and aircraft. There are 30 scenarios covering operations in the South China Sea and Dutch East Indies. South American Navies A promotional supplement restricted to Avalanche's 'Gold Club' discount scheme, South American Navies was available for order for a restricted period over Christmas 2015 and early 2016. The supplement expands the Argentinian, Brazilian and Chilean fleets from Cone of Fire to fit into the Second Great War background. It has 90 counters and 10 scenarios and Avalanche have stated it will not be available after initial orders have been fulfilled. Future Products A boxed game entitled Plan Z is set for 2016 launch. This will cover the greatly expanded German fleet which was to be built under the eponymous plan. In early 2016 this was expected to contain 630 counters and 30 scenarios/ Future products in the Second World War at Sea series are expected to include a new version of U.S. Navy Plan Orange. Replacements for SOPAC - South Pacific, Bomb Alley - La Regia Marina, and Midway - Midway Deluxe, have been announced for projected availability in late 2016.

It was located at Six Flags Magic Mountain where it operated from 1986 through 1988 (where it was known as Shockwave); Six Flags Great Adventure from 1990 until September 1992 (where it was known as Shockwave); and at Six Flags AstroWorld from 1993 until 2005. After being moved to Six Flags Darien Lake, it was never assembled, but put into storage in a lot across from the park and scrapped around 2018. Batman The Escape was designed by Intamin and featured one loop. This loop was followed by a diving turnaround, a midcourse brake run and a helix through the loop before returning through a straight away back to the final brakes. History= Six Flags Magic Mountain  The ride was built in 1986 for Six Flags Magic Mountain where it was known as Shockwave. It was one of the first stand-up roller coasters in the world. The coaster was a very popular attraction at Magic Mountain regardless of its roughness due to the positions of the restraints. At the time, Six Flags had a ride rotation program, in which some coasters would remain at a park for a couple years and then transferred to another park.  Six Flags Great Adventure  Late in 1988, the Shockwave was closed, in 1989 removed, and in 1990 relocated to Six Flags Great Adventure and opened there. At Magic Mountain, the former Shockwave location would be where the California Psyclone wooden twister coaster would be built in 1991. At Great Adventure, the Shockwave opened a month into the 1990 season and was plagued with many technical difficulties. The ride continued to be quite rough but had some of the longest lines in the park. At times Shockwave did not open until noon while the rest of the park opened at 10:00 am. It was still a very popular ride at the park, like when it was at Six Flags Magic Mountain. The ride was painted blue instead of its prior color, black. The restraints also had been changed while at Six Flags Great Adventure, removing the padding. In June 1992, it was announced that Six Flags Great Adventure would add Batman The Ride, a state-of-the-art steel inverted coaster for the 1993 season and begin building it on the then-current site of Lightning Loops. Lightning Loops was shut down at the end of July to be disassembled and for construction of Batman to begin. Then in August, the park was told it would also be losing Shockwave, which closed after Labor Day weekend. The site is now the location of the paid attraction, Slingshot.  AstroWorld  Batman The Escape, 2005 Shockwave was dismantled in September 1992 and relocated to AstroWorld. The coaster was painted a blue shade of white, renamed and rethemed \\"Batman The Escape\\". A Batcave adjacent to the coaster was created out of an artificial mountain for a previous attraction and heavily themed as guests would prepare to ride the coaster. Batman The Escape would open on April 24, 1993. In 1998, the theming at the Batcave would be eliminated. On September 12, 2005, Six Flags CEO, Kieran Burke, announced that AstroWorld would be closed and demolished at the end of the 2005 season. The company cited issues such as the park's performance, and parking issues involving the Houston Texans football team, Reliant Stadium, and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo leveraged with the estimated value of the property upon which the park was located. Company executives were expecting to receive upwards of $150 million for the real estate, but ended up receiving less than half of that amount. After spending $20 million to demolish the park and clear the land, Six Flags received $77 million when the bare property was sold to a development corporation in 2006 (reported in a corporate earnings report). This transaction contributed to the decision by shareholders of the company to remove CEO, Kieran Burke, from his position on the board. He was replaced by Mark Shapiro formerly of Disney and ESPN.  Six Flags Darien Lake, scrapped  After being dismantled, Six Flags placed the coaster in storage at Six Flags Darien Lake. It remained there in storage through the sale of the park to PARC Management and CNL Income Properties. However, no mechanical parts existed. As of 2018, the ride has been removed from Darien Lake‚Äôs property and sold for scrap. Facts *The ride featured a vertical loop. *The ride was painted blue and black when it opened. It was painted white in 1994 but was re-painted yellow and black in 2004.

They had appeared in various magazines throughout the early 1970s with the exceptions of \\"Paulie Charmed the Sleeping Woman\\" which originally appeared in 1962 and \\"Ecowareness\\" which was previously unpublished. According to the author's introduction, the book was originally conceived in 1970 as a call to action that would contain cautionary tales from Ellison's previous books. Over the ensuing protracted gestation period of four years, however, Harlan Ellison's personal outlook had gradually changed. This resulted in the inclusion of previously uncollected stories with underlying themes of disillusionment and futility in rebelling. Classic examples along these lines are the dystopian \\"Knox\\" and \\"Silent in Gehenna\\". Other notable stories include \\"One Life, Furnished in Early Poverty\\" which depicts a man meeting a younger version of himself as a child and finding himself unable to ease the pains of his own childhood. The encounter begins at Lathrop Grade School in Painesville, Ohio where the author himself attended elementary school and experienced many emotionally painful and physically brutal encounters with antisemitic prejudice recounted in the introduction. The foreword by fiction author Michael Crichton paints a picture of Ellison as an energetic, eclectic, uncompromising, and sometimes obstinate individual. It also describes the resistance and resentment felt by many of the people who have worked with Ellison in the movie business.

Born a Jew in the Venice Ghetto, he was taken in by a Christian priest and baptized. The Christians later refused to let him return to his Jewish family, saying that giving him back to the 'Christ-killers' would damn his soul to Hell. Being unable to reunite with his family left him psychologically scarred. When he grew up he became the leader of the Spanish Inquisition, and oversaw the Inquisition from Domdaniel. He was ordered to execute the witchbreed, but hid those who could pass off as normal. Enrique's only known followers are his children Petros and Sister Wanda (Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, who are unaware of their parentage. Enrique is, and chooses not to tell them), and his spy in the Vatican, Toad. Enrique uses his position to further his needs and curry favor with influential figures, including King James of Scotland; towards this end, he has all 'witchbreed' killed. While Enrique is attempting to have Angel killed, the witchbreed is rescued by Iceman and Cyclops. This does not deter Enrique, who continues on his path until Toad is discovered to be a witchbreed by the Pope's men, and to save his own life he sells out Enrique, Petros and Wanda. The trio are set to be sacrificed, but Enrique escapes and pursues many of the other heroes to America. However, the New World is under the threat of impending doom, and Richard Reed determines that to restore balance, Enrique has to co-operate. With the help of Nick Fury and Thor, Enrique participates in the restoring of the world. He then tells his enemy, Carlos Javier, to train Petros and Wanda. Age of Apocalypse In the reality of the Age of Apocalypse, Magneto founded Earth-295's X-Men after the death of his friend Charles Xavier, at the hands of Xavier's own son David who traveled back in time to kill Magneto hoping to fulfill his \\"father's greatest wish\\". He and the X-Men fight against the forces of this world's Apocalypse who, having been wakened early by the battle between David and Magneto, was able to take over North America in the absence of Xavier's interference. Holocaust, Sinister, Mikhail Rasputin and Abyss are Apocalypse's horsemen, and while Magneto's team is composed not only of X-Men but also of standard \\"evil\\" mutants from traditional timelines, including mutants such as Sabretooth, other individuals who are \\"heroes\\" in Earth-616 serve Apocalypse in this timeline. In this timeline, Magneto is married to his former prot√©g√© Rogue, and being able to touch due to his magnetic mastery over his own bio-aura, are able to have a son together who they name Charles, in honor of Xavier. Magneto and Charles are later personally captured by Apocalypse himself,Amazing X-Men vol.1 #3 (1995) though they are rescued by Rogue and the other X-Men, including Nate Grey, who raid Apocalypse's citadel in a desperate final attempt to save all of reality from M'Kraan crystallization.X-Men: Omega (1995) As the X-Men use the M'Kraan Crystal to send Bishop back in time to return the timeline to its proper course, Magneto and Nate Grey square off in one last fight against Apocalypse and Holocaust. Nate Grey jams the original fragment of the M'Kraan Crystal into Holocaust, crystallizing them both, while the battle between Magneto and Apocalypse ends with Magneto using his control of magnetism to rip the techno-organic Apocalypse in half. Following this, Manhattan Island and most of North America are enveloped in nuclear bombs. It is later revealed that the day was saved by Jean Grey, who manifested the Phoenix Force at the point of near-death. However, nobody realizes this, and everyone assumes it is Magneto, who immediately becomes a reluctant hero to a grateful humanity. The X-Men then help rebuild America in record time, and Magneto is made Federal Director of Mutant Affairs of the government of the newly restored United States of America, with the X-Men deputized as a mutant police force sanctioned to bring to justice the remaining survivors of Apocalypse's regime. Just as the burden of maintaining the deception eventually begins to take its toll on an extremely stressed Magneto, he is secretly visited by Mister Sinister (who everyone has assumed to have been killed by X-Man), who reveals to him just what really happened when the bombs fell. Sinister offers his silence in exchange for Magneto's promises not to go looking for him and to let him have the body of Jean Grey, who is actually still alive. Magneto is forced to accept for the sake of preserving the current fragile peace of global mutant- human relations, which had improved primarily due to the general public's mistaken assumption that he had personally saved the world by singlehandedly stopping nuclear armageddon. A subsequent scheme of revenge orchestrated by an embittered former X-Man later forces Magneto to confess the truth to the rest of the shocked team of X-Men. He is nearly killed by an enraged Weapon X, but is saved by the intervention of his wife. The X-Men then proceed to stop Sinister from conquering the world using his own version of the Sinister Six (which consisted of brainwashed mutants, including this world's version of Dark Phoenix) in a violent confrontation filled with many deaths, including those of both Gambit and Quicksilver. Grief-stricken and guilt-ridden, Magneto then voluntarily goes into U.S. government custody as penance for his deception. While in jail awaiting trial, Magneto appoints a restored Jean Grey as the new leader of the X-Men in his absence. Days of Future Past In this possible future, when Sentinels rule North America, Magneto is in a wheelchair and, like the rest of the surviving X-Men save Wolverine, held in a mutant concentration camp, his powers suppressed by an inhibitor collar. It is implied but never stated that he devised the X-Men's plan to escape from the camp and send Kate Pryde's spirit back through time. When Franklin Richards is able to disable the inhibitors and the other X-Men flee the camp, Magneto stays behind to cover their escape and is presumably killed by the Sentinels. Earth-110 Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants allied with Doctor Doom, Hulk, Namor, Red Skull, and Ultron in a plot to take over Manhattan.Fantastic Four: Big Town #1 Magneto was defeated by Mockingbird.Fantastic Four: Big Town #4 Earth X In Earth X, Magneto resides in Sentinel City, a city he constructed after drawing all the Sentinels to the Savage Land and using the extra forces there, destroying all the sentinels and turning them into a city. He rules there with Toad. After the Celestial is removed from the Earth, the resulting shifts due to the removal of the vibranium within the Earth shifts the magnetic poles such that Magneto is depowered and Toad is given all of Magneto's powers. Toad forces Magneto to constantly dance and humiliates him at every opportunity by forcing him to become a Jester. When the vibranium is restored, Magneto's powers are restored as well. Magneto then joins the other heroes in the fight against Creel. Exiles/Magnus In the Exiles comics, an alternative good version of Magneto living on Earth-27 falls in love with Rogue. Magneto uses his powers to alter Rogue's DNA so they can touch and kiss. They have a child together, a son whom they name Magnus, who has both his magnetic powers and a white streak in his auburn hair. Magnus quickly shows the potential to be an even more powerful master of magnetism than his father. Unfortunately, during his teens, Magnus develops his second mutation, which turns anyone touched by his skin into immobile steel, never dying. Like his mother he cannot touch anyone. Magnus lives a lonely life, and is eventually forced to join the Exiles, a group of alternative reality mutants forced to repair broken realities. The Exiles first mission involves a reality where all superpowered individuals have been either exterminated or imprisoned. They are instructed to save the one individual who can save this broken reality. They mistakenly release a totally evil and depraved version of Professor Xavier who uses his mental powers without remorse or mercy. Magnus dies on the team's mission after giving his life to stop a bomb set by the leader of high security prison.Exiles #1-2 Later the Exiles learn that Magnus' corpse is trapped inside the Crystal Palace. They free it and return it to his homeworld, where Magnus is buried by his parents.Exiles #83 Marvel Zombies In the reality of Marvel Zombies, Magneto and his Acolytes were a few of the survivors following a plague that caused an undead-like effect in \\"super- powered beings\\". It is revealed in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days that he and Fabian Cortez made a deal with an unknown entity from another universe to damage the Earth to let mutants become the dominant force. Though they believe it is the zombie Sentry, the zombified Reed Richards later hypothesizes that it was with an entirely different universe unrelated to the zombie plague and that Sentry's arrival was a coincidence misleading Magneto into believing he had led to the Earth' ruin.Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution Regretful that he has doomed the entire planet and his Acolytes either dead or having retreated to Asteroid M, Magneto returns to earth to help any non-infected beings left. He eventually hides out with a small group of human survivors, a female cop, a lone father and his daughter. He saves Reed Richards of the Ultimate Universe from the Zombies and brings him to their hideout, a subway station. Magneto acknowledges the irony of working with normal humans, but believing that \\"Beggars can't be choosers when you're down to the last few people alive\\". Magneto learns the zombified Fantastic Four of his reality had tricked Reed, in a plan to allow the zombies to cross to Reed's universe for more victims. Reed and Magneto work together, first getting diabetic medicine for the young girl, then taking the civilians back to the dimensional teleporter that Reed had emerged from, although they require the aid of the rest of the Fantastic Four to do so (Magneto is the first person outside of the team to explicitly refer to the Ultimate Universe's Fantastic Four as 'superheroes'). After Richards escapes with all three of the civilian survivors and his teammates, Magneto stays behind, not wanting to die but acknowledging that he is the only one capable of destroying Richards' dimensional transporter so that the zombies won't infect Earth-1610. Magneto destroys the device and flees from the zombies. He is contacted by the Acolytes in Asteroid M, who offer to send a shuttle down; Magneto, however, refuses to let them risk infection, and says that he will find a way up to them somehow. As the battle with the zombies takes place, Magneto decapitates the zombie Hawkeye with Colonel America's shield. He attempts to decapitate the Colonel as well but only succeeds in slicing off the top half of Colonel America's brain. The latter becomes very annoyed at this, demanding double rations when Magneto is caught. Magneto is soon confronted by more zombie hordes, whom he only destroys but with little success as result of them being undead, and prepares for a final showdown. He drops many of them with a rain of metallic debris, but is swiftly bitten by the zombie Wasp. Magneto is pounced upon and devoured before turning, his last words being \\"I hope you choke on me!\\" just as Thor and Hulk tear him in two as the rest of the group descends upon him.Marvel Zombies #1 In Marvel Zombies 2, a group known as the \\"Acolytes\\" established a cult to Magneto in New Wakanda. In Marvel Zombies vs. Age of Ultron Magneto is revealed to have become a zombie. Magneto is transformed into a robot zombie hybrid. MC2 While he has yet to be seen in the MC2 comics, Magneto has inspired a few possible successors: *Magneta- Also known as the Mistress of Magnetism. She first appeared in the comic J2, where she attempts to start her own superhero team. She later takes up crime as a new member of the Revengers in Last Planet Standing. *Charlie Philip- He first appeared in Spider-Girl #44, where he wanted to become a crime fighter with magnetic power (With a device he created to wear). He wanted to become Magneto, but without the bad attitude. He came across Spider-Girl when he tried to steal a superhero costume as he had no money. His second appearance was in Spider-Girl #92 where he tried to secure/steal funds to become a superhero, this time posing as Magneto. He is stopped by Spider-Girl and X-People member Push. Mutant X In the Mutant X universe, Magneto is leader of the X-Men, just as he was for a time in the mainstream Earth-616 universe.Mutant X #9-12 Several of the X-Men, however, feel that he has strayed from Professor X's dream and split off to form a separate mutant team, the Six.Mutant X #1 (October 1998) Powerless In Powerless (which takes place in a world without superpowers), Magneto appears as a middle-aged American senator named Eric Magnus. He is involved with a shadowy government conspiracy involving mentally conditioned assassins, and is ultimately killed by Logan after arranging the death of Charles Xavier.Powerless #3-5 Ruins Warren Ellis's Ruins is a two-part parody of Marvels where the circumstances that gave the normal Marvel Universe's heroes their powers instead led to more realistic effects causing horrific deformities and deaths. The version of Magneto seen in Ruins is shown as a demonstrator protesting the corrupt regime of President Charles Xavier. His powers are uncontrollable, causing him to wear a magnetic-dampening harness around his chest. When a government agent pushes him aside and breaks the device, Magneto unwillingly brings destruction to an airport and kills the agent with a massive neural hemorrhage brought on by intense electromagnets. He meets his end when a plane gets magnetised towards him, killing many in the process. Ultimate Marvel Magneto on the cover of Ultimate X-Men In the Ultimate Marvel comics, Magneto, a.k.a. Erik Lehnsherr's background differs greatly from his mainstream history. He has given contradictory accounts of his past; he once told Cyclops how his entire family had died in a large scale genocide (this could indicate a similar origin as the main continuity Magneto, only that he was a descendant of Shoah survivors, not a Shoah survivor himself), but he also claimed to come from a rich family with whom he no longer spoke; although it is possible the family he mentioned at that point was an adopted family, rather than his true family. In Ultimate Origins #3, it is revealed that his parents were Weapon X agents, and that he was responsible for their deaths. His wife's name was Isabelle (whom he still possibly loves), and is aware from the beginning of his familial relationship with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. It is also noted that he verbally mistreats them, hinting that he regards them as a living reminder of having an inter-species relationship. An arrogant fantasist who gradually sank deeper and deeper into his self-proclaimed role as Mutant Messiah, Erik Lehnsherr eventually reinvented himself as Magneto, the leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants and a ruthless terrorist who is willing to kill hundreds in the name of mutant supremacy.Ultimate X-Men #1 Additionally, he was the one to cripple Professor X. In addition, Magneto helped Xavier to create the Savage Land, using his knowledge of technology and genetics. He created an artificial language called Epsilon-Omega, based on Esperanto and featuring its own script, for mutants to use in the Savage Land, as a rejection of human languages. They even have plays, poetry and songs in this language. This version of Magneto is significantly darker and more cynical than the mainstream version, regarding all humans with utter and unwavering disdain and likening them to \\"insects\\". On several occasions he has attempted to implement unflinchingly genocidal plans for humanity. More than once, dialogue refers to him actually consuming the flesh of human beings as he literally considers them to be animals. He commands a noticeably larger Brotherhood than his mainstream counterpart and has displayed enough power to defeat the Ultimates (even Thor, a literal god, on two separate occasions by taking his hammer). However, Magneto does believe that humanity has done some good things, as is shown in his appreciation for art, especially that of Ren√© Magritte. Magneto was imprisoned following the events of \\"Return of the King\\", the sixth arc in the series. Aside from a brief mention in the Ultimate Six arc of Ultimate Spider-Man, he was then unseen until \\"Magnetic North\\", the 12th arc and the final run for writer Brian K. Vaughan. Magneto was found to have hatched a scheme to escape, utilizing the willing cooperation of Forge and Mystique as well as the unknowing but amicable aid of Longshot's mutation for luck. Magneto escapes by the end of the arc, leaving Mystique in his cell to impersonate him. He and Longshot then exit the Triskelion unharassed and Magneto makes it clear to Longshot that he has something different planned than any of his more typical world-domination schemes. Most recently, Magneto has shown up in the \\"Aftermath\\", following the death of Charles Xavier. Magneto has apparently freed Forge from prison, and there are signs that he is building something. Exactly where he is hiding is still unknown, but with Charles Xavier's death he now believes it's time to speed up his plan. He takes pleasure knowing his former friend is dead (unaware that he is in fact alive and was simply transported into the future). He has a close relationship with Mystique, and arranged for her to be freed from the Triskelion by having Mastermind take her place. He has also apparently established a mutant commune. He appears in Ultimates 3 along with the Brotherhood (Mystique, Blob, Sabretooth, Lorelei and Madrox). They attack the Ultimates Mansion so he can talk to Quicksilver about re-joining the Brotherhood and retrieve Wanda's body. Magneto appeared in Ultimate Spider-Man and revealed that the Blob is Liz Allan's father. He tried to recruit her into the Brotherhood. In the crossover event Ultimatum Magneto uses Thor's hammer with his magnetic powers to cause worldwide devastation, flooding New York, freezing Doctor Doom's country and a portion of Europe, causing eruptions of volcanoes and earthquakes in other locations. He also uses an army of suicide bombers composed of Jamie Madrox duplicates, mind-controlled by Lorelei. His army blows up the Academy of Tomorrow, including everyone inside, and the European Defense League. The suicide bombers also try to blow the Triskelon but thanks to the SHIELD agents, Carol Danvers and Iron Man, as well as timely assistance by Clint Barton and Hank Pym's sacrifice, they fail to blow up the SHIELD base. Because of Magneto's actions the surviving Ultimates (Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Valkyrie and Hulk) and some of the X-Men (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Wolverine and Colossus) travel to Magneto's floating home and after a fight, Wolverine is killed. Then soon after Nick Fury arrives and, due to Jean Grey's abilities to connect minds together, Magneto learns the truth about mutants: they were created accidentally by some scientific experiments and not by God's wish. Upon learning of this truth, Magneto pleads mercy from Cyclops, stating that Xavier would have done so, but Cyclops disintegrates Magneto's head with an optic blast. Following the worldwide devastation caused by Magneto, the American government brings in new anti- mutant laws. Recently, Magneto has resurfaced in Egypt, where he is being worshipped as a God. Whilst doing this, he is instructing Wanda how best to ensure the protection of mutants.Ultimate Comics X-Men #07 However they are revealed to be illusions by Apocalypse.Ultimate Comics X-Men #12 What if? There were various What If issues that had Magneto as a key character: * What if? ... \\"What if Magneto took over the U.S.A.?\\" - Following the death of Professor X, Cyclops, and Jean Grey at the hand of Cable, Magneto becomes dictator of the United States uniting the Freedom Force, the Morlocks, the Externals, Shadow King, the Nasty Boys, Fenris, the Savage Land Mutates, the Hellfire Club, and the Mutant Liberation Front. When he took over the White House, the president unleashed Sentinels which killed every mutant and non- mutant. Psylocke tried to warn Magneto about one Sentinel that carried a nuclear warhead, but it was too late. When Magneto destroyed the Sentinel, the nuclear warhead exploded killing him, Storm, Psylocke and every other mutant that was in the White House at the time. This was the Master of Magnetism's first starring role in the series, spinning out of Uncanny X-Men #269.What if? v2. #47 * What if? ... \\"What if Legion killed Magneto?\\" - Magneto is the focus of this issue, through his mere absence is a departure from the Legion Quest and Age of Apocalypse storylines.What if? v2. #77 *What if? ... \\"What if the Age of Apocalypse had not ended?\\" - Prominently features Magneto continuing his role as leader of the X-Men, continuing after the events shown in Age of Apocalypse.What if? v2. #81 *What if? ... \\"What if Magneto ruled all mutants?\\" - Magneto leads the remains of mutantkind, as they float through space on Asteroid M.

Instead, he was convinced by Gabrielle Haller to let go of his hatred. Together, Magnus and Xavier formed the X-Men and were responsible for advancing the mutant cause and aiding world peace.What if? v3. #1 X-Men: Fairy Tales In the second issue of the X-Men: Fairy Tales limited series, based on the African story The Friendship of the Tortoise and the Eagle, Magneto appears as the eagle, alongside Professor X as the tortoise. Magneto/eagle has witnessed his family's slaughter when he was young, and had to teach himself to fly and survive. He has many 'demons' of his past that continue to haunt him, although while he is with his friend, Professor X/tortoise, they fade. When they come back to haunt him, he no longer believes in the friendship, thinking himself a danger to those around him. He also appears in the Japanese story of The little peach boy in which he and his children are demons who have taken over a town. They are defeated by the peach boy (Cyclops) and animals that resemble other X-Men: Beast, Angel, and Iceman. X-Men: Noir Eric Magnus is a Chief of Detectives in the New York City Homicide Department, a firm believer in eugenics, and leader of the secret society that rules over most organized crime in the city, the Brotherhood. His son, Peter, a former track star, has just joined Homicide, and his daughter, Wanda, is a local socialite who started a relationship with reporter Tom Calloway. Magnus appears to owe most of his success to Sebastian Shaw, the latter stating that the months of practice it took Magnus to lose his eastern European accent is the only thing that Magnus didn't get from him. Magnus's last name is revealed to be Magnisky, which the Ellis Island agent misheard as Magnus. He is currently seeking out Anna-Marie Rankin on behalf of Shaw so that they may use her against \\"Unus the Untouchable\\", a crime boss and enemy of Shaw and Magnus.

It is in the district of Chacarita in the northern part of Buenos Aires, adjacent to La Chacarita Cemetery. History of the British Cemetery The British Cemetery was inaugurated in April 1821; President Rivadavia approved the project on 19 March 1821 and the purchase of the land. The first address was Juncal Street today number 866, beside the building that houses Socorro Church. The first burial took place a few days after 19 March 1821 when it was still an open paddock. This burial was of a 30 year old Englishman named John Adams, a carpenter by profession. In 1833 the Cemetery was moved to Victoria Street, (today Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen), between Pasco and Pichincha, until 1892. The site is today a plaza called \\"1 de Mayo\\". Protestant Cemetery of Victoria In May, 1827 the British consul Woodbine Parish started negotiations with the government to obtain permission for the British community to build a new temple and another plot for the cemetery, since the existing cemetery (at Socorro) was full. In February, 1829, the Rosas government made available a plot for the construction of the temple, but there were no funds for the donation of the land for the new cemetery. On 21 August 1832, the then British consul Griffiths reported that the British government would cover half of the expenses necessary for the new cemetery. In 1833 Victoria Cemetery was opened in today's Plaza 1¬∞ de Mayo, between Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen Street (then Victoria Street) and Pasco, Alsina and Pichincha Streets. The new land, measuring 100m x 100m, was acquired from Manuel La Serna and Maria Luisa Roseti for $4,500. The land was more expensive than expected, and the estimated budget was insufficient to finish the project. In March, 1833 the Buenos Aires English language newspaper, The British Packet, reported that the subscriptions were not sufficient so more contributions were requested from the community. When on 7 June 1833 the purchase of the land was concluded it was agreed that it was exclusively for Protestants of the city. Victoria Cemetery received its first two British burials on 6 November 1833. The plots were freely transferable, but no trees could be planted; no tablets or monuments against the walls or common space were allowed. Carriages, wagons, horses or cattle were not allowed to enter. The gravedigger would take record and deliver a copy to the British chaplain for the official record. Victoria Cemetery remained open for almost sixty years, with a temporary closure in two occasions: during Hilario Lagos's siege in 1853, and during the yellow fever outbreak in 1871, when the government prohibited burial in urban cemeteries. As the city around the cemetery was growing, the neighbors wanted the cemetery moved further away. In 1869 the Municipality notified the cemetery that they had to go elsewhere, so they initiated negotiations, which dragged on for more than twenty years. The last burial at Victoria Cemetery dates back to November, 1892. Some remains, monuments and headstones, were moved to the new cemetery, work that finished around 1923. The old Cemetery became the Plaza \\"1¬∞ de Mayo\\" where a commemorative plaque remains. Some say that the remains of Elizabeth Chitty, wife of Admiral William (Guillermo) Brown, are still under this plaza.  At La Chacarita  Section 16 of the Chacarita Cemetery was given in exchange for the Victoria Cemetery. The British Cemetery finally opened its doors at its current address in Chacarita on Sunday, 13 November 1892. In 1913 the British Cemetery was divided into the German and the British Cemeteries as we know them today, because the two local communities had grown since the beginning of the 19th century. War graves The Chacarita British Cemetery contains the war graves of one Royal Navy seaman of World War I and eleven British service personnel of World War II, comprising six from the Royal Navy and three of the Merchant Navy, besides one each from the Royal Artillery, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force.BUENOS AIRES (CHACARITA) BRITISH CEMETERY CWGC Cemetery report, details from casualty record.

Television Magneto appeared in several Marvel animated series from 1967 to 1991. Strangely, it was some time before he actually appeared on a show with the X-Men. Spider-Man (1967 TV series) In the 1967 Spider-Man animated series, Spider-Man battled a scientist named Dr. Matto Magneto wielding a magnetic gun in \\"The Revenge of Dr. Magneto\\". The character was (very) loosely based on the Magneto character from the comics, and more closely resembled Albert Einstein instead of Erik Magnus Lehnsherr. This character is also not a mutant nor had any super powers. His name is pronounced \\"Mag-netto\\" instead of \\"Mag-neet-o\\" because he is German. Fantastic Four (1978 TV series) In the 1978 Fantastic Four animated series, Magneto (voiced by John Stephenson) briefly took control of the team in \\"The Menace Of Magneto\\". Here, he is not depicted as a mutant. Instead he is simply an extremely powerful supervillain with typical aspirations such as robbing a bank. Instead of flying, he moves around in a bizarre, car-like device which he moves using his magnetic powers. He was defeated when Reed Richards tricked him with a wooden gun. 1980sSpider-Man (1981 TV series)= The solo Spider-Man animated series from 1981 featured Magneto in the episode \\"When Magneto Speaks... People Listen\\". In this version he used the alias Mr. M, took over and hid several of the world's communication satellites and demanded $100 million in gold to return power to the world. He was defeated by Spider Man who was able to turn his magnet power back at him using a microwave relay but Magneto managed to escape. =Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends= Magneto returned in Spider- Man and His Amazing Friends, attempting to free his fellow mutants from prison in \\"The Prison Plot\\". He was voiced by Michael Rye. The character also made a cameo appearance in flashback in \\"A Firestar Is Born\\", as Firestar recounts her past to the X-Men. In spite of his Spider-Man television appearances, he has appeared in only two issues of a Spider-Man title. =Pryde of the X-Men= Magneto was the main villain in the animated X-Men pilot X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men - his first actual animated appearance battling the X-Men. He was voiced by Earl Boen. X-Men (TV series) X-Men animated series. Magneto's voice was provided by David Hemblen in the series X-Men, where he played a prominent role. Curiously, though he began on the show as a villain, his character spent more time as an ally to the X-Men, fighting alongside them against common enemies such as the Sentinels and Mr. Sinister as opposed to the cold-hearted villain he was previously portrayed as in earlier shows like Pryde of the X-Men. In the series, he briefly appears in the first episode \\"Night of the Sentinels: Part I\\" on a television screen Jubilee accidentally turns on with her powers but Magneto makes his true first appearance in the third episode \\"Enter Magneto\\", where he attempts to incite a war between humans and mutants by attacking a military base and launching its nuclear armaments, though they are prevented from reaching their targets by the X-Men. It is revealed that his real name is Magnus, and he is an old friend of Xavier's. However, a violent encounter with an army convinces Magnus that humans and mutants can't coexist, and the two parted ways. He reappears in the next episode \\"Deadly Reunions\\", when he attacks a chemical plant in an effort to draw Xavier out to face him. After defeating Cyclops, Rogue and Storm, Xavier meets his challenge and they do battle. Though Magneto gains the upper hand, Xavier tortures him with repressed memories of his childhood during The Holocaust, causing Magneto to flee in agony. In the first-season finale, he kidnaps Senator Kelly in order to once again attempt to begin a war, but is thwarted by a group of Sentinels. After Mastermold and the other Sentinels rebel against their creators and become a threat to the entire world, Magneto allies himself with the X-Men and they successfully eliminate the Sentinels, during which he saves Xavier's life. He appears in nearly every episode in the second season, in which he and Professor Xavier have been depowered and travel throughout the Savage Land. At the end of that season, all of the X-Men save them from Mr. Sinister, and they regain their powers. In season four, he creates Asteroid M as a safe haven for mutants who feel persecuted on Earth. Though his intentions are noble, a betrayal by his closest servant Fabian Cortez puts into motion a series of events after which he realizes that the world will never again trust him as the leader of the Asteroid, and he allows the base to be destroyed. In the fourth-season finale, Magneto teams up with Apocalypse, believing that the immortal will use his powers to resurrect his wife. When he discovers that Apocalypse plans to destroy all reality, Magneto helps the X-Men to defeat him. Disheartened by the loss of his sanctuary, he does not care about even the impending assimilation of mankind by the Phalanx, until he receives news from the Beast, Forge, Mr. Sinister and Amelia Voght that his son, Quicksilver, has been kidnapped by the Phalanx in the second part of the two-part fifth-season premiere. He teams up with them to defeat the Phalanx and save everyone they had captured or assimilated. His final appearance is in the last episode of the series \\"Graduation Day\\", he has gathered up an entire army of rebellious mutants, and is poised to conquer the world, but receives news from Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey that Professor Xavier is dying. Relenting, Magneto uses his power in conjunction with Xavier's in order to contact Lilandra Neramani, who takes Xavier to her planet where there is a suggestion that he may be cured. He is last seen along with the X-Men standing outside the mansion as Professor X departs. As with many television shows, X-Men: The Animated Series has suffered from continuity errors. For one, in the episode where Magneto makes his initial appearance, aptly titled \\"Enter Magneto\\", the X-Men do not know him, as he is an old acquaintance of Xavier's. However, as the series progresses Magneto is shown fighting Iceman during a flashback in \\"Cold Comfort\\". It may be possible that only Iceman knows him since he was not present in \\"Enter Magneto\\" and was the only one fighting Magneto in the flashback. 2000sX-Men: Evolution= Magneto's voice was provided by Christopher Judge in the animated television series X-Men: Evolution. During the show's first season he is a shadowy, mysterious manipulator where the X-Men, except for Professor Xavier, do not know of his existence, until the first X-Man, Wolverine, figures it out, although Magneto becomes a more direct threat from the first- season finale. In the first season he uses his agent Mystique to assemble a team of mutants, and even recruits his own son Quicksilver to spy on them. In the first-season finale, he pits the Brotherhood against the X-Men and brings the winners to Asteroid M in an attempt to convince them to join his cause and to use a genetic enhancer to fully develop their powers as he had. His decision to leave Mystique behind leads her to betray him (although flashbacks indicate that they have been at odds since Magneto separated Mystique from her newborn son Nightcrawler), and their vendetta lasts throughout the second season. In the second season, Magneto personally recruits a new team, the Acolytes, de-ages himself using the same technology that created Captain America as his genetic enhancements are no longer working, and finally reveals the existence of mutants to the public after the X-Men and Brotherhood fight off a Sentinel which was meant to destroy every mutant known. In this time his daughter Wanda is introduced, who hates Magneto for abandoning her as a child and leaving her in a mental asylum (when asked about what specific event led to Magneto institutionalizing Wanda, X-Men: Evolution's head writer Greg Johnson stated that \\"There was no specific event. It was just years of him trying to handle a hostile, out of control child whose powers were promising to be very destructive if he didn't get her put away.\\"). She hunts him down relentlessly until he uses the mutant Mastermind to change her memories, painting him in a new light. In the third and fourth seasons of the show, Magneto dedicates himself to preventing the awakening of the mutant Apocalypse, although all his attempts fail and upon Apocalypse's awakening he is transformed into one of his Four Horsemen after he is thought to have been killed by Apocalypse. He is freed of this enslavement in the finale episode \\"Ascension: Part Two\\", and is last seen being helped by his two children. In the final moments of the episode, Charles Xavier reveals that he witnessed the future in the mind of Apocalypse, and among the visions he saw was Magneto becoming an ally of the X-Men and training the New Mutants, like he did in the comics. In this series, Magneto uses a device aboard Asteroid M to advance his evolution, and propelling his abilities to further heights. Evidently, this advancement pushes him onto another plateau of existing as a mutant. A claim that he references when he goes to fight Apocalypse, declaring that it is a battle between \\"higher evolutionaries.\\" This is enforced by Caliban's claim that Magneto is too far advanced for him to locate, but that any other mutant was still within his capabilities. =Wolverine and the X-Men= Magneto appears in Wolverine and the X-Men voiced by Tom Kane in a rendition of Ian McKellen's portrayal of Magneto in the X-Men films. He is shown to rule the island of Genosha, where it appears most mutants are moving to, in light of recent anti-mutant feelings. Despite the government's treatment of mutants, they seem content to allow Magneto to promote Genosha in the United States with assorted poster and commercials. It is later revealed that Magneto found Professor X unconscious on Genosha after the destruction of the X-Mansion and took to caring for him. When the X-Men arrive to \\"rescue him\\" Magneto turns over his care to them, stating that they are his family. When Nightcrawler arrived in Genosha, he had his daughter Scarlet Witch give him a tour. During that time, he sends Mystique to the X-Mansion to \\"check up\\" on Professor X. Magneto, Scarlet Witch, and the Acolytes attacked Nightcrawler when he discovered Magneto's underground cells. When Nightcrawler did a lot of teleporting to warn the X-Men, Magneto had Mystique intercept him while he prepared a special cell for Nightcrawler. Magneto gave Quicksilver and his Brotherhood of Mutants a mission. During the transmission, Quicksilver tells his father that if they pull this off, he'd better receive a warm welcome back to Genosha. In \\"Battle Lines\\", Magneto had a talk with Senator Kelly about holding back the powerful mutants from being sent to Genosha. He later has his Acolytes raid the MRD prisons to free the mutants. In \\"Hunting Grounds\\", he finds out that Scarlet Witch and Nightcrawler had been abducted by Mojo. After the rescue, Scarlet Witch persuades Magneto to let Wolverine and Nightcrawler go. In \\"Backlash\\", Quicksilver was not pleased with Magneto when he cuts Quicksilver's Brotherhood of Mutants loose. After a chat with Quicksilver, he has Scarlet Witch notify the MRD of the Brotherhood's hideout. In \\"Aces and Eights\\", Senator Kelly sends Gambit to steal Magneto's helmet. When Gambit gets away without the helmet and Magneto learns of this, he was about to pummel Senator Kelly until intervention by the X-Men prevented this, showing Magneto and Kelly the true horror of the future their actions are creating. While Kelly listens to reason and agrees to stop the Sentinel program, Magneto refuses to give up on his ambitions. In the three-part episode \\"Foresight\\", Magneto sends Mystique to pose as Senator Kelly to unleash the Sentinels on Genosha, making it appear as though Kelly started the attack. When the Sentinels attack Genosha, Magneto initially does nothing, claiming that the weak must be sacrificed so the strong can rally together. He then uses his powers to reprogram them to attack humans. He was knocked off his Sentinel by the Phoenix Force yet was rescued by Quicksilver who takes him back to Genosha. After the Phoenix Force was stopped, Scarlet Witch and Polaris had Blink teleport Magneto and Quicksilver away from Genosha. Finally seeing the corrupt and misguided nature of her father, Scarlet Witch takes control of Genosha with the islanders' full support. Though Scarlet Witch tells Quicksilver that he is always welcome in Genosha, she also states that Genosha is no longer Magneto's country; therefore banishing her own father. =The Super Hero Squad Show= Magneto appears in The Super Hero Squad Show voiced by Maurice LaMarche. Besides being depicted as an ally of Doctor Doom, this version is shown trying to train his children Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to follow his legacy. In \\"Hexed, Vexed, and Perplexed\\", he arrived in Super Hero City with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in a plot to steal the Infinity Fractals from the Vault for Doctor Doom. He ends up fighting Captain America, Hawkeye, and the Super Hero Squad. When Falcon makes an attack on Magneto, Quicksilver uses his super speed to deflect the attack back at Falcon. Magneto sends his children to infiltrate the Helicarrier to steal the security codes in order to infiltrate the Vault. When the Super Hero Squad attacks, Magneto grabs an Infinity Fractal which gives him the ability to control matter which he uses to stop Falcon in mid-air. Scarlet Witch objects to Magneto hurting him more. Magneto releases them from his control only to take Falcon and Redwing captive as Quicksilver grabs the Infinity Fractals. Magneto then traps the Super Hero Squad in metal. Quicksilver discovers that Magneto had stolen the Infinity Fractals all along. Doctor Doom later attacks Magneto blaming him for stealing the Infinity Fractals until Falcon makes off with them. Doctor Doom holds Magneto responsible for his children helping Falcon and knocks him out. In \\"Lo, How the Mighty Hath Abdicated!\\", Magneto and Quicksilver attack the Helicarrier thinking that Scarlet Witch was kidnapped and brainwashed by the Super Hero Squad. Their fight ends up crashing the Helicarrier into Asgard. When Odin is freed from Enchantress' love lutefisk, he convinces Magneto to let Scarlet Witch stay with the Super Hero Squad. When Scarlet Witch states that she will come to Magneto when he needs her, Magneto states that if they meet as hero and villain, it will be different. Due to his transportation being wrecked, Magneto and Quicksilver ask the Super Hero Squad for a ride back to Super Hero City. A vastly older version appears in the alternate universe episode \\"Days, Nights, and Weekends of Futures Past\\", where he helps Falcon, HERBIE, and Reptil (known as \\"The Man\\") reform Scarlet Witch. Here, he is seen using a zimmer frame, complete with a bicycle horn, but later uses a scooter composed of Sentinel pieces. 2010sMarvel Anime= Magneto was referenced in Marvel Anime: X-Men. In \\"Conflict,\\" Cyclops mentions that Magneto is in a special plastic cell when discussing on how a metal bridge was twisted in a different direction. In a post-credits scene to \\"Destiny,\\" it is revealed that Magneto's plastic prison has been destroyed and he has escaped. =Iron Man: Armored Adventures= Magneto appears in the Iron Man: Armored Adventures episode \\"The X-Factor\\" voiced by Ron Halder, also in a rendition of McKellen from the films. His alias includes Magnus, Max Eisenhart and Erik Lensherr and it is mentioned he was a victim of the Weapon X program (like the Ultimate version), and is considered to be as dangerous as Doctor Doom, as revealed when Pepper looks up his S.H.I.E.L.D. profile. Iron Man encounters Magneto in a parking lot having bounded anti-mutant activist Simon Trask with a metal pipe and ends up attacked by Magneto with the battle ending with Iron Man dropped into the trash cans. He was targeting Annie Clairmont (who was an alias for Jean Grey) and ends up catching up to her when she was at a diner with Tony Stark, James Rhodes, and Pepper Potts. Tony Stark becomes Iron Man while Magneto pursues Annie, Pepper, and James. When Iron Man arrives, Magneto uses his magnetic abilities on Iron Man and tries to constrict him. Annie tries to use her telekinesis to help Ironman but Magneto sends the metal objects back at them. As Iron Man shuts down, Magneto uses his magnetic abilities to make off with Annie. At Magneto's hideaway, Magneto shows Annie the footage of Senator Robert Kelly's campaign against mutants and recaps his history of being experimented upon. When Annie tries to make mental contact with Iron Man, Magneto reveals to Annie that he had his hideout lined with the same mental-deflecting metal used for his helmet. Magneto plans to have Annie help him wage war against the humans one way or the other. When Iron Man and War Machine find Magneto's hideout, they get a mental message from Annie telling him where Magneto is. Using a special armor, Iron Man fights Magneto with War Machine's help. Both Iron Man and War Machine had a hard time fighting Magneto and his magnetic powers. Using his special force field, Iron Man blocks Magneto's magnetic attacks. Annie tells Iron Man that they have to remove his helmet in order for her mental attacks to harm him. Using his Uni-Beam attack, Iron Man knocks down Magneto as War Machine successfully removes his helmet. Annie takes the opportunity to use her mental powers to make Magneto fall asleep for a few days. Iron Man hopes that Magneto will awaken in a plastic cell. Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers Magneto appears as a guest star in Episode 21 of Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers, voiced by Banj≈ç Ginga. In the show, he is stated to be an old enemy of the X-Men, but agrees to help rescue the kids and Noriko Ashida from the Sentinels after realizing he can recruit Noriko as a member of the Brotherhood. He offers Noriko the chance to come with him and help create a world where mutants are the dominant species, but she rejects his offer, stating that Hikaru and the other children showed her that one day mutants and humans can live together in peace. Films X-Men (2000). In the X-Men film series, Magneto is portrayed by Sir Ian McKellen (adult) and by Michael Fassbender (younger self). His character development in the films is directly influenced by the African American human rights leader Malcolm X. The character's pre- teen versions were portrayed by Brett Morris (in X-Men) and by Bill Milner (in X-Men: First Class). His real name is Erik Magnus Lehnsherr, which at the time was his name in the comics, and was a holocaust survivor. Though he was good friends with Charles Xavier, his objective to ensure mutant prosperity but only so long as he remains in control of it has since made them adversaries. In the X-Men films, Magneto's resistance to mental attack does not stem from his own natural powers but from his helmet which is made of a psychic shielding component. Having taken the helmet from Shaw, Magneto is rendered immune to any form of telepathy and mind control as seen in the first two film entries. His powers are much more limited when compared to his depiction in comics. Whereas he's displayed controlling magnetism to an almost unlimited degree in the comics, he is generally restricted to manipulating metal within the films. Throughout the films, despite being at odds with Xavier, Magneto displays great care towards his old friend while acknowledging his contributions to mutant kind. Magneto currently appeared in eight of the X-Men films. X-Men In the film X-Men, Magneto is a powerful mutant whose abilities have become near limitless. He is the main antagonist of the film. But the existence of mutants have become public and the subject of a fierce debate over whether or not to be granted the same rights as others humans or whether they should be separated altogether. The US Senate is debating a Mutant Registration Act to force all mutants to reveal themselves and be registered, a move sponsored by Senator Robert Kelly. Magneto is present the day when attempts to convince the Senate to vote against mutant registration but is shouted down by Senator Kelly. When confronted by his old friend, Charles Xavier, he tells him that he had seen and heard the same speeches before, when the Nazis had cried out against Jews. He then asks that Xavier does not get in his way as he tries to ensure mutant supremacy. Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy installed on the Statue of Liberty's torch. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps Rogue to use as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by Jean Grey and Storm, Magneto does not believe them nor does he care. In the end, while Wolverine attacks Magneto atop the torch Cyclops uses an optic blast to knock down Magneto and destroy the machine. Magneto ends locked up in a plastic prison. Brett Morris portrayed a young Erik Lehnsherr. X2 In X2, Magneto returns as an antihero. After escaping from prison when Mystique had injected a suspension of iron particles into a security guard, he makes a temporary alliance with the X-Men to defeat William Stryker's plan to kill all mutants. But once Magneto foils Stryker's attempt to use a makeshift Cerebro operated by Xavier under the mental control of Stryker's own son to kill all the mutants, he decides with Mystique to force Xavier to try to kill all normal humans. Shortly after Magneto leaves the facility in a helicopter, the X-Men intervene in time to wake up Xavier and stop Magneto's plan. For this film, Magneto's costume and helmet were slightly redesigned for better performance due to McKellen's experience with the previous film in which found the helmet particularly uncomfortable to wear and the costume rather restricting to his movements. In addition to these costume changes, Magneto now sports a silver collar pin highly reminiscent of the designs on the character's helmet from the comics. X-Men: The Last Stand In X-Men: The Last Stand, Magneto is the secondary antagonist / antihero and has expanded the Brotherhood of Mutants with new recruits. After learning that a major company has produced a \\"cure\\" for the mutant gene, he and his Brotherhood attack the facility with the intention of killing the cure's source. Upon learning of Jean Grey's return, Magneto sets his concerns about the cure aside to sway Phoenix to his side; he succeeds, but is shaken when Phoenix vaporizes Xavier before his eyes. After Xavier's apparent demise, Magneto shows genuine grief over Xavier's death. During the Brotherhood's assault on Alcatraz, Magneto lifted and manipulated the Golden Gate Bridge and had no qualms about endangering or sacrificing dozens of his mutant followers by knowingly sending them against anti-mutant weapons while he remained safely out of range stating that \\"in chess, the pawns go first.\\" During the final showdown, Wolverine and Beast work together and inject Magneto with the \\"cure\\" which strips him of his powers. In defeat, he says to Jean 'This is what they want for all of us'. He, after feeling guilty for the bad things he has done before, then withdraws from Alcatraz with the other mutants and humans when Phoenix goes on a rampage, unleashing her powers. In the final scene, he, now alone and repented, extends his hand toward a metal chess piece and is able to slightly move it, revealing that his powers are returning. X-Men: First Class Michael Fassbender as young Magneto in X-Men: First Class (2011). Michael Fassbender portrays a younger and alternate Erik Lensherr/Magneto in the 2011 film X-Men: First Class as one of the film's two protagonists, alongside a young Charles Xavier. In this film, Lensherr was separated from his parents by Nazi soldiers in a concentration camp, and it was during this moment that his powers begin to manifest (twisting open a metal fence separating him and his parents). This event was witnessed by Dr. Klaus Schmidt, taking Erik aside while asking him to display his power again by moving a coin. He then threatens and executes Erik's mother in order to force an emotional display of his power. Erik spends his life after the war tracking Schmidt (who now goes by the name Sebastian Shaw), during which he crosses paths with Charles Xavier in 1962. He ends up recruited to \\"Division X\\", a CIA task force of mutants, and assists the agency in the investigation of Shaw. Erik develops a strong friendship with Xavier, and Raven; their respective codenames \\"Mystique\\" and \\"Magneto\\" were thought up by each other. Charles and Erik eventually discover Shaw plans to trigger World War III by convincing the Soviet Union to place nuclear missiles in Cuba, just before Shaw attacks Division X's secret facility and forces the team's dismantlement. The remaining mutants gather in Xavier's home estate planning to oppose Shaw's plans, and Xavier helps Erik find another way to channel his innate power. During the showdown with Shaw and his men in the Caribbean, Erik pulls Shaw's nuclear submarine from the water to the beach and confronts aboard it, removing Shaw's helmet so that Xavier can access his mind and stop Shaw. In a twist of fate, Erik instead puts on Shaw's helmet and reveals that he agrees with Shaw's exclusivist ideals for mutant-kind. He then uses the same coin from the concentration camp to kill Shaw. Both United States and Soviet forces turn their weapons on the beach after witnessing the mutant confrontation. Erik stops the missiles in mid-air, but then attempts to redirect the weapons back at the human vessels, ignoring Xavier's pleas. Moira MacTaggert attempts to shoot Erik, but he deflects each shot, one of which hits Xavier in the spine and causes paralysis. As a result, he loses focus and has the missiles drop into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Lensherr leaves with Mystique and Shaw's crew. In the final scene of the film, Magneto breaks Emma Frost free from confinement while wearing a costume similar to his first appearance in the comic book. The character was originally planned for a spin-off film titled X-Men Origins: Magneto, which after languishing on development hell was shelved for its plot being redundant with X-Men: First Class. Bill Milner portrayed a 12-year-old Erik Lehnsherr. The Wolverine Ian McKellen reprises his role in a brief cameo along with Professor Xavier in a mid- credits scene for The Wolverine, in which Logan returns to the United States after the film's exploits. Both inform Logan in an airport of the government's terrible new weapon that could destroy all mutant life, as a television broadcast for Trask Industries plays on a television. The film also reveals that Magneto regained his powers, causing various coins and other metallic objects to shake and stop his former enemy Wolverine from attacking him. X-Men: Days of Future Past Michael Fassbender and Ian McKellen reprised their roles as Magneto in X-Men: Days of Future Past, with the older version as a supporting protagonist in the ruined future and the younger version serving as an antihero before taking over as the antagonist in the past. In the future storyline where the Sentinels exterminated most mutants and went on to kill regular humans as well, the completely redeemed and regretted Magneto allies with the X-Men's remnants in a monastery in China. He and Professor Xavier decide that the best solution would be to prevent the Sentinels' creation by stopping Mystique's assassination of Bolivar Trask in 1973. Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his past self by Kitty Pryde, and his past actions occur simultaneously to an incoming Sentinel attack on the mutant hideout. Magneto destroys many Sentinels by hurling the Blackbird at them but ends up impaled by a stray fragment from a destroyed Sentinel. Retreating into the monastery, Magneto starts to fight with his wound as he tells Charles he regrets that both friends spent too many years fighting among themselves rather than seeing eye-to-eye. He remains there after having redeemed himself heroically defending his friends until the Sentinels infiltrate the stronghold right as young Xavier and Wolverine have successfully changed the future. Back in 1973, Wolverine contacts a young Xavier and a young Beast then recruit Quicksilver to release the young but cruel and ruthless Magneto from his prison underneath the Pentagon, where he had been captive since 1963 for his apparent role in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and of which he kept maintaining his innocence. The young Magneto helps them stop Mystique from killing Trask at the Paris Peace Accords but then decides to try killing Mystique to impede the dystopian future, betraying her and the others. After failing to kill her he decides to take matters into his own hands. He laces the prototype Sentinels with steel to control them, commandeers the Sentinels at their White House unveiling to attack the crowd, then sets the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium around the White House as a barricade. Using his powers, young Magneto controls the Sentinels against Logan and young Beast, while young Beast fight the Sentinels Logan affronts young Magneto and tries attacking him to stop him, a battle erupts while young Magneto throws several pieces of metal at Logan. Wolverine defends himself but is ultimately thrown into the Potomac River. Then young Magneto pulls the safe room out of the White House, makes a speech at the television cameras regarding mutant superiority, and prepares to kill President Richard Nixon and his cabinet. Afterward, Nixon turns out to be Mystique in disguise who shoots Magneto in the neck. Young Magneto is labeled a mutant terrorist for his attack against Nixon and the world leaders unite to hunt him down. His actions also demonstrate the threat the Sentinels pose if they are in the wrong hands and used against people, becomes one of the contributing factors that lead to the cancellation of the Sentinel program and averting the dystopian future. In the newly-changed future, Magneto is nowhere to be seen, leaving his fate uncertain. X-Men: Apocalypse Fassbender reprises his role in the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse, with Magneto starting off an antagonist before reverting to hero once again by the end of the movie. Erik has spent the next ten years after the 1970s events living in Poland as a metalworker under the alias \\"Henryk Gurtski\\" and a wife and daughter; his wife aware of his past and his daughter possessing an undefined mutant ability to command animals. When he uses his powers to save a colleague at work, someone reports him to the police. His attempt to give himself up to save his family causes his daughter's mutant ability to turn the animals of the nearby forest against the police, which results in his loved ones' deaths when an arrow is accidentally fired that penetrates both his wife and daughter. Magneto kills all the officers with his daughter's locket and later journeys to his factory to do the same to the workers. He ends up being recruited by En Sabah Nur after his recruiter murders the workers before taking Erik to Auschwitz and awakens his full power to serve as his Horseman. Charles Xavier tries to get in contact with his former friend by Cerebro, trying to convince him to let revenge go, only for Erik to alert En Sabah Nur to his friend's presence. He takes part in the kidnapping of his old friend, using his magnetic abilities to drag Charles' wheelchair towards them. At the command of his master, Magneto uses his improved abilities to terraform the world. Despite being approached by Mystique and his unknown son Quicksilver to help them defeat Apocalypse, he only decides to help Charles and the team when the two are attacked and nearly killed by Apocalypse. After the battle, Erik uses his abilities to rebuild the X-Mansion with Jean Grey but declines an offer from Charles to remain and takes his leave. Dark Phoenix Fassbender reprises his role in 2019's Dark Phoenix. Magneto resides on the mutant haven Genosha by the time of the movie's story. Jean Grey comes to his residence for advice, asking how was he able to put aside his desire to kill others, leading Magneto to suspect her that she has killed someone, pointing out a blood stain on her shirt and he confronts her about it. Their confrontation is interrupted by the arrival of the military force, demanding to arrest Jean after she has caused a chaos during the incident in Red Hook. Jean then nearly destroys the whole military operation after ripping out one helicopter, and Magneto struggles to send the men away. He then lashes out at Jean, banishing her from Genosha. Hank McCoy arrives at Genosha, revealing that Jean is the one who caused the death of Raven, and Magneto, along with mutants Ariki and Selene, joins Hank to hunt and kill Jean. The group is confronted by the X-Men, consisting of Xavier, Storm, Scott, and Kurt.

Origins and format  The programme began with three Welsh-language series before the English version appeared in 1971. This then ran for three series, ending in 1973. The programme consisted of sketches and stand-up comedy sessions in which Ronnie took the role of \\"straight man\\" to Ryan's clowning. There was also music, from the duo themselves and regular guests such as Welsh singer Margaret Williams. Each programme ended with an episode of a spoof soap opera entitled \\"Our House\\", in which Ryan played the mother of the family and Ronnie the father. Myfanwy Talog played their daughter, \\"Phyllis Doris\\". The running joke in \\"Our House\\" was that \\"Mam\\" doted on her son, Nigel Wyn (originally played by Derek Boote and later by resident singer Bryn Williams), and forgave him anything, whilst being strict with Phyllis Doris, whom she always addressed as \\"you brazen hussy\\". Both children were played by adults, the former appearing dressed in school uniform. The father, \\"Will\\", was the silent type, but each week, Nigel Wyn would address him as \\"Will\\" and \\"Will\\" would say, \\"Don't call Will on your father\\". (The phrase \\"call on\\" is a direct translation from the Welsh \\"Paid a galw Wil ar dy dad!\\"). With its almost surreal humour, \\"Our House\\" has achieved an iconic status. On one occasion, the show's guest star Ken Dodd also appeared as a character in \\"Our House\\".  Legacy  An S4C film about Ryan and Ronnie won several BAFTA Cymru awards in May 2010. Recurring characters Blodwen and Mary had their own song, in both English and Welsh versions. An English version was released as a single in 1975.

This court decision defended by the Parisian Lawyer, Andre Bertrand, was path-setting for the whole European Yellow Pages industry, as it decided that the phrase \\"Yellow Pages\\" cannot be considered the property of a single company. Previously, many former state monopoly telecom companies outside the US had tried to ban competition by claiming the term \\"yellow pages\\", or the translation of \\"yellow pages\\" into the vernacular, as their exclusive trademark.

This was distributed with the alphabetical phone directory rather than as a stand-alone publication. The company now produces The Hull Colour Pages. :With the encouragement of The Thomson Corporation, at the time an advertising sales agent for the nationalised General Post Office's telephone directory, a business telephone number directory named the Yellow Pages was first produced in 1966 by the GPO for the Brighton area, and was rolled out nationwide in 1973. The Thomson Corporation formed Thomson Yellow Pages in 1966 to publish and to distribute the directory to telephone subscribers for the GPO, and later for The Post Office. :Thomson Yellow Pages was sold by The Thomson Corporation in 1980, at the same time as Post Office Telecommunications became the (then) state-owned British Telecom (BT). The Yellow Pages directory continued to be distributed to all telephone subscribers by BT. At the same time, The Thomson Corporation formed Thomson Directories Ltd, and began to publish the Thomson Local directory, which would remain the Yellow Pages' main, and often sole, competitor in the UK for more than the next two decades, and would be the competitive driving force behind such changes to Yellow Pages as the adoption (in 1999) of colour printing and \\"white knock out\\" listings. :In 1984 the year that BT was privatised, the department producing the directory became a stand alone subsidiary of BT, named Yellow Pages. In the mid-1990s the Yellow Pages business was re-branded as Yell, although the directory itself continued to be known as the Yellow Pages. :Yell was bought by venture capitalists in 2001, and in 2003 was floated on the Stock Exchange. After the one year \\"no competition\\" clause expired BT too went into competition with the Yellow Pages, re-entering the market by adding similar content to their existing directory, \\"The Phone Book\\", adding a classified section to the traditional alphabetical domestic and business listings. :Yellow Pages, Thomson Local and BT's The Phone Book display advertising and can be booked directly with advertising sales representatives. :Nowadays the KC Yellow Pages is referred to as Hull Colour Pages, and is separate from the White Pages. Yell now also publishes an East Yorkshire edition of Yellow Pages in competition. Bell System Yellow Pages Logo * United States: In the past, AT&T;, Verizon, and Qwest, the three largest phone companies in the U.S., dominated the U.S. yellow pages industry; however, the term \\"yellow pages\\" and the Walking Fingers logo was heavily marketed by AT&T; pre divestiture. However, AT&T; never filed a trademark registration application for the current and most recognized version of the Walking Fingers logo, so it is in the public domain. AT&T; allowed the \\"independent yellow pages\\" industry to use the logo freely.Bellsouth v. Datanational The \\"independents\\" are unrelated to the incumbent phone company and are either pure advertising operations with no phone infrastructure or telephone companies who provide local telephone service elsewhere. Such independents include operators who typically focus on industry or business segments, or local market directories. :Yellow pages publishers or their agents sell the right to place advertisements within the same category, next to the basic listings. :For example, AT&T; is the dominant local telephone service provider in California, but since Bell Atlantic and GTE merged to become Verizon, it now provides service in many pockets such as West Los Angeles. Los Angeles telephone users can select from telephone directories published by AT&T;, Verizon (published by Idearc), Yellow Book USA, PDC Pages (Phone Directories Company) PDC Pages.com and other independent publishing companies.

Built in 1955, the Discovery I is a tour vessel on the Chena and Tanana rivers. History Discovery I was built by Captain Charles M. (\\"Jim\\") Binkley Jr., who had started a tour business on the rivers near Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1950. For the first five years of operation, Binkley used a converted missionary boat, the Godspeed, to conduct the tours. By 1954, Binkley was in need of a larger boat due to increased passenger volume, and made plans to build a stern-wheel riverboat similar to ones he had piloted earlier in his career as a riverboat captain.Madonna, James. 1999. Alaska Gold Trails: The Pioneers. A.P. Publishing, Fairbanks, Alaska. , p. 31 After drawing up plans with a local architect, Binkley began construction of Discovery I in his back yard during the winter of 1955. The boat was complete early the next summer, and Captain Binkley put the newly christened Discovery I into immediate use in his tour business. The initial passenger capacity of Discovery I was 49, but within a few years Binkley had expanded the boat's capacity twice. These expansions raised the number of passengers the vessel could carry to 80, and then to 150. The Discovery I served as the Riverboat Discovery's main tour boat for 16 years, from its construction in 1955 to the construction of Discovery II in 1971. Binkley planned to expand the capacity of Discovery I beyond 150 through further remodeling, but the Coast Guard hesitated to certify the vessel for more passengers. The decision by the Coast Guard that Discovery I had reached its maximum passenger capacity precipitated the construction of Discovery II. After Discovery II took over as the primary sternwheeler for the company, Discovery I was kept on in a standby status until the construction of Discovery III in 1987. After the construction of Discovery III, Discovery I 's license was surrendered, and for the next fourteen years, Discovery I was dry- docked. During the tenure of Discovery I 's dry-docking, periodic repairs and maintenance were performed, and in 2000, the Riverboat Discovery company brought her back into the fleet for the company's 50th anniversary. Since 2000, Discovery I has been maintained by the Riverboat Discovery as a periodic tour vessel. Due to the relatively small capacity of Discovery I, she is no longer used for the company's regular tours, but takes on passengers on a semi-regular basis for special tours and charters.

Around 1860 he joined two other Johnson's workers, Duncan McKechnie and Charles Wigg, in setting up the Old Quay Works in Runcorn to make soap and to extract copper by the Henderson wet process. In 1865, when John & Thomas Johnson became registered under the Companies Act as the Runcorn Soap and Alkali Company, Mathieson invested in the company, buying 175 shares. He left the Old Quay Works to set up his own business, Matheison and Company in Widnes, Lancashire in 1870. His partners were Frederick Herbert Gossage, son of William Gossage, and Thomas Sutton Timmis, both of whom had been associated with Gossage's soap business. Matheison and Company became one of the most important companies in Widnes. Its main business was producing alkali by the Leblanc process and they also produced glycerine from soap waste from Gossage's.

In the later years of his life became known as a peace activist. Young age and Enlistment T√ºrr was born in the city of Baja, Hungary, the fifth child of an ironmonger. His mother was Ter√©zia Udvary, whose father was a medical doctor. When young he was not a diligent pupil and left school early. As a teenager he tried his father's profession as well as working in a mill and as an unskilled mason, but did not show great aptitude for any of these three jobs. The first time he tried to enlist in the Austrian Army he was rejected, but on his re-application in 1842 he was accepted at the age of 17. Moreover, officers found in him a hitherto unnoticed promise and encouraged him to improve himself and undergo officer's training at P√©cs. By 1848 he was already a military engineer at the rank of lieutenant in a Hungarian grenadier regiment. Deserting the Austrian Army, fighting for the 1848 Revolution in Italy At the time when the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 engulfed his homeland, T√ºrr was stationed in Lombardy, Italy. He was involved in early fighting against Piedmont and witnessed the cruel reprisals inflicted on rebellious Italians at Monza, where he was stationed, which caused him to change his loyalties. On 19 January 1849 T√ºrr crossed the bridge over the Ticino and went over to the Piedmont side. He was immediately placed in command of the newly formed \\"Hungarian Legion\\", comprising numerous deserters of the Austrian Imperial Army. Its ranks were swelled by the increasing desertion of Hungarian soldiers and officers, crossing the Ticino in small boats every night until the Austrian command moved them away. In a parallel development, another Hungarian Legion, headed by Lajos Winkler (1810‚Äì1861) who would later become T√ºrr's close associate, was formed at Venice and fought in defence of the revolutionary Repubblica di San Marco headed by Daniele Manin.Paul Ginsborg, \\"Daniele Manin and the Venetian revolution of 1848‚Äì49\\", p. 345, ; Margaret Anne Doody, \\"Tropic of Venice\\", p. 34: \\"The Memorial to Lajos Winkler and his band of Hungarians who fought with the Venetians, on the wall of the post office behind St. Mark's, was only put up in 2002\\" ; commemorative plaque at ; 2008 memorial by the Italian-Hungarian Friendship Society , Thus, T√ºrr became involved in the First Italian War of Independence, under the leadership of King Carlo Alberto of Piedmont. The final Austrian victory at Novara dashed the Italian hopes. Carlo Alberto had to abdicate and go into exile, and Piedmont could no longer carry on the struggle. From Italy to Baden Under the terms of the ceasefire imposed on Piedmont, the Hungarian Legion (and a similar Polish Legion, also composed of deserters from the Austrian Army) were to be disbanded. Privates and NCO's up to the rank of sergeant-major were offered a pardon and a return home. This did not include the officers, but the Austrians did not object to their accepting commissions in the Piedmontese Army. However, when T√ºrr put it to his men, they voted by acclamation to reject the Austrian pardon, stay together and leave Piedmont in search of a place whose revolution was still holding out. At first they set out for the Roman Republic, but were blocked by the French forces besieging the city (thus, T√ºrr's meeting with Garibaldi, at this time directing Rome's defence, was delayed for ten years). Next, the Hungarians entered France itself via Nice, where they had to give up their arms and the authorities regarded them with considerable suspicion. The Hungarians, kept for a considerable time in Toulon, conceived the idea of going to the Ottoman Empire, where some Hungarians already got refuge (and many more would follow in the coming years). However, the French disliked this idea, attempting to send them instead to Algiers, where, T√ºrr feared, the Hungarian Legion would \\"melt down\\". He then decided to try heading to Britain in the hope that from there it would be easier to get to Turkey. Hearing of the revolutionary ferment at Baden, Germany, where \\"the army had joined with the people to overthrow the monarchial government\\", T√ºrr decided to set out in that direction, also in the hope of eventually returning to a liberated Hungary via Germany. Two contingents of the Hungarian Legion did manage to cross into Germany and reach Baden; a third was stopped by the French and diverted to Folkestone, where the British put them on a ship headed to Turkey. Bringing sorely needed reinforcements, T√ºrr was warmly welcomed in Baden, made immediately upon arrival a colonel in its revolutionary army, and got three battalions of German troops under his command in addition to the Hungarians who came with him. He did not hold this position long, however, as the Baden revolution soon succumbed to an overwhelming Prussian attack. Together with the overthrown Baden Government, he and his troops had to seek refuge in Switzerland. The victors, in control of occupied Baden, were summarily executing the officers of the revolutionary army who fell into their hands. In Bern, T√ºrr got the bitter news of the revolution being crushed in his own homeland, too, after prolonged fighting throughout Hungary. He was faced with the prospect of an exile life of indefinite duration, with his life forfeit if he ever tried to go home. Sending exiles to America In the wake of the Hungarian Army's surrender at Vil√°gos (now ≈ûiria, Romania) on 13 August 1849, the Austrians in the following month, September, renewed the offer of a free pardon to the men of the Hungarian Legion. This time, a considerable part of them accepted the offer, \\"tired of incessant fatigues and disappointments, and having lost all hope of ever being able to fight for their country's cause\\", and went back to defeated Hungary. The sympathetic Government of Switzerland, described by T√ºrr as \\"always humane and noble minded\\", financed and facilitated the sending the rest of the Hungarian soldiers to America. (This Federal Swiss government was newly installed, composed of the Radicals, who won the Swiss civil war two years earlier, one of the few regimes established by the Revolutions of 1848 that remained in power, inclined to help the less fortunate revolutionary refugees.) T√ºrr himself, dejected and in bad health, remained in Europe, alternating between Switzerland and Piedmont, and living on a pension that the Piedmont-Sardinian Government granted to him. In October 1850, the above- mentioned Captain Lajos Winkler, who had fought at Venice, came over from Lombardy, in command of a party of about a hundred Hungarian privates that he had kept together under discipline. T√ºrr's 1856 brochure, mentioning this and other events of the 1850s,\\"Narrative of the arrest, trial, & condemnation of Colonel T√ºrr\\", published by T√ºrr in London, 1856 does not relate where Winkler and his men had been and what they had been doing during the year since the fall of Venice; evidently, they had gotten the help of sympathetic Italians. With the Hungarian fortunes at their nadir, T√ºrr and Winkler devised a plan of sailing with this troop to Montevideo, to join the Liberal forces fighting against Juan Manuel de Rosas in the Uruguayan Civil War. Since the 1830s, the prolonged struggle, especially the perilous Siege of Montevideo, gained the considerable support and sympathy of progressive Europeans, and it was there that Garibaldi first gained his reputation as a freedom fighter. With the European revolutions crushed, the war in Uruguay seemed to offer T√ºrr the only place where he could still \\"contribute to the protection of freedom against oppression and tyranny\\". Had T√ºrr carried out this plan, his subsequent career might have been considerably different. However, at Genoa, they were faced with a firm Austrian demand for the extradition of the Hungarian deserters. To save them, T√ºrr falsely declared that they had all belonged to the former Piedmontese-Hungarian Legion that he had commanded and thus covered by the amnesty offered to these. T√ºrr gained the Piedmontese Government's permission to take the Hungarian troops to Switzerland, whose friendly Federal Council in turn obtained French permission for them to go to America. As the Austrians had not completely given up their demands, T√ºrr personally conducted the exiled troops as they made their way on foot to Le Havre and saw them safely embarked to their destination. From the Austrian point of view, the demand for the Hungarian troops' extradition turned out to be a serious blunder. Instead of letting T√ºrr neatly get rid of himself and devote his energies to Latin American struggles, the Austrians themselves ensured that he would stay on in Europe and become an increasingly disturbing thorn in the Habsburg Empire's side. Many of the Hungarian \\"Forty-Eighters\\" who arrived in the US at this time are known to have later fought on the Union side in the American Civil War. The ones sent off by T√ºrr might have been among them. Mazzinian conspiracies and the Crimean War Between 1850 and 1853 the exile T√ºrr, facing execution as a deserter should he return to Hungary, moved between Switzerland, France, England and Piedmont. In the early 1850s he became closely involved with fellow exile in Mazzinian conspiracies, such as the failed Milan uprising of 6 February 1853. Following the outbreak of the Crimean War T√ºrr was also involved in the plan of Gy√∂rgy Klapka, former War Minister of the 1848 revolutionary Hungarian government, to raise a force of Hungarian exiles to fight against Russia, whose intervention in 1848‚Äì49 had tipped the scales against the Hungarian rebels. Even before the Crimean War, a considerable number of exiled Hungarians had already taken service with the Ottomans, some reaching high positions without having to convert to Islam (see Islam in Hungary). During the Siege of Kars in eastern Anatolia, Hungarian exiles took an active part in defending this border city against the invading Russians. As T√ºrr would later disclose to Italian friends, supporting the Ottoman Empire against the Russian Empire was far less satisfactory to him than taking part in the Italian struggle for liberation. It was more in the nature of \\"serving one barbarism, out of the hatred of another barbarism\\".\\"Servire un barbaro per odio contro un altro barbaro\\", quoted in Giuseppe Cesare Abba, \\"Storia dei Mille\\", 1904, . Arrest by the Austrians, court martial, release During the Crimean War, in 1855 T√ºrr was required to procure supplies for the British forces in the Danubian Principalities, at the time occupied by Austria though not annexed to the Habsburg Empire. He trusted to the protection of the British and to promises of safe-conduct by locally stationed Austrian officers, which were apparently overruled by Vienna. In Bucharest T√ºrr was arrested and sent on to Kronstadt (the present Bra»ôov), where he was interrogated and court-martialed. He was sentenced to death for desertion and treason (\\"seeking to detach Italy and Hungary from Austrian rule\\"). However, the Emperor commuted his punishment to perpetual banishment, due to the strong British protests, apparently involving Queen Victoria personally. At the time, the whole affair got considerable press attention all over Europe, and on his release T√ºrr published a long and detailed account of it.* \\"Narrative of the arrest, trial, & condemnation of Colonel T√ºrr\\" by Istv√°n T√ºrr, 48 p English translation of the Austrian original, published in London, 1856. Disputed British naturalization It was in 1856, after this intervention to save him that Turr asked for British citizenship. This was granted, but his naturalization was thereafter strongly contested, as can be seen from a then-classified British document stating tersely: > Naturalization by certificate of secretary of state: Naturalization Act > 1844: Certificate obtained by fraud: Colonel Etienne Turr. False statements > as to residence and intention to reside. Law officers advised that > certificate could not be revoked by secretary of state.The [British] > National Archives, \\"Records created or inherited by the Home Office, > Ministry of Home Security, and related bodies\\" The document was declassified only thirty years later and not given particular prominence even then. It does not seem to have influenced Turr's reputation. 1859 fighting, wounded at Brescia With the outbreak of the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 T√ºrr returned to that country and joined Garibaldi's volunteer unit Cacciatori delle Alpi (\\"Hunters of the Alps\\"). Garibaldi held T√ºrr in great esteem and in one speech dubbed him \\"The Fearless Hungarian\\". On the circumstances of Turr's wounding on 15 June 1859, an eye- witness report is provided in a letter by Frank Leward, an English volunteer fighting with Garibaldi: > Col T√ºrr, an' Hungarian who hates the Austrians like sin, had been sent with > a lot more of our men to Rezzato a few miles from Brescia on the road to > Preschiera and a battalion of Austrians came at them but T√ºrr sent them off > and was so excited he followed them up too far and fell into a sort of > ambuscade they had waiting for him and he got awfully cut up. However he > managed to keep the enemy at bay for some time. Castenodolo the place was > called I think [where] T√ºrr lost a heap of men(...). > The General [Garibaldi] was in an awful stew, [he] made me go with him to > Castenodolo. On the way we met T√ºrr badly wounded in an ambulance he was > very bad but tried to sit up and sang out viva Italia then we met a lot more > wounded being carried off.Frank Leward's letter to a friend, written at > Lovere, July 29, 1859 . Expedition of the Thousand, promotion to general General Istv√°n T√ºrr in Palermo, during the 1860 Expedition of the Thousand (photo by Gustave Le Gray). T√ºrr had completely recovered from his wounds by the next year (1860), when he again followed Garibaldi and took a major part in the Expedition of the Thousand. The 500 Hungarians led by T√ºrr, helped by fellow exiles Adolf Mogy√≥rody, N√°ndor √âber and Guszt√°v Frigyesy, were the largest contingent of foreign volunteers fighting with Garibaldi, alongside French, Poles, Swiss, German and other nationalities. Like the Hungarians, most of the other internationals were fighting with a view to follow up the liberation of Italy with that of their own countries from foreign or domestic tyranny (see International Legion). In later parts of the campaign, as Garibaldi's campaign gathered momentum and many local recruits in Sicily and South Italy, T√ºrr was in command also of an increasing number of Italian troops. In Talamone, en route to Sicily, Garibaldi promoted T√ºrr to General and included him in the General Staff formed for the expedition. After the capture of Palermo, T√ºrr led the force that went through the rugged Sicilian interior towards Messina, while Garibaldi himself went on along the island's north shore. After crossing to the mainland, T√ºrr led a force of 1,500 men towards Salerno. Franco Catalano, analysing the Battle of Volturnus (1860), accuses Turr of \\"reckleness\\" that contributed to the initial Garibaldian defeats at Caiazzo and Castel Morrone,Quoted in \\"Magazzeno Storico Verbanese\\" but the overall battle ended with Garibaldi's decisive victory, and at the time there were no recriminations. In the aftermath of the fighting T√ºrr was appointed by Garibaldi as Governor of Naples. In this role he conducted the plebiscite of 21 October 1860, in which the city's population voted overwhelmingly in favour of incorporation in the new Kingdom of Italy. During the famous meeting of Garibaldi with King Victor Emmanuel II at Teano, the king refused Garibaldi's request that the soldiers and officers who took part in the Expedition of the Thousand be taken into the Italian Army, and most of them were in fact dismissed. Garibaldi afterwards went back to his home in Caprera, and his later relations with the King and the royal government were often tense. However, Victor Emmanuel not only confirmed T√ºrr's rank as a general but also made him a royal aide-de-camp, and subsequently entrusted to T√ºrr the handling of some sensitive diplomatic matters. Despite this divergence of political courses, however, T√ºrr remained on highly cordial and friendly relations with Garibaldi until the Italian revolutionary's death in 1882. Meanwhile, back in Austrian-ruled Hungary, the city of Debrecen on 6 February 1861, declared T√ºrr and as Kossuth, Klapka and other exiled nationalists, to be its honorary citizen. This was an act of defiance, as at the time T√ºrr stood to be executed out of hand had he attempted to arrive at the city whose honorary citizen he became,List of hinorary citizens of Debrecen Wedding and Napoleonic connection On 10 September 1861, in Mantua, T√ºrr married Adelina Bonaparte Wyse (1838‚Äì1899), granddaughter of Lucien Bonaparte, the brother of the Emperor Napoleon, which made her a cousin of the then Emperor Napoleon III of France. (Her legal parents were Sir Thomas Wyse, British Minister to Athens, and Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte, Lucien Bonaparte's daughter; however, her real father was her mother's long-time lover, as Princess Letizia had separated from her husband). Moreover, Adelina's sister, Laetitia Marie Wyse Bonaparte, married in the same year the Piedmontese statesman Urbano Rattazzi, who was the Italian Prime Minister several times during the 1860, thus became T√ºrr's brother in law. T√ºrr is mentioned as having, with the help of his wife, carried out extensive diplomatic activity. Among other things, both of them are known to have conducted extensive correspondence with Prince Napoleon, the Emperor's cousin and advisor, a proponent of the anti-Clerical forces in the French imperial court and opponent of the policy of letting French troops preserve the Pope's temporal power over Rome Prince Napoleon's papers, preserved at France's \\"Centre historique des Archives nationales\\" include files of correspondence with \\"Turr (Adeline)\\" and with \\"Turr (E.), g√©n√©ral\\" Istv√°n T√ºrr and his wife had one son, Raoul T√ºrr (1865‚Äì1906). Pallanza Dignitary In October 1862, T√ºrr acquired from the Milanese Carlo Lattuada a villa in Pallanza, described as \\"an elegant dwelling with a garden facing the lake\\" (i.e. Lake Maggiore). The T√ºrrs immediately became prominent figures in the town's social life, as seen in repeated reports in the local paper, the \\"Il Lago Maggiore\\". The return after a visit to France of \\"The Valorous Hungarian General and his Most Beautiful and Amiable Consort, Princess Bonaparte\\" was a major local news item. The couple were hosted and feted by the town's dignitaries (sub-prefect, municipal councillors and the commander of the local National Guard) with a civic band playing various pieces, prominently ones associated with Garibaldi. The T√ºrrs also took considerable interest in the lower classes. T√ºrr became the Honorary President of the local Labourers' Society (Societ√† Operaia di Pallanza) and gave donations to be distributed among the needy. On 4 November 1862 the paper noted with regret that: > Now that the summer is over, the T√ºrr Family has left and are not expected > back until next spring. They carry with them the esteem and affection of the > townspeople, who have come to appreciate their rare qualities. Before her > departure, Mrs. Adelina T√ºrr insisted upon visiting the orphanages, where > the children greeted her with a most abundant dose of confetti. It was > wonderful to see this scion of one of the greatest and most powerful > families of Europe caress and kiss the sons of our labourers, and make the > effort of conversing with them in their Pallanzese dialect.Relevant articles > from \\"Il Lago Maggiore\\", 1862‚Äì1865 provided by \\"Magazzeno Storico > Verbanese\\", In 1876, the Pallanza villa was sold to Cesar Bozzotti, apparently because T√ºrr was able to return to Hungary after 1867 (see below) and, therefore, spent less time in Italy. Romanian Negotiations In 1863, T√ºrr returned to the Romanian Principalities, now under the government of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, who had shown some sympathy to the Hungarian exiles. Following upon an earlier (1861) delegation headed by Klapka, T√ºrr sought an agreement on establishing Hungarian weapons and supplies depots on Moldavian soil, with a view to a new uprising against Habsburg rule. In case of their independence being achieved, the Hungarians promised \\"a full autonomy\\" to the Romanian population of Transylvania. Nevertheless, disagreement on the Question of Transylvania prevented T√ºrr and his fellows from reaching an agreement. At the time, T√ºrr was a confidential adviser to Italian King Vittorio Emanuele. With Venetia still held by the Austrians and a new war a distinct possibility, it was clearly in Italy's interest to have a Hungarian rebellion open a second front for the Austrians.Besprechungen Ungarn 1848‚Äì1918, p.279 (Irina lonescu) Planned Hungarian uprising in 1866 In 1866, in coordination with the Third Italian War of Independence and Garibaldi's campaign against the Austrians in the Trentino, T√ºrr was assigned to prepare an uprising in Hungary involving Gy√∂rgy Klapka and other Hungarian exiles. It was supposed to be launched from Serbian territory, but because of the fast ending of the Prussian-Austrian War including its Italian part, it never came to implementation, and the next year's developments rendered all such plans moot. Return to Hungary The 42-year-old Istv√°n T√ºrr at the time of his return to Hungary (drawing by K√°roly Rusz, 22 September 1867) Defeat in the war forced the Emperor Franz Josef to grant a Liberal Constitution as well as a renewed autonomy for the ancient Kingdom of Hungary; the unitary Austria became the dual Austria- Hungary. The changed political climate also included an amnesty for exiles such as T√ºrr, who could at last return to his homeland. Not long after his return, T√ºrr, no longer an implacable foe of Austrian interests, was informally involved in (ultimately unsuccessful) negotiations aimed at creating an alliance between Austria, Italy and France. Canal Architect and Engineer Though often referred to as \\"General T√ºrr\\" until the end of his life, in practice T√ºrr did not take up an active military or political career in Hungary. Rather, he chose to devote his later years to working as a canal architect and engineer. Using his wide international experience and personal contacts, he was a leading proponent of the building of navigation canals and river navigation systems in Hungary.Andrew L. Simon \\"Made in Hungary: Hungarian Coctributions to Universal Culture\\", p.291 On the basis of his international experience, T√ºrr was charged with √©laborating a plan for navigable canals connecting the Danube and Tisza rivers. T√ºrr was deeply involved with the Panama Canal at its earlier stage, being himself the President of the \\"Societe Civile Internationale du Canal Interoceanique\\" that proposed to build it.Popular Science Magazine, July 1902 In 1876, T√ºrr as well as B√©la Gerster, a younger Hungarian engineer who would be his partner in later projects, accompanied Ferdinand de Lesseps in an international expedition with the task of locating the most suitable route of an interoceanic canal that would eventually become the Panama Canal. However, T√ºrr was no longer involved in later stages of the French Panama project, having shifted his interest and gave his full attention to another canal, closer to home (see below). This saved T√ºrr from public responsibility for the fiasco of the collapse of French Panama project and the appalling loss of thousands of workers to disease at Panama. After 1881, T√ºrr and Gerster were involved with the Greek Government's major project of planning and implementing the Corinth Canal, a project that gained considerable international attention. In his 1883 travel book, \\"To the Gold Coast for Gold\\", Richard Francis Burton mentioned meeting \\"that talented and energetic soldier, General T√ºrr\\" in Venice, and predicted that the hitherto impoverished Patras \\"will have a fine time when [T√ºrr] begins the piercing of the Isthmus.\\" In 1888, the company constructing the canal failed, putting the project's completion in danger. T√ºrr then led a successful effort to get governments and individuals to invest further sums, so that on 6 August 1893, King George I of Greece and his wife, Queen Olga could solemnly inaugurate the artificial waterway. Also in partnership with Gerster, T√ºrr formulated monumental plans of water-supply engineering in Hungary itself. As well as promoting the canalization of the Danube he was distinguished for supporting the newborn Hungarian national industry. 1890s Transylvania Controversy Like other Hungarian Nationalists, T√ºrr in his later years was mainly concerned, not with confronting Austrian rule, a goal mostly if not completely achieved through the compromise of 1867, but in preserving Hungarian territory and interests against the demands of other nationalities. In particular, T√ºrr was opposed to the Transylvanian Memorandum movement of 1892, whose initiators demanded greater autonomy for Romanians, a demand seen as the prelude for altogether detaching Transylvania from Hungarian rule and therefore causing the Manifesto's organisers to be imprisoned by the Hungarian authorities. In 1894 and 1895, T√ºrr published articles condemning the Memorandum participants and their Bucharest-based partisans. Nedelcu Oprea, Vasile Alexandrescu Urechia. PreocupƒÉri bibliologice , at the V. A. Urechia Library of Gala≈£i; retrieved February 2, 2008 One of the latter, V. A. Urechia, answered in kind in a series of articles of his own, debating T√ºrr on the pages of the European press and in various international forums. \\"The Pacifist General\\" of the Universal Peace Congresses In 1878, the International Peace Congress (\\"Congr√®s International de la Paix\\") was held in Paris, bringing together a great a variety of peace activists from all over Europe to debate ways of working to prevent war. One of the organizers, the Swiss Valentine de Sellon who would later write a book on the congress \\"Congr√®s international de la paix. Paris, 1878\\" by Valentine de Sellon . noted with great satisfaction the participation of workers and women, and \\"even [of] a former general\\".Quoted in \\"Patriotic pacifism: waging war on war in Europe, 1815‚Äì1914\\", by Sandi E. Cooper The former general referred to was Istv√°n T√ºrr. From that time until his death, T√ºrr would increasingly become known in the role of \\"The Pacifist General\\", who became \\"a prominent personality of the international peace movement\\".An online biography where he is placed among other \\"noteworthy Hungarians\\" notes this as one of T√ºrr's claims to fame In the 1890s, T√ºrr was \\"a regular fixture\\" in the annual Universal Peace Congresses, held every year at a different location. In 1896 he was elected President of the Seventh Congress, held at Budapest. The well-known Austrian pacifist Bertha Von Suttner recalls in her memoires the great impression of meeting, on that occasion, \\"the old warrior, General T√ºrr\\" (he was seventy one at the time) and hearing from him that \\"he had seen so much of war that he came to thoroughly detest it\\".Quoted in Von Suttner's \\"The Records of an Eventful Life\\", Volume 2, Ch. XLIX T√ºrr recalled, and Von Suttner later published, some horrors that he had witnessed during the Expedition of the Thousand, which had not been published in 1860 itself. For example, entering a village and discovering the bodies of Bourbon soldiers who had been burned to death by the inhabitants. When Garibaldi became extremely furious with the villagers for having perpetrated such an act, they responded that it was done in retaliation for the soldiers having earlier set houses on fire in the village and prevented their inhabitants from escaping.Von Suttner, Op. Cit. \\"Yellow Peril\\" and The Boxer Rebellion T√ºrr was the first person known to have used in public the term \\"The Yellow Peril\\".http://passingstrangeness.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/the-yellow-peril/ He used it in June 1895; in an article mainly concerned with Otto von Bismarck, there was a passage referring to Japan's recent victory over China where T√ºrr remarked: \\"The 'yellow peril' is more threatening than ever. Japan has made in a few years as much progress as other nations have made in centuries.\\" This was widely republished and translated throughout the world (the quotation here is from the text published at the time in an Ohio paper, The Sandusky Register).June 1895 Sandusky Register article quoted in the \\"Phrases, sayings and idioms\\" website , also here . A few months later, in September 1895, Kaiser Wilhelm II took up the term and made extensive use of it, being indeed often credited as its originator. As interpreted by the German Emperor (and subsequently, by many others) this implied a concrete threat by \\"Yellow Hordes\\" in the Far East, poised to invade and overwhelm the West by sheer numbers. This attitude to \\"Yellow-skinned people\\" had very concrete results in Wilhelm, a few years later, explicitly exhorting German troops involved in putting down the Boxer Rebellion in China to particularly ruthless and cruel conduct. There is, however, no record of T√ºrr sharing such attitudes. In fact, \\"General Etienne Turr, Buda\\" is duly noted in the list of participants at the Tenth Universal Peace Congress held at Glasgow in 1901, where that Western expedition against the Boxer Rebellion, in the previous year, was strongly condemned. In that gathering, Dr. Spence Watson got applause when stating at the podium that \\"The swooping down of the Christian nations on China [was] the most detestable bit of greed that history records\\". The conference as a whole adopted resolutions clearly condemning that Western intervention in China (though in milder terms) and stating that defence of Western missionaries active in non-European countries, or of connverts to Christianity, was not an acceptable reason for waging war.\\"Proceedings of the Tenth Universal Peace Congress, held in St. Andrew's, Glasgow\\" The transcript does not record, however, any speech made by T√ºrr himself, who was then 76 and had recently lost his wife. Last years T√ºrr's wife Adelina died on 8 July 1899 at Berck, France. In his last years, T√ºrr spent much of his time in Paris. He died in Budapest on 3 May 1908. His son Raoul predeceased him in 1906. He was survived by his granddaughter Maria Stephanie T√ºrr (1895‚Äì1994).http://www.geneall.net/U/per_page.php?id=110090 Today, there are only a few descendants of Istv√°n T√ºrr and the granddaughter of Lucien Bonaparte, Adelina.

Opened in 1914, the theater was later known as the Mark Strand Theatre, the Warner Theatre, and the Cinerama Theatre. It closed as the RKO Warner Twin Theatre, and was demolished in 1987. History The Strand Theatre was built in 1914 as part of the chain of movie theaters owned by the Mark Brothers, Mitchel and Moe. It cost US$1 million () to build and is believed to have been the first lavish movie palace built only to show motion pictures. It was designed by Thomas W. Lamb and served as a model for many other similar theaters built at the time. The New York Times favorably reviewed the opening of the Strand, helping to establish its importance. To manage the theater, Mitchel Mark personally hired Samuel \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel. Rothafel developed his luxurious style of presenting films at the Strand which he later perfected at the Capitol and Roxy Theatres, becoming the best known motion picture showman in New York City. The theatre was under contract and mostly showed films distributed by Paramount Pictures. In 1928, the Mark Strand became the Warner Strand when Warner Bros acquired the theatre to showcase its films on Times Square. It was eventually renamed the Warner Theatre in 1951. After closing for renovation in 1952, the theater reopened as the Warner Cinerama Theatre in 1953 with the widescreen film This Is Cinerama (1952). The Warner was the primary New York home of Cinerama films during the remaining years of the 1950s and in 1963 installed an even larger screen to present such 70mm films as It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). In 1968, the theater was converted into three separate cinemas by RKO Stanley Warner Theatres. The 1,000 seat Warner Cinerama now occupied the original theater's main floor. The 1,200 seat Penthouse Theatre occupied the former balcony and the Cine Orleans was created in the stage house of the old Strand, entered from 47th St. The Cinerama and Penthouse were renamed again in the 1980s as the RKO Warner Twin. The entire building closed on February 8, 1987. It was demolished to make way for the Morgan Stanley Building, part of the redevelopment of Times Square. Memorable films that had their New York premieres at the Strand include Captain Blood (1935) starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland.

Early life and career Ranulph Crewe was the second son of John Crew of Nantwich, who is said to have been a tanner, by Alice, daughter of Humphrey Mainwaring. He attended Shrewsbury School and, in 1576, Christ's College, Cambridge, but did not take a degree. He was admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn on 13 November 1577, called to the bar on 8 November 1584, returned to parliament as junior member for Brackley, Northamptonshire, in 1597, elected a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1600, and Autumn Reader there in 1602. The earliest reported case in which he was engaged was tried in the Queen's Bench in Hilary term 1597‚Äì8, when he acted as junior to the attorney-general, Coke. In 1604 he was selected by the House of Commons to state objections to the adoption of the new style of king of Great Britain in the conference with the lords. Involvement in leading trials His name does not appear in the official list of returns to parliament after 1597. He was certainly, however, the member for Saltash in 1614, and was elected speaker (7 April). He was knighted in June, and took the degree of serjeant-at-law in July of the following year. In the address with which, according to custom, he opened the session in 1614, he enlarged upon the length of the royal pedigree, to which he gave a fabulous extension. In January 1614‚Äì15 Crewe was appointed one of the commissioners for the examination, under torture, of the Puritan minister Edmond Peacham for high treason, in that his attacks, which were never published, on the King and his ministers could be construed as incitement to regicide and rebellion. Peacham refused to speak even after being tortured on the rack. Crewe concurred with the advice of the majority of the High Court judges that Peacham's unpublished writings clearly amounted to treason, although Coke in a celebrated ruling called Peacham's Case vehemently disagreed. Peacham was sent down to Somersetshire to stand his trial at the assizes. Crewe prosecuted, and Peacham was convicted. He was sentenced to death but allowed to die in prison. Crewe's professional reputation was somewhat damaged by the Leicester boy Witch Trials, where he sat as an extra judge of assize. Nine women were hanged on the evidence of a young boy called John Smith whom Crewe, and his colleague Sir Humphrey Winch, found entirely credible, but whom King James soon after declared to be a fraud. Crewe was a member of the commission which tried Richard Weston for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury in 1615, and was concerned with Bacon and Montague in the prosecution of the Earl and Countess of Somerset as accessories before the fact to Overbury's murder in the following year. In 1621 he conducted the prosecution of Henry Yelverton, the attorney-general, for certain alleged misdemeanours in connection with patents. The same year Crewe prosecuted Sir Francis Mitchell for alleged corrupt practices in executing 'the commission concerning gold and silver thread,' conducted the impeachment of Sir John Bennet, judge of the Prerogative court, for corruption in his office, and materially contributed to the settlement of an important point in the law of impeachment. Edward Floyde, having published a libel on the Princess Palatine, was impeached by the commons, and sentenced to the pillory. The lords disputed the right of the commons to pass sentence upon the offender on two grounds : (1) that he was not a member of their house ; (2) that the offence did not touch their privileges. At the conference which followed Crewe adduced a precedent from the reign of Henry IV in support of the contention of the lords, and the commons being able to produce no counter-precedent the question was quietly settled by the commons entering in the journal a minute to the effect that the proceedings against Floyde should not become a precedent. In 1624 Crewe presented part of the case against Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex, on his impeachment. The same year he was appointed king's serjeant. Lord Chief Justice Crewe as Lord Chief Justice The following year (26 January 1625) he was created chief justice of the king's bench by King James I. On 9 November 1626, he was removed by Charles I for having refused to subscribe a document affirming the legality of forced loans. All his colleagues seem to have concurred with him, but he alone was punished. The Oxford peerage case The Crewe family is said to be among the most ancient in the kingdom, a fact the importance of which is not likely to have been underrated by Sir Ranulph, if we may judge by his eloquent prologue to the Oxford peerage case, decided 1625, which is one of the few passages of really fine prose to be found in the Law Reports. \\"Time\\" he said, \\"hath his revolutions, and there must be an end to all temporal things, \\"... \\"Where,\\" he asks, \\"is Bohun, where's Mowbray, where's Mortimer? Nay, which is more and most of all, where is Plantagenet? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality. And yet let the name and dignity of De Vere stand so long as it pleaseth God.\\" Retirement From a letter written by him to the Duke of Buckingham (28 June 1628) it seems that he hoped to receive some compensation through Buckingham's support. On the assassination of Buckingham (24 August 1628) Crewe urged his suit upon the king himself, but without success. After the impeachment in 1641 of the judges who had affirmed the legality of Ship money, Denzil Holles moved the House of Lords to petition the king to compensate Crewe, who seems to have passed the rest of his days in retirement, partly in London, and partly at his seat, Crewe Hall, Barthomley, Cheshire, built by him upon an estate said to have belonged to his ancestors, which he purchased from Coke in 1608. Crewe Hall was garrisoned for the parliament, taken by Byron in December 1643, and retaken in the following February. A letter from Crewe to Sir Richard Browne at Paris, under date 10 April 1644, describing the growing exasperation of 'this plus quam civile bellum,' as he called it, and the devastation of the country, is preserved in the British Museum, and is printed in the Fairfax Correspondence. Crewe died at Westminster on 3 January 1645‚Äì6, and was buried on 5 June in a chapel built by himself at Barthomley. Private life Crewe's second wife, Julia Fasey (Peter Lely) He married twice: #on 20 July 1598, Julia, daughter and coheiress of John Clipsby or Clippesby of Clippesby, Norfolk, who died on 29 July 1603 ; #on 12 April 1607, Julia, daughter of Edward Fasey of London, relict of Sir Thomas Hesketh, knight, who died on 10 August 1629. Julia Fasey was the widow of a prosperous Gray's Inn lawyer with a flourishing practise. It enabled Ranulph to buy an estate at Barthomley in Cheshire from Sir Christopher Hatton.Catalogue Note from the portraits of Randlph and Julia Crewe By his first wife, he had two sons, Clipsby Crew and John Crew, who were both MPs.

She was the only U.S. Navy ship named for the Chiwawa River in Washington. History Chiwawa was launched 25 June 1942 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Sparrows Point, Maryland, under a Maritime Commission contract as SS Samoset; sponsored by Mrs. H. G. Smith; acquired by the Navy 24 December 1942; commissioned the same day, Commander Harold F. Fultz in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet. The Chiwawa was designated a T3-S-A1 design, where \\"T\\" stood for tanker, \\"3\\" meant longer than , \\"S\\" stood for single-screw steam propulsion, and \\"A1\\" meant first design of its kind.Strupp, Jon L.

Military Service Chiwawa cleared Norfolk, Virginia, 13 February 1943 to load oil at Aruba, and returned to New York 25 February to join a convoy for Casablanca, Morocco, which sailed 4 March. Attacked by a wolf-pack east of the Azores, the convoy lost four ships, but aircraft from Port Lyautey, Morocco, drove the U-boats away, and the remainder of the convoy arrived safely 21 March. Chiwawa put out of Casablanca in convoy 11 April for Norfolk, arriving 28 April after a quiet passage. Between 4 May and 17 July she ferried oil on the east coast, loading at Aruba, Netherlands West Indies, and Port Arthur, Texas, and discharging her cargo at Bermuda, Argentia, Newfoundland and Norfolk. She made three convoy crossings, to Scotland, Wales, and Casablanca, between 17 July and 4 December, then resumed operations to Port Arthur and Aruba, except for the period 25 January-8 March 1944, when she again crossed to North Africa. After two convoy crossings to the British Isles in May and July 1944, Chiwawa sailed 14 July from Norfolk for Mers el Kebir, Algeria, and Naples, Italy, arriving 5 August. From Naples, Chiwawa fueled the ships carrying out the invasion of southern France until she retired to Oran, Algeria, on 2 September. She returned to New York 14 September to resume coastal oil runs until her next convoy to Casablanca in November. A series of runs between Aruba and New York, then to Guant√°namo Bay and Bermuda, and later to Argentia occupied Chiwawa until 31 May 1945, when she entered Norfolk Navy Yard for overhaul until 1 July. She cleared Norfolk to load oil at Baytown, Texas, and on 1 August reached Pearl Harbor. Five days later she sailed for Ulithi and Okinawa, where from 30 August to 29 November she served as station tanker, making one voyage in September to fuel the U.S. 7th Fleet at sea. Homeward bound, Chiwawa put in at San Francisco, California, and Balboa, arriving at New York 7 January 1946. She sailed 19 January 1946 from Melville, Rhode Island, for ports in England, Germany, and France, called at Casco Bay and Argentia, and put back to Iceland before her arrival in New York 18 March. Chiwawa was decommissioned 6 May 1946 and transferred to the Maritime Commission 23 August 1946. Civilian Service The Lee A.

She was then rebuilt as a straight-decked bulk freighter for Great Lakes service, at American Shipbuilding, Lorain, Ohio, renamed SS Walter A. Sterling and launched, 15 July 1961. That conversion included the integration of a 510-foot midbody cargo section constructed in Germany and towed across the Atlantic Ocean. She was sold in 1985 to Ford Motor Company, renamed SS William Clay Ford (II). In 1989, she was sold again, this time to Lakes Shipping Co. and renamed SS Lee A. Tregurtha. Now owned by Interlake Steamship Co., the Tregurtha had her steam engine room removed in the winter of 2005-2006 and replaced with a diesel power plant.

The idea was first raised by the Barroso European Commission in 2011 during the 2009-2012 European sovereign debt crisis. Eurobonds would be debt investments whereby an investor loans a certain amount of money, for a certain amount of time, with a certain interest rate, to the eurozone bloc altogether, which then forwards the money to individual governments. The proposal was floated again in 2020 as a potential response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, leading such debt issue to be dubbed \\"corona bonds\\". Eurobonds have been suggested as a way to tackle the 2009-2012 European debt crisis as the indebted states could borrow new funds at better conditions as they are supported by the rating of the non-crisis states. Because Eurobonds would allow already highly indebted states access to cheaper credit thanks to the strength of other eurozone economies, they are controversial, and may suffer from the free rider problem. The proposal was generally favored by indebted governments such as Portugal, Greece, and Ireland, but encountered strong opposition, notably from Germany, the eurozone's strongest economy. The plan ultimately never moved forward in face of German and Dutch opposition; the crisis was ultimately resolved by the ECB's declaration in 2012 that it would do \\"whatever it takes\\" to stabilise the currency, rendering the Eurobond proposal moot. Blue bond proposal In May 2010 the two economists Jakob von Weizs√§cker and Jacques Delpla published an article proposing a mix of traditional national bonds (red bonds) and jointly issued eurobonds (blue bonds) to prevent debt crises in weaker countries, while at the same time enforcing fiscal sustainability. According to the proposal EU member states should pool up to 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) of their national debt under joint and several liability as senior sovereign debt (blue tranche), thereby reducing the borrowing cost for that part of the debt. Any national debt beyond a country's blue bond allocation (red tranche) should be issued as national and junior debt with sound procedures for an orderly default, thus increasing the marginal cost of public borrowing and helping to enhance fiscal discipline. Participating countries must also establish an Independent Stability Council voted on by member states parliaments to propose annually an allocation for the blue bond and to safeguard fiscal responsibility. The authors argue that while their concept is not a quick fix, their Blue Bond proposal charts an incentive-driven and durable way out of the debt dilemma while \\"helping prepare the ground for the rise of the euro as an important reserve currency, which could reduce borrowing costs for everybody involved\\". Smaller countries with relatively illiquid sovereign bonds (such as Austria and Luxembourg) could benefit most from the extra liquidity of the blue bond, although Germany's borrowing costs under the blue bond scheme would be expected to fall below current levels. Countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios (such as Italy, Greece, and Portugal) would have a strong incentive for fiscal adjustment. European Commission proposal On 21 November 2011 the European Commission suggested European bonds issued jointly by the 17 eurozone states as an effective way to tackle the financial crisis. On 23 November 2011 the Commission presented a Green Paper assessing the feasibility of common issuance of sovereign bonds among the EU member states of the eurozone. Sovereign issuance in the eurozone is currently conducted individually by each EU member states. The introduction of commonly issued eurobonds would mean a pooling of sovereign issuance among the member states and the sharing of associated revenue flows and debt-servicing costs. On 29 November 2012, European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso suggested to introduce Eurobonds step by step, first applying to short-term bonds, then two-year bonds, and later Eurobonds, based on a deeply integrated economic and fiscal governance framework. Three approaches to eurobonds The green paper lists three broad approaches for common issuance of eurobonds based on the degree of substitution of national issuance (full or partial) and the nature of the underlying guarantee (joint and several or several). #Full eurobonds with joint liability: This option suggests to fully replace the entire national issuance by eurobonds, each EU member being fully liable for the entire issuance. According to the European Commission \\"this would have strong potential positive effects on stability and integration. But at the same time, it would, by abolishing all market or interest rate pressure on Member States, pose a relatively high risk of moral hazard and it might need significant treaty changes.\\" #Partial eurobonds with joint liability: The second option would pool only a portion of borrowings, again guaranteed by all. This means EU member states would still partly issue national bonds to cover the share of their debts beyond a certain percentage of GDP not covered by eurobonds. The Commission does not state a specific volume or share of financing needs that would be covered by national bonds at the one hand and eurobonds on the other. However, the proposal is similar to that of the German Council of Economic Experts that proposed a European collective redemption fund, which would mutualise the debt in the eurozone above 60%, combined with a bold debt reduction scheme for those countries, which are not on life support from the European Financial Stability Facility. This option is expected to require an amendment of the TFEU treaty. #Partial eurobonds without joint guarantees: According to the third option that is similar to the blue bond proposal, eurobonds would again cover only parts of the debt (like option 2) but without joint guarantees. This could impose strict entry conditions for a smaller group of countries to pool some debt and allow for the removal of countries that do not meet their fiscal obligations. Due to \\"a mechanism to redistribute some of the funding advantages ... between the higher- and lower-rated\\" governments, this option aims to minimise the risk of moral hazard for the conduct of economic and fiscal policies. Unlike the first two approaches, this would involve \\"several but not joint\\" government guarantees and could therefore be implemented relatively quickly without having to change EU treaties. =Suggested effects= According to the European Commission proposal the introduction of eurobonds would create new means through which governments finance their debt, by offering safe and liquid investment opportunities. This \\"could potentially quickly alleviate the current sovereign debt crisis, as the high-yield Member States could benefit from the stronger creditworthiness of the low-yield Member States.\\" The effect would be immediate even if the introduction of eurobonds takes some time, since changed market expectations adapt instantly, resulting in lower average and marginal funding costs, particularly to those EU member states most hit by the financial crisis. The commission also believes that eurobonds could make the eurozone financial system more resilient to future adverse shocks and reinforce financial stability. Furthermore, they could reduce the vulnerability of banks in the eurozone to deteriorating credit ratings of individual member states by providing them with a source of more robust collateral. Setting a euro-area wide integrated bond market would offer a safe and liquid investment opportunity for savers and financial institutions that matches its US$ counterpart in terms of size and liquidity, which would also strengthen the position of the euro as an international reserve currency and foster a more balanced global financial system. On the other hand, the governments of those states that most people would like to take over those debt risks do not think that this is a good idea and see other effects. They do not understand why it should help a group of states that have excessively borrowed and circumvented the EU contracts for many years should now be helped by making it even easier for them to borrow even more via Eurobonds. Germany is one of those sceptical states, together with Austria, Finland and the Netherlands. Hans-Werner Sinn from the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research believes the cost for German tax payers to be between 33 and 47 billion Euros per year. Other economists such as Henrik Enderlein from the Hertie School of Governance and Gustav Horn from the Macroeconomic Policy Institute (IMK) contend these figures. Both suggest that German interest rates would only go up marginally, as Eurobonds would benefit from substantially higher liquidity and demand from around the world. Again others believe German interest rates could even go down. Experts from the German finance ministry expect borrowing costs to go up by 0.8%, resulting in additional borrowing costs of 2.5 billion Euros in the first year of introduction and 5 billion in the second year, reaching 20‚Äì25 billion Euros after 10 years respectively. After all, Eurobond supporters argue that their introduction \\"would be far less expensive than the continuous increases to the emergency umbrella or even a failure of the euro.\\" Tighter fiscal rules Presenting the idea of \\"stability bonds\\", Jose Manuel Barroso insisted that any such plan would have to be matched by tight fiscal surveillance and economic policy co-ordination as an essential counterpart so as to avoid moral hazard and ensure sustainable public finances. Under the proposals, eurozone governments would have to submit their draft national budgets for the following year to the European Commission by 15 October. The commission would then be able to ask the government to revise the budget if it believed that it was not sound enough to meet its targets for debt and deficit levels as set out in the Euro convergence criteria. On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the euro zone and six states that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries that violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries except Great Britain are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. Reactions Italy and Greece have frequently spoken out in favour of eurobonds, the then Italian Minister of economy Giulio Tremonti calling it the \\"master solution\\" to the eurozone debt crisis. A growing field of investors and economists share this belief, saying eurobonds would be the best way of solving the debt crisis. However, Germany remains opposed to debt that would be jointly issued and underwritten by all 17 members of the currency bloc, saying it could substantially raise the country's liabilities in the debt crisis. Barroso maintained that Germany did not oppose joint issuance in principle, but questioned the timing of it. Austria, Bulgaria, Finland and the Netherlands have also raised objections over eurobond issuance. Bulgarian finance minister Simeon Djankov criticised eurobonds in Austria's Der Standard: \\"Cheap credit got us into the current eurozone crisis, it's naive to think it is going to get us out of it.\\" Counter proposals On 28 November 2011, German newspaper Die Welt reported that Germany, France and four other AAA-rated EU members may issue common \\"elite bonds\\" (or \\"triple A bonds\\") in a bid to raise more money at low interest rates for themselves and, under strict conditions, to help also indebted euro region members. Austria, Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are said to be part of the plan aimed at stabilising the top-rated countries and calming financial markets. Common bonds of the six countries are expected to have an interest rate of 2 percent to 2.5 percent. Following the 2011 proposal made by the \\"five wise economists\\" from the German Council of Economic Experts, Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the liberal ALDE group in the European Parliament, suggested creating a European collective redemption fund. It would mutualise eurozone debt above 60%, combining it with a bold debt reduction scheme for countries not on life support from the EFSF. In January 2012 a working group within the European League for Economic Cooperation unveiled a blueprint for a Euro T-Bill Fund. The proposal, which elaborates further on a concept first introduced by Rabo Bank's Chief Economist Wim Boonstra, calls for a temporary fund of only four years and bonds with a maturity of a maximum of two years. In March 2012, Boston Consulting Group also followed up on the German Council proposal, agreeing that \\"the scope of the problem is too great to be solved by the European Stability Mechanism or the medium-term injection of liquidity by the European Central Bank\\" and favouring limited-scope Eurobonds.Delamaide, Darrell, \\"Last chance to avoid nasty euro train wreck\\", MarketWatch, 12 April 2012. With link to ‚ÄúFixing the Euro‚Äù, the BCG paper. Retrieved 2012-04-12. In June 2012, German chancellor Angela Merkel firmly rejected any German support for Eurobonds.spiegel.de:Kanzlerin Merkel schlie√üt Eurobonds aus (german) Critics The planned introduction of Eurobonds has been criticised by economists for reasons such as the free rider problem and moral hazard. Beside economic grounds, mainly legal and political reasons are mentioned which could prohibit the introduction of Eurobonds: Article 125 of the Lisbon Treaty states explicitly that the European Union and its member states are not liable for the commitments of other members. Since Eurobonds would possibly contravene Article 125, it may have to be changed prior introduction. Corona bonds The positions of the national governments on eurobonds in April 2020EU Fails to Agree on 500 Billion-Euro Response to Virus Crisis Spanish and Italian leaders have called for jointly issued \\"corona bonds\\" in order to help their countries, hard-hit by the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, to recover from the epidemic. Corona bonds were discussed on 26 March 2020 in a European Council meeting, but Germany and the Netherlands ruled out issuing such bonds. European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde, who plans (separately) to buy more than 1 trillion euros in bonds in response to coronavirus, urged the EU to consider issuing corona bonds. After the meeting, Spanish leaders continued to argue for jointly issued debt. Despite the fact that the European Commission and European Central Bank released billions in special funds, relaxed the limits for budget deficits and government debt of EU countries, some members (such as France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia and Luxembourg) demanded more to be done in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Germany which was the strongest opponent of eurobonds, was supported by Austria, the Netherlands, Finland and Estonia. In the meantime, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte questioned: \\"What do we want to do in Europe? Does each member state want to go its own way?\\", he also added: \\"If we are a union, now is the time to prove it\\", in Germany's weekly Die Zeit. Conte also described the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as \\"completely inadequate\\" to face the crisis.Conte stronca il Mes: inadeguato, Milano Finanza Later on, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen mentioned that \\"Today Europe is mobilising alongside Italy. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case\\", she later added that EU \\"will allocate up to 100 billion euros ($110 billion) to the hardest hit countries, starting from Italy, to compensate for the reduction in the wages of those working on shorter hours\\". The main opposition to the plan by the Commission came from the so-called Frugal Four.

UC Davis Health System, n.d. Web. 12 Mar. 2014. . Although the mode of action is unknown, TCC can be effective in fighting infections by targeting the growth of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. Additional research seeks to understand its potential for causing antibacterial resistance and its effects on organismal and environmental health. Usage Triclocarban has been used as an antimicrobial and antifungal compound since the 1960s. It was commonly found in personal care products as an antimicrobial in soaps, lotions, deodorants, toothpaste, and plastic. about 80% of all antimicrobial bar soap sold in the United States contained triclocarban. In 2011 United States consumers were spending nearly 1 billion dollars annually on products containing triclocarban and triclosan. In December 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required all companies to prove within the next year, that triclocarban is not harmful to consumers. Companies like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, and Avon began phasing out antibacterial ingredients due to health concerns.Westervelt, Amy, https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/avon-remove-triclosan- product-cosmetic-chemicals, 4 April 2014 By 2016 usage of triclocarban in soaps had declined to 40%, and that September the FDA banned triclocarban, triclosan and 17 other common antibacterial chemicals by September 2017, for their failure to be proven safe, or more effective than plain soap and water. Chemical structure and properties Triclocarban, 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea, is a white powder that is insoluble in water. While triclocarban has two chlorinated phenyl rings, it is structurally similar to carbanilide compounds often found in pesticides (such as diuron) and some drugs. Chlorination of ring structures is often associated with hydrophobicity, persistence in the environment, and bioaccumulation in fatty tissues of living organisms. For this reason, chlorine is also a common component of persistent organic pollutants.\\"How Do the Partitioning Properties of Polyhalogenated POPs Change When Chlorine Is Replaced with Bromine?\\" Environmental Science and Technology.

Web. 17 Feb. 2014. Mechanism of action=Bacteria Triclocarban is predominantly active against gram positive bacteria (bacteria with a thick peptidoglycan wall). The precise mechanism of action of triclocarban is unknown, but it is shown to be bacteriostatic, which prevents bacterial proliferation. Humans The specific mechanism of action for triclocarban's health effects on humans, like in bacteria, is unclear. Generally, triclocarban enhances the gene expression of other steroid hormones, including androgens, estrogens, and cortisol. It is hypothesized that the compound acts similar to cofactors or coactivators that modulate the activity of estrogen receptors and androgen receptors. Experiments show that triclocarban activates constitutive androstane receptor and estrogen receptor alpha both in vivo and in vitro and might have the potential to alter normal physiological homeostasis. Activation of these receptors amplifies gene expression and, in doing so, may be the mechanistic base of triclocarban's health impact on humans. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether triclocarban increases the activity of sex steroid hormones by binding to the receptors or by binding to and sensitizing the receptor coactivators. Antibacterial properties Triclocarban acts to treat both initial bacterial skin and mucosal infections as well as those infections at risk for superinfection. In vitro, triclocarban has been found to be effective against various strains of staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus bacteria. It has been shown to be effective as an antibacterial even at very low levels. Triclocarban‚Äôs minimum inhibitory concentration has been found to range from 0.5 to 8 mg/L for these various strains. Triclocarban is unquestionably bacteriostatic only for gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, which suggests that the mechanism of triclocarban‚Äôs antibacterial activity is through its destabilization of bacterial cell walls. Resistance Exposure of organisms like fish, algae, and humans to low levels of triclocarban and other antibacterial chemicals kills weak microbes and allows the stronger, resistant strains to proliferate. As microbes share genes, an increase in resistant strains increases the probability that weak microbes acquire these resistance genes. The consequence is a new colony of drug resistant microbes. When resistant microbes are exposed to antimicrobials, they increase their expression of genes that confer this resistance. The risk of bacterial antibiotic resistance has been studied by quantitatively monitoring the abundance of the tetQ gene in wastewater microcosms. As tetQ is the most common resistance gene in the environment and encodes for ribosomal protection proteins, the amount that it expresses correlates with the amount of resistance in a microbial population. The addition of triclocarban was shown to increase the expression of this tetQ gene. TetQ gene expression in bacteria was also found to be significantly increased when multiple antimicrobials such as tetracycline, triclosan, and triclocarban were added to an experimental system at the same time. Combining these compounds affects resistance by creating a situation where co-selection (or natural selection by more than one reagent) for resistance genes occurs. The complex nature of microbial communities and the multitude of antibiotics present in aquatic environments often leads to this sort of dynamic selection event and the multiple resistance patterns seen in naturally occurring bacteria. Environmental fate When triclocarban is manufactured, 139 toxic, carcinogenic byproducts, such as 4-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline, are released. More of these carcinogens can be released upon chemical, physical and biological attack of triclocarban. The duration of triclocarban chemical in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, the triclocarban is washed down the drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, where about 97-98% of triclocarban is removed from the water. Discharge of effluent from these treatment plants and disposal of sludge on land is the primary route of environmental exposure to triclocarban. Research shows that triclocarban and triclosan have been detected in sewage effluents and sludge (biosolids) due to their incomplete removal during wastewater treatment. Due to their hydrophobic nature, significant amounts of them in wastewater streams partition into sludge, with concentrations at mg/kg levels. The volume of triclocarban reentering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is s 127,000 ¬± 194,000 kg/yr. This is equivalent to a 4.8 ‚Äì 48.2% of its total U.S consumption volume. Crops shown to take up antimicrobials from soil include barley, meadow fescue, carrots and pinto beans. Studies show that substantial quantities of triclocarban (227,000 ‚Äì 454,000 kg/y) can break through wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters. Environmental concerns=Waste water High concentrations of triclocarban may be found in wastewater. As of 2011 it was among the top ten most commonly detected organic wastewater compounds in terms of frequency and concentration. Triclocarban has been found in increasing concentrations over the past five years and is now more frequently detected than triclosan. Wildlife toxicity Triclocarban has a hazard quotient rating of greater than one, which indicates the potential for adverse effects on organisms due to toxicity. As triclocarban is found in high concentrations in aquatic environments, there are concerns regarding its toxicity to aquatic species. Specifically, triclocarban has been shown to be toxic to amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and aquatic plants, and traces of the compound have been found in Atlantic dolphins. Triclocarban may disrupt hormones critical to the developmental and endocrine processes in exposed animal wildlife. The neurological and reproductive systems are particularly affected through contact with this compound. Triclocarban may also affect animal wildlife behavior. For example, triclosan and triclocarban are 100-1,000 times more effective in inhibiting and killing algae, crustaceans, and fish than they are in killing microbes. Triclocarban and triclosan have been observed in multiple organisms, including algae, aquatic blackworms, fish, and dolphins. Bioaccumulation Triclocarban bioaccumulation is possible in a number of organisms. Earthworms are known to store this chemical in their bodies and, because of their ecological role as a food source, they have the potential to move triclocarban up the food chain. Microbial species found in soils also bioaccumulate triclocarban. However, the health of these microbes has not been found to be affected by the presence of the chemical. Triclocarban is rapidly accumulated in both algae and adult caged snails. Moreover, triclocarban is more likely than triclosan to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. Bioaccumulation occurs in plants treated with water containing triclocarban. However, it is estimated that less than 0.5% of the acceptable daily intake of triclocarban for humans is represented by vegetable consumption. Thus, the concentration of triclocarban in edible portions of plants is a negligible exposure pathway for humans. The potential for triclocarban to bioaccumulate in plants has been exploited in the construction of wetlands meant to help remove triclocarban from wastewater. These constructed wetlands are considered a cost-effective treatment option for the removal of PPCPs, including triclocarban and triclosan, from domestic water effluent. Such compounds tend to concentrate in the roots of wetland plants. Potential ecological risks associated with this method are the decrease of root systems in wetland plants, reduced nutrient uptake, decreased competitive ability, and increased potential for uprooting. Due to these risks, the long term exposure of wetland ecosystems to wastewater containing triclocarban as a major solution to wastewater pollution is still under discussion. Health concerns=Personal care One study has investigated how triclocarban remains in the human system after using a bar of soap with traces of triclocarban. Analysis of urine samples from human test subjects shows that, after triclocarban has undergone glucuronidation, its oxidative metabolites are less readily excreted than triclocarban itself. This same study performed topical treatments of triclocarban on rats and, by analyzing urine and plasma levels, demonstrated that triclocarban does remain in the organism's system.  Endocrine disorders Triclocarban induces weak responses mediated by aryl hydrocarbon, estrogen, and androgen receptors in vitro. This has yet to be confirmed in vivo. In vitro, the dihydrotestosterone-dependent activation of androgen receptor-responsive gene expression is enhanced by triclocarban by up to 130%. Triclocarban is also a potent inhibitor of the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in vitro. Additionally, triclocarban amplifies the bioactivity of testosterone and other androgens. This increased activity may have adverse implications for reproductive health. Triclocarban studies on rats exhibited increased size of the specimens' prostate glands.\\"Triclocarban: sc-213106 Material Safety Data Sheet.\\" Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Web. 17 Feb. 2014. . The amplification of sex hormones could promote the growth of breast and prostate cancer. While triclocarban causes endocrine disruption, its chemical toxicity with respect to lethality is low ( >5000 mg/kg). Its rate of skin absorption is also low. Repeated low-dose exposure, however, can cause endocrine disruption over time. Safety Spillage may increase the risk of human, ecological, and environmental exposure to triclocarban. Immediate removal and restraint of the spill, including triclocarban as dust, is urged. Although triclocarban has few to no direct detrimental effects on health aside from allergic reactions, preventing exposure to triclocarban is recommended. Since triclocarban enters the body through pores, wearing gloves, properly washing hands, and overall proper hygiene reduces the risk of skin exposure and irritation. High concentrations of triclocarban dust may remain in the lungs and inhibit lung and respiratory function. For individuals with prior respiratory conditions, triclocarban exacerbates the severity of respiratory diseases, and proper protection is recommended as a precaution. In case of exposure to triclocarban, the individual is suggested to wash the area with water or to clear the respiratory pathways. In addition to its adverse effects on humans and the environment, solid triclocarban is a fire hazard. It is particularly combustible as dust. Contamination with other oxidizing agents may also result in combustion. Policy The Food and Drug Administration began to review the safety of triclocarban and triclosan in the 1970s, but due to the difficulties of finding antimicrobial alternatives, no final policy, or \\"drug monograph,\\" was established. Legal action by the Natural Resources Defense Council in 2010 forced the FDA to review triclocarban and triclosan. The United States Environmental Protection Agency maintains regulatory control over triclocarban and triclosan. On September 2, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration announced that triclosan and triclocarban must be removed from all antibacterial soap products by late 2017. Triclocarban is similar in its use and adverse health impacts as triclosan, and hexachlorophene which was already prohibited by the FDA. Current research Scientists are searching for more sustainable antimicrobials that maintain their effectiveness while being minimally toxic to the environment, humans, and wildlife. This entails low degrees of bioaccumulation and rapid, clean biodegradation in existing wastewater treatment facilities. A lowered potential or no potential for resistance is also preferable. These next generation chemicals should aim to act on a broad spectrum of microbes and pathogens while also being minimally toxic and bioaccumulating in non-target species. Synthesis of these compounds could be improved upon by finding renewable sources for their production that lacks occupational hazards. Research into sustainable chemical production is helping to formulate green pharmaceuticals. These same principles may be applied to the development of improved antimicrobials. Developments in this area would benefit both people and the environment.

It is south of the B3408 between Popeswood and Wokingham. It was formerly the location of Binfield Brickworks. It is now home to the John Nike Leisuresport Complex, the Coppid Beech Hotel, and a number of hi-tech industries, including the UK Head Offices for 3M, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Fujitsu Technology Solutions. It also has a well-known music shop which specialises in guitars, bass guitars and drums. Amen Corner is split into Amen Corner North and Amen Corner South. Amen Corner North Amen Corner North lies between London Road and Murrell Hill Lane. Murrell Hill Lane is home to the Bracknell businessman John Nike OBE DL. Amen Corner North currently consists of fields which traditionally hosted circuses in the summer. In August 2014, Wilson Developments received outline planning permission to build 380 homes and a primary school on the site. Amen Corner South To the north of Amen Corner South lies a residential estate which was developed in the 1980s by Thameswey Homes (later bought by George Wimpey). The housing estate has a well-known music shop which specialises in guitars, bass guitars and drums. Amen Corner South was the home of the Binfield Brick and Tile Works Company's Binfield Brickworks between the late 19th century and the 1960s. The 60-acre site was purchased by John Nike OBE DL in 1969 through his company Key Properties Ltd (the Nike Group of Companies). The original plan was to build a garden centre on it. Part of the site now houses the John Nike Leisuresport Complex, comprising the Bracknell Ski and Snowboard Centre which was opened in 1985 and Bracknell Ice Rink which was opened in 1987. Adjacent to this is the four star, 205-bedroom Coppid Beech Hotel, which has an alpine ski lodge design and which was opened in 1992. There is also a small residential development opposite the entrance to the Coppid Beech Hotel, Braeside, whose dwellings look like ski lodges to blend in with the surrounding area. All of these developments are accessed via John Nike Way, which is privately owned by the Nike Group of Companies. Amen Corner Business Park - home to the UK Head Office of Hewlett-Packard To pay for these ventures, the Nike Group of Companies sold part of its land to Hewlett-Packard and the area now houses the UK Head Office for Hewlett-Packard at the Amen Corner Business Park, and the UK Head Offices for Dell, 3M and Fujitsu Technology Solutions. A further part of Amen Corner South is owned by the property company Helical Bar. In August 2014, the Nike Group of Companies was granted outline planning permission to develop the remaining part of its land (which was originally to house a garden centre), along with the land owned by Helical Bar, for 550 homes, a neighbourhood centre with shops and restaurants and a primary school.

Introduction On August 23, 1944 German soldiers left the town of Dƒôbica, and the Red Army units captured it. However, the frontline remained on the Wis≈Çoka river for a few months, until the beginning of 1945. Wehrmacht artillery shelled Dƒôbica, soldiers of the Armia Krajowa, cooperating with the Soviets, fought the enemy. After some time the Nazis were relentlessly pushed to the west and left their positions and the whole area of Dƒôbica County was in Soviet hands. However, Soviet advance was regarded by many as yet another occupation. Behavior of some Red Army units and the NKVD confirmed this notion - they persecuted Polish patriots, arrested and imprisoned them. Thousands of members of the Home Army were either shot or sent to Siberia. Under the circumstances, several members of the resistance movement decided to hide in the forests and to continue struggle for free Poland. After dissolution of the Home Army, new, anti-Communist organizations including, Freedom and Independence (Wolno≈õƒá i Niezawis≈Ço≈õƒá - WiN) and National Armed Forces (Narodowe Si≈Çy Zbrojne - NSZ) were created with the purpose was to rid Poland of Soviet occupiers. In 1945, Jan Stefko (aka \\"M≈õciciel\\" - \\"The Avenger\\") created a branch of the NSZ affiliated with the WiN in the district around Rzesz√≥w. Grƒôbosz, Koz≈Çowski, and Franciszek joined the group and took part in a number of attacks on Communists which led to their capture and eventual execution.Szczygie≈Ç, Rafa≈Ç. \\"Oddzia≈Ç Narodowych Si≈Ç Zbrojnych pod dow√≥dztwem Jana Stefki ps.‚ÄûM≈õciciel‚Äù w latach 1945‚Äì1946 w ≈õwietle dokument√≥w UB.\\" Folia Historica Cracoviensia 20, no. 1 (2014): 205-258. The condemned J√≥zef \\"Pszcz√≥≈Çka\\" Grƒôbosz was born June 3, 1921 in Tuszym and worked as a bricklayer. He was a member of the Polish Army until deserting in April 1945. In January 1946 he joined Stefko's group. J√≥zef \\"Mruk\\" Koz≈Çowski aka RƒÖbski was born on September 30, 1924 in Bitk√≥w (USSR) and was from a peasant family. On February 2, 1946 he deserted MO Korczyn and joined Stefko's group where he became a commander and deputy. Franciszek \\"Bukiet\\" Noster was born October 29, 1920 in Domaradz from a peasant farmer family. He was accused of being a part of an attack in June 1945 in a forest near Domaradz where seven Ukrainians were killed. He joined with Stefko in January 1946. Anti-Communist activities In the spring of 1946 Stefko's unit, with some 30 members, was staying in the area of Sƒôdzisz√≥w Ma≈Çopolski. There, an exchange of fire occurred between them and agents of the Communist secret services from the Ministry of Public Security (UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa - UB). On February 9, under the command of J√≥zef Koz≈Çowski, J√≥zef Grƒôbosz, Franciszek Noster and three others attacked the MO station in Domaradz and captured deputy commander Marian Urycie. They brought Urycia to where Stefko was staying and Stefko sentenced Urycia to death - a sentence which was carried out by Jan DƒÖbrowskiego on Stefko's command. A few days later, on February 15, a group including Stefko detained two militiamen and two officers of the PUBP, Walentego Dziƒôgiela and Stanis≈Çaw Kosydara. They disarmed the four men and according to later description by J√≥zef Grƒôbosz, Stefko told Grƒôbosz to shoot Dziƒôgiela and Grƒôbosz shot him in the head. Shortly thereafter, Kosydara tried to escape and when he was recaptured, J√≥zef Koz≈Çowski shot him, also in the head. At the funerals for Dziƒôgiela and Kosydara, UB authorities announced that the perpetrators should be executed. After this incident, the group moved towards Mielec, where on February 18 in the village of Przec≈Çaw a group including Koz≈Çowski and Grƒôbosz attacked Communist forces which were staying at a palace of the Rey (Rej√≥w) family, which had been nationalized. The attackers faced no resistance, they took jewelry and some paintings from the home of Stanis≈Çaw Sobkowicz and left. Capture of the group On February 20 on the way towards Jas≈Ço, the unit was caught in a trap set by soldiers of the Polish Army, militiamen and agents of UB in Grudna G√≥rna. Four persons were killed, 16 captured and 10 managed to flee, together with Jan Stefko. Three of those captured, Grƒôbosz, Koz≈Çowski, and Franciszek, were sentenced to death by District Court judge Norbert O≈Çy≈Ñski and lay judges Stanis≈Çaw Stefa≈Ñczyk and Edmund Kaczmarek in Rzesz√≥w on June 25, 1946 by the WSR. The trial was prosecuted by Marian Stok≈Çosy. On Wednesday, July 10, 1946, Dƒôbica's main square was full of people, as this was the market day. Two gallows were set - one in the square, another in the vicinity of the St. Jadwiga church. The purpose of the execution was obvious - to intimidate the population of the town. The execution It is difficult to establish how many people witnessed the event. At some point a truck entered the square, carrying three young men, members of WiN. The hangman, whose name probably was Stanis≈Çaw Swieca, haltered all of them and soon afterward the truck drove off, leaving the condemned in the air. The square was surrounded by the Communist agents who checked everything, making sure the execution was carried out without any obstacles. However, some witnesses claim that the head of one of the condemned men got out of the halter, but this was quickly fixed. Deaths were announced by doctor Roman Lic and Marian Stoklosa from Rzesz√≥w prosecutor's office. The three were buried secretly by UB officers at the cemetery in Dƒôbica and their graves were marked by members of the WiN. Other members of the group were captured and executed shortly later, including Jan Gom√≥≈Çka on July 11, 1946 and Zygmunt ZƒÖbk on August 1, 1946. Stefko was shot in Autumn of 1946, although there were later investigations into whether or not he was actually killed. Photograph Most probably, the whole incident would have been forgotten, had it not been for a photograph, taken by J√≥zef Stec. The snapshot was taken from a window of a building, delivered to London and published in several newspapers in the West. Stec was quickly captured and imprisoned, and spent many years behind bars.

The NWHA was formerly known as the National Women's History Project. Based out of Santa Rosa, California since 1980, it was started by women's history activists Molly Murphy MacGregor, Mary Ruthsdotter, Maria Cuevas, Paula Hammett and Bette Morgan. The National Women's History Alliance started by leading a coalition that successfully lobbied Congress to designate March as Women's History Month, now celebrated across the country. Today, the National Women's History Alliance is known nationally as the only clearinghouse providing information and training in multicultural women‚Äôs history for educators, community organizations, and parents-for anyone wanting to expand their understanding of the historic contributions of women. History=Over 30 years of \\"Writing Women Back into History\\" From a Grassroots Organization into a National Institution ‚Ä¢ In 1980, the NWHA was a group of women who noticed that women were absent from textbooks. No more than 3% of the content was devoted to women. ‚Ä¢ Girls had few role models. Girls and boys and many adults assumed women did nothing important. The founders thought this perception needed to be addressed. ‚Ä¢ The NWHA convinced Congress and the White House of the need for our nation to celebrate and recognize women‚Äôs role in history on an annual basis. As a result of their efforts, the week of March 8 (International Women‚Äôs Day) was officially designated as Women‚Äôs History Week. In 1987, the NWHA led the successful campaign to have the entire month of March declared Women's History Month. ‚Ä¢ The NWHA mobilizes the national celebrations of Women's History Month in March each year by choosing an annual theme. ‚Ä¢ They promote a multicultural women‚Äôs history perspective by honoring women of diverse cultural, ethnic, occupational, racial, class, and regional backgrounds. ‚Ä¢ Every year the NWHA sends out 100,000 catalogs and distribute tens of thousands of women's history posters, celebratory materials, books, videos, and curriculum resources. ‚Ä¢ The NWHA website has over 1,000,000 visitors a year. Additionally, the staff answers over 2,500 e-mails and letters each year from students, teachers, reporters, and other interested individuals requesting information. ‚Ä¢ The staff has conducted women's history training sessions and women's historic site tours in 42 states, and has trained over 30,000 teachers and federal program managers and has delivered over 2,500 speeches. ‚Ä¢ The NWHA created a national clearinghouse to provide multicultural women's history information, materials, referrals, and strategies. This service also provides easy access to women's history performers, organizations, museums, and historic sites. ‚Ä¢ They have designed, developed, and produced more than 200 multicultural women‚Äôs history resource materials, such as videos, speeches, posters, celebratory items, guides, program kits, and curriculum units. ‚Ä¢ In 1995 and 1998, the NWHA led national campaigns to celebrate and recognize the work of women in expanding and enriching democracy. In 1995, they celebrated the 75th anniversary of women in the United States winning the right to vote and in 1998 the 150th anniversary of the Women's Rights Movement. In 2005, they celebrated the 85th anniversary of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment and the 25th anniversary of the women's history movement. In 2010 they marked the 90th anniversary of U.S. women gaining the right to vote. ‚Ä¢ In 1997 the NWHA launched a website to serve as the digital clearinghouse for multicultural women's history information. Today, this award-winning website is the first women's history choice on all website search engines. ‚Ä¢ The NWHA has worked with the President‚Äôs Commission on the Celebration of Women in American History. Executive director Molly Murphy MacGregor was appointed by the White House to serve on the Congressional Commission on Women's Historic Landmarks. ‚Ä¢ The NWHA believes that \\"'Our History Is Our Strength\\"' Accomplishments The National Women‚Äôs History Alliance has been recognized for its groundbreaking work in education and its many nationally recognized programs and services by organizations throughout the country, including: ‚Ä¢ The National Association for Multicultural Education Award. ‚Ä¢ The Jessie Bernard Wise Women Award from the Center for Women Policy Studies. ‚Ä¢ The National Education Association‚Äôs prestigious Mary Hatwood Furtrell Award. ‚Ä¢ The Myra Sadker Equity Award for their work in achievement in gender equity. Mission The National Women‚Äôs History Alliance is an educational nonprofit organization whose mission is to recognize and celebrate the diverse and historic accomplishments of women by providing information and educational materials and programs. They explain their mission this way: The impact of women‚Äôs history might seem abstract to some, and less pressing than the immediate struggles of working women today. But to ignore the vital role that women‚Äôs dreams and accomplishments play in our own lives would be a great mistake. We draw strength and inspiration from those who came before us ‚Äì and those remarkable women working among us today. They are part of our story, and a truly balanced and inclusive history recognizes how important women have always been in American society. Purpose The NWHA promotes women's history because, By walking history‚Äôs pathways, we learn to step forward with confidence. The legacy of how others shaped society sparks our own longings to contribute. Everyone needs role models ‚Äî footsteps enough like our own to inspire us. History must tell the whole story. For girls, knowing women‚Äôs achievements expands their sense of what is possible. For all of us, knowledge of women‚Äôs strengths and contributions builds respect and nourishes self esteem ‚Äî crucial to all children and adults now, and in the years to come. The enduring goal of the NWHA is to ‚Äúmake history‚Äù accurate by continuing to recognize and celebrate women‚Äôs authentic contributions through current and future projects.

Article 11 of the First Title of the Spanish Constitution refers to Spanish nationality and establishes that a separate law is to regulate how it is acquired and lost. This separate law is the Spanish Civil Code. In general terms, Spanish nationality is based on the principle of jus sanguinis, although limited provisions exist for the acquisition of Spanish nationality based on the principle of jus soli. History Spanish nationality law has changed significantly since the 1889 Civil Code provisions on citizenship and nationality, especially during its liberalization during the Second Spanish Republic of 1931 to 1939, the repudiation of the Republican Constitution in 1938, the Francoist constriction of 1954, and the reforms of 1978, 1983, 1990s, and 2000s. All the constitutions in Spain before 1978 have had an article that defines Spanish nationality, even the constitutions that never came into effect. The current constitution of 1978 is the first that does not define Spanish nationality; rather, article 11 establishes that a separate law is to define and regulate it entirely, namely the Spanish Civil Code. It is also the first constitution that emphasises that those \\"Spaniards by origin\\", roughly equivalent to a \\"natural born Spaniard\\", cannot be deprived of their nationality. On 13 July 1982, and in accordance to what had been established in the constitution, the first law regarding nationality was approved, which was in fact an amendment to the Spanish Civil Code in effect. This law has been reformed on 17 December 1990, 23 December 1993, 2 November 1995, and most recently 2 October 2002. The approval of article 11 of the constitution was somewhat controversial, mostly due to the possible confusion it would cause with the term \\"nationalities\\", in reference to those communities or regions in Spain with a special historical and cultural identity,Nacionalidad. Real Academia Espa√±ola. a term that had been used in the second article of the constitution.The second article reads: The Constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards; it recognises and guarantees the right to self-government of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed and the solidarity among them all. It was suggested that article 11 should substitute the term \\"nationality\\" for \\"citizenship\\", but it was considered, as it is common in other legislations in Europe and Latin America, that the terms were not synonymous. Another point of constitutional conflict was that the creation of European Union citizenship gave all nationals of EU member the same basic rights in all member States, including the right of active and passive suffrage in municipal elections. The constitution was reformed to allow this. Acquisition of Spanish citizenship Title One of Book One of the Spanish Civil Code lays out the details of Spanish nationality. Jus sanguinis biometric passport Spanish legislation regarding nationality establishes two types of nationality: \\"Spanish nationality by origin\\" (nacionalidad espa√±ola de origen, in Spanish)‚Äîthat is, a \\"natural-born Spaniard\\"‚Äîand the \\"Spanish nationality not by origin\\" (nacionalidad espa√±ola no de origen, in Spanish). According to article 17 of the Spanish Civil Code, Spaniards by origin are: * those individuals born of a Spanish parent; * those individuals born in Spain of foreign parents if at least one of the parents was also born in Spain, with the exception of children of foreign diplomatic or consular officers accredited in Spain; * those individuals born in Spain of foreign parents if neither of them has a nationality, or if the legislation of either parent's home country does not grant the child any nationality; * those individuals born in Spain of undetermined filiation; those individuals whose first known territory of residence is Spain, are considered born in Spain. Foreign minors under the age of 18 acquire Spanish nationality by origin upon being adopted by a Spanish national. If the adoptee is 18 years or older, he or she can apply for Spanish nationality by origin within two years after the adoption took place. At points since the 1889 Civil Code, various regulations have been in effect requiring registration of births of Spaniards abroad and limiting citizenship by descent to a number of generations that has been in flux. These rules have changed over time, which requires historical analysis to determine which rights may apply. Under Article 24.1, persons born outside Spain, other than in specified Iberophone countries, to a Spanish citizen born in Spain will lose Spanish nationality if they exclusively use a foreign nationality acquired before adulthood. That loss can be avoided by registering the desire to preserve Spanish nationality in the civil registry at a Spanish consulate. Until an 9 January 2003 change in the law came into effect, Spanish citizans born in an Ibero-American country or specific former Spanish territories to a Spanish citizen parent, also born outside of Spain, and who held that other country's citizenship, preserved Spanish citizens with no retention declaration required. After that date, second generation born abroad Spaniards from the Iberosphere who were not already 18 or in legal majority (adulthood) by that date, and who held the other country's citizenship, are required to declare their intention to retain Spanish nationality to Spanish authorities within three years of majority, a period typically ending at age 21. The range of Ibero-American countries in which Spanish jus sanguinis will apply to a person of Spanish descent has also changed over time as Spain has signed agreements and treaties with countries. All other individuals that acquire Spanish nationality, other than by which is specified above, are \\"Spaniards not by origin\\". By option Article 20 of the Spanish Civil Code, established that the following individuals have the right to apply (lit. \\"to opt\\") for Spanish nationality: * those individuals that were under the tutelage of a Spanish citizen, * those individuals whose father or mother had been originally Spanish and born in Spain (i.e. those individuals who were born after their parent(s) had lost Spanish nationality, or those born with another nationality before 1982 to a Spanish mother). * those individuals mentioned in the second bullet-point in article 17, and adopted foreigners of 18 years of age or more. Spanish nationality by option must be claimed within two years after their 18th birthday or after their \\"emancipation\\", regardless of age, except for those individuals whose father or mother had been originally Spanish and born in Spain, for which there is no age limit. Spanish nationality by option does not confer \\"nationality by origin\\" unless otherwise specified (i.e. those mentioned in article 17, and those who obtained it through the Law of Historical Memory). Naturalization Spanish nationality can be acquired by naturalisation, which is only granted at the discretion of the government through a Royal Decree, and under exceptional circumstances, for example to notable individuals. Also, any individual can request Spanish nationality after a period of continuous legal residence in Spain, as long as he or she is 18 years or older, or through a legal representative if he or she is younger. Under Article 22, to apply for nationality through residence it is necessary for the individual to have legally resided in Spain for: * ten years, or * five years if the individual is a refugee, or * two years if the individual is a citizen of a country of Ibero-America (including individuals with Puerto Rican citizenship), Portugal, Andorra, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, or if the individual can prove they are a Sephardi Jew with a connection to Spain; or * one year for individuals: ** born in Spanish territory, or ** who did not exercise their right to nationality by option within the established period of time, or ** who have been under the legal tutelage or protection of a Spanish citizen or institution for two consecutive years, ** who have been married for one year to a Spanish national and are not separated legally or de facto, or ** are widow(er)s of a Spanish national if at the time of death they were not legally or de facto separated, or ** who were born outside of Spain, if one of their parents or grandparents was originally Spanish (i.e. Spanish by origin). =Sephardi Jews= In 2015 the Government of Spain passed Law 12/2015 of 24 June, whereby Sephardi Jews with a connection to Spain could obtain Spanish nationality by naturalisation, without the residency requirement as explained above. The law required applicants to apply within three years from 1 October 2015, provide evidence of their Sephardi origin and some connection with Spain, and pass examinations on the Spanish language and Spanish culture.Rhodes Jewish Museum: Frequently asked questions for Spanish citizenship for Sephardi Jews. Date (embedded in the PDF): 3 September 2015 The law provided for a possible one-year extension of the deadline to 1 October 2019; it was indeed extended in March 2018. This path to citizenship is in restitution for the 1492 expulsion of the Jews from Spain. The Law establishes the right to Spanish nationality of Sephardi Jews with a connection to Spain.Ley 12/2015, de 24 de junio, en materia de concesi√≥n de la nacionalidad espa√±ola a los sefard√≠es originarios de Espa√±a (Law 12/2015, of 24 June, regarding acquisition of Spanish nationality by Sephardis with Spanish origins) An Instruction of 29 September 2015 removes a provision whereby those acquiring Spanish nationality by law 12/2015 must renounce any other nationality held.Instrucci√≥n de 29 de septiembre de 2015, de la Direcci√≥n General de los Registros y del Notariado, sobre (‚Ä¶) concesi√≥n de la nacionalidad espa√±ola a los sefard√≠es originarios de Espa√±a (Instruction of 29 September 2015, from the Directorate General of Registration and Notaries, on the application of law 12/2015, regarding acquisition of Spanish nationality by Sephardis with Spanish origins Most applicants must pass tests of knowledge of the Spanish language and Spanish culture, but those who are under 18, or handicapped, are exempted. A Resolution in May 2017 also exempted those aged over 70.Resoluci√≥n del Director General de los Registros y del Notariado (‚Ä¶) sobre dispensa pruebas a mayores de 70 a√±os (Resolution of the Directorate General of Registration and Notaries, of the questions raised by the Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain and the Council General of Notaries on exempting over-70s from tests) By July 2017 the government of Spain had registered about 4,300 applications who had begun the proceedings. 1,000 had signed before a notary and filed officially. A hundred, from various countries, had been granted citizenship, with another 400 expected within weeks. The Spanish government was taking 8‚Äì10 months to decide on each case. By March 2018 over 6,200 people had been granted Spanish citizenship under this law. Applicants must pass a cultural and historical knowledge exam called the CCSE (Conocimientos Constitucionales y Socioculturales de Espa√±a) and a language test called the DELE (Diploma de Espa√±ol como Lengua Extranjera -Certificate of Spanish as a Foreign Language-). Loss and recovery of Spanish nationality Spanish nationality can be lost under the following circumstances: * Those individuals of 18 years of age or more whose residence is not Spain and who acquire voluntarily another nationality, or who use exclusively another nationality which was conferred to them prior to their age of emancipation lose Spanish nationality. In this case, loss of nationality occurs three years after the acquisition of the foreign nationality or emancipation only if the individual does not declare their will to retain Spanish nationality. The exception to this are those Spaniards by origin who acquire the nationality of an Iberoamerican country, Andorra, Philippines, Equatorial Guinea or Portugal; * Those Spanish nationals that expressly renounce Spanish nationality if they also possess another nationality and reside outside Spain will lose Spanish nationality; * Those minors born outside Spain that have acquired Spanish citizenship being children of Spanish nationals that were also born outside Spain, and if the laws of the country in which they live grant them another nationality, will lose Spanish nationality if they do not declare their will to retain it within three years after their 18th birthday or the date of their emancipation. The Civil Code regulations on loss of citizenship, and the reasons for it‚Äîincluding lack of registration with Spanish consular authorities overseas‚Äîand the practical application of those regulations, has varied over time. Spanish nationality is not lost as described above if Spain is at war. In addition, Spaniards \\"not by origin\\", will lose their nationality if: * they use exclusively for a period of three years their previous nationality‚Äîwith the exception of the nationality of those countries with which Spain has signed an agreement of dual nationality; * they participate voluntarily in the army of a foreign country, or serve in public office in a foreign government, against the specific prohibition of the Spanish Government; * they had lied or committed fraud when they applied for Spanish nationality. People who lose Spanish nationality can recover it if they become legal residents in Spain. Emigrants and their children are not required to return to Spain to recover their Spanish nationality. (Since the nationality law automatically grants Spanish nationality to people born of a Spanish parent, a person born outside Spain to a parent of Spanish birth and nationality who uses the citizenship of the other country exclusively since birth is said to \\"recover\\" their Spanish nationality should they apply for it). Spanish nationality by the Law of Historical Memory In 2007, the Congress of Deputies, under the government of prime minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, approved the Law of Historical Memory with the aim of recognising the rights of those who suffered persecution or violence during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), and the dictatorial regime that followed (1939-1975). In recognition of the \\"injustice produced by the exile\\" of thousands of Spaniards, the law allowed their descendants to obtain Spanish nationality by origin, specifically for: * those individuals born of a parent that was Spanish by origin, regardless of the place of birth of the parent, whatever the age of the applicant. (The Spanish Civil code currently grants Spanish nationality \\"by origin\\" only to those individuals born of a Spanish national who was born in Spain, and Spanish nationality \\"not by origin\\" to those individuals born of a Spanish national who was not born in Spain only if they apply for it prior to the second year after their 18th birthday or emancipation); and * those individuals whose grandfather or grandmother had been exiled because of the Spanish Civil War, and had lost his or her Spanish nationality. In this case the applicant must have proven that the grandparent had left Spain as a refugee or that the grandparent left Spain between 18 July 1936 and 31 December 1955. The law also granted Spanish nationality by origin to those foreign individual members of the International Brigades who had defended the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War. (In 1996, they were granted Spanish nationality \\"not by origin\\", which implied that they had to renounce their previous nationality‚ÄîSpanish nationals \\"by origin\\" cannot be deprived of their nationality, and therefore, these individuals can also retain their original nationality). By virtue of this law, if an individual, whose father or mother had been originally Spanish and born in Spain, and who had previously acquired Spanish nationality \\"not by origin\\" by option (art. 20) could request his or her nationality be changed to nationality \\"by origin\\", if he or she chose to do so. The period wherein the Spanish nationality could be acquired by the Law of Historical memory started on 27 December 2008, and was concluded on 26 December 2011. Even though the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet released the final count, and it is still reviewing applications, 446,277 individuals had applied for Spanish nationality through this law by 30 November 2011. Around 95% were Latin American, half of them from Cuba and Argentina. To the surprise of government officials, 92.5% of all applications were made by sons or daughters of Spaniards by origin regardless of their place of birth, and only 6.1% by grandchildren of refugees. More than five centuries after Jews were banished from the kingdom of Spain during the Spanish Inquisition, Spanish lawmakers approved, on 10 June 2015, a law allowing descendants of Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in 1492 to seek Spanish nationality without giving up their current citizenship. Many applications under the law came from Cuba, which also offered those Cubans an ability to leave the island, and to also live and work in EU countries other than Spain. The measure, championed by the centre-right government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, grants dual citizenship rights for Sephardic Jews, those descended from Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. Dual citizenship Dual citizenship is permitted for all Spaniards by origin, as long as they declare their will to retain Spanish nationality within three years of the acquisition of another nationality. This requirement is waived for the acquisition of the nationality of an Iberoamerican country, Andorra, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea or Portugal, and any other country that Spain may sign a bilateral agreement with. Foreign nationals who acquire Spanish nationality must renounce their previous nationality, unless they are natural-born citizens of an Iberoamerican country, Andorra, the Philippines or Equatorial Guinea. Since October 2002, dual citizens of Spain and another country who are born outside Spain to a Spanish citizen parent born outside Spain must declare to conserve their Spanish nationality between ages 18 and 21. Citizenship of the European Union Because Spain forms part of the European Union, Spanish citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Spanish embassy, Spanish citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK), Belize (UK), Central African Republic (France), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK), Guyana (UK), Liberia (Germany), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor-Leste (Portugal), Vanuatu (France) Spanish citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty. Travel freedom of Spanish citizens Visa requirements for Spanish citizens According to the 2020 Visa Restrictions Index, holders of a Spanish passport can visit 188 countries visa-free or with visa on arrival. In the index, Spain is in the 4th rank in terms of travel freedom. The Spanish nationality is ranked eleventh in Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well. ReferencesExternal links *Government of Spain.

Starring an ensemble cast, including Phil Davis, Rupert Penry-Jones, Helen McCrory and Kevin McKidd, the programme is set around the practice of a barristers' chambers in Leeds. The series was filmed in and around the real life Park Square, Leeds. This is the area in the city where the majority of barristers' chambers are concentrated. Despite gaining considerable critical acclaim, the show failed to garner a substantial audience resulting in only the one series of ten episodes being produced. In Australia, the series was broadcast in 2001 on ABC and repeated in 2004 after popular and critical acclaim. The full series was released on DVD for the first time by Acorn Media UK on 5 March 2012. Synopsis North Square is a British drama about a group of young, irreverent barristers all hoping to make their mark in the legal profession at a defence chambers in Leeds, West Yorkshire. They are all under the leadership of their Machiavellian chief clerk Peter McLeish (Phil Davis), who is clever and obsessed by work and doesn't appear to have a social life. He's struggling to make this new enterprise work and will do anything to make it succeed and beat his archrival, Michael Marlowe (Tony Monroe), from whom he left, taking the best barristers with him. He establishes relationships with the top criminals in Leeds so he can get their best cases. He is not above persuading a client to offer a plea, not because it's in their best interests but because he doesn't want to miss out on a bigger case coming up. Early in the series, Rose (Helen McCrory) and Billy (Kevin McKidd) give birth to a baby boy and Rose comes back to work four days later. Billy is on an assault charge for defending Wendy De Souza (Kim Vithana), their head of chambers, whom another barrister, Leo Wilson (who works for Marlowe's chambers), claimed only got to her position because of her skin colour and is suspended but then cleared. However, Marlowe continues to ask Billy to come back to his chambers which he refuses to do and he instructs the case to go to trial. Morag Black (Ruth Millar) is a new pupil at chambers, taken under the wing of Rose, and is used as a scapegoat to represent cases for Peter while he gives more high- profile cases to other barristers. Johnny Boy (James Murray) begins a relationship with Morag, however, Peter is against the relationship and instructs them both to end it. Later on, Hussein Ali (Robert Mountford), another pupil, also joins chambers under the guidance of Tom Mitford (Dominic Rowan), yet there is only one new place in chambers available. Peter supports Hussein as he believes he will bring in business because he's a British Asian. At the end of the series the decision of who should stay in chambers goes to Hussein, however Peter tells Morag that she can \\"squat\\" in their chambers. Alex Hay (Rupert Penry-Jones), the golden boy of Peter McLeish, is a smooth, good-looking barrister with a city centre apartment and a relationship with Dr. Helen Ferryhough (Victoria Smurfit). But Peter is working with solicitor Stevie Goode (Sasha Behar), who can bring business to chambers away from Marlowe, and believes Helen is not strong enough for Alex so pushes Stevie and Alex together for the good of chambers. They embark on an affair, unaware that Peter is pulling the strings; using their relationship to secure big clients from Stevie. After a tip-off from Peter to Helen, she and Alex split up and Helen embarks on a relationship with Tom Mitford. At the end of the series, Alex begs Helen to come back to him and it is unknown whether Helen leaves Tom for Alex. John is the nephew of Peter McLeish and starts work as a trainee at chambers but due to the confusion of his name with his colleague, Johnny Boy, Peter tells him that he is now known as Bob to the rest of chambers. No one except Johnny Boy knows of their kinship, Peter admitting he has been installed \\"as his eyes and ears\\" of chambers. Throughout the series there is an underlying story of Wendy De Souza, who happens to be having an affair with Judge Martin Bould, applying to be QC. She does not succeed in getting the position. Marlowe finds out about the affair and asks Billy to confirm it, stating that if he does the trial will be dropped. Billy confirms this to Marlowe which results in the trial being dropped but Peter is suspicious as to why. He eventually learns from Billy about his admission and advises Judge Martin to end his affair with Wendy De Souza. Billy tells Rose about what he has done and she is in despair about how Peter is controlling everybody's personal lives, how Wendy was betrayed and why Billy would go to Peter and not her. Plus, she is against Peter's dealings with criminals to secure work. At the same time, Alex learns from Helen that it was Peter who told her about his affair with Stevie. At this point, Rose lobbies the team to have Peter removed but in the end she gets no support and decides to leave chambers. However, Peter asks her to do one more case; represent his son, whom he has had no dealings with for 18 years, on a drugs charge. She manages to secure a \\"Not Guilty\\" verdict.

Born in Kyoto, Japan in 1948, Shimada moved at the age of 16 with his parents to the U.S. in 1964. He majored in anthropology at Cornell (B.A. 1971) where he became interested in the ancient Andean civilization and experimental archaeology under tutelage of Prof. John V. Murra and Robert Ascher, respectively. Two seasons (1973, 1975) of archaeological fieldwork at the Moche city of Pampa Grande (c. AD 600-750) on the northern coast of Peru led to his doctorate in anthropology from the University of Arizona in 1976. Career Since then, Shimada taught at University of Oregon (1977-8), Princeton (1978‚Äì1983) and Harvard (1984‚Äì1991) before joining the SIUC in 1994. From 1978 to the present, he has directed the Sic√°n Archaeological Project, focusing on the developmental processes, technology, religion, and other aspects of the pre-Hispanic Sic√°n culture (c. AD 800-1400) on the northern coast of Peru. The project results formed the collection foundations of the Sic√°n National Museum in Ferre√±afe, Peru, which opened in 2004. In 2003 Shimada began interdisciplinary investigation into the social foundations and the paleo-environmental context of the famed prehistoric religious center of Pachacamac, outside the city of Lima. The executive government (2003) and the congress (2006) of Peru bestowed him medals of honor for his contribution to Peruvian cultural and historical knowledge and understanding. He has written 150 journal articles and book chapters, collaborating on many of them with other prominent scholars in the field, including, but not limited to, Kenichi Shinoda and Robert Corruccini. Dr. Shimada has written or edited 11 books, including the following works: *Pampa Grande and the Mochica Culture (1994); *Cultura Sic√°n (1995); *Andean Ceramics: Technology, Organization and Approaches (1998); and *Craft Production in Complex Societies (2007).

Additionally, bornaprine has been used to treat other disorders, including hyperhidrosis. History Bornaprine was first synthesized in 1960 by the German scientist H Haas, under the name Kr 399. Additional tests revealed that bornaprine was significantly more effective than nicotine at antagonizing choline. Because of its anticholinergic effects, it was intended to help with the symptoms of Parkinson's. Early clinical trials with Parkinsonian patients (completed in Germany), showed that bornaprine was successful at treating many of the key side-effects of Parkinson's including akinesia, language, tremors, and psychological symptoms. Pharmacodynamics Bornaprine Pathway Bornaprine is an antimuscarinic agent that nonselectively antagonizes muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, M1 and M2. Bornaprine has been characterized as a very potent anticholinergic medication and further clinical trials have indicated its effectiveness at treating parkinsonian tremors. Bornaprine also has a pa2 value (affinity of antagonist for receptor) of 7.27 ¬± 0.21 indicating a high potency. Pharmacokinetics=Absorption Bornaprine is successfully absorbed into the plasma of humans within 1‚Äì2 hours after an oral dose. Additional oral doses of bornaprine resulted in some accumulation in the plasma. Excretion Single oral doses of bornaprine were successfully excreted in urine and feces in rats, dogs, and humans. The following mean excretion rates were also reported during five days for urine and feces: rat 31 and 70%, dog 53 and 39%, and humans 78 and 4%. Excretion was notably prolonged and incomplete at five days in humans, indicating a longer half life and metabolism rate of bornaprine for humans. In human subjects, bornaprine has a half life of approximately 30 hours compared to 5 and 12 hour half lives in rats and dogs, respectively. Metabolites Bornaprine is an epimeric mixture of exo and endo esters, and its major metabolites have been identified and include: three isomers of monohydroxy-N-desthel-Sormodren, three isomers of monohydroxy-Sormodren and 5-hydroxyl. Each of these metabolites were hydroxylated at either C-5 or C-6 in the bicyclic ring. The activity of each of compounds has been studied extensively and 5-hydroxyl showed similar anticholinergic activity to the parent compound when tested in isolated rat atrium unlike other identified metabolites. Availability Bornaprine is currently available under the brand name Sormodrem in the following countries: Austria (Abbott Pharmaceuticals), Germany (Abbott), Italy (Teofarma Pharmaceuticals), and Turkey (Abbott). Bornaprine is normally administered in a tablet form, however a recent patent is investigating the effect of several anticholinergic drugs, including bornaprine, in transdermal patches. These patches are not currently available to the public market. Bornaprine is not currently on the market in the United States and its clinical trial status is unknown. Treatment=Parkinson's Disease Like many other anticholinergic drugs, bornaprine had been used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Bornaprine most effectively treats the tremors associated with Parkinson's and also helps bradykinesia, hypokinesia, and posture and facial expression. Hyperhidrosis Hyperhidrosis occurs in acute phase of spinal cord injured patients and an effective oral treatment for hyperhidrosis has yet to be perfected. A recent study done with patients with medullary lesions found bornaprine to be very effective in decreasing the amount of sweating in patients with minimal side-effects. Bornaprine is now commonly prescribed for treating hyperhidrosis in Europe. Sleep When administered to healthy humans, bornaprine suppressed the amount of REM sleep, suggesting that the M1 and M2 receptors are involved in sleep increase and REM latency. This also suggests that bornaprine may be able to be used as a sleep aid in the future. Side Effects Since bornaprine is a potent anticholinergic drug, it has a similar side effect profile to other anticholinergic drugs, including dry mouth and constipation. Additionally, when bornaprine was administered to patients with secondary parkinsonism, few patients reported transient confusion. Toxicity LD50 tests performed on rodents revealed that 26 mg/kg intravenously and 112 mg/kg subcutaneously administered amounts of bornaprine were toxic. Subcutaneous application resulted in ataxia, spastic paralysis, and convulsions.

Overview By definition, as a vernacular dialect of English, AAVE has never received the social prestige of a standard dialect, leading to widespread and long-standing misconceptions that it is a grammatically inferior form of English, which linguistics research of the twentieth century has soundly refuted. However, educators and social commentators traditionally have advocated for eliminating AAVE usage through the public-education system for a variety of reasons, ranging from a continued belief that AAVE is intrinsically deficient to arguments that its use, by being stigmatized in certain social contexts, is socially limiting. Some of the harshest criticism of AAVE or its use has come from African Americans themselves.\\"Black critics [of Black English] use all the different arguments of the white critics, and spare us the more or less open embarrassment that all white Americans feel when publicly criticizing anything or anyone Black. So, of course, they can be even more wrong-headed and self-righteously wrong-headed than anyone else . . .\\" . A conspicuous example was the \\"Pound Cake speech\\", in which Bill Cosby criticized some African Americans for various social behaviors, including the way they talked. Faced with such attitudes, the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC), a division of National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), issued a position statement on students' rights to their own language. This was adopted by CCCC members in April 1974 and appeared in a special issue of College Composition and Communication in Fall of 1974. The resolution was as follows: > We affirm the students' right to their own patterns and varieties of > language‚Äîthe dialects of their nurture or whatever dialects in which they > find their own identity and style. Language scholars long ago denied that > the myth of a standard American dialect has any validity. The claim that any > one dialect is unacceptable amounts to an attempt of one social group to > exert its dominance over another. Such a claim leads to false advice for > speakers and writers and immoral advice for humans. A nation proud of its > diverse heritage and its cultural and racial variety will preserve its > heritage of dialects. We affirm strongly that teachers must have the > experiences and training that will enable them to respect diversity and > uphold the right of students to their own language. Around this time, pedagogical techniques similar to those used to teach English to speakers of foreign languages were shown to hold promise for speakers of AAVE. William Stewart experimented with the use of dialect readers‚Äîsets of text in both AAVE and standard English. The idea was that children could learn to read in their own dialect and then shift to \\"Standard English\\" with subsequent textbooks. developed a comprehensive set of dialect readers, called bridge readers, which included the same content in three different dialects: AAVE, a \\"bridge\\" version that was closer to \\"Standard American English\\" without being prohibitively formal, and a Standard English version. Despite studies that showed promise for such \\"Standard English as a Second Dialect\\" (SESD) programs, reaction to them was largely hostile and both Stewart's research and the Bridge Program were rejected for various political and social reasons, including strong resistance from parents. A more formal shift in the recognition of AAVE came in the \\"Ann Arbor Decision\\" of 1979 (Martin Luther King Junior Elementary School Children et al., v. Ann Arbor School District). In it, a federal judge of the Eastern District of Michigan ruled that in teaching black children to read, a school board must adjust to the children's dialect, not the children to the school, and that, by not taking students' language into consideration, teachers were contributing to the failure of such students to read and use mainstream English proficiently. National attitudes towards AAVE were revisited when a controversial resolution from the Oakland (California) school board (Oakland Unified School District) on December 18, 1996, called for \\"Ebonics\\" to be recognized as a language of African Americans. In fact, ebonics would be classified as a \\"second language\\". The proposal was to implement a program similar to the Language Development Program for African American Students (LDPAAS) in Los Angeles, which began in 1988 and uses methods from the SESD programs mentioned above. Like other similar programs, the Oakland resolution was widely misunderstood as intended to teach AAVE and \\"elevate it to the status of a written language.\\" It gained national attention and was derided and criticized, most notably by Jesse Jackson and Kweisi Mfume who regarded it as an attempt to teach slang to children. The statement that \\"African Language Systems are genetically based\\" also contributed to the negative reaction because \\"genetically\\" was popularly misunderstood to imply that African Americans had a biological predisposition to a particular language. In an amended resolution, this phrase was removed and replaced with wording that states African American language systems \\"have origins in West and Niger‚ÄìCongo languages and are not merely dialects of English. . . .\\" The Oakland proposal was explained as follows: that black students would perform better in school and more easily learn standard American English if textbooks and teachers incorporated AAVE in teaching black children to speak Standard English rather than mistakenlyNonstandard language is not the same as substandard, as explained for example by the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker in The Language Instinct pp. 28 et seq. (Pinker's comments on dialects in general and AAVE in particular go unmentioned by Geoffrey Sampson in Educating Eve, a book-length attempted debunking of The Language Instinct.) The same point is made in various introductions to language and sociolinguistics, e.g. and et seq.; and also in surveys of the English language, e.g. , sec. 20, \\"Linguistic Variation\\". equating nonstandard with substandard and dismissing AAVE as the latter. point to these linguistic barriers, and common reactions by teachers, as a primary cause of reading difficulties and poor school performance.Cited in More recently, research has been conducted on the overrepresentation of African Americans in special education., citing and argue that this is because AAVE speech characteristics are often erroneously considered to be signs of speech development problems, prompting teachers to refer children to speech pathologists.Cited in According to Smitherman, the controversy and debates concerning AAVE in public schools imply deeper deterministic attitudes towards the African-American community as a whole. Smitherman describes this as a reflection of the \\"power elite's perceived insignificance and hence rejection of Afro-American language and culture\\". She also asserts that African Americans are forced to conform to European American society in order to succeed, and that conformity ultimately means the \\"eradication of black language . . . and the adoption of the linguistic norms of the white middle class.\\" The necessity for \\"bi-dialectialism\\" (AAVE and General American) means \\"some blacks contend that being bi-dialectal not only causes a schism in the black personality, but it also implies such dialects are 'good enough' for blacks but not for whites.\\"  Ann Arbor decision The case of Martin Luther King Junior Elementary School Children et al. v. Ann Arbor School District, known as the Ann Arbor Decision, is considered to have established an important precedent in the education of poor African American students who are Black English speakers. The case was decided on July 12, 1979, by Judge Charles W. Joiner on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The suit was brought on behalf of poor black students at the school. Gabe Kaimowitz, lead counsel for the Plaintiffs, alleged that the students were denied equal protection of the laws, because applicable Michigan regulations did not recognize social, economic and cultural factors differing those pupils from others. Black middle class students at the school were not represented among the plaintiffs. Judge Joiner in 1977 and 1978 rejected five of the six claims. The sixth claim asserted that the Ann Arbor School District violated federal statutory law because it failed to take into account the home language of the children in the provision of education instruction. The court agreed. The judge ordered the school district to find a way to identify Black English speakers in the schools and to \\"use that knowledge in teaching such students how to read standard English\\".Flood, J., Jensen, J., Lapp, D., Squire, J. (1991). Handbook of research on teaching the English language arts. New York, NY: Macmillan Publishing Company.  Cases that led to the Ann Arbor Decision  In 1954, most of the United States had racially segregated schools, which was made legal by the Plessy v. Ferguson case in 1896. In the case it held that segregated public schools were constitutional as long as the black and white children in the schools were equal. Throughout the middle of the twentieth century many civil rights groups and leaders challenged the school board's racial segregation through legal and political action. One of the actions, Brown v. Board of Education was filed, and is an important and significant case, which ultimately led up to the Ann Arbor Decision. The Brown v. Board of Education case was filed against Topeka and it went over how it violated the 14th amendment. The case paved the way for integration in many public schools across the United States, but black students still faced many problems as stated in the Ann Arbor Decision. Oakland Ebonics resolution On December 18, 1996, the Oakland Unified School District in California passed a controversial resolution recognizing the legitimacy of Ebonicswhat mainstream linguists more commonly term African American English (AAE)as an African language. The resolution set off a firestorm of media criticism and ignited a national debate. For students whose primary language was Ebonics, the Oakland resolution mandated some instruction in this, both for \\"maintaining the legitimacy and richness of such language ... and to facilitate their acquisition and mastery of English language skills.\\" This also included the proposed increase of salaries of those proficient in both Ebonics and Standard English to the level of those teaching limited English proficiency (LEP) students and the use of public funding to help teachers learn AAE themselves. Popular response Some interpretations of the controversial issues in the resolution include the idea that Ebonics is not a vernacular or dialect of English, that it is a separate language; a member of an African language family; that African Americans particular language and their dialects; that speakers of Ebonics should qualify for federally funded programs traditionally restricted to bilingual populations; and that students would be taught American Standard English via Ebonics. The Rev. Jesse Jackson condemned the resolution, saying \\"I understand the attempt to reach out to these children, but this is an unacceptable surrender, borderlining on disgrace.\\" His comments were seconded by former Secretary of Education William Bennett, former New York governor Mario Cuomo, and Senator Joe Lieberman. Jackson would later reverse his position, attributing his initial opposition to a misunderstanding of the school district's proposal. He said, \\"They're not trying to teach Black English as a standard language. They're looking for tools to teach children standard English so they might be competitive.\\" Amended resolution The original resolution caused a great deal of consternation and anger, which fueled the controversy. On January 15, 1997, Oakland's school board passed an amended resolution. The original resolution used the phrase \\"genetically based\\" which was commonly understood to mean that African Americans have a biological predisposition to a particular language, while the authors of the resolution insisted that it was referring to linguistic genetics. This phrase was removed in the amended resolution and replaced with the statement that African American language systems \\"have origins in West and Niger-Congo languages and are not merely dialects of English.\\" Linguists' response Some linguists and associated organizations issued statements in support of recognizing the legitimacy of African American English as a language system: Walt Wolfram, a linguist at North Carolina State University, wrote that this controversy exposed the intensity of people's beliefs and opinions about language and language diversity, the persistent and widespread level of public misinformation about the issues of language variation and education, and the need for informed knowledge about language diversity and its role in education and in public life. However, in response to the amended resolution claiming that African American language systems \\"are not merely dialects of English\\", there have been some statements in opposition from linguists, since linguists do primarily regard African-American English as a dialect or variety of English.

It runs from County Road 95A, just southeast of U.S. Highway 29 in Molino, to the Alabama state line near Atmore, where it becomes State Route 21. The road runs through the community of Walnut Hill and serves primarily to connect Pensacola to the northwest Escambia County and Atmore areas. In combination with SR 21, the road also provides a connection to Interstate 65. Route description View south from the north end of SR 97, March 2016 SR 97 heads northwest from its southern terminus at County Road 95A, just east of passing under U.S. Highway 29/SR 95, in Molino. The road heads northwest through rural Escambia County and slowly turns into a northerly direction as it approaches Walnut Hill, north of which it is also known as Atmore Highway. Heading directly north from Walnut Hill, the road meets its northern terminus south of Atmore at the Alabama state line, where it becomes State Route 21. SR 97 intersects with several county roads, but does not meet with other state roads or US highways. The Florida Department of Transportation annual average daily traffic (AADT) numbers for 2012 show average numbers between 5,600 vehicles on the southern portion of the road, decreasing to 4,300 vehicles around Walnut Hill, and again increasing to 5,000 north of Walnut Hill, back to 5,600 vehicles at the road's northern terminus. History A 1922 map of Florida auto trails shows an unimproved auto trail running from Quintette, south of Molino, through what appears to be the Walnut Hill area, and then to Atmore. It appears that the portion of today's SR 97 from Walnut Hill (starting around mile 15) to its northern terminus corresponds to this 1922 auto trail. The southern portion also appears on this map, but is indicated as an unimportant road. In 1935, the current routing of SR 97, from Molino northwest to Walnut Hill, then north to Atmore, was extant as a third-class graded road, and was signed as SR 87 at the time. By 1955, SR 4 is being shown as a bituminous road, with its start at the intersection with US 29/SR 95 (now CR 95A) west of Molino, and traveling its current routing to Atmore. The road intersected what were then SR 99 and SR 380 (now both CR 99) around Walnut Hill, and SR 4 (now CR 4) south of the Alabama state line. On maps from 1978, the entire road had been paved in hard surface. The state roads it had intersected in 1955 had all been re-signed as county roads, bringing SR 97 to its current form.

He became a successful businessman, joining the club's board of directors in 1903, and was instrumental in the club constructing and moving to the St Andrew's stadium. Biography Morris was born in Birmingham and attended Small Heath Council School. On leaving school he took up an apprenticeship in the plumbing trade, which he combined with playing for Small Heath Alliance from 1883 at the age of 17 ‚Äì the club was one of the first to turn professional, but that was not until 1885. As a youth he played as a centre forward, but gradually moved into midfield, developing into an influential wing half and captain. Much of his playing career preceded the formation of the Football Alliance, of which Small Heath was a founding member, in 1889‚Äì90, so information is not readily available on how many games he played for the club, but he was a first-team regular by 1885, and played on long enough to make one appearance in the inaugural Football League Second Division in 1892-93. Over his career he saved ¬£85 from his wages as a footballer, enough to take on the lease of a shop near the club's old Arthur Street ground, buy tools, and set up his own plumbing business. He made such a success of it that within ten years he was being invited to join the Small Heath board. By this time the ground at Muntz Street was becoming inadequate; a new stadium was needed, and Morris's business acumen again came to the fore. He identified an area of wet, sloping wasteland next to a railway as a potentially suitable site for a state-of-the-art football ground, convinced his fellow directors to back the idea, and served on the committee formed to organise the works. Within ten months of the land being acquired, the new ground, which would become known as St Andrew's, was opened. Morris's investments extended beyond football. When the first talking picture came out in 1928, he saw the potential and acquired an interest in several Midlands cinemas. He remained on the Birmingham board until 1929, when his son Harry junior took his place; another son, Len, also served as a director. Harry junior became chairman of the club in 1933, and after 38 years unbroken service to the club was appointed president in 1967, the year of his death. Morris died in June 1931 in Birmingham, not long after watching his club lose to West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup Final. Forty-five years earlier, he had played against, and lost to, the same club in the FA Cup semi-final.

Sanyals are Barendra Brahmins of the Vatsa gotra. He was an Indian revolutionary and a founder of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA, which after 1928 became the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association) that was created to carry out armed resistance against the British Empire in India. He was a mentor for revolutionaries like Chandrashekhar Azad and Bhagat Singh. Early life Sachindra Nath Sanyal's parents were Bengalis. His father was Hari Nath Sanyal and his mother was Kherod Vasini Devi. He was born in Benaras, then in United Provinces, on 3 April 1893 and married Pratibha Sanyal, with whom he had one son. Revolutionary career Sanyal founded a branch of the Anushilan Samiti in Patna in 1913. He was extensively involved in the plans for the Ghadar conspiracy, and went underground after it was exposed in February 1915. He was a close associate of Rash Behari Bose. After Bose escaped to Japan, Sanyal was considered the most senior leader of India's revolutionary movement. Sanyal was sentenced to life for his involvement in the conspiracy and was imprisoned at Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where he wrote his book titled Bandi Jeevan (A Life of Captivity, 1922). He was briefly released from jail but when he continued to engage in anti-British activities, he was sent back and his ancestral family home in Benaras was confiscated. Following the end of the Non-cooperation movement in 1922, Sanyal, Ram Prasad Bismil and some other revolutionaries who wanted an independent India and were prepared to use force to achieve their goal, founded the Hindustan Republican Association in October 1924. He was the author of the HRA manifesto, titled The Revolutionary, that was distributed in large cities of North India on 1 January 1925. Sanyal was jailed for his involvement in the Kakori conspiracy but was among those conspirators released from Naini Central Prison in August 1937. Thus, Sanyal has the unique distinction of having been sent to the Cellular Jail in Port Blair twice. He contracted tuberculosis in jail and was sent to Gorakhpur Jail for his final months. He died on 7 February 1942. Beliefs Sanyal and Mahatma Gandhi engaged in a famous debate published in Young India between 1920 and 1924. Sanyal argued against Gandhi's gradualist approach. Sanyal was known for his firm Hindu beliefs, although some of his followers were Marxists and thus opposed to religions. Bhagat Singh discusses Sanyal's beliefs in his tract Why I am an Atheist. Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee was a close associate of Sanyal. He was also supplied with guns by Maulana Shaukat Ali, who was at that time a supporter of Congress and its non-violent methods but not with the same fervor for non-violence that was expressed by his organization's leader, Gandhi. Another prominent Congressman, Krishna Kant Malaviya, also supplied him with weapons. Death He participated in a lot of Anti-British programs which were not obliged by the authorities. Thus, he was sent to the prison once again and the government seized his Varanasi property. While he was serving his second term in prison, he died.

Appleton was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census recorded Appleton-with- Eaton's parish population as 915. Manor In the 9th century Abingdon Abbey held the manor of Appleton. In AD 871 the Danes sacked the abbey and thereby obtained Appleton, but it is assumed that Appleton was recovered by Alfred the Great. Appleton's toponym means simply \\"an orchard\\". In the 10th century it was √Üppeltune or Appeltun, from then until the 17th century it evolved as Apletone, Apletune and Appelton, and in 1316 it was recorded as Aspelton. In the 10th century the village had the alternative name of Earmundesl√¶h, Earmundesleah, Earmundeslee or Earmundeslei, referring to King Edmund I, who in AD 942 granted it to Athelstan, one of his thegns, who may have restored it to Abingdon Abbey. The Domesday Book of 1086 records that Miles Crispin was the manorial overlord of Appleton and Eaton. There was also a second landholding at Appleton of which the overlord was Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, who was William of Normandy's half-brother. The Domesday Book records that Appleton had the most valuable fishery in Berkshire, valued at ¬£1.4s.2d. From then on the history is largely a record of grants and reversions, the best- known names to appear in the list of grantors or tenants being William de Merton, perhaps a kinsman of the founder of Merton College, Oxford, Sir William de Shareshull, Lord Chief Justice in the reign of Edward III, and William Lenthall, Speaker of the Long Parliament (this at a time when the Lordship of the Manor descended with that of Besselsleigh) and, of more local note, the Fettiplace and the Southby families. Appleton Manor House dates from about 1174 and has an ornate doorway. The Grade-II*-listed house has a porch and fireplace that were added in the Tudor era. Parish church Monument erected in 1593 in memory of Sir John Fettiplace (died 1580) The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint Laurence are 12th-century Norman. The north aisle was added late in that century, linked with the nave by a four-bay arcade of pointed arches. In the 13th century a new window and doorway were inserted in the south wall of the nave, as was the priest's doorway on the south side of the chancel. The east window of the chancel is 14th-century in style. In the 15th century the Perpendicular Gothic bell tower was added, a window inserted on the south side of the nave and the nave was re-roofed. The south porch was added early in the 16th century, the north aisle was rebuilt in the 17th century and the north porch was built in about 1700. The Gothic Revival architect CC Rolfe restored the nave in 1882‚Äì84. The church is a Grade II* listed building. Monuments in the church include a brass of two shrouded corpses in memory of John Goudrington, who died in 1518, and his wife. In the chancel is a Renaissance stone monument erected in 1593 in memory of Sir John Fettiplace, who died in 1580. It includes a life-size effigy of Sir John in 16th-century armour, a pair of Corinthian columns supporting a canopy surmounted by a pair of obelisks, and a long Latin inscription surrounded by extensive strapwork and a number of skulls. The tower has a ring of ten bells, all cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Thomas II Mears cast the seventh bell in 1817. George Mears cast the second and third bells in 1859 and the ninth and tenor bells in 1861. Mears and Stainbank recast the eighth bell in 1874 and cast the treble, fourth and fifth bells in 1875.

The ward borders the following other wards (from North, proceeding clockwise): Histon, King's Hedges, West Chesterton, Market and Castle. History The area has been occupied since at least Roman times. In the 1950s, stone coffins from the 2nd century were discovered, as well as the remains of a Roman villa and mausoleum. In medieval times, a decaying circular earthwork of unknown age was visible just to the north of where Arbury Road meets Histon Road (now part of Orchard Park) and was known as Hardburgh, Arborough or Arbury Camp. The earthwork was formerly around 100 metres in length, though its western half (extending into Impington) was no longer visible by the start of the 19th century. It is thought to have been an undefended Iron Age enclosure to protect animals from predators. In medieval times, the area was common land, and local peasants were permitted to graze their sheep on the meadow between Lammas and Lady Day. In the 17th and 18th centuries the meadows were dug for earth to make bricks. Arbury was historically part of the parish of Chesterton and the parish of Impington. The area was developed by Cambridge City Council from 1957 as a housing estate of around 100 acres. Electoral ward boundaries have changed substantially over the years. As a result, much of what was originally in Arbury Ward is now in Kings Hedges Ward, including the northern part of the original Arbury estate along with community facilities such as Arbury Community Centre and Arbury Court. Local life The community is served by the Church of the Good Shepherd,http://www.churchofthegoodshepherd.co.uk/ a red brick church designed by Stephen Dykes Bower. The chancel was built in 1958 and the nave in 1963-4. Opened in 1963, it became the parish church of its own parish in 1969. The Arbury community centre opened in 1974, which is also home to the Arbury Community Church.Arbury Community Church The Roman Catholic community of Arbury worship at St Laurence's church in Milton Road.

Cleveland moved to Hollywood in 1936 and went on to work in films via acting, producing and directing. Cleveland is perhaps best remembered today as George \\"Gramps\\" Miller in the early years of the long running US series Lassie.

He played the grumpy but-kind hearted father-in-law of farm woman Ellen Miller (Jan Clayton), and grandfather of Lassie's owner, Jeff (Tommy Rettig). Cleveland appeared in the first three seasons (1954-1956) and in the first 12 episodes of the fourth season (1957). His death in July 1957 was written into the 13th episode of the fourth season (1957) and became the storyline motive for the selling of the farm and the departure of the Millers for Capitol City.

There are two very different accounts of this battle. The first was written by 17th-century historian Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet, who himself was a younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, and it describes a battle fought between the Earl of Sutherland's forces who defeated the Clan Mackay of Strathnaver. The Earldom of Sutherland having recently passed to the Gordon family through marriage. However, this version of events is disputed. Firstly, late 19th-century historian Sir William Fraser states that Alexander Sutherland, who according to Gordon led the Earl of Sutherland's force at the battle, was in prison for the whole year of 1517 when the battle is supposed to have taken place. Secondly, early 20th- century historian Angus Mackay states that the battle was actually fought between the Clan Mackay, who were defeated, but who had fought against the Murrays of Aberscross, the Clan Ross and the Clan Gunn, and cited a historic manuscript as his source. Angus Mackay also agreed with Fraser's observations about Alexander Sutherland being in prison when the battle is supposed to have taken place. Sir Robert Gordon's account=Background John de Moravia, 9th Earl of Sutherland (John Sutherland), chief of the Clan Sutherland died in 1514. He was succeeded by his sister, Elizabeth de Moravia, 10th Countess of Sutherland (Elizabeth Sutherland). Elizabeth would go on to marry Adam Gordon, the second son of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, chief of the powerful Clan Gordon in 1517. Adam and Elizabeth's son Alexander Gordon would become the heir to the Earldom of Sutherland and chiefship of the Clan Sutherland. The Battle of Torran Dubh took place because John Mackay, 11th of Strathnaver, chief of Clan Mackay, and later the brother in law of Alexander Sutherland (Elizabeth's younger half-brother) was against the Gordon family taking over as Earls of Sutherland. According to historian Sir Robert Gordon (1580‚Äì1656), Elizabeth persuaded her younger half-brother, Alexander Sutherland, to resist Mackay, as this battle took place before Alexander Sutherland had married Mackay's sister. The battle According to Sir Robert Gordon, many on the Mackay side were killed, but few on the Sutherland side. An account of the battle was written in the book Conflicts of the Clans published by the Foulis Press in 1764, written from a manuscript from the time of King James VI of Scotland (Sir Robert Gordon's A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland). Adam Gordon, first of that surname, Earl of Sutherland having married Elizabeth Sutherland, heiress of that country, took journey to Edinburgh, the year of God 1517, to dispatch some affairs there, which did concern the settling of his estate, leaving the commandment of the country, in his absence, to Alexander Sutherland (base brother to his wife Elizabeth) and to John Murray of Abirscors; which John Mackay of Strathnaver, understanding (having now appeased his civil discords at home, by the death of his uncle Neil) this occasion, in the very change of surnames in Sutherland, to try if he could gain anything by spoiling that country; and thereupon assembling together all the forces of Strathnaver, Assynt and Eddrachillis, with all such as he could purchase out of the west and north-west isles of Scotland, invades the country of Sutherland with all hostility, burning and spoiling all before him. The inhabitants of Sutherland do speedily convene together with all the parts of the country; and so, under the conduct of Alexander Sutherland, John Murray, and William Mackames, they rencounter with John Mackay and his company at a place called Torran Dubh, beside Rogart, in Strathfleet, where there ensued a fierce and cruel conflict. The Sutherland men chased John Mackay's vanguard, and made them retire to himself where he stood in battle array, then did he select and chose a number of the ablest men in all his host, and, with these, he himself returned again to the conflict, leaving his brother Donald to conduct the rest, and to support him as necessity should require; whereupon they do begin a more cruel fight than before, well fought on either side. In the end, after long resistance, the Sutherland men obtained the victory; few of these that came to renew the fight escaped, but only John Mackay himself, and that very hardly. Neil MacIan MacAngus of Assynt was there slain, with divers of his men. There were 216 of the Strathnaver men left dead in the field, besides those that died in the chase. There were slain of Sutherland men 38. Not long thereafter John Mackay sent William and Donald, two brethren, with a company of men, to invade John Murray, with whom they met at a place called Loch-Sallachie, in Sutherland. After a sharp skirmish, both the chieftains of the Strathnaver men were slain, with divers of their men, and the rest put to flight; neither was the victory pleasing to John Murray, for he lost there his brother, called John Roy-Murray. Aftermath In the aftermath of the Battle of Torran Dubh other people rose up against the Gordon family holding the Earldom of Sutherland. Elizabeth, Countess of Sutherland's younger half-brother, Alexander Sutherland, married a sister of John Mackay. Alexander Sutherland then claimed the Earldom of Sutherland for himself and seized Dunrobin Castle, seat of the Earl of Sutherland. Adam Gordon with his family were then forced to flee to Strathbogie (home of the Gordons of Huntly) until he was reinforced by his father's and elder brother's forces from the Clan Gordon. In 1518 or 1519 the Battle of Alltachuilain took place where Alexander Sutherland was killed by forces loyal to his sister Elizabeth and her husband Adam Gordon. According to Sir Robert Gordon, in 1522 Alexander Gordon, the Master of Sutherland overthrew John Mackay of Strathnaver at Lairg, and forced him to submit himself to the Earl of Sutherland; unto whom John Mackay gave a bond of manrent and service. After Alexander Sutherland's death the Sutherland Laird of Duffus who descended from Kenneth de Moravia, 4th Earl of Sutherland would claim the Earldom of Sutherland. However, William Sutherland, 5th Laird of Duffus was killed by Andrew Stewart, Bishop of Caithness in 1529. Adam Gordon and Elizabeth, Countess of Sutherland's eldest son, Alexander Gordon the Master of Sutherland, died in 1530, five years before his mother. His son John Gordon succeeded as the 11th Earl of Sutherland. Historical accuracy Nineteenth-century historian Sir William Fraser casts doubt on the events concerning the Battle of Torran Dubh or Torrandow, stating that Alexander Sutherland, who is alleged by Sir Robert Gordon to have been persuaded by his sister Elizabeth, Countess of Sutherland to resist Mackay, was in prison for the whole year of 1517, when the battle is said to have taken place. Angus Mackay's account=The battle According to early 20th-century historian Angus Mackay, the Battle of Torran Du was fought in 1517 between the Clan Mackay, with the support of the Clan Matheson and the Polsons, against the Murrays of Aberscross, the Clan Ross and the Clan Gunn. Angus Mackay agrees with historian Sir William Fraser that the battle did not take place how Sir Robert Gordon describes it, as it is confirmed that Alexander Sutherland was in prison when it was supposed to have taken place in 1517. According to Angus Mackay there was no fighting in the policy of Adam Gordon, Earl of Sutherland, but does say that Alexander Sutherland was \\"assassinated\\" by Gordon emissaries in 1519.Mackay, Angus. p. 80. Historian Angus Mackay quoted the MS Account of the Gunns, a historic manuscript as his source for the Battle of Torran Du. According to this account the battle was initially going in favour of the Mackays, until the Gunns appeared over the brow of the hill and charged. The Mackays and Mathesons prudently left the battle, but many of the Polsons were slain. Angus Mackay quotes a Scottish Gaelic poem from the MS that reads: This translates in English as: Aftermath According to historian Angus Mackay a few months after the battle another skirmish took place upon the borders of Ross in the parish of Rogart in which on one side William Mackay, chieftain of the Mackay of Aberach branch of clan was killed as was his brother Donald, and on the other side was killed John Murray of Aberscross. Shortly after this the Mackays burned the town of Pitfure in Strathfleet, Rogart. However, this was immediately followed by a bond of friendship between the Mackays and Adam Gordon, Earl of Sutherland dated 16 August 1518. Angus Mackay states that historian Sir Robert Gordon incorrectly refers to these skirmishes as \\"defeats\\" for the Mackays, and that Gordon also fails to mention that the Mackays rounded the year off by securing a title to the lands in the said parish of Rogart as confirmed by the Reay Papers. Angus Mackay also disputes Sir Robert Gordon's account given above that in 1522 Sir Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland overthrew John Mackay of Strathnaver at Lairg and that Mackay then submitted himself to Gordon, the Earl of Sutherland.Mackay, Angus. p. 84 Angus Mackay explains that the Earl, resigning the earldom into his son Alexander's hands was simply renewing the bond of friendship that he had made with Mackay in 1518 this time with his son Alexander.

Until the early 1960s, it was largely based on the former English country house of Appley Towers (seat of the Hutt family, and later of Sir Hedworth Williamson) and neighbouring Appley Farm. The area's character changed with the construction of the Appley housing estate ‚Äì a development of mainly detached houses and bungalows, built on either side of the B3330 Ryde to St Helens road. The names of the roads on the estate relate mostly either to proximity of the sea (Marina, Solent) or refer to Cumbrian lakes (Grasmere, Derwent). The area to the north of the Appley housing estate is now a public park, with the Solent beyond. The stone-built tower by the sea wall dates from the days this land was the property of the Hutt family, as does the parkland itself, the latter being laid out to a design by Humphry Repton in 1798. In 2008, Appley Park became the first open space on the Isle of Wight to be awarded a Green Flag. The large villa just off the B3330 road, known previously as \\"Little Appley\\" at one time accommodated a school, as shown by the remaining sports field which adjoins it. This field is the home of archery club Wight Bowmen. The former school building now operates as a hotel and restaurant under the name Appley Manor. Appley House was the residence of Mr. Clayton.

USS Enoree (AO-69) was a constructed for the United States Navy during World War II. She was the only U.S. Navy ship named for the Enoree River in South Carolina. Construction and commissioning The tanker SS Sachem - T3 laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC Hull No. 517) on 8 April 1942 at Sparrows Point, Maryland, by the Bethlehem Steel Company and launched on 29 August 1942 - was renamed SS Enoree and designated as a fuel oil tanker (AO-69) on 17 September 1942. Acquired by the U.S. Navy on 23 January 1943, Enoree was commissioned the same day with Commander William S. Campbell in command. Service history=World War II Departing Baltimore, Maryland, on 27 January 1943 for Norfolk, Virginia, her conversion having been completed the previous day, Enoree proceeded thence to Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, arriving on 3 March 1943, where she was involved in a minor collision with the U.S. Navy oiler . While Enoree suffered no damage in the mishap, Sapelo required minor repairs. Shifting thence to the waters off Ambrose Light, Enoree, escorted by the destroyer departed on 8 March 1943 for Hampton Roads, Virginia, arriving the following day. Her loading delayed, however, she returned to New York City, arriving on 17 March 1943. She ultimately sailed on her maiden transatlantic run on 1 April 1943, departing the United States East Coast with Task Force 69 as it escorted convoy UGS-7, and arriving at its destination, Casablanca, French North Africa, on 19 April 1943. Enoree returned to the United States, via Gibraltar (which she visited on 22-23 April 1943), with convoy GUS-6A, reaching Norfolk on 10 May 1943. Enoree shuttled between Norfolk, Aruba in the Netherlands West Indies, and Port Arthur Texas, for the balance of May and through mid-June 1943 before she departed Hampton Roads with Task Force 62, the escort for convoy UGS-11, on 27 June 1943, bound, once more, for Casablanca, which she reached on 18 July. Sailing for home with convoy GUS-10 on 23 July 1943, she paused briefly at Bermuda, shepherded by the destroyer escorts and , ultimately arriving back in Hampton Roads on 11 August 1943. Subsequently, she made her third voyage to Casablanca, that time with Task Force 61 as it escorted UGS-16, arriving at its destination on 13 September 1943, and returning home with GUS-15. Putting into New York City with that section of GUS-15 on 4 October 1943, Enoree then made her first voyage to Belfast, Northern Ireland, with Task Force 69 as it escorted troop convoy UT-4, departing the East Coast of the United States on 21 October 1943 and reaching its destination on 31 October 1943. Returning to New York City on 18 November 1943, she dropped down the coast to Norfolk, arriving there on 23 November 1943 with the New York section of convoy UGS-25. She then shuttled between Norfolk, Houston, Texas, and Port Arthur into the second week of January 1944. Ultimately, she returned to New York City on 22 January 1944 and there joined Task Force 60, the escort force for the troop convoy UT-8, sailing for the United Kingdom on 12 February 1944. Three days later, during the passage, Enoree topped off the escort force's destroyers. Returning to New York City from Belfast on 9 March 1944, Enoree departed that port on 11 March with the New York section of UGS-36 and reached Norfolk on 12 March. Less than a fortnight later, on 26 March 1944, she was earmarked for future assignment to Service Squadron Eight, United States Pacific Fleet. Enoree remained at Norfolk into late April 1944, and received an overhaul during that time, the work being completed on 15 April 1944. Plans for her conversion to a crane vessel having been contemplated since at least early December 1943, she was the recipient of a 160-ton capacity crane during that period of yard work. Enoree departed Norfolk on 25 April 1944 with the similarly derrick-configured oiler , escorted by the destroyer . Pausing briefly at Aruba from 30 April to 1 May 1944, Enoree pushed on for the Panama Canal Zone, which she reached on 3 May 1944. After transiting the Panama Canal, she cleared Balboa and reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet on 5 May 1944, bound for Oahu, Territory of Hawaii. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 19 May 1944, Enoree sailed in convoy for the Marshall Islands on 27 May 1944. Arriving at Eniwetok on 5 June 1944, the ship dispensed fuel oil and ammunition to ships present on a daily basis over the next twelve days. Departing Eniwetok on 17 June 1944 with Task Unit 16.7.6, Enoree conducted fueling operations at sea subsequently. Detached from Task Group 60.17 upon completion of those services, she returned to Eniwetok, escorted by the destroyer escort , dropping anchor on 1 July 1944. Enoree based out of Eniwetok over the next three months, proceeding to sea at intervals to conduct logistical work as required, those and the previous evolutions in support of the unfolding campaign to secure the Mariana Islands, and, subsequently, the western Caroline Islands. Enoree shifted her base of operations to Ulithi, in the recently secured western Carolines, sailing from Eniwetok on 8 October 1944 and arriving at her destination on 13 October 1944. From Ulithi, she supported the United States Third Fleet (under Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr.) as it carried out its devastating attacks against Formosa, the coast of China, and in the Nansei Shoto group during January 1945. Ultimately departing the western Carolines on 7 February 1945, she reached Saipan, in the Marianas, two days later. She remained there until 30 March 1945, when she got underway to return to Ulithi, arriving on 1 April 1945 as operations began against Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands. With the establishment of a logistics base at Kerama Retto, Enoree sailed for that place on 3 April 1945, taking up her duties there a week later, on 10 April. Departing Kerama Retto three days later, Enoree returned to Ulithi on 20 April 1945, where she remained until 24 May 1945. Joining Task Unit 30.18.11 on 31 May 1945, Enoree discharged fuel oil, aviation gasoline, and some of her crew to the mobile storage tanker for transportation. Arriving at Okinawa on 1 June 1945, she got underway the following day for the fueling rendezvous off Hagushi beach, fueled a convoy underway, and then returned whence she had come. Departing Okinawa on 5 June 1945, she returned to Ulithi to load a cargo of oil, arriving on 11 June 1945. She shuttled to Kerama Retto and back into mid-July 1945. After having loaded a cargo of fuel oil from the merchant tanker SS Skullbar, Enoree sailed from Ulithi on 19 July 1945 for Okinawa in convoy UOK-39, and resumed operations in Buckner Bay soon thereafter. In addition to her regular fueling duties, the large cruiser being one of her customers, Enoree, with her heavy-lift capacity, easily unloaded five 27-ton (24.1-long ton; 24.5-metric ton) pontoon barges for the medium landing ship on 26 July 1945, and on 5 August 1945, lifted the 105-ton (94-long ton; 95-metric ton) tank landing craft from the deck of the tank landing ship . Enoree departed Okinawa on 6 August 1945 with convoy OKU-17, arriving at Ulithi on 10 August, only to put to sea again, Okinawa-bound with convoy UOK-48 on 14 August, the day before Japan accepted the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration and agreed to surrender. Postwar The cessation of hostilities and the occupation of the Japanese homeland required Enoree‚Äôs presence in the Pacific and cancelled her projected 15 July-1 September 1945 overhaul at San Pedro, California. Enoree thus shuttled back and forth between Okinawa and Ulithi into the autumn of 1945, departing Buckner Bay on 5 October 1945 for Japanese waters to support the occupation. Enoree then operated out of Kure, Hiro Wan, Yokohama, Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Wakayama. Departing Wakayama on 19 December 1945, Enoree arrived off Okinawa on 23 December 1945. She remained there until sailing for Guam, in the Marianas, on 18 March 1946. Proceeding thence via Manila, Philippine Islands, and a brief six-hour liberty call at Singapore, Straits Settlements, Enoree ultimately reached Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf, to load a cargo of fuel, on 15 May 1946. Sailing for Manila on 17 May, she called at Ceylon from 24 to 26 May 1946 en route, and arrived in Philippine waters on 3 June 1946. Assigned to the Repair and Service Unit (Task Unit 1.8.1) of Joint Task Force 1, for Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll, Enoree departed Manila on 4 June 1946, and arrived at Bikini on 13 June 1946. She provided fuel for the other units assigned to the work there for the next two weeks before shifting to Kwajalein on 29 June 1946. During Test Able, on 1 July 1946, she lay at Kwajalein, about southeast of Bikini, and because of the favorable weather conditions and the relatively small size of the bomb, received no contamination from the atomic blast. Underway on 3 July 1946, Enoree returned to Bikini the following day, and remained anchored there until the second dog watch on 13 July 1946, when she again got underway to return to Kwajalein. Reaching her destination the following afternoon, she replenished her fuel supplies there and then set course for Bikini on the 16th, arriving the following morning. Between 20 and 23 July 1946, she supplied oil to various units of the task force. Underway late in the afternoon watch on 24 July 1946, Enoree was underway the following morning (25 July 1946) in company with the destroyer tender , and observed Test Baker, the shallow underwater detonation, from a distance in excess of 17 nautical miles (19.5 statute miles; 31.5 km). Enoree ultimately returned to Bikini lagoon during the morning watch on 29 July 1946, and resumed dispensing fuel oil, a vital logistical task that occupied her throughout much of the month of August 1946. She left Bikini for the last time on 24 August 1946, when she sailed for Kwajalein, arriving the next day. A radiological monitoring team boarded the ship on the morning of 28 August 1946, and declared her radiologically safe, clearing her to sail. She was detached from Operation Crossroads on 29 August 1946. After a brief visit to Eniwetok from 29 August to 3 September 1946, Enoree departed Kwajalein for Pearl Harbor with the barrack ship in tow on 7 September 1946, delivering her charge upon arrival on 20 September. Departing Pearl Harbor a week later on 27 September 1946, Enorree reached San Francisco, California, her decontamination port, on 4 October 1946. Assigned a restricted availability commencing 14 November 1946 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California. for urgent repairs to her number one boiler, with other work to be performed by the repair ship , Enoree received operational and radiological clearance by 11 December 1946. Departing San Francisco on 22 December 1946, the oiler reached San Diego the following day, where she remained into 1947. With the floating workshop YR-37 in tow, Enoree departed San Diego on 2 January 1947 bound for the Panama Canal Zone. Transiting the Panama Canal between 13 and 16 January 1947, and reporting for duty with the Service Force, United States Atlantic Fleet, the oiler dropped off YR-37 at Charleston, South Carolina, on 26 January 1947. Pushing on the same day for Norfolk, the ship paused briefly at that port on 28-29 January 1947 before departing for her ultimate destination, the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which she reached on 30 January 1947 to begin preparations to join the inactive reserve fleet. Placed out of commission, in reserve, on 27 May 1947, with preservation 37% completed, Enoree was formally inactivated on 23 June 1947. Cold War Ordered activated on 7 August 1950, Enoree, preparations to return her to active service still in progress, was recommissioned at Philadelphia on 18 October 1950 with Commander Samuel H. Pattie in command. After a visit to Norfolk from 8 November to 14 December 1950, Enoree returned to Philadelphia on the latter date and continued fitting out into the new year of 1951. Sailing from her activation yard on 25 January 1951, the ship paused at Norfolk from 26 January to 2 February 1951 before pushing on for the Panama Canal Zone. Transiting the Panama Canal on 9-10 February 1951, Enoree reached Pearl Harbor on 26 February 1951. Reassigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) on 30 March 1951, she would operate as United States Naval Ship (USNS) Enoree (T-AO-69) for the remainder of her operational service. Having reported to Commander, MSTS, for operational control and Commander, MSTS, Pacific, for administrative control, meanwhile, Enoree departed Pearl Harbor on 31 March 1951 for San Francisco, arriving there on 7 April 1951. Her departure thence delayed until 28 April 1951, the ship sailed for Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on that date, and retransited the Panama Canal, Aruba-bound, on 8-9 May 1951. Over the remainder of the year 1951, Enoree picked up petroleum cargoes at Aruba; Marcus Hoo, Pennsylvania; Houston; Port Arthur; and Perth Amboy, New Jersey, delivering them to Norfolk; Melville, Rhode Island; Newport, Rhode Island; Savannah, Georgia; Boston, Massachusetts; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; and Trinidad. She arrived at the New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York, on 8 November 1951, where she remained into 1952. Enoree visited New York City from 10 to 15 January 1952, Leonardo, New Jersey, from 15 to 16 January 1952, and Norfolk from 17 to 28 January 1952 before she returned to the West Indies, and her first visit to Aruba for the year from 2 to 3 February 1952, steaming thence to the Panama Canal Zone. She transited the Panama Canal between 4 and 6 February 1952, departing Balboa on the latter date for Galveston, Texas, which she reached on 10 February 1952. Remaining there until 20 February 1952, Enoree then visited Freeport, Texas, at the mouth of the Brazos River, before she proceeded on to return to the Panama Canal Zone, bound for the United States West Coast. Transiting the Panama Canal on 26-27 February 1952, she reached El Segundo, California, on 8 March 1952. She operated in the El Segundo-Long Beach-San Diego area until 28 March 1952, when she took departure for the Panama Canal Zone, transiting the Panama Canal on 5 April 1952. After shuttling between Aruba and Guantanamo Bay, Enoree loaded a cargo of oil at Aruba and sailed for Norfolk, and thence to the northward, to Thule, Greenland, which she visited from 30 June to 13 August 1952, and Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. Canada, from 30 to 31 August 1952. After a period at New York from 3 to 19 September 1952, the tanker sailed once more for Aruba, and during the autumn of 1952 carried cargoes between Aruba and San Juan, Puerto Rico (twice); Trinidad' Roosevelt Roads; Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone; and Norfolk. During December 1952, she made two round trips between Aruba and Guantanamo Bay. Ultimately reaching New York on 19 December 1952, Enoree remained there into the second week of March 1953. During 1953, Enoree voyaged to and from Aruba ten times, Houston five times, and Port Arthur once, calling at Norfolk eleven times, Mayport and Key West, Florida; Melville; New York City; and Crist√≥bal, Panama Canal Zone, once apiece; the only variation to the usual succession of United States ports was Hvalfjordur, Iceland, from 1 to 4 October 1953. Offloading at Earle, New Jersey on 19 January 1954, Enoree entered the Todd Plant, Erie Basin, yard at Brooklyn, New York, the same day, for overhaul; she remained there until 9 March 1954. Enoree continued shuttling between oil ports like Aruba, Houston, and Galveston, and locales of fleet activity like Gona√Øves, Haiti; San Juan; Melville (twice); Key West; and Norfolk (twice) into the spring of 1954. On 5 May 1954, however, she received word that, effective 11 May 1954, her home yard was to be changed from Norfolk to Long Beach. Departing Norfolk for the last time on 12 May 1954, Enoree transited the Panama Canal between 17 and 19 May 1954 and reached San Francisco on 29 May 1954, where she remained until 5 August 1954. Underway for Long Beach on that date, she reached her destination the next day, and remained there for four months, her inactivity reflecting decreased military shipping requirements. Underway for San Diego on 7 December 1954, she arrived at that port the next day. She was decommissioned and placed in the San Diego group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet on 10 December 1954. Ordered activated and transferred to MSTS on 6 November 1956, Enoree was recommissioned on 10 December 1956 at Long Beach Naval Shipyard with Commander Richard H. Tibbets in command. She sailed to begin her third tour of active service on 27 December 1956. Transiting the Panama Canal on 4 January 1957, she reached Aruba three days later. Over the months that followed, Enoree conducted seven voyages from Aruba to Norfolk, three to Guantanamo Bay, one to Jacksonville, Florida, and one to Crist√≥bal. In addition, she made one deployment to the Mediterranean, departing Aruba on 5 April 1957 and reaching the Bay of Pozzuoli, west of Naples, Italy, on 21 April 1957. Port visits to Amuay, Venezuela, from 11 to 12 June 1957 and New York City from 19 to 21 June and 14 August to 2 September 1957 punctuated those routine voyages in the summer of 1957. Her final visit to New York City occurred between 25 September and 16 October 1957, after which she departed on her final voyage, proceeding via Sabine Pass and Port Arthur, and arriving at Orange, Texas, on 22 October 1957, where she was decommissioned and placed in reserve the same day. She was transferred to Maritime Administration custody at Beaumont, Texas, on 13 November 1957. Disposal Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1959, Enoree remained in the National Defense Reserve Fleet‚Äôs Beaumont berthing area until sold for scrapping on 27 April 1976 to Luria Brothers and Company, Inc., of Cleveland, Ohio.

It was first formed in 1919 from the remnants of the Lithuanian Rifle Division and fought in the Defence of Petrograd during the Russian Civil War. The division then fought in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. In 1939, the division fought in the Soviet invasion of Poland. It fought in the Winter War from December 1939 and suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Kelja. After Operation Barbarossa, the division fought in the Barvinkove-Losowaja Operation and the 1942 Battle of Voronezh. It suffered heavy losses at Voronezh and was disbanded in November 1942. The division reformed in 1943 and fought in the Bryansk Offensive, Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive, Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive, Warsaw- Poznan Offensive and Berlin Offensive. It was disbanded in the summer of 1945. The division was reformed a third time from the 160th Rifle Division and inherited that division's honorifics and awards. It became the 4th Motor Rifle Division in 1957 and disbanded in 1959.  History = First formation  The division was activated 1919 near Petrograd during the Russian Civil War, and fought on the western front of that war and in the Polish-Soviet War. Until 1923 its headquarters was at Minsk. During the 1930s the division was part of the 5th Rifle Corps, stationed in the Belarussian Military District. It was moved north in 1939 and fought in the Winter War, including at the Battle of Kelja, later joining the newly formed 13th Army. In July 1941 the division was part of the 3rd Rifle Corps of the Transcaucasian Military District. By an order of 23 July 1941, the 3rd Rifle Corps became the 46th Army, as of 1 August 1941, and the 4th Rifle Division thus became part of the 46th Army. In the middle of April 1942 the division under Colonel Ivan Rosly was fighting as part of the 12th Army. In August 1942 it participated in the Battle of the Caucasus. The division was disbanded after heavy combat in November 1942.  Second formation  It was reformed 1943 in the Moscow Military District and from April 1943 ‚Äì May 1944 it was part of the Baltic Front's 11th Army. Later reassigned to 48th Army. By January 1945, now part of the 25th Rifle Corps of the 69th Army, it took part in the fighting for the Pu≈Çawy bridgehead in Poland; much weakened by the battle, its effective strength was reduced to not more than six battalions. In April 1945, still part of the 69th Army, it took part in the Battle of Berlin. It disbanded in accordance with Stavka Directive No. 11095 to the Commander of the 1st Belorussian Front \\"About renaming of the front to the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany and its composition\\" dated May 29, 1945. The troops of the division strengthened other group formations.  Third formation  The division was reformed again in 1955 from the 179th Rifle Division in the South Ural Military District at Buzuluk but then was reorganised as the 4th Motor Rifle Division on 25 June 1957.Feskov et al 2013, p. 150, Table 4.1.5 The 4th Motor Rifle Division was disbanded in 1959.Michael Holm, 4th Motor Rifle Division  Order of Battle 1941‚Äì1945  * 39th Rifle Regiment * 101st Rifle Regiment * 220th Rifle Regiment * 40th Artillery Regiment  Distinctions and Divisional Decorations  * 1923 : Received the honorific title \\"In the name of the German Prol√©tariat\\"; * 1945 : Name of \\"Bezhitsa\\". inscribed on the divisional banner.

He was canonised by Pope John Paul II in 1999.Cirilo Bertr√°n and 8 Companions, religious of the Institute of Brothers of the Christian Schools and Inocencio de la Inmaculada, priest of the Congregation of the Passion of Jesus Christ, martyrs (+1934, +1937) Life He was born on March 10, 1887 at Santa Cilla do Valadouro (Foz), near the Cantabrian coast in the province of Lugo (Galicia) and joined the Passionist seminary at the age of 14 at Pe√±afiel, near Valladolid.Mercurio, R: \\"The Passionists\\", page 176. The Liturgical Press, 1991 He joined the Passionist Congregation at Deusto (Biscay) and then continued his philosophy and theology. At Mieres, not far from Tur√≥n, he was given the sub-diaconate in 1910, the diaconate in 1912 and was ordained priest in 1920.Mercurio, R: \\"The Passionists\\", page 37. The Liturgical Press, 1991 As a priest he preached missions and also taught in various schools. Whilst he was in Mieres he had been asked by the Brothers of the Christian Schools (De La Salle) to hear the confessions of the children on their school as they prepared for their First Communion. This was at the time of the Asturias revolt, when communists and anti-clericalists had risen up against the Second Spanish Republic. Martyrdom On Friday October 5, 1934, a group of strikers forced their way into the Lasallian school in Tur√≥n, where Father Inocencio was exercising his priestly ministry. He was imprisoned alongside the eight Brothers in the so- called \\"House of the People\\" to await the judgment of the Republican committee. They were condemned to death and, in the early hours of October 9, 1934, were executed by a firing squad. Their bodies were buried in a common grave. Inocencio is regarded by the Catholic church as one of the Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War. Although his death occurred some two years prior to the outbreak of the war, his death was part of the same violence and anti-clerical feeling of that period in Spain's history. Canonization Inocencio and his eight fellow martyrs were declared venerable in 1989, beatified on April 19, 1990, then canonized on November 21, 1999 by Pope John Paul II.

Arlescote forms part of the district of Stratford-on-Avon and the civil parish of Warmington. This small hamlet sits approximately away from Warmington at the bottom of Edgehill, with roughly 10 houses and 30 villagers today. Without any shops or other local conveniences situated in the hamlet, the main feature is Arlescote House, a Grade II* James I house of architectural and historic interest. Location Arlescote is in the county of Warwickshire, England, despite the hamlet's postcode (OX17 1DQ). Arlescote is part of the parish of Warmington and is on the north-facing side of Edgehill. Nearby towns include Banbury, and Leamington Spa. Arlescote is fairly remote, with the nearest village being 2 miles away. Arlescote is at one of the northernmost points of the Cotswolds AONB.cotswolds area of outstanding natural beauty A public footpath runs through the village. History As part of the parish of Warmington, Arlescote shares much of its history with the nearby villages of Warmington and Ratley. Originally Arlescote began as little more than the manor house and surrounding farmland. During the late 10th century, the land was held by the Norman Abbey of Pr√©aux. Arelscote was given to the abbey by the Count of Meulan's father, Roger de Beaumont, and confirmed by William the Conqueror c. 1080. When the count's brother, Earl of Warwick, succeeded his sibling, he also gave the village of Warmington to the abbey. During the 14th century, the \\"priory\\" seems to have disbanded and the parish passed into the control of the prior of Toft monks. During the war with France, the parish was passed in and out of the possession of the king. In 1542, Arlescote was granted to Richard Andrews and Leonard Chamberlain, who quickly passed the land on to the Lecke family. The house fell into the possession of John Croker of Hook Norton who subsequently passed the land on to his son Gerard following his death. In 1572, Warmington and Arlescote's manor houses were sold to Richard and Thomas Cupper. Following Richard's death around 1605, his son Henry Cupper (or Cooper, as the name had now become) gave Warmington manor to his second son Thomas. Both Alrescote House and Warmington Manor were then passed down through the Cooper family. In 1642 the Battle of Edgehill took place as the first battle of the first English Civil War. The battle itself took place very near to Arlescote, with battle reenactments still taking place today in nearby countryside. The next known owner of Warmington manor was William Bumpstead in 1743. By 1764 the house was owned by Robert Child, a wealthy banker. Child's daughter Sarah and her husband John then took ownership of the manor in 1787. Their daughter Sarah Sophia and her husband, Earl of Jersey, then became lord of the manor around 1806. Following the earl's death in 1859, Mr and Mrs Bennet became lord and lady of Warmington manor until 1924. Since this time the manorial rights appear to have fallen through.(History sourced from British History Online) Arlescote Manor has been redeveloped by its current owners who bought the house in the mid-2000s. The village community also rebuilt a dry-stone wall on the east side of the village in 2000 as a millennium community project.

WNMB FM existed from 1972-2000 when it was sold and the call letters changed to WEZV. Soon after, Bill Norman leased the AM station and changed the callsign to WNMB. Norman later purchased WNMB outright and continued the WNMB radio tradition on the Grand Strand. The station broadcasts a classic rock format. FM translator In addition to the AM frequency of 900 AM, programming from WNMB is relayed to an FM translator on 95.5 MHz which is used in the branding on the station website.

In late April 2011, WNMB owner Bill Norman resurrected WVCO. Ted Bell moved mainly back over to The Surf (where he had been previously for about 11 years). However, Bell could still be heard on WNMB as well. Both radio stations were located together in the WNMB building on Pine Avenue in North Myrtle Beach. In 2014, WNMB changed from playing 1950s' and '60s' music to playing music from the '60s, '70s, and '80s. Previously, under Mr. Norman's tenure, the station had played a wide range of true golden oldies and had a considerable audience. Also, Mr. Norman was active in the community and had many advertising clients on his air. After the shift in music, the station's identity changed dramatically.

Death of WNMB owner Bill Norman and subsequent investigation Owner Bill Norman suffered a serious stroke on September 29, 2012, and died at Grand Strand Regional Medical Center on October 14, 2012, from what initially was labelled a \\"cerebral vascular accident\\" on the death certificate. On October 19, 2012, the Myrtle Beach Police Department launched an investigation into Norman's death. WMBF-TV reported on December 6‚Äì7, 2012, that a 53-year-old nurse, Janet Kupka, had given Norman 20 milligrams of morphine instead of the prescribed 4 milligrams. Kupka allegedly admitted to a witness that she gave Norman the drug Diprivan. Norman was brain dead due to the stroke. Norman's body had been cremated and was not available to be autopsied. The cause of death may be changed to an overdose. In a filing with the FCC, Norman's widow is listed as his personal representative and owns 50% of WNMB in that capacity, in addition to the 50% stake she already held.

First published by Houghton, Mifflin and Company in 1886, it was soon collected as the title story in Jewett's anthology A White Heron and Other Stories. It follows a young city girl named Sylvia who came to live with her grandmother in the country. She meets a young ornithologist hunter seeking to find a rare bird that he recently spotted in the area. As the story progresses, Sylvia is challenged with whether or not she should tell the hunter she saw the bird. She also discovers her passion for country life and her love and values for the animals that inhabit it. Plot summary Sylvia has come from the city to live in the Maine woods with her grandmother, Mrs. Tilley. As the story begins, Sylvia has been living with her grandmother for nearly a year, learning to adapt to country ways. She helps the old woman by taking over some of the more manual jobs, such as finding Mistress Moolly, the cow, each evening in the fields where she grazes and brings her home. By means of this and other tasks, along with her explorations in the forest, Sylvia has become a country girl who dearly loves her new home. She has taken to it easily and immerses herself in her new life completely, as evidenced by the description of her journey home each evening with the cow: ‚ÄúTheir feet were familiar with the path, and it was no matter whether their eyes could see it or not.‚Äù One evening she is approached by a hunter, who is in the area looking for birds to shoot and preserve for his collection. This young man is searching in particular for the rare white heron, and he is sure that it makes its nest in the vicinity. He accompanies Sylvia on her way with hopes of spending the night at her grandmother‚Äôs house. Once he has received this invitation, he makes himself at home. After they eat, he says that he will give a sum of money to anyone who can lead him to the white heron. The next day Sylvia accompanies the hunter into the forest as he searches for the bird‚Äôs nest, but he does not find it. Early the following morning, the girl decides to go out and look for the bird by herself so that she can be sure of showing the hunter its exact location when he awakes. She decides to climb the tallest tree in the forest so that she can see the entire countryside, and she finds the heron, just as she had thought she would. This is the critical passage of the story. When Sylvia climbs the tree as a bird might, she arrives at an epiphany at the tree's top. High as a bird, she has broken free of the world beneath and \\"becomes\\" the heron. But Sylvia is so affected by her leaf- top observation of the heron and other wildlife that she cannot bring herself to disclose the heron's location to the hunter after all, despite his entreaties. Sylvia knows that she would be awarded much-needed money for directing him to the heron, but she decides that she can play no part in bringing about the bird's death. The hunter eventually departs without his prize. Sylvia grows up to ponder if her choice to conceal the heron's secret was a better choice than to receive the young man's money and friendship. The author states that the treasures Sylvia might have lost are easily forgotten among the splendors of the woodland. Major themes \\"A White Heron\\" can be thought of as a starting point for both ecological, nature-ethical literature in the US, and questioning the undoubted positive development of the US. The author explores a number of ecological themes including the freedom of nature, a return to nature, emancipation from materialism and industrialism. Other themes explored include the hesitation of actions that might counteract the proceeding industrialization and the recollection of the individual human being as the important actor in society. This book can also be thought of as an example of New England feminist literature and an example of \\"New England Realism\\" (cf.: William Dean Howells).  Feminism  Since the rise of feminist literary criticism around the 1960s, more research has been focused on the themes of how the female experience is presented in \\"A White Heron\\". Research by George Held has identified themes such as, ‚Äúthe socialization of girls, the balance of power between the sexes, and the need for a woman to be true to her nature\\". The influence of the female experience in this work being represented by the strength and independence of the main character has been connected to imitating a traditional hero character, more often depicted as male . This challenging of traditional roles of power argues the importance of the female voice and provides an empowering perspective on the female experience. The protagonist in ‚ÄúA White Heron‚Äù can be seen as an example of a woman of power and embodying heroism. Some criticism has even acknowledged the fact that the main character of the story may have been loosely based on Jewett's life growing up. Losing her father encouraged a need to be a strong and powerful young girl. She created a character who expressed the female voice of the women of her time in a new perspective than traditionally published works.

The identity of this queen has not yet been established with any degree of certainty and Dakhamunzu has variously been identified as either Nefertiti, Meritaten or Ankhesenamen. The identification of this queen is of importance both for Egyptian chronology and for the reconstruction of events during the late Eighteenth Dynasty. However, in recent years it has been noted that Dahamunzu may be the Hittite phonetic rendition of the Egyptian ta hemet nesu, 'the king's wife', and thus is simply the equivalent of addressing her as the equivalent of 'queen'. If so, then Dahamanzu is not a proper name at all and thus not a mysterious synonym for any of the queens discussed here, and is instead only a title. See below on this page. See Reeves (2001) p. 176, citing the work of T.O. Lambdin and W. Federn. The episode in The Deeds of Suppiluliuma that features Dakhamunzu is often referred to as the Zannanza affair, after the name of a Hittite prince who was sent to Egypt to marry her. Context The Dakhamunzu episode should be seen against the background of Egypt's relations with the other major powers in Western Asia during the second half of the 14th century BC, more specifically the three-cornered struggle for power between Egypt, Mitanni and the newly arising power of the Hittites under Suppiluliuma I.Reeves (2001) p.175 During the late-Amarna period and its immediate aftermath we are almost totally dependent on the Hittite records for information on these matters.Aldred, C., Akhenaten, King of Egypt (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 297 While involved in war with Mitanni, the Hittites were attacked by Egyptian forces in the region of Kadesh, which had only recently come under Hittite control. Suppiluliuma retaliated by simultaneously besieging Mitanni forces at Carchemish and sending forces into the Amqu region, at that time an Egyptian vassal state. At this point the annals inform us that: > [The Egyptians] were afraid. And since, in addition, their lord Nibhururiya > had died, therefore the queen of Egypt, who was Dakhamunzu, sent a messenger > to [Suppiluliuma].G√ºterbock (1956) p.94 The Zannanza affair The annals then recount the message the Egyptian widow queen wrote to Suppiluliuma: > My husband died. A son I have not. But to thee, they say, the sons are many. > If thou wouldst give me one son of thine, he would become my husband. Never > shall I pick out a servant of mine and make him my husband. I am afraid. Such an offer to marry a female member of the Egyptian royal family is unprecedented; as Amenhotep III made clear in his correspondence with a foreign king, the gift of women in marriage was, for Egypt, a one-way trade: From time immemorial no daughter of the king of Egypt is given to anyone.Reeves, C.N., Akhenaten, Egypt's False Prophet (Thames and Hudson, 2001) p. 64 Suppiluliuma is therefore surprised and suspicious, the annals report his reaction: > Such a thing has never happened to me in my whole life!G√ºterbock (1956) p.95 Intrigued, he sends his chamberlain to Egypt to investigate the matter. He orders him: > Go and bring thou the true word back to me! Maybe they deceive me! Maybe (in > fact) they do have a son of their lord! In the meantime, Suppiluliuma concludes the siege of Carchemish, then returns to his capital Hattusa for the winter. The following spring his chamberlain and a messenger from Egypt return to him, bringing a further letter of the queen:G√ºterbock, H.G., \\"The Deeds of Suppiluliuma as told by his son, Mursilli II\\", Journal of Cuneiform Studies, 10 (1956) p. 96 > Why didst thou say ‚Äúthey deceive me‚Äù in that way? Had I a son, would I have > written about my own and my country's shame to a foreign land? Thou didst > not believe me and hast even spoke thus to me! He who was my husband has > died. A son I have not! Never shall I take a servant of mine and make him my > husband! I have written to no other country, only to thee have I written! > They say thy sons are many: so give me one son of thine! To me he will be > husband, but to Egypt he will be king.G√ºterbock, H.G., \\"The Deeds of > Suppiluliuma as told by his son, Mursilli II\\", Journal of Cuneiform Studies, > 10 (1956) pp. 96-97 Suppiluliuma however remains suspicious and he tells the Egyptian messenger: > ...You keep asking me for a son of mine (as if it were my) duty. [H]e will > in some way become a hostage, but [king] you will not make him!G√ºterbock, > H.G., \\"The Deeds of Suppiluliuma as told by his son, Mursilli II\\", Journal > of Cuneiform Studies, 10 (1956) p. 97 Nevertheless, after further negotiations with the Egyptian messenger and consultation of an earlier peace treaty between the Hittites and Egypt, Suppiluliuma agrees to send one of his sons to Egypt.G√ºterbock, H.G., \\"The Deeds of Suppiluliuma as told by his son, Mursilli II\\", Journal of Cuneiform Studies, 10 (1956) pp. 97-98 But this prince, named Zannanza, is killed, possibly before he even reaches Egypt.Reeves, C.N., Akhenaten, Egypt's False Prophet (Thames and Hudson, 2001) p. 176 As the annals make clear, the Hittites accuse the Egyptians for this murder: > They spoke thus: \\"The people of Egypt killed Zannanza and brought word: > ‚ÄòZannanza died!‚Äô And when [Suppiluliuma] heard of the slaying of Zannanza, > he began to lament for Zannanza and to the gods he spoke thus: 'Oh gods! I > did no evil, yet the people of Egypt did this to me, and they also attacked > the frontier of my country\\".G√ºterbock, H.G., \\"The Deeds of Suppiluliuma as > told by his son, Mursilli II\\", Journal of Cuneiform Studies, 10 (1956) p. > 108 This leads to recriminations on behalf of Suppiluliuma, who again attacks Amqu, drives the Egyptians from it, and returns with prisoners to Hattusa.Aldred, C., Akhenaten, King of Egypt (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 298 Aftermath Nothing is told of the eventual fate of Dakhamunzu, but the draft for a letter written by Suppiluliumahttps://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/4482/Ay.html&date;=2009-10-25+11:24:47 might shed more light on the matter. This letter is addressed to an unnamed pharaoh, written in response to an earlier letter from this pharaoh to Suppiluliuma. From this correspondence it appears that this pharaoh came to the throne of Egypt at some time before the murder of Zannanza, and that Suppiluliuma seems to have been unaware of this development at the Egyptian court at the time he sent his son there. This new pharaoh might be seen either as a servant to whom Dakhamunzu was married against her own wish or as supplanting her on the throne, depending on the identification of the individuals involved (see below). The deaths of both Suppiluliuma and his immediate successor Arnuwanda II might be seen as an indirect result of the Zannanza affair because both succumbed to a plague brought to Hattusa by the prisoners from Amqu.http://www.hittites.info/history.aspx?text=history%2fEarly+Late+Empire.htm#Arnuwanda2 Identification of the Egyptian protagonists Initially the name Dakhamunzu was believed to be a misreading of Sankhamun, a supposed version of Ankhesenamun, Tutankhamun's widow. However, it has been demonstrated that Dakhamunzu is a Hittite rendering of the Egyptian title ta hemet nesu (the king's wife) instead of the name of a queen. As a consequence Dakhamunzu has variously been identified as either Nefertiti, Meritaten or Ankhesenamun. Nibhururiya, the name of the recently deceased Pharaoh as it is recorded in the annals, has been seen as a rendering of the prenomen of either Akhenaten (Neferkheperure ) or Tutankhamun (Nebkheperure) and the flexibility of the chronology of the period admits both possibilities.Aldred, C., Akhenaten, King of Egypt (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 229 The chronology of events requires that the death of Nibhururiya occurs near the end of Suppiluliuma's lifeMcMurray, W., Towards an Absolute Chronology for Ancient Egypt, p.4 and therefore conventional Egyptian chronology favours Tutankhamun. Linguistic analysis has demonstrated that 'Nib·∏´ururiya' is an accurate rendering of Tutankhamun's throne name Nebkheperure. It is also assumed that the situation at the Egyptian court (i.e. the lack of male royal offspring) fits better with the period after Tutankhamun's death. In this case Dakhamunzu should be identified as Ankhesenamun, while the anonymous pharaoh from Suppiluliuma's draft letter can be identified as Ay, a servant Dakhamunzu did not want to marry. Alternative EgyptianMcMurray, W., Towards an Absolute Chronology for Ancient Egypt, p.5 and table 1 or HittiteMiller, J.L., \\"Amarna Age Chronology and the Identity of Nibhururiya in the Light of a Newly Reconstructed Hittite Text\\", Altorientalische Forschungen, 34 (2007) fig. 1 chronologies based on recorded astronomical phenomena make Akhenaten a more likely candidate for Nibhururiya, although Smenkhkare cannot be entirely ruled out. Comparison between the probable times of death for Akhenaten (after the vintaging of wine, i.e. at the end of September or the start of October) and Tutankhamun (in December, based on floral and faunal evidence from his tomb) with the account found in the Hittite annals (which places the reception of Dakhamunzu's first letter in late autumn) also seems to favour the identification of Nibhururiya with Akhenaten.Reeves, C.N., Akhenaten, Egypt's False Prophet (Thames and Hudson, 2001) pp. 176-177 Further evidence to support this identification might come from one of the Amarna letters which seems to deal with the same military actions against Amqu that are reported in the Hittite annals. Since the Amarna archives seems to have been abandoned and closed by the end of Tutankhamun's reign, the presence of this letter there suggest he cannot have been the recently deceased pharaoh from the annals.Reeves, C.N., Akhenaten, Egypt's False Prophet (Thames and Hudson, 2001) p. 177 The recently proposed identification of an Egyptian official named Armaa, who appears in a Hittite document relating events from Mursili II's regnal years 7 and 9, as Horemheb in his function of viceroy and commander in Asia (i.e. before his ascent to the throne) would also rule out Tutankhamun as possible candidate for Nibhururiya.Miller, J.L., \\"Amarna Age Chronology and the Identity of Nibhururiya in the Light of a Newly Reconstructed Hittite Text\\", Altorientalische Forschungen, 34 (2007) The identification of Nibhururiya as Akhenaten does however complicate the identity of Dakhamunzu because besides his great royal wife Nefertiti, Meritaten seems to have held the title ta hemet nesu in relation to her father as well.McMurray, W., Towards an Absolute Chronology for Ancient Egypt, p.5 in this case the identity of Dakhamunzu is largely depended on the identity of Akhenaten's co-regent and successor. Those who see evidence for a gradually changing role for Nefertiti (from great royal wife, over co-regent to sole ruler after Akhenaten's death) will naturally identify Dakhamunzu as Nefertiti and they see the Zannanza affair as further evidence for Nefertiti's continuing importance in the late-Amarna period. In this case it is believed that, in spite of her changed role at the Egyptian court, to the outside world she would have remained to be known as the king's wifeReeves (2001) p.177 and a parallel is drawn between the Hatshepsut-Tuthmosis III co-rule earlier in the 18th dynasty and a co-regency between Nefertiti and Tutankhamun,Reeves, C.N., Akhenaten, Egypt's False Prophet (Thames and Hudson, 2001) p. 180 the latter king can then be identified as the unnamed pharaoh from Suppiluliuma's letter, supplanting Nefertiti on the Egyptian throne. Other's however maintain that Nefertiti predeceased her husband and they will therefore identify Dakhamunzu/Akhenaten's female co-regent as Meritaten. In this scenario Smenkhare can be identified as the new unnamed pharaoh, who would then be the servant Dakhamunzu was unwilling to marry, although the identification of Smenkhkare as Zannanza is also suggested as a (more unlikely) possibility. In the event that Smenkhkare was Nibhururiya, Meritaten is again identified as Dakhamunzu.

It lies in the northeastern part of the county and has an estimated population of 70.Handbook of Texas Online entry for Carlton History Carlton was founded in 1877 by a man named H.H. Armstrong on land owned by two local settlers; rancher J. M. Evans and Dr. F. M. Carlton, the town's namesake. With growth stimulated by its location on the major area stagecoach line, Carlton prospered through the late 1870s and by 1878 possessed its own school and several churches. In 1879, the post office at nearby Honey Creek was moved to Carlton and renamed for its new location. In 1900 the community had a reported population of just over 160 and several business, including a large cotton gin. The Stephenville North and South Texas Railway part of the historic Cotton Belt Route was built through Carlton in 1907 on its way from nearby Alexander to Hamilton. Carlton reached its peak population of 750 residents by 1910. During this time, two small weekly newspapers had served the area; the Courier, which ran from 1907 to 1909, and the Citizen, which ran 1910-1936. Prosperity came to an end in the 1930s, however. Effects of the boll weevil blight of the 1920s and the Great Depression had dire effect on Carlton. The railroad was abandoned in 1934, and by 1940 the population had fallen to 400. The declining population led to the closing of the Carlton schools in 1969 and by 1980 the reported population had dropped to seventy, a figure it maintained through to the 2000 Census. Education Carlton is served by the Hico Independent School District. Miscellaneous Portions of Carlton's ZIP code: 76436 extend into neighboring areas of Comanche and Erath Counties in Central Texas.

Plot  Andris is a child living in Budapest. He is conceived when his mother Maria is attracted to a mysterious stranger during a performance of The Magic Flute. The stranger disappears after the conception, and as a result Andris does not know his father. The law states that a boy should have his father's name, even if the father is unknown, to avoid the taint of illegitimacy. When Maria tries to register Andris with the child custody department, Andris is given the name of a fictitious father. She enters on Andris' birth certificate the name of the bureaucrat she is dealing with, Antal Orban. Maria dies when she is hit on the head by a falling brick, an accident resulting from being in the wrong place at the wrong time, leaving Andris suddenly motherless. He then goes off in search of his nonexistent father. Along the way he meets and is helped by The Girl, the young nurse who delivered him, and who is alone like Andris. Meanwhile, the kindly Orban becomes tired of the tyrannical bureaucracy, and decides to destroy the files of children he has helped to legitimize by giving them fictitious fathers.

It was Resnais's third feature film, following Hiroshima mon amour (1959) and L'Ann√©e derni√®re √† Marienbad (1961), and in common with those films it explores the challenge of integrating a remembered or imagined past with the life of the present. It also makes oblique reference to the controversial subject of the Algerian War, which had recently been brought to an end. Muriel was Resnais's second collaboration with Jean Cayrol, who had also written the screenplay of Nuit et brouillard (Night and Fog) (1955). Plot H√©l√®ne, a widow who runs an antique business from her own apartment in Boulogne-sur-Mer, is visited by a past lover, Alphonse. Her stepson, Bernard, is tormented by the memory of a girl named Muriel whom he has participated in torturing while doing military service in Algeria. The story takes place over 15 days in September‚ÄìOctober 1962. (The screenplay provides specific dates and times for each scene, but these are not apparent in the film.) An extended sequence takes place on the first day (a section lasting about 45 minutes: the introductions of Alphonse and his 'niece' Fran√ßoise to H√©l√®ne and Bernard, and their first meal together). Another long sequence takes place on the last day (the Sunday lunch and its revelations, and the scattering of the principal characters in their different directions). The intervening days are represented in a series of fragmented scenes, which are chronological but seldom consecutive, and the passage of time is blurred. Cast * Delphine Seyrig, as H√©l√®ne Aughain, a widowed antique dealer, about 40 years old, who retains obsessive memories of her love affair with Alphonse when she was 16, and the unexplained manner of their separation in 1939. * Jean-Pierre K√©rien, as Alphonse Noyard, H√©l√®ne's sometime lover, who says he has spent many of the intervening years in Algeria running a bar. * Nita Klein, as Fran√ßoise, an aspiring young actress having an affair with the much older Alphonse, and biding her time before leaving him. * Jean-Baptiste Thierr√©e, as Bernard, H√©l√®ne's stepson, recently returned from doing his military service in Algeria where his role in the torture of a girl called Muriel has left him with traumatic memories. * Martine Vatel, as Marie-Do, the intermittent girl-friend of Bernard who is ready to set off for a new life in South America. * Claude Sainval, as Roland de Smoke, a Boulogne property- developer and amorous friend of H√©l√®ne. * Laurence Badie, as Claudie, a friend of H√©l√®ne with whom she shares a taste for gambling. * Jean Champion, as Ernest, the brother-in-law of Alphonse. * Philippe Laudenbach, as Robert, a fellow-soldier with Bernard in Algeria, now an active member of the OAS. * Fran√ßoise Bertin, as Simone * Jean Dast√©, as the man with a goat, who has returned from Australia. Production Alain Resnais and Jean Cayrol first discussed the project of Muriel in 1959. They developed the script while Resnais was working on L'Ann√©e derni√®re √† Marienbad as well as on two other (uncompleted) projects relating to the then contentious topic of the war in Algeria.Interview with Fran√ßois Thomas, included with Arte DVD of Muriel (2004). Cayrol, though primarily a poet and novelist, was himself interested in film-making and editing, and he produced a screenplay for Muriel in which nearly all of the complex editing sequences were outlined.James Monaco, Alain Resnais: the r√¥le of imagination. (London: Secker & Warburg, 1978.) p.74. Filming took place between November 1962 and January 1963. Location shooting was done in Boulogne-sur-Mer, which is almost another character in the film, a town whose centre has seen rapid rebuilding after extensive war damage and which is presented as both ancient and modern, uncertainly balanced between its past and future.Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais, arpenteur de l'imaginaire. (Paris: Ramsay, 2008.) p.109. The scenes in H√©l√®ne's apartment where most of the action takes place were filmed on a set at Studios Dumont in √âpinay, but Resnais asked the designer Jacques Saulnier to reconstruct exactly a real apartment which he had seen in Boulogne, even down to the colour of the woodwork.James Monaco, Alain Resnais: the r√¥le of imagination. (London: Secker & Warburg, 1978.) p.90. The d√©cor of the apartment is modern but, because of H√©l√®ne's business as an antique dealer, it is full of furniture of different styles and periods which continually change through the film. Resnais explained his intentions: \\"We used everything that could give this impression of incompleteness, of unease. ...The challenge of the film was to film in colour, that was essential, never to move the camera position, to film a week behind the [time of the] scenario, to invent nothing, and to do nothing to make it prettier\\".Suzanne-Liandrat-Guigues & Jean-Louis Leutrat, Alain Resnais: liaisons secr√®tes, accords vagabonds. (Paris: Cahiers du Cin√©ma, 2006.) p.225. \\"Tout ce qui pouvait donner cette impression d'inach√®vement, de malaise, a √©t√© utilis√©. ...La gageure du film c'√©tait: on tourne en couleurs, c'est essentiel, on ne bouge jamais le pied de la cam√©ra, on tourne avec huit jours de retard sur le sc√©nario, on n'invente rien et on ne fait rien pour que cela fasse plus joli.\\" Filming lasted for 12 or 13 weeks, the longest shooting time of any of Resnais's films. According to Resnais, there were around 800 shots in the film instead of the usual 450; the many static camera set-ups were time-consuming; and it was only in the final shot of the film that the camera moved.Suzanne-Liandrat-Guigues & Jean-Louis Leutrat, Alain Resnais: liaisons secr√®tes, accords vagabonds. (Paris: Cahiers du Cin√©ma, 2006.) p.225. Music for the film was written by Hans Werner Henze who picked up the visual principle of multiple fixed camera shots by adopting a musical style which mirrored the fragmentation of the film structure.Fran√ßois Thomas, L'Atelier de Alain Resnais. (Paris: Flammarion, 1989.) p.258. A series of verses, by Cayrol, are sung throughout the film (by Rita Streich); the relative lack of clarity of the words on the soundtrack was attributed by Resnais to the effect of having a German composer (who at the time did not speak French) setting French words.Fran√ßois Thomas, L'Atelier de Alain Resnais. (Paris: Flammarion, 1989.) p.274. The full words of the verses are included in the published screenplay of the film.Jean Cayrol, Muriel: sc√©nario et dialogues. (Paris: Seuil, 1963.) The song \\"D√©ja\\", with words about the passing of time, which is sung unaccompanied by the character of Ernest near the end of the film, was written for a musical review in 1928 by Paul Colline and Paul Maye. It was one of several elements in the film which were prompted by Resnais's interest in \\"music-hall\\" and the theatre. Themes At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival in 1963, Resnais said that his film depicted \\"the malaise of a so-called happy society. ...A new world is taking shape, my characters are afraid of it, and they don't know how to face up to it.\\"Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais, arpenteur de l'imaginaire. (Paris: Ramsay, 2008.) pp.110-111. \\"...le malaise d'une les civilisation dite du bonheur. ...Un nouveau monde se forme, mes personnages en ont peur, et ils ne savent pas y faire face.\\" Muriel has been seen as part of a 'cinema of alienation' of the 1960s, films which \\"betray a sudden desperate nostalgia for certain essential values\\".Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais, arpenteur de l'imaginaire. (Paris: Ramsay, 2008.) p.107. \\"Autant dire que les films trahissent une nostalgie soudaine, d√©sesper√©e de certaines valeurs essentielles...\\" A sense of disruption and uncertainty is constantly emphasised, not least by the style of jump-cutting between events. \\"The technique of observing absolute chronology while simultaneously following a number of characters and treating even casual passers-by in the same manner as the main characters gives rise to a hallucinatory realism.\\"Roy Armes, French Cinema. (London: Secker & Warburg, 1985.) pp.206-207. At the centre of the film lies the specific theme of the Algerian war, which had only recently been brought to its troubled conclusion, and which it had hitherto been almost impossible for French film-makers to address in a meaningful way. (Godard's film about the war, Le Petit Soldat, had been banned in France in 1960 and was not shown until 1963. Also in 1960, Resnais had been one of the signatories of the Manifesto of the 121, in which a group of intellectuals had declared opposition to the French government's military policy in Algeria.) At the midpoint of Muriel, a sequence of newsreel with Bernard's voiceover commentary presents the inescapable 'evidence' of an incident of torture which continually haunts Bernard and explains his obsession with the girl he calls Muriel. This \\"moment of truth\\" which has not been confronted is echoed in different forms in the past lives of each of the other main characters.Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais, arpenteur de l'imaginaire. (Paris: Ramsay, 2008.) p.112. H√©l√®ne has been unable to overcome her sense of loss and betrayal from a past love affair; H√©l√®ne, Alphonse and Bernard all carry troubled memories of having lived through and survived World War II; and Boulogne itself presents the image of a town uneasily rebuilding itself over the devastation that it suffered in that war. H√©l√®ne's apartment, with its half-finished d√©cor and ever-shifting furniture, and seen by the camera only as a disjointed collection of spaces until the film's final shot, offers a metaphor for the traumatised brain which is unable to put itself in order and see itself whole. Reception The film was first presented in Paris on 24 July 1963, and it was then shown at the Venice Film Festival in September 1963. It was for the most part very badly received by both the press and the public. Resnais observed later that it had been his most expensive film to make and the one which had drawn perhaps the smallest audiences.Suzanne-Liandrat-Guigues & Jean-Louis Leutrat, Alain Resnais: liaisons secr√®tes, accords vagabonds. (Paris: Cahiers du Cin√©ma, 2006.) p.225. \\"C'est mon film le plus cher et qui a peut-√™tre le moins de spectateurs. Il a √©t√© tr√®s mal re√ßu par le presse et les gens ne sont pas venus de tout.\\" He also noted the paradox that it had subsequently become almost a cult film, attributing its difficulties for the public to the fact that its principal characters were people who continually made mistakes, which created a sense of unease.Suzanne-Liandrat-Guigues & Jean-Louis Leutrat, Alain Resnais: liaisons secr√®tes, accords vagabonds. (Paris: Cahiers du Cin√©ma, 2006.) p.226. \\"Les films o√π les h√©ros ne r√©ussissent pas... je crois que c'est un ressort dramatique qui n'attire pas... Alphonse, ou H√©l√®ne, ou Bernard sont des gens qui ne cessent de faire des erreurs et cela cr√©e un malaise.\\" It nevertheless drew much attention from French film-makers and critics. Fran√ßois Truffaut, writing about the film in 1964, acknowledged its demanding nature but castigated critics for failing to engage with its core elements. \\"Muriel is an archetypically simple film. It is the story of several people who start each sentence with 'I...'.\\" Truffaut also drew attention to the film's many allusions to Alfred Hitchcock (including the life-size cut-out of the director outside a restaurant); \\"his 'in-depth influence on many levels ... makes Muriel ... one of the most effective tributes ever rendered the 'master of suspense'\\".Fran√ßois Truffaut, The Films in My Life. (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1978.) pp.327-328. The critic Jean-Andr√© Fieschi also made a connection with Hitchcock: \\"So we have a thriller, but a thriller where the enigma is the intention of the film itself and not its resolution\\".Quoted in the booklet accompanying the 2009 Eureka DVD (Masters of Cinema) p.36. Henri Langlois was one of several commentators who noted in Muriel a significantly innovative style and tone: \\"Muriel marks the advent of cinematic dodecaphony; Resnais is the Schoenberg of this chamber drama\\".Quoted in the booklet accompanying the 2009 Eureka DVD (Masters of Cinema) p.41. cf. Jacques Rivette: \\"Muriel is one of the first European films in which failure is not somehow sensed as inevitable, which, on the contrary, has a sense of the possible, and opening out on to the future in all its forms\\". (ibid. p.39.) Among English-language reviewers there was much perplexity about Muriel, described by the critic of The New York Times as \\"a very bewildering, annoying film\\".Bosley Crowther, The New York Times, 31 October 1963. The reviewer for The Times (London) shared an initial feeling of distrust and hostility, but admitted that \\"the film's stature increases with a second viewing\\".The Times (London), 19 March 1964, p.19 col.C. This recognition that Muriel benefited from, or required, multiple viewings was something upon which a number of commentators have agreed.E.g. Fran√ßois Truffaut: \\"I have already seen Muriel three times without liking it completely, and maybe not liking the same things each time I saw it. I know that I'll see it again many times.\\" (The Films in My Life. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1978. pp.328.). B. Kite: \\"There's always something else to say about the film. It keeps opening out even in its closing moments...\\" (Essay in the booklet accompanying the 2009 Eureka DVD (Masters of Cinema) p.23.) Susan Sontag, reviewing the film in 1963, deemed Muriel to be \\"the most difficult, by far, of Resnais' [first] three feature films\\", and went on to say that \\"although the story is not difficult to follow, Resnais' techniques for telling it deliberately estrange the viewer from the story\\". She found those techniques to be more literary than cinematic, and linked Resnais's liking for formalism with contemporary trends in new novels in France such as those of Michel Butor. While admiring the film for its intelligence and for the beauty of its visual composition, its performances, and its music, she remained dissatisfied by what she saw as its emotional coldness and detachment.Susan Sontag, \\"Muriel ou le Temps d'un retour\\", in Film Quarterly, vol.17, no.2 (Winter 1963-1964), pp.23-27; reprinted, with amendments, as \\"Resnais' Muriel \\", in S. Sontag, Against Interpretation: and other essays. (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1966.). The appearance of Muriel on DVD led to some reconsideration of its qualities, generally with greater sympathy than on its first appearance.See Rotten Tomatoes on Muriel (retrieved 19 Oct. 2010). Many now rank it among Resnais's major works. The positive view of the film was summarized by Philip French: \\"It's a rich, beautifully acted masterpiece, at once cerebral and emotional, that rewards several viewings and is now less obscure than it seemed at the time\\".The Observer, 29 March 2009. In 2012, the film received four critics' votes and two directors' votes in the British Film Institute's decennial Sight & Sound polls. According to the aggregation site They Shoot Pictures, Don't They, it is the world's 480th most acclaimed film. Awards Delphine Seyrig won a Volpi Cup for best actress at the 1963 Venice Film Festival. The film was nominated for a Golden Lion. Restoration A restored version of the film was released on DVD in France in 2004 by Argos Films/Arte France D√©veloppement from a distorted video master that squeezed the image into a 1.66:1 picture format. A DVD version with English subtitles was issued in the UK in 2009 by Eureka, in the Masters of Cinema series. It uses the same transfer as the 2004 French DVD, but the mastering corrects the image resulting in a picture that fills out a \\"telecinema\\" screen format ratio of 1.78:1. Argos later created a new high-definition scan after Resnais was shown the distorted video master used for the 2004 DVD.

Part of Spain's effort to convert the Native Americans to Catholicism, Santa Catalina served as the provincial headquarters of the Guale mission province. It also served various non-religious functions, such as providing food and labor for the colonial capital of St. Augustine. The mission was located on St. Catherines Island from 1602 to 1680, then on Sapelo Island from 1680 to 1684, and finally on Amelia Island from 1684 to 1702. History The mission Santa Catalina de Guale was founded in 1602 on St. Catherines Island, one of the Sea Islands of the present-day U.S. state of Georgia. It was probably associated with a Guale village known today as the archaeological site \\"Wamassee Head\\", on St. Catherines Island. During the 17th century the Guale people experienced a dramatic population loss, mainly due to epidemic diseases. This resulted in the consolidation of mission settlements. By 1675 the Guale mission village of San Diego de Satuache was incorporated with Santa Catalina de Guale. Likewise the mission villages of Santa Clara de Tupiqui and San Joseph de Sapala were merged. After two major slave raiding attacks in 1680, the Santa Catalina de Guale mission was moved south to Sapelo Island. The attacking force consisted of about 300 Westo Indians who had been armed, supplied, and encouraged to attack Spanish missions by English colonial authorities in South Carolina. Santa Catalina de Guale was the first to fall. Its defenses included a recently built stone fort, 6 Spanish soldiers, and about 40 Christian Indians. Other missions in the region quickly fell to the slave raiders. Relocated to Sapelo Island, the four original mission villages of Tupiqui, Sapala, Satuache, and Santa Catalina were merged in one. Thus the old intervillage hierarchical political system of the Guale chiefdom was lost, although the chiefly lineages associated with each village were retained. As a result, the Santa Catalina de Guale population contained many titular leaders lacking actual roles as village headmen. In 1683 the French pirate Michel de Grammont raided Spanish Florida settlements, including St. Augustine and the Mocama mission province, forcing further southward migrations. In 1684 the Santa Catalina de Guale mission was moved to Amelia Island in present-day Florida. The appearance of other pirates in 1684 prevented the nearby missions of Santo Domingo de Asao and San Buenaventura de Guadalquini from moving south. Both were burned. Their inhabitants fled to the mainland. By 1685 the Guale peoples had either fled inland, joining unconverted groups such as the Yamasee, or had relocated to Amelia Island's three settlement of Santa Catalina de Guale, San Felipe, and Santa Clara de Tupiqui. In 1702, during Queen Anne's War, the English colonial governor of South Carolina, James Moore, launched an invasion of Spanish Florida. In the process the settlements on Amelia Island, including Santa Catalina de Guale, were destroyed. The surviving inhabitants who remained under the Spanish mission system moved to the vicinity of St. Augustine.

Both stories take place in the fictional land of Sartorias-deles, a fantasy world Smith has written about since her youth. The first book follows the adventures of young Countess Meliara \\"Mel\\" Astiar of Tlanth as she and her small group of forces rebel against the greed of King Galdran; along the way the mysterious Marquis of Shevraeth aids her, though she distrusts him. With the king now dead, the second part focuses on Mel's journey to the court in Remalna-city, where she must navigate court intrigues surrounding Shevraeth's rise to power as king. In 2008 Smith also published a prequel about Shevraeth: A Stranger to Command. Smith invented Sartorias-deles as a fantasy world that gradually became populated by humans over a number of centuries; these new arrivals were influenced by the world's indigenous beings enough to better themselves, largely eradicating societal problems like disease and overpopulation. She originally wrote Crown Duel as a twenty-year- old, and when she returned to rewrite the story later in life, she sought to maintain the story from Mel's young perspective. As a result, the novel's intended audience are young adults. As Smith's most popular YA novel, both parts of Crown Duel received generally positive reviews. Reviews of the 1997 publication of Crown Duel highlight the character of Mel and Smith's worldbuilding as positive elements. Critics assessed Court Duel as generally the lesser of the two. Background and development While Sherwood Smith originally wrote Crown Duel as two separate books entitled Crown Duel (1997) and Court Duel (1998), she considered them as \\"one story.\\" Both novels explore the fictional land of Sartorias-deles, the world she has been writing about since her youth. Smith grew up wondering why \\"[her surroundings were] the way [they were]\\" for instance observing, \\"Why were the cities so clean, I wondered when I was a kid. I knew about sewers, etc. Why is it safe to drink from a stream there, and not here?\\". She conceived Sartorias-deles as a world where, over the course of several centuries, humans of many different races entered through \\"worldgates\\" and were influenced by the culture of its indigenous beings. According to Smith, while her invented world was not perfect, it contains fewer problems than Earth has endured, such as disease and overpopulation. She wrote, > \\"basically, the indigenous life forms, appalled by these things that came > through and started multiplying and spreading out, carrying their diseases > and wars, tried to fix things for the humans ... Their history is not all > happy, it's very strange, and humans still have many human problems, but in > other ways they are somewhat different from [Earth].\\" According to Smith, Sartorias-deles most resembles New Zealand. Smith's stories set in the world of Sartorias-deles have \\"focuse[d on] a generation of kids with remarkable abilities who are born into extraordinary times.\\" Meliara (\\"Mel\\") is the protagonist of Crown Duel, which is set in the fictional country of Remalna. Remalna's human population lives alongside the mysterious Hill Folk, sentient beings that reside in the land's forests and with whom Mel has a special affinity. Smith wrote the first part as a twenty-year-old, and sought to keep it set in Mel's teenage point of view when typing it out as someone older than forty. Smith describes the stories' primary audience as \\"middle grade or YA, because I was young and writing from the kid's eye view.\\" At the same time, she made some changes to the original story based on her experience, such as providing motivations for the adult characters and \\"nail[ing] down place and time more thoroughly than I did.\\" When Smith learned as a teenager that \\"anyone could write a book,\\" she tried to write stories that would please potential publishers, as she assumed that they would never approve of \\"real stuff\\" like Crown Duel. Several decades before Crown Duels release, Smith \\"began the laborious process of consolidating\\" her notes on Sartorias-deles. As part of her development of the novel, she drew inspiration from European history; for example, details like the novel's fan language and changing fashions were inspired by the fashions at the Palace of Versailles court of Louis XIV of France. Synopsis=Part One ‚Äì Crown Duel The novel begins in the fictional country of Remalna in Sartorias-deles, where seventeen-year-old Countess Meliara \\"Mel\\" Astiar of Tlanth makes an oath to her dying father. She swears in that oath that she and her older brother Count Branaric \\"Bran\\" (21) will defend their people from the growing greed of King Galdran. Galdran covets the Tlanth lands for his cruel cousin, Baron Nenthar Debegri, and also seeks to break the Covenant ‚Äì an ancient pact between humans and the Hill Folk ‚Äì by resuming the harvest of their valuable \\"colorwoods\\". When Mel and Bran learn of these plans, they feel compelled to fulfill their promise and enter into a war ill-prepared and severely outnumbered. Debegri attempts to subdue Tlanth under the pretense of unpaid taxes and for conspiring to break the Covenant. Mel and Bran and their small group of forces ‚Äì mostly farmers and tradespeople ‚Äì initially succeed at foiling Debegari with guerilla tactics, such as blockading a stream to flood the enemy's camp. However, the war changes for the worse when the capable Marquis of Shevraeth (25), the heir to the nearby principality of Renselaeus, takes command from Debegari. Shevraeth soon captures Mel and takes her to the capitol of Remalna- city, imprisoning her. Shevraeth tells her that the king orders her to surrender Tlanth's forces or face execution. Mel refuses, and soon escapes imprisonment with the help of their family spy, Azmus. Mel tries to return to Tlanth, with Debegri, Shevraeth and (ostensibly) his cousin the Duke of Savona in pursuit. Along the way people of the countryside assist her, but Debegri eventually captures Mel, furious about the months of trouble she caused. Taken to Debegri's nearby fortress to be tortured, Shevraeth unexpectedly frees her and takes her to Renselaeus where she finds Bran. Shevraeth and his father reveal that they had been secretly fighting Galdran for years, wish to form an alliance with the Astiars, and plan for Shevraeth to take the throne. However, Mel refuses their help still deeply distrustful of Shevraeth and thinking of the promise made by Bran herself to their father: to become Remalna's rulers. Mel also thinks of Shevraeth as insincere, having been taught by her father to distrust of anyone who resides at court. On the journey back to Tlanth, unknown forces assault Mel and Bran, and, believing her brother dead, Mel escapes to continue on alone. She thinks that Shevraeth betrayed her, and begins rallying her forces to attack him. Recognizing the misunderstanding, Shevraeth responds by using hostages to force Mel to surrender and brings her to her brother, injured but alive. Soon Shevraeth openly opposes King Galdran, and accompanies the Astiars to fight the royal forces. They kill Galdran, ending the war and creating opportunity for a change in power in Remalna. Bran, who has gradually befriended Shevraeth, goes to court with him while Mel returns to Tlanth. Part Two ‚Äì Court Duel Victorious after defeating the King in the war, Meliara returns to Tlanth to improve its dilapidated castle with the family's new riches. One day, Bran visits her, accompanied by his new fianc√© Lady Nimiar Argaliar and the Marquis of Shevraeth, who is preparing to take the throne of Remalna. Now accustomed to the fine fashions of court, Bran expresses dismay at finding Mel dressed in old clothes - she never before cared about her appearance. Mel becomes shy and embarrassed about her lack of courtly finesse and grace, and avoids the visitors, especially Shevraeth, who she fears looks down on her. Nimiar convinces Mel to return with them to court, and begins to teach her the essential of life there, including its customs, clothing styles, and hand fan language. Once in Remalna-city, Mel finds herself popular in part because of her now legendary rebellion against the unpopular King Galdran. She acquires many male admirers, and is friendly but dismissive towards their romantic attentions. Mel avoids Shevraeth when possible, though when she often unexpectedly encounters him, Mel fights to remain cordial while he remains inscrutable but polite. Meanwhile, Galdran's sister, the Marquise of Merindar, attempts to manipulate Mel into distracting Shevraeth from her covert plans to take the throne for herself, though this is largely unsuccessful. While at court, Mel begins exchanging letters and tokens with a secret admirer. She gradually opens up her feelings of ignorance and being out of her depth at court; they also discuss court politics and academic subjects, with her admirer offering advice and encouragement about her growing knowledge. Meanwhile, Mel meets Merindar's reclusive son Flauvic and pursues a brief relationship with him before realizing that she has no real feelings for him. Through this relationship experience, she begins to realize her exchange of letters has become a courtship, though she does not know her admirer's identity. Mel learns from her spy Azmus that northern mercenaries have been seen near the border ‚Äì allies of the Marquise of Merindar ‚Äì and that other allied forces are planning on eradicating the Hill Folk to take their colorwoods for payment. Mel sends Azmus to tell Shevraeth and rides out to warn the Hill Folk, but is shocked to encounter Shevraeth already on the road. Initially, he assumes she is plotting with Merindar against him, but lets her go when she tells him about the plans against the Hill Folk. An outnumbered Mel bravely tries to stop a group of mercenaries marching towards nearby forests, and is only saved by forces sent by Shevraeth. The Hill Folk now safe, Mel returns to Shevraeth, where she learns that he successfully put down Merindar's revolt. She also learns that he has been her secret admirer. After finally calling him by his first name, Vidanric, they kiss. The two return to Remalna-city, and find that Flauvic has secretly bewitched the entire capitol. As Flauvic prepares to complete his victory, the Hill Folk come to Mel's rescue and turn him into a tree. With the realm now secure, Shevraeth and Mel marry and are crowned as king and queen. Style and genre Crown Duel has been labeled a coming-of-age story. According to The ALAN Review, Mel's \\"journey from captivity to freedom parallels her coming of age,\\" in which she \\"comes to realize that she has led a very sheltered life and that people are often not what they seem.\\" This teenage perspective affects how the reader views the novel's events ‚Äì Smith has commented that if she \\"see[s] a story from a kid's eye view, then what shapes that story is how kids look at the world.\\" In Brigham Young University's Children's Book and Play Review, Leah Hanson wrote that as a result, \\"we view the happenings at court with her same confusion and suspicion.\\" Writing for the same publication, Lillian H. Heil added that \\"the reader learns to expect that she will plunge into every situation with minimal thought about the consequences.\\" Crown Duel deviates from the typical rebellion story by treating its success as another problem to be dealt with. Comparing this to the George Orwell story Animal Farm, Leigh Kimmel wrote that by defeating \\"the wicked king at midpoint, the second half involv[es] court intrigues of the provisional government as the next king is decided upon,\\" thus increasing the challenges for the protagonist. Rather than face armies and weapons, Mel must contend with a court where \\"war is just as intense and bewildering as on the battlefield--except swords have been traded for fans and armor discarded for elaborate dresses.\\" Publication In the United States, Harcourt published Crown Duel in April 1997, and followed it with a sequel, Court Duel, in March of the following year. According to Smith, this split was made because her original novel was \\"already 'too long' for production costs.\\" Firebird Books combined the two into one edition, also entitled Crown Duel, in 2002. Rich Horton, writing in Locus magazine, attributes this republication to the growing popularity of YA fantasy, as writers and publishers observed the success of Harry Potter and other fantasy stories. In 2008, Smith released a prequel to Crown Duel entitled A Stranger to Command, which follows the Marquis of Shevraeth's early life learning military command. In 2010, Book View Cafe released another edition of Crown Duel as an e-book, which combined the two main stories in tandem with a new short story entitled \\"Vidanric's Birthday Surprise,\\" in addition to six scenes from Vidanric's point of view. Reception Jim C. Hines, co-editor of the fantasy anthology Heroes in Training, considers the combined volume of Crown Duel to be Smith's most popular YA book. Reviews for the first 1997 edition of Crown Duel have been generally positive, with reviewers highlighting Smith's worldbuilding ability and Mel's worthiness as a protagonist. Booklist reviewer Carolyn Phelan stated that Smith \\"tells a fast-moving tale of adventure, intrigue, and honor, with Mel a likable heroine and a lively narrator.\\" Phelan added that \\"characters and setting are well realized, but the novel seems plot driven from its midpoint almost to the book's end.\\" Lillian H. Heil of Brigham Young University also found favor with the novel's heroine, noting in her review that Mel's \\"fortitude in the face of enormous difficulties, her willingness to admit her mistakes, and her concern for others make her an appealing, if stubborn, young woman.\\" Author Jo Walton, contributing to Tor.com, wrote that the first book \\"has a fairly predictable plot,\\" but a \\"terrific YA heroine\\" redeems its flaws. Walton thought that the story drew strength from its teenage perspective, because \\"we get immersed in the world and the problems of the world and see [Mel] grow up from the inside, in the best traditions of YA fiction.\\" R√©ception du Grand Cond√© √† Versailles by Jean- L√©on G√©r√¥me, 1878; Mel's coming to court was deemed similar to that of a \\"stranger coming to Versailles\\" (pictured) by Jo Walton. In another review of the first book, Publishers Weekly noted that Smith \\"create[s] a fantasy world fit for the most discriminating medieval partisan. It cleverly walks just this side of parody, getting away with lines like, 'I wished I could personally flout him and his busy searchers, and make him look the fool he was.'\\" In a similar vein, Kirkus Reviews praised the first novel as \\"Smith's lush descriptions evoke a fantastic yet credible world, where magic spells and enchanted stones are everyday facts of life.\\" M. Jean Greenlaw, contributing to The ALAN Review, lauded Smith for her \\"language and imagery\\" as well as \\"her deft plotting [to] keep the reader glued to the pages.\\" Writing for the School Library Journal, Patricia Lothrop-Green, however, gave a largely negative review to the first part, highlighting \\"huge logical leaps,\\" an \\"utterly predictable plot,\\" and a heroine whom \\"many readers will be thoroughly tired of\\" by the end of the story. Reviewers generally have found less to favor in Smith's second book, Court Duel, though reviews have still been mainly positive. It was noted by Carolyn Phelan of Booklist to be \\"different in setting, structure, and tone\\" from its predecessor, who added that \\"readers who loved Crown Duel for its strongly realized fantasy world, adventurous characters, and scenes of action may find the sequel disappointing,\\" though she found Meliara to be \\"as compelling as ever.\\" Ruth Cox of Emergency Librarian observed \\"a flicker of the love/hate relationship often found in adult romance novels between Meliara and Shevraeth.\\" Contributing to Brigham Young's Children's Book and Play Review, Leah Hanson called the second part \\"fast paced and intriguing,\\" and said it could \\"stand on its own as an enthralling story.\\" Jo Walton believed that the second story's changing fashions and fan customs were \\"done very well,\\" and added that the court's culture of terror felt real. She opined that \\"Mel's eruption into their midst has in it something of the stranger coming to Versailles, and it's fascinating,\\" but called \\"Mel's continued obliviousness to the identity of her mysterious Unknown correspondent\\" \\"slightly implausible.\\" Walton concluded that the combined volume Crown Duel is \\"a charming book with a solid background and a great first person voice. Give it to your twelve year old friends, and read it with your inner twelve-year-old eyes.\\" The publication Voice of Youth Advocates included Crown Duel in its list of \\"fantasy for people who don't like fantasy,\\" and wrote that the novel \\"ha[s] few fantastical creatures, and readers will relate easily to the main characters.\\" References=Works cited  Category:1997 American novels Category:1998 American novels Category:1997 fantasy novels Category:1998 fantasy novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:Novels by Sherwood Smith Category:Young adult fantasy novels Category:American young adult novels ","title":"Crown Duel"},{"id":"12768921","text":"Ascott is a village in Warwickshire, England.

The station is currently owned by William Marc Graham, through licensee 2B Productions, LLC Sports coverage on the station includes Catawba College football and men's and women's basketball, area high school sports, the Carolina Panthers of the NFL, and American Legion baseball. History WSAT was Salisbury's second radio station, signing on April 25, 1948, on 1280 kHz with 1 KW power (daytime). It was owned by Mid-Carolina Broadcasting Company. Harry Welch, Sr. took over as general manager in 1953, and for nearly 50 years WSAT was run by someone from the Welch family. It was once known as \\"The Family Station\\". Past personalities include Grady Cole, Russ McIntyre, and Bob Mason. Mike Moore, at age 13 in July 1960, began his radio career hosting a \\"top tunes\\" show. Moore, now running WLOE/WMYN, continued to work at WSAT until 1966. He believed he was the youngest person working in radio at that time.\\"Lumber Liquidators Open,\\" Salisbury Post, August 22. 2010. Because WAYS could not be heard in Salisbury at night, WSAT started playing Top 40 at night in the late 1960s. In the 1990s WSAT broadcast an oldies format in the morning, nostalgia/big band and easy listening during the midday hours, and ESPN Radio in the late afternoon. The station was also an affiliate for Atlanta Braves baseball broadcasts. Former WSAT personality Buddy Poole, hired as a South Rowan High School junior by Harry Welch, Sr. in 1964, bought the station in 2002 from Charles Welch and changed the station to the current format.\\"Poole Comes for a Hot Dog, Leaves with a Radio Station,\\" Salisbury Post, June 29, 2002. For four years, the station used the Memories format until that format was discontinued by its syndicator ABC Radio Networks in 2006. Until 2015, most of the station's music came from the Dial Global adult standards format that used the on-air brand \\"America's Best Music\\". In 2004, WSAT added the Carolina Panthers after requests from people who had trouble hearing the games on WBT, which was the only station in the area airing them. In 2014, CAP Communications, Inc. announced the sale of WSAT to Catawba College Foundation for $600,000. Programming will not change and Poole will continue to run the station, while students at the college will get broadcasting experience. About 23,000 people were listening to the station at the time. The sale was eventually consummated on September 9, 2014 as a license assignment to 2B Productions, LLC. 2B's sole shareholder, William Marc Graham, is an alumnus of Catawba. 2B Productions also bought WSTP, which signed off in 2016. For several years ending in 2015, the station also aired The Huckabee Report, which was hosted by former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and is the successor program to Paul Harvey's long-running News and Comment program, which the station also aired. In December 2015, it was announced that 2B Productions would be buying WTIX (which became WEGO October 10, 2018) in Concord. WTIX would simulcast the oldies format of WSAT, with local news, sports and information for an area that will also include Concord and Kannapolis. 2B Productions will change its name to Rowan-Cabarrus Radio.

British Speedway Who's Who. is a former Australian motorcycle speedway rider and a four time South Australian Champion. Currently he is riding in the Australian season at his home track of Gillman Speedway in Adelaide, and finished second in the 2012/13 South Australian Championship behind reigning champion and Speedway Grand Prix rider, Troy Batchelor. Shane Parker holds one of the unluckiest records in Australian speedway, having been the runner-up in the South Australian title on seven occasions during his career. Parker retired from riding in 2014. Career=Australia Parker attended LeFevre High School in the Adelaide suburb of Semaphore South, and started in speedway at the Under-16 Sidewinders Speedway in Wingfield in the early 1980s. He won the South Australian Under-16 Championships in 1983 and 1984 and went on to win the Australian Under-16 Championship in 1985 at Sidewinders (defeating Leigh Adams), and finish third in 1986 at the Olympic Park Speedway in Mildura, before turning 16 and graduating into the senior ranks. In his home country of Australia Parker has been a successful rider winning the South Australian Championship four times (1991, 1994, 2001 and 2002), though he has unluckily been runner-up on seven occasions. He also sits one behind Mark Fiora's record for winning the SA title at the most tracks, with Fiora winning at four tracks and Parker at three. Shane Parker made his senior debut at the North Arm Speedway on 4 May 1986 riding an older 2 valve bike which was all his father could afford to buy. He showed his style by winning his first ever race, only 1.37 seconds outside of Phil Crump's 4 lap record. Three years later Parker finished 3rd in the South Australian Championship at North Arm, finishing behind Craig Hodgson who won his 4th championship, and defending champion Mark Fiora, just missing out on a place in the Australian Championship at the Newcastle Motordrome. He defeated Ashley Norton in a runoff to finish in third place in the 1988/89 SA title. Parker won his first South Australian Championship at the Riverview Speedway in Murray Bridge on 29 December 1990 (counted as the 1991 championship) with a 15-point maximum, finishing 4 points clear of Damon Richardson and Brett Tomkins. He then went on to finish in 9th place at the Australian Championship in Alice Springs. Finishing with 8 points, he was robbed of the chance to finish fourth outright when his engine failed half a lap from home while leading his final heat from eventual fourth placed David Cheshire. Had Parker won and Cheshire finished second, Parker would have finished fourth outright on 11 points, one point clear of the Western Australian. Following the 1991 Australian title, Parker was suspended from riding on 14 February at an Auto Cycle Union (ACU) of NSW Disciplinary Meeting in Sydney and fined A$1,000 as a result of riding in the Johnnie Hoskins Trophy meeting at the Newcastle Motordrome New Year's Day when it was discovered that he did not have a 1991 FIM racing licence. A maximum ban of two years was rumoured as had he crashed and been injured the insurance covering the meeting would have been invalid. However a solicitor representing him successfully argued that as speedway riding was Parker's main source of income he would be deprived of his chance to earn a living with the longer ban and he was suspended until 1 April instead. Unfortunately for Parker the ban kept him out of Adelaide's biggest international meeting for the season, the West End Speedway International held at the Wayville Showground which was held just two days after the hearing. After finishing runner up to Craig Hodgson in the 1992 South Australian Championship at North Arm, Shane Parker produced his best result in the Australian Solo Championship in 1992 when he was runner-up to Mildura rider Leigh Adams at North Arm. Parker was the only rider to defeat Adams on the night when they clashed in Heat 5, his win robbing the 20-year-old Adams of finishing the night with a perfect score from his five rides. Parker would score a total of 13 points, one behind Adams (who won the first of what would be a record 10 Australian Championships), and two points clear of Queensland's Mark Carlson who finished third. Parker, who had lost his opening heat to twice former national champion Glenn Doyle, won his next three rides and went into his last ride of the meeting (heat 19) needing to win to finish on 14 points to force a run-off with Adams, but could only finish second behind Queensland rider Tony Langdon. Parker finished in third place in the 1990 Australian Under-21 Championship behind Leigh Adams and fellow South Australian Shane Bowes at Renmark's Riverland Speedway, and runner up to Adams in the 1991 Australian Under-21 Championship held at the Olympic Park Speedway, the last time he was eligible for the U/21 title. His 1991 U/21 title was hampered by bike problems forcing him to race on a bike borrowed from Australian U/16 Champion Ryan Sullivan. While he rode well, he did not have the outright speed to challenge Adams. After winning his second SA Championship at North Arm in 1994, he failed to place in the Australian Championship Final in Mildura. In 1995, Parker finished 5th in the Australian Championship in Gosford which saw him qualify for the Overseas Final in Coventry, England. At the Overseas Final he finished in 8th place (after winning a runoff with American's Chris Manchester and Charles Ermolenko) to progress to the Intercontinental Final in Norway. There he would again impress by finishing a fine 7th place to just miss a place in the Challenge Round which was qualification to the 1996 Speedway Grand Prix World Championship series. Parker finished second to Ryan Sullivan in the 1996 SA Championship at North Arm before going on to finish 10th in the 1996 Australian Championship at the Newcastle Showgrounds. He again finished second to Sullivan in the 1997 SA title and went on to finish 6th in the Australian Championship at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. In the 1998 Aussie title in Murray Bridge, Parker finished in 9th place. His next ride in the Australian Championship came in 2001 at Murray Bridge when he finished 5th to qualify for the Overseas Final in Poole, England where he would finish in 14th place. That year he had won his third South Australian championship at the new Gillman Speedway (which had replaced North Arm when it closed in 1997), and backed up to win his fourth state title at Gillman in 2002. Great Britain and Europe Shane Parker started riding overseas in 1990 at the age of 20. He raced for Elite League team the Ipswich Witches who he would win the Elite League Fours in 1991. He won the Scottish Open Championship in 1996, was the Elite League KO Cup Winner in 2001 with the Peterborough Panthers and the Premier League Pairs Winner in both 2005 and 2006 while riding for the Glasgow Tigers. In Europe Parker rode for teams in Poland and Sweden. He won the European Speedway Club Champions' Cup as part of Polish team Polonia Bydgoszcz in 1999 and was Swedish Div II Champion with Piraterna in 2003. International After finishing second in the 1992 Australian Solo Championship, Parker went on to finish 11th in the Commonwealth Final at Kings Lynn, England, which saw him qualify for the Overseas Final at the Brandon Stadium in Coventry. The top 9 riders at the meeting would progress on to the Intercontinental Final. Parker finished the Overseas Final in 11th place with 7 points from his 5 rides. Parker represented Australia in the Speedway World Pairs Championship Final in 1992 held in Lonigo, Italy. Parker, riding as backup to Craig Boyce and Leigh Adams scored 1 point in one ride as Australia finished in 7th and last place.Oakes, P.(2006). Speedway Star Almanac. Parker finished in 5th place in the 1990 Under-21 World Championship in Lviv, Russia, and improved to 4th place in 1991 in Coventry. Parker also represented Australia in various \\"Test Matches\\" against visiting overseas teams or all-star lineups during the Australian domestic seasons which generally runs from October to March, as well as test matches in England and Europe. Return to Australia In October 2010, Shane Parker confirmed that 2011 would be his last season riding in the British leagues before he moves back to Adelaide with his family and would race full- time at Adelaide's Gillman Speedway. Parker also confirmed his intentions to race in the 2012 Australian Solo Championship, though he eventually did not participate, only competing in the South Australian Championship where he finished second to reigning Australian champion Troy Batchelor. The 2012 SA title at Gillman was the first time he had contested the championship since finishing runner up in 2004 behind Rory Schlein. Parker completed a successful return home to Adelaide for 2012-13 when he won the Gillman Speedway Division 1 Solo Championship on 2 February 2013. Only beaten in his first ride of the night, veteran Parker, still a favourite of the Adelaide crowd after some 27 years of senior racing, showed the younger riders the way around the long track, top scoring in the heats, and after grabbing the lead from the start, easily won the four lap final from local rider Robert Branford, with newly crowned Australian Under-21 champion, 16-year-old Max Fricke finishing third, and Justin Sedgemen from Mildura finishing fourth.2013 CBS Bins Gillman Solo Championship Parker backed this up by winning the 2014 Gillman Championship from Victorian riders Justin Sedgemen and Max Fricke. While still racing in the 2013-14 season, Parker also finds himself back where he began at the Sidewinders Speedway helping with junior rider development. He also conducts junior coaching clinics at other speedways around Australia, including Gillman and the Pinjar Park Speedway located near the Barbagallo Raceway north of Perth.

This large bonfire burned on the Texas A&M; University campus annually from 1909 until 1999. Since 2003, an unofficial version, known as Student Bonfire, has been burned off campus. The Aggie Bonfire leadership is responsible for safely managing the large number of student participants. Leaders are generally identified by the color of their \\"pots\\" (hard hats). History Since 1909, students at Texas A&M; University had built an annual bonfire on campus. Freshmen were expected to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Aggie Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees on the edge of town. The early Bonfires were constructed under the leadership of the Corps of Cadets. All students were members of the Corps, which had its own leadership structure. When membership in the Corps became voluntary in 1965, this leadership structure was no longer viable; Corps leaders had no authority over the civilian students. A separate Bonfire leadership structure was instituted. The new leaders were designated with colored hard hats, or pots, with the overall leaders known as redpots. Leaders were chosen by their predecessors. Initiation rites for the upper echelon of leaders were often brutal, at times including beatings with ax handles or bar fights. Sportswriter Scott Eden commented that \\"these tests of toughness were meant to steel new Redpots for the job ahead.\\" Knowledge was passed down from one leader to another verbally, with little to no official written documentation. Each generation of Redpots strived to outdo the generation before. The structure became more elaborate, and in 1969, the stack of logs set the world record for the height of a bonfire at tall. Out of concern for the safety of participants and the community, the university limited the size to tall and in diameter. Despite the new height restrictions, in the 1970s, the Guinness Book of Records listed Aggie Bonfire as the largest Bonfire in the world. While the Bonfires of the 1960s were constructed in five to ten days, working primarily in daylight, by the late 1970s, changes in the school led to a more elaborate and lengthy construction schedule. Construction began in late October with \\"Cut\\", obtaining wood by cutting down trees with axes, which took several weekends. After Cut, students brought the logs to campus during \\"Load\\", a process by which the logs were loaded by hand onto flatbed trucks and brought to campus. In early November, crews began \\"Stack\\", a three-week period in which the logs were wired together and Bonfire took shape. Although between two and five thousand students participated in the construction of Bonfire each year, most worked only part-time, and many worked only one or two shifts. Student workers were organized by dormitories or Corps units, with a separate off-campus student team. Many former students participated with teams they belonged to as students. Each team had assigned shifts, although individuals were not limited to working only the assigned shifts. Following the collapse of the 1999 Bonfire, which killed 12 current and former students, Texas A&M; officials cancelled the annual event. In 2003, several current and former students founded Student Bonfire, a nonprofit organization which hosts an annual Bonfire, unaffiliated with the university, off-campus. The Bonfire leadership structure has remained in place, although in 2014 only 10 of the 26 dorms were represented by Bonfire crews. Leadership roles=Redpots Redpots are the leaders of Bonfire. Prior to 1999, there were 9 senior redpots and 9 junior redpots each year. These nine seniors and nine juniors were in charge of Bonfire as a whole, from the design of the structure to ensuring that all participants were following safety precautions while overseeing both Cut and Stack. There was no official written documentation for Bonfire, and all applicable information was passed orally from one year's redpots to the next. Senior redpots were responsible for training the junior redpots in the proper process and procedures for building the next year's Bonfire. In 2016, there are only 4 senior and 3 junior redpots. These redpots must follow the safety and construction procedures outlined in the Student Bonfire bylaws. As of 2017 there are 3 senior and 3 junior redpots. At the end of their junior year, junior redpots are promoted to senior redpots, and choose their successors. Redpots decorate their helmets with a list of their predecessors. The most famous redpot is likely former Texas governor Rick Perry, from the class of 1972. The head redpot, essentially the CEO of Bonfire, is known as Head Stack. The other senior redpot titles, colloquially known as \\"lines\\", represented in the past several years include Truck Pot, who is responsible for the hauling of the logs, and all vehicles and trailers, Head Civilian, who is the chief lumberjack overseeing the students who are not members of the Corps of Cadets, Brigade Woods, who is the counterpart chief lumberjack overseeing the students who are members of the Corps of Cadets, and Shockpot, who is responsible for the electrical setup of Bonfire. Redpots are denoted by the red color of their helmets as well as the ceremonial ax handles that they carry. Brownpot Brownpots are in charge of machinery at Cut and Stack. They are most often seen operating chainsaws at Cut and Stack sites. There were 6 brownpots prior to 1999. Brownpots are the only people at cut with permission to use machinery. After trees are felled by hand, brownpots strip the branches and cut the logs into the appropriate lengths using chainsaws. Brownpots are the only individuals allowed to use chainsaws at any stage of bonfire. Buttpot Buttpots are all members of the corps of cadets and are all juniors (the name \\"buttpot\\" referring to \\"sergebutt\\", the moniker for all juniors in the corps) each corps outfit would have one junior designated as Buttpot for the outfit and would be in charge of all crew chiefs and fish for their unit, as well as serving as the spokesperson for the outfit. The nonreg equivalent of a buttpot would be a yellow pot for the respective non-corps dorms on Texas A&M;'s campus. Buttpots could be identified by a Maroon pot with their outfit name on the front and \\"Buttpot\\" clearly written on the back, just as yellowpots are identified by the yellow paint on theirs. Yellowpot Yellowpots are the liaison to higher on-site leadership for crews. Each dorm with enough volunteers will have a yellowpot designated who serves as spokesman for that dorm, as well as manager to the crew chiefs of his dorm. One leadership position, Load Pot, technically falls within the hierarchy as a Yellowpot, but does not represent any specific dorm. The Load Pot is typically a junior who is charged with the responsibility of supervising Load directly with a Brownpot and a Redpot. The Load Pot is the head authority of Load site. Crew chief Crew chiefs are in charge of each dorm's crew while at Cut and Stack, serving as both instructors and supervisors. With larger dorms, there will be multiple crew chiefs to ensure that there is adequate supervision of the larger crews. Greenpot Greenpots are in charge of administrative and financial aspects. These students are responsible for things such as checking people in at the beginning of the day, collecting organization dues, selling merchandise, and managing paperwork. While no position is technically restricted to certain genders, Greenpots are the only leadership position that has been historically held by females. This position was created in 2003. Outhouse Crew/Orangepots The Outhouse Crew is in charge of building the orange outhouse that sits on top of the bonfire stack. The Outhouse Crew is made up of 6 sophomore cadets from The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band. A crewmember is chosen from each of the four band outfits and a head crewmember and grode crewmember are also chosen.

The process for determining who gets the responsibility of these roles changes from pot to pot, but ultimately, the candidates are voted on according to who best represents the desired qualities. In the cases of crew chiefs and Yellowpots, the vote is decided within the dorm by the leaders for that year, and candidates are usually chosen from the freshman of that dorm. For the higher positions, such as the Redpots, the candidates are chosen from the pool of Crew Chiefs, Yellows, and any member of the applicable year. The Greenpots are the only non-dorm-specific pots that do not use crew chiefs or Yellowpots as candidates.

The civil parish of Ashby Folville was abolished in 1936 and its were merged with Gaddesby . History The village of 'Ashby' was recorded in the Domesday Book as consisting of twenty-four villagers, three smallholders, two slaves, one priest and being owned by the Countess Judith. By the time of the Leicestershire Survey of 1124-29 the manor had passed from Judith to her daughter Maud, Countess of Huntingdon and her husband King David I of Scotland. The Folville Family Arms of Folville - party per fess, argent & or, a cross moline gules The Folville element of the placename comes from a family that had its seat here since at least 1137 when its lordship was held of the Honour of Huntingdon by Fulk de Folville. The family name, ultimately derived from Folleville in the French region of Picardy, was attached to several other sites in Leicestershire, including the deserted village of Newbolt Folville. They seem to have gained most their estate at the beginning of the 12th century. Several of their possessions, such as Ashby and the manor at Teigh in Rutland, were in the hands of other parties at the time of the Domesday survey, but had passed to the Folvilles by the reign of Stephen (1135-1154). The family were certainly well-established in Leicestershire by the mid 13th century. In 1240 a member of the family donated a large sum to the church at Cranoe. The Folvilles were rebels during both Barons Wars; Sir William Folville (died about 1240) had his lands seized for his part in the First Barons' War in 1216 and Sir Eustace Folville (murdered in 1274) was one of the knights appointed to enforce the Provisions of Oxford in 1258 and stoutly defended Kenilworth Castle after the Battle of Evesham in 1265. The family gained renown during the reign of Edward II, when they ambushed and killed the Baron of the Exchequer, Roger de Beler. Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester had been stealing people's lands in Leicestershire, using Roger de Beler as an enforcer, and in 1325 de Beler had threatened the Folville family with violence. By the beginning of 1326 much of the country had turned against Edward and the Despencers and preparations for a rebellion led by Edward's wife, Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer had started. The Folville family, headed by Eustace Folville, and encouraged by Sir Roger la Zouch, Lord of Lubbesthorpe murdered de Beler before fleeing to Paris. Following Isabella and Mortimer's successful invasion of England, Edward III was crowned and rebels were pardoned including the Folville family who were celebrated locally with the Folville Cross, said to be located at the site of de Beler's murder. The Folville Gang flitted in and out of outlawry for many years, but, apart from Richard Folville, vicar of Teigh, who was beheaded in his own churchyard, they ended with their freedom intact. The manor of Ashby eventually passed via marriage from the Folvilles to the Woodfords and then Smiths. Landmarks After World War II, a resettlement camp for displaced people from Poland was established in a former US Army base in the grounds of Ashby Folville Manor.\\"Polish reunion is resounding success\\", Melton Times 14 Sept 2010 Religious sites The parish church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building. The Ashby Folville estate was bought in 1890 by Herbert Smith-Carington, then mayor of Worcester (died 1917), who built cottages and a village institute and restored the church. The old wooden roofs of the nave and the new oak panels of the chancel and screen of the Woodford chapel are among the features of interest. In the chancel are memorials to Ralph Woodford (a descendant of the Folvilles) and Elizabeth Woodford. Monuments in the Woodford chapel include a stone knight known as \\"Old Folville\\" and the fine monument of Sir Francis Smith and his wife.

The compositions are distinguished by a minimalist compositional aesthetic and a distinctly religious or mystical subject focus. Origins With the growing popularity of minimalist music in the 1960s and 1970s, which often broke sharply with prevailing musical aesthetics of serialism and aleatoric music, many composers, building on the work of such minimalists as Terry Riley, Philip Glass and Steve Reich, began to work with more traditional notions of simple melody and harmony in a radically simplified framework.\\"Is less more?Is minimalism a lazy rip-off, or beauty in its simplest form?

It started as two land clearing fires to the west of the city. The first fire was further away from the city and was clearing land for the roundhouse of the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The second fire was clearing land to extend the city to the west. The Great Fire occurred shortly after the township of Granville was incorporated into the City of Vancouver. The fires spread north east into the city, killing at least 21 people and destroying 600‚Äì1,000 buildings (the exact numbers are unknown). Most residents escaped by fleeing to the Burrard Inlet shore or the False Creek shore. Following the recovery efforts, the city of Vancouver continued to grow. The first police force was set up, the first brick buildings were built, and the first fire engine was brought in from the nearby larger town of New Westminster.  Early Vancouver  left European settlement in the Vancouver area began in 1862 after Captain George Henry Richard's 1859 discovery of coal in the Burrard Inlet. The settlement of Granville (later Vancouver) was formed in the mid-1860s between two Burrard Inlet sawmills. It began as shops and hotels providing service to the workers of the mills and later their families. The two sawmills were Moodyville (originally Moody's Mill), opened 1863, on the Burrard Inlet north shore and Hastings Mill (originally Stamps Mill), opened 1867, on the Inlet's south shore. The two mills were the main employers in Granville. In the early 1880s, they employed between 150 and 200 workers, not including loggers and longshoremen. The exact numbers are unknown as many of the workers were transient unmarried men, who worked at a mill for only a few weeks at a time before moving on. To reach Granville required either a nine- mile journey through dense forest from the nearby larger town of New Westminster or a thirty-mile journey via the Fraser River from Fort Langley, the capital of British Columbia at the time. In 1885 it was announced that Granville would be the west coast terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The township of Granville was incorporated as the city of Vancouver on April 6, 1886, becoming the fourth city in British Columbia. At the first city council election on May 3, 1886, Malcolm MacLean was elected the city's Mayor. The inaugural meeting of the Vancouver Volunteer Hose Company No.1 was held May 28th 1886. Future Vancouver blocks and streets had been marked out to the west of the city to allow for its anticipated growth. These had been designated by the Canadian Pacific Railway land commissioner Lachlan Hamilton.  Demographics  right Early Vancouver attracted budding entrepreneurs who were very active in the civic politics forming the new city. The population of Granville grew substantially in the early to mid 1880s. The population and economic growth in the area in early 1886 was so significant three new newspapers were established. The mid-1880s also saw a change in the population from mostly unmarried men and some families with First Nations wives to an increasing number of families especially with European wives. Following the British victory in the Opium Wars, British colonies such as Vancouver received an influx of Chinese migrants from the provinces surrounding Canton, the sole port for foreign trade. Most of these migrants were employed at the Hastings Mill. The Canadian Paciific Railway also brought in Chinese railway workers, employed to establish the CPR terminus.  First Nations people  The main native population in the area at the time of European settlement was the Salish-speaking Squamish people. They had been in the area from Howe Sound to the north to English Bay and Burrard Inlet to the south for at least 500 years. The Musqueam people lived further south but had a presence in the Burrard Inlet area dating back at least 2,000 years. When sawmilling began in 1863, the local Squamish men were hired as unskilled labour. The mission reserve near Moodyville and the Indian rancheria at Hastings Mill were the product of the mill's employment of native people. In 1881 there were at least 500 Squamish at Burrard Inlet. The first nations people were not given the same rights as their British and North American contemporaries. The men were not hired for the higher skilled and higher paid roles at the sawmills while the women were unable to inherit property from their white partners and were often kicked out of their home after his death.  Origin  Prior to the fire, Vancouver had experienced three weeks of abnormal heat for late spring. Sunday, June 13, was particularly hot with an offshore breeze from the Pacific Ocean. There was also significant forest deadfall in the area to the East of the city as well as debris from the recent clearing for the expansion of the city which provided fuel to the fire.  First clearing fire  The first clearing fire was located to the south-west of the city. The land was being cleared to create the roundhouse for the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The dry conditions and a Pacific breeze caused the fire to grow out of workers' control throughout the morning and into the afternoon.  Second clearing fire  The second clearing fire was located at the west end of the city near the intersection of Cambie and Cordova street. The fire was being used to clear land for the expansion of the city. It grew out of control in the early afternoon.  Spread  Panorama of Vancouver with clearing fire 1886 The men working on the clearing fires and volunteers from the town attempted to put out both fires with buckets, wet blankets and shovels. For the first clearing fire, the water came from False Creek, whilst the second fire used the hand-pump well at the newly constructed nearby Regina Hotel. The men attempted to bring both fires under control into the afternoon, however, the breeze turned to a gale and the men at the first fire were forced to give up their efforts and flee to the False Creek shore. At the second fire, an attempt to create a fire break with pickaxes was unsuccessful. The second fire was abandoned when the two fire fronts joined. The smoke from the fire filled the sky over the town. The men fleeing warned the people in the town of the incoming fire. Most residents hurriedly packed up their belongings and their stores and headed to the Burrard Inlet shore. However, despite warnings from other residents and the growing smoke, a number of residents did not believe the fire was dangerous. Some residents waited until the last minute to flee whilst others headed to the hotels to drink the unguarded liquor. The Squamish people from the south shore village Snauq, paddled across in canoes to view the fire. At the Burrard Inlet shore, some residents were able to flee out into the inlet on floats and vessels. The local Squamish Nation provided help to the survivors who were floundering in the water. They paddled over and canoed people to safety. The men of the Vancouver Volunteer Hose Company No.1 went to Scoullar's General Store to remove a supply of explosives, which were taken to the Hastings Mill at the opposite end of town. The city clerk Thomas McGuian saved the city records detailing the city's short history by entrusting them to a stranger.  After the fire  Vancouver Police Department 1886First Vancouver City Council Meeting after the fire c.1886 After the fire passed, the newly elected Mayor of Vancouver, Malcolm MacLean, sent telegrams to the Canadian Prime Minister and the Mayor of Toronto. The telegram to the Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald read: \\"Our city is ashes three thousand people homeless can you send us any government aid?\\" The telegrams were sent via horse to the nearby town of New Westminister. Shortly after, word arrived that relief supplies from New Westminister were being sent in wagons. At this time most Vancouver residents had gathered at Hastings Mill or False Creek. Mayor MacLean instructed the survivors to gather at Westminister Bridge to await the relief supplies. An impromptu bivouac was set up with tents and lean-tos made with large branches. At around midnight, supplies arrived from New Westminister and Port Moody (an eastern township on the Burrard Inlet).  Damage  Between 600 and 1,000 buildings were destroyed by the fireÃ≥, with few surviving the blaze. The Regina Hotel at the north of the city survived, as did the Bridge Hotel at the south-east. A side building of the Bridge Hotel was used as a makeshift morgue. According to Alderman Gallagher, a Vancouver businessman, who witnessed the fire and the aftermath, there were 21 bodies (or parts thereof) found immediately after the fire, while others were discovered during the cleanup and rebuilding. The exact number of dead is unknown, mostly because Vancouver's population at this time was constantly changing due to its rapid expansion as well as the transient nature of many of the mill workers.  Newspaper reports  The Quebec Daily Telegraph reported the fire June 15, 1886. It reported five people dead, 1,000 homeless and a total loss of an estimated one million dollars. The Day in New London, Connecticut, reported the fire June 15, 1886, with 50 people dead, 1,000 homeless and a total loss of one million dollars. The Manistee Weekly Times in the June 15, 1886, edition outlined the events of the fire and attributed the blaze to the Canadian Pacific Railway. It also reported that ‚Äúliberal and prompt‚Äù aid was expected from Canadian Pacific. The fire was reported in the June 16, 1886, edition of the Toronto World. It reported 12 lives had been lost, outlined the events of the fire and included a response from the Toronto mayor promising immediate aid. The Montreal Gazette reported June 18, 1938, that a George H. Keefer of Cobble Hill, B.C., claimed he was responsible for setting the Great Vancouver Fire. This claim is not verified by any other sources.alt=  Rebuilding  The day after the fire, the manager of the Hastings Mill, Richard Alexander, announced free lumber for anyone rebuilding their homes and businesses after the fire. Impromptu emergency shelters were set up in the few surviving structures. Several blocks of ice found beneath the wreckage of the Deighton House ice shed provided drinking water to residents. The city council set up a temporary tent city hall. A few months later, one of the first brick buildings in Vancouver became the city hall building. The day after the fire, to address looting, Mayor MacLean appointed three special constables, Jackson Abray, V.W. Haywood, and John McLaren, to join constable John Stewart as the first Vancouver police force. The police force operated out of the city hall tent whilst Vancouver was rebuilt. 200x200px In the days that followed, the residents of Vancouver set up white canvas tents and small huts and searched the wreckages of their homes and businesses looking for any surviving objects. The CPR Hotel was the first building to be completely rebuilt. Within two weeks, Cordova St from Carrall to Abbott streets was filled with businesses reopening in basic structures. The City Council organised the main streets to be planked. Within six months, 500 buildings had been rebuilt with many of the new buildings being made from brick.  Population growth  After the fire, the City Council focused on urban development to promote the growth of the city. The Canadian Pacific Railway played an important role in the growth of Vancouver. It brought demographic and economic growth and was the largest property owner. In the years following the fire, the population of Vancouver continued to grow, expanding from several hundred people, to 2,000 people within a year and 13,000 people within six years.

Spencer was a twentieth century painter, whose work attempted to combine the sexual with the divine in contemporary English settings. His paintings frequently showed biblical scenes taking place in ordinary English villages, particularly Cookham, and often depicted, or used figures inspired by, his friends, relatives and lovers.

Biography Cook was born in Twiggs County, Georgia. His parents had moved from Virginia to Georgia. He served with the United States Army in the Seminole Wars, serving in Florida. After studying at Oglethorpe University, he graduated from the law school of the University of Virginia in 1841. He subsequently lived in Macon County, Georgia, where he maintained a law practice.History Central Once the American Civil War started, Cook sided with the Confederate States of America and enlisted as a private in the 4th Georgia Volunteer Infantry. By the end of the Seven Days campaign on the Virginia Peninsula, Cook had advanced to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He also fought in the battles of Second Manassas, Antietam and Chancellorsville, where he was wounded in the leg. As a result, he missed the Gettysburg Campaign while he recovered. For a short time, Cook took a leave of absence to serve in the Georgia Legislature before returning to the army. At the Battle of Cold Harbor in 1864 he took command of the brigade when Brig. Gen. George P. Doles was killed. Cook was wounded again during the Siege of Petersburg. After recovering, he fought under Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Ramseur at the Battle of Cedar Creek in the Shenandoah Valley before returning with his men to the trenches around Petersburg, Virginia. He was wounded a third time during the 1865 attack on Fort Stedman. After the war ended in early 1865, Cook moved to Americus, Georgia, where he set up a law practice and was active in local and state politics. From 1873 to 1883, Cook was a member of the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat, serving a district comprising part of southwest Georgia. He became Georgia's Secretary of State in 1890, at the specific request of long-serving Secretary of State Nathan Crawford Barnett, made prior to his death in office. Cook was part of the commission that built Georgia's state capitol building in Atlanta. Phillip Cook died in Atlanta on May 21, 1894. Cook County, Georgia, is named in his honor.

Town signs may be placed for reading both by drivers entering the town and, in a different format, by those exiting it. Signs give the name of the town in the local official languages, and sometimes in other languages. In some countries, town signs are also an essential part of the traffic law, for example by defining (explicitly or implicitly) the speed limit within the town's territory. In much of the U.S., there is a similar county sign at the boundary between each county (or independent city not part of one), indicating the county being entered and often the one being left. Even if not done within a give U.S. state, there is also nearly always a welcome sign at the state line on every major highway, and most any other road. The welcome signs on Interstate highways are usually very large and have graphics, and may have an attached text-only sign directing motorists to the welcome center at a rest area. On smaller roads, they are usually more similar to town signs, showing the state and county, often with other signs indicating speed limit, a state law (such as \\"burn headlights during rain\\"), and/or a change in time zone.

Smoky black is a hair coat color of horses in which the coat is either black or a few shades lighter than true black. Smoky black is produced by the action of a heterozygous (single copy) cream gene on an underlying black coat color. Therefore, smoky black is a member of the cream family of coat color dilutions, and found in horse populations that have other cream gene-based colors such as palomino, buckskin, perlino and cremello. All smoky blacks must have at least one parent with the cream gene, and a smoky black can be verified through DNA testing. Smoky black has been mistaken for faded black, dark bay or brown, grullo or even liver chestnut. A smoky black horse usually appears to be a black horse and the dilution gene dilution factor is not visible. However, the coat may be somewhat more prone to fade to a brown shade if weathered or sun-bleached. Conversely, just because a black horse may fade in the sun does not necessarily prove or disprove that it is a smoky black. Two copies of the cream gene on a black base coat produce a smoky cream, a cream-colored horse which is visually difficult to distinguish from a perlino or cremello, but can be identified through DNA testing. Identification bay. Correctly identifying a smoky black often calls for knowing the genetic background of the individual animal. Smoky black foals must always have at least one parent with the cream dilute gene and at least one parent that carries the \\"E\\" extension gene associated with black coloring. This could occur one of two ways: A foal could have a smoky black parent or a buckskin parent carrying both genes within a single horse. A smoky black could also be produced by breeding one horse with only the cream dilution, such as a palomino, to a bay or black horse carrying only the extension gene, but no cream dilution. As foals, smoky blacks are typically quite silvery, and may be mistaken for grullos, especially when born with primitive countershading. Smoky black foals are sometimes born with reddish tufts of hair in their ears. However, both traits are also seen in many true black foals as well. While it superficially resembles other coat colors, experienced horse persons often detect something \\"off\\" about the coat of an adult smoky black. The darkest shades among smoky blacks are almost indistinguishable from true black but for a slightly burnished look often chalked up to sun bleaching. The palest can be mistaken for dull bays or liver chestnuts, especially if exposed to the elements. Smoky black coats tend to react strongly to sun and sweat, and many smoky blacks turn to a chocolate color with particularly reddish manes and tails. Bleaching due to the elements means that the legs retain their color better, and can take on an appearance of having dark points like a bay horse. Smoky blacks, however, will lack rich red tones in the coat, instead favoring chocolate and orange tones. One way to visually identify some smoky blacks are by the eyes, which may be amber even at adulthood. However, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish an amber-brown eye from an ordinary dark brown eye unless there are other horses available for direct comparison. Smoky black mimics * Dark bay: When smoky blacks fade from exposure to the elements, their legs usually retain their color, giving them the appearance of a bay or brown horse with black points. However, the brown coat of a bleached smoky black recalls orange rather than red or mahogany. * Black: A true genetic black horse may still develop a sun-bleached coat, usually due to issues related to management and nutrition, though in some cases there may also be genetic factors contributing. A smoky black looks very similar to a sun- bleached black, and often only pedigree analysis or genetic testing can distinguish between the two. * Seal brown: The just off-black coat color of true seal browns can sometimes be misidentified as smoky black, or vice versa. * Liver chestnut: The palest, most evenly bleached smoky blacks may mimic the darkest shades of chestnut. Chestnuts do not have true black tones in their coats, and will usually reveal reddish character around the fetlocks. Smoky blacks usually have uniformly black legs. Furthermore, chestnuts do not possess amber eyes. * Classic champagne: Paler smoky blacks with amber eyes may be confused with the activity of champagne on a black coat. Champagne horses have pinkish, freckled skin and green, hazel or amber eyes, as opposed to the dark skin and brown or amber eyes of a smoky black. * Grullo: Grullo is the action of the dun gene on black. Typically, grullo coats have cool slate hues as opposed to warm orange-brown tones. Furthermore, grullos have dun characteristics such as bold dorsal stripes and leg bars. Genetic identification Genetically, smoky blacks are black horses heterozygous for the cream gene. The mutation that produces the cream colors is on the MATP gene on equine chromosome 21 (ECA21), and is an incomplete dominant trait. Incomplete dominant traits differ from recessive traits, which are only \\"visible\\" in the homozygous state, and simple dominant traits, which look just the same in the homozygous and heterozygous states. Instead, the MATP mutation is visible the heterozygous state, but more so in the homozygous state. The difficulty in identifying smoky blacks has led some to describe black as \\"masking\\" cream, however smoky blacks are more properly termed \\"cryptic creams.\\" The location of the cream gene was published in 2003 and there now exists a DNA test for the cream gene.\\"Horse Coat Color\\", Veterinary Genetics Lab, University of California, Davis. Web Site accessed May 29, 2008 This test enables breeders to identify cryptic creams such as smoky blacks, dark palominos and buckskins, and creams whose coats are obscured by the action of the gray gene or pattern genes such as pinto.

All the members of KUBE are students at Keele University and so are all volunteers. It makes up the student media at the university, along with Concourse (newspaper). Early history KUBE was founded in 1994 by a small group of students. KUBE obtained a short-term AM licence, as opposed to the short-term FM licences typically on offer ‚Äì this greatly increased the range of the initial broadcast. However, KUBE has since moved to broadcasting exclusively via the internet, no longer broadcasting on AM radio. KUBE's studio has changed greatly since 2007, when it was given a dedicated studio and office space to the back of K2, when the original space used by the station was used to redevelop the toilet facilities of K2. Awards In November 2007 KUBE was awarded 'Best Internet Only' award at the first European Radio Awards in Barcelona, Spain. On 28 June 2007 KUBE was awarded the 'Gold Medal Award' for 'Best Online Radio' at the New York Festival's Radio Programming & Promotion Awards 2007 and were originally nominated for the award after a fund raising event for Comic Relief raised thousands in a single 24-hour broadcast. In June 2007 the lead technical member of KUBE was short-listed for the Gary Frisch Busary award, which is for an entrepreneur or pioneer who is innovating in the fields of radio and audio software. KUBE Radio received a nomination at the Student Radio Awards in 2008. The show 'Llamageddon' was nominated for 'Best Interview' for their interview with indie-pop rock group The Hoosiers. KUBE events KUBE holds events throughout the year including the Launch Party in freshers week. This event is open to all students at the university and is an opportunity for new members to get to know each other. Another regular event that KUBE has held since 2007 is the 24-hour broadcast. During the event the station broadcasts live for 24 hours and raises money for a chosen charity. Initially run to tie in with Comic Relief and Red Nose Day, the event has evolved into being a key part of the fundraising Rag Week. In 2007, Mark Welch and Matt Hallworth spent the whole 24 hours presenting from KUBE's original studio, before the area was redeveloped. This event led to KUBE winning its NY Festivals award. In 2008 a different approach was taken and there was a multitude of different presenters who did the full 24 hours. In 2009, Georgie Hammerton and Nick Lancaster took the reins and in 2010 TC Balmer and Aide Rushton fronted the broadcast. For KUBE Radio's 24 Hour Charity Broadcast 2011, Holly Beaumont-Wilkes and Dwayn ‚ÄòD-Won‚Äô Evans were challenged to host the marathon broadcast solely from one studio, with no breaks and no sleep. Through online and off-line donations, KUBE Radio raised over ¬£1000 for The Donna Louise Children's Hospice Trust on Monday 30 May 2011. The 24-hour broadcast was rebranded in 2012, simply as ‚ÄòKUBE24‚Äô. Following the similar style as the previous years, presenting duo Megan ‚ÄòJMeg‚Äô Jones and Lauren ‚ÄòDodge‚Äô Dodgeson were set the challenge of broadcasting for a full 24 hours in the studio, with no breaks and various challenges to perform throughout the broadcast. In 2016 KUBE Radio began hosting regular underground music events entitled 'BreakOut', a play on the popular student night 'Lockdown'. BreakOut became a monthly event hosted on a Monday night, in conjunction with other University music societies. These nights are characterised by multiple DJs performing Back2Back sets, in a typical soundclash format. These events continue regularly and are a popular fixture in the student calendar. In 2015, KUBE TV, a YouTube channel was launched, providing both live and pre-recorded content. The 24hr Broadcast moved to a live video format in December 2016, under the title #KUBE24 and continues annually. Alongside the 24-hour broadcast, KUBE TV complements the radios live coverage of the University Varsity and hosts a 3/4 day broadcast annually for the event. Refurbishment KUBE's current studio in Keele University Students' Union underwent major refurbishment in 2010 and was officially opened by Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe on 6 November. The opening ceremony followed previous openings/ribbon cuttings done in the past by members of the Kerrang Team and Faithless.

Since the universe of strings over any finite alphabet is a countable set, every language can be mapped to a unique set A of natural numbers; thus, every language has a unary version {1k  k in A}. Conversely, every unary language has a more compact binary version, the set of binary encodings of natural numbers k such that 1k is in the language. Since complexity is usually measured in terms of the length of the input string, the unary version of a language can be \\"easier\\" than the original language. For example, if a language can be recognized in O(2n) time, its unary version can be recognized in O(n) time, because n has become exponentially larger. More generally, if a language can be recognized in O(f(n)) time and O(g(n)) space, its unary version can be recognized in O(n + f(log n)) time and O(g(log n)) space (we require O(n) time just to read the input string). However, if membership in a language is undecidable, then membership in its unary version is also undecidable.  Relationships to other complexity classes  TALLY is contained in P/poly‚Äîthe class of languages that can be recognized in polynomial time given an advice function that depends only on the input length. In this case, the required advice function is very simple‚Äîit returns a single bit for each input length k specifying whether 1k is in the language or not. A unary language is necessarily a sparse language, since for each n it contains at most one value of length n and at most n values of length at most n, but not all sparse languages are unary; thus TALLY is contained in SPARSE. It is believed that there are no NP-hard unary languages: if there exists a unary language that is NP-complete, then P = NP.Piotr Berman. Relationship between density and deterministic complexity of NP-complete languages. In Proceedings of the 5th Conference on Automata, Languages and Programming, pp.63-71\\\\. Springer-Verlag. Lecture Notes in Computer Science #62. 1978. This result can be extended to sparse languages.S. R. Mahaney. Sparse complete sets for NP: Solution of a conjecture by Berman and Hartmanis. Journal of Computer and System Sciences 25:130-143. 1982. If L is a unary language, then L* (the Kleene star of L) is a regular language.  Tally classes  The complexity class P1 is the class of the unary languages that can be recognized by a polynomial time Turing machine (given its input written in unary); it is the analogue of the class P. The analogue of NP in the unary setting is NP1. A counting class #P1, the analogue of #P, is also known.Leslie Valiant, The Complexity of Enumeration and Reliability Problems,  References =NotesGeneral references * Lance Fortnow.

He had studied in Rome for his doctorate at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and became a parish priest in the Danube Valley. After becoming bishop, in 1952 he was arrested, together with many other religious, and executed for ostensible crimes against the state. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1998. Life Vincent Bossilkov was born to a family of Bulgarian Latin Rite Catholics on November 16, 1900 in Belene, Bulgaria. After studies, he entered the Passionist Congregation at the age of 14. The Passionists are an Italian religious institute founded by Saint Paul of the Cross in the eighteenth century. They have practiced in Bulgaria since 1781.Mercurio, R: The Passionists, p. 43. The Liturgical Press, 1991 Bossilkov studied in Passionist houses in the Netherlands and Belgium and took the religious name Eugene. He professed his vows in 1920 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1926. He had returned to Bulgaria in 1924 and had pursued theological studies. In 1927 he went to Rome to take his doctorate at the Pontifical Oriental Institute, where he wrote a thesis on the Union of Bulgarians with the Holy See during the early 13th century. On his return to Bulgaria, Father Eugene served in various Diocesan offices, but he preferred working with the laity. He took up a post as parish priest in the Danube River valley. Here his reputation for scholarship grew, and he was noted for his work with the youth of the parish.Hogland, V:\\"A Modern Christian Martyr: Bishop Eugene Bossilkov, C.P.\\", In the wake of World War II, the Soviet Union invaded the Kingdom of Bulgaria and installed a Communist government answering to Joseph Stalin. The new regime began to enact laws to destroy religious institutions and beliefs. At this time, Eugene was appointed Bishop of Nicopolis in 1947.Mercurio, R: The Passionists, p. 179. The Liturgical Press, 1991 From 1949 the attitude of the State to religious institutes worsened. In the same year the government deported the Apostolic Delegate, seized Church property, and suppressed the religious congregations. In 1952 the government began to make mass arrests of Church officials. On July 16, police seized Bishop Eugene in Sophia. Martyrdom Bishop Eugene suffered both physical and mental torture in prison, where he was told to confess to being the leader of a Catholic conspiracy to subvert Communism.Hogland, V:\\"A Modern Christian Martyr: Bishop Eugene Bossilkov, C.P.\\", At a political \\"show trial\\", two guns supposedly seized from the Catholic college in Sophia were presented as evidence.

Beatification During the 1980s, supporters gathered evidence regarding the Bishop's life and death, and put before the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome.

Many American colleges and universities seek to provide a broad \\"liberal arts education\\", in which all college students to study the humanities in addition to their specific area of study. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included Mortimer J. AdlerAdler, Mortimer J.; \\"A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom\\" and E.D. Hirsch. A liberal arts focus is often coupled with curricular requirements; colleges including Saint Anselm College and Providence College have mandatory two-year core curricula in the humanities for their students. The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, The Humanities in American Life: > Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it > mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. > They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual > sense of a world in which irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are > as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason. Conceptual validity The very concept of the ‚Äòhumanities‚Äô as a class or kind, distinct from the ‚Äôsciences‚Äô, has come under repeated attack in the twentieth century. T.S. Kuhn‚Äôs The Structure of Scientific RevolutionsKuhn, Thomas, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, The University of Chicago Press, 1962 argued that the forces driving scientific progress often have less to do with objective inference from unbiased observation than with much more value-laden sociological and cultural factors. More recently, Richard Rorty has argued that the distinction between the sciences and the humanities is harmful to both pursuits, placing the former on an undeserved pedestal and condemning the latter to irrationality. Rorty‚Äôs position requires a wholesale rejection of such traditional philosophical distinctions as those between appearance and reality, subjective and objective, replacing them with what he endorses as a new ‚Äòfuzziness‚Äô. This leads to a kind of pragmatism where \\"the oppositions between the humanities, the arts, and the sciences, might gradually fade away... In this situation, ‚Äòthe humanities‚Äô would no longer think of themselves as such....\\"Rorty, Richard, Science as Solidarity, in Objectivity, Relativism and Truth: Philosophical Papers Volume I, Cambridge University Press, 1991 Modernism and postmodernism In the United States, the late 20th century saw a challenge to the \\"elitism\\" of the humanities, which Edward Said has characterized as a \\"conservative philosophy of gentlemanly refinement, or sensibility.\\" Such postmodernists argued that the humanities should go beyond the study of \\"dead white males\\" to include work by women and people of color, and without religious bias. The French philosopher Michel Foucault has been a very influential part of this movement, stating in The Order of Things that \\"we can study only individuals, not human nature.\\" However some in the humanities believed that such changes could be detrimental; the result is said to be what E. D. Hirsch Jr. refers to as declining cultural literacy.Kernan, Alvin, editor; What's Happened to the Humanities?, Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1997 National institutions President Lyndon Johnson signed the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act in 1965,www.neh.gov creating the National Council on the Humanities, and funded the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in 1969. NEH is an independent grant-making agency of the United States government dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities (see Public humanities). NEH facilitated the creation of State Humanities Councilswww.neh.gov in the 56 U.S. states and territories. Each council operates independently, defining the \\"humanities\\" in relationship to the disciplines, subjects, and values valued in the regions they serve. Councils give grant funds to individuals, scholars, and nonprofit organizations dedicated to the humanities in their region. Councils also offer diverse programs and services that respond to the needs of their communities and according to their own definitions of the humanities. Career prospects Criticism of the traditional humanities/liberal arts degree program has been leveled by critics who see them as both expensive and relatively \\"useless\\" in the modern American job market, where several years of specialized study is required in most job fields. According to a 2018 report by the Humanities Indicators, unemployment rates for humanities majors were slightly higher and their earnings were slightly lower than the averages for college degree recipients with similar degree levels (though both were still substantially better than for those without a college degree). Their overall levels of satisfaction with their jobs and their lives, however, were essentially the same as graduates from other fields, with more than 85% of humanities graduates reporting they were satisfied with their jobs. As of 2015, approximately five million people employed in management and professional jobs had bachelor‚Äôs degrees in the humanities.

Although it is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, it is included in a charter of c.1280. In the 13th century and during the Middle Ages, the area comprised estates that had many different owners. From the 15th century, most of these farming estates came under the ownership of the de Trafford family. In 1830 Chorley consisted of only a few cottages, the De Trafford Arms Inn, a toll bar, and a smithy, straggling along the Congleton to Manchester Road. The coming of the railway in 1842 with the construction of the Stockport to Crewe section of the main Manchester and Birmingham Railway changed all this. The Manchester and Birmingham Railway Company built the line through Chorley, offering free season tickets for 20 years to Manchester businessmen who built houses with a rateable value of more than ¬£50 within a mile of the station. This 'season ticket' was in the form of a small silver oval which could be worn on a watch chain. The railway also gave Alderley Edge its current name. As the railway network expanded and travel became easier, the railway company did not want its station called Chorley any more because of the possible confusion with Chorley in Lancashire. So, in 1880 they renamed it Alderley Edge against much opposition, taking the old name for the village and the name of the sandstone escarpment already known as The Edge.

In 1996 the acquisition of Ashfield Towers on Kenton Road, adjacent to Senior House, led to the relocation of Junior House allowing Westfield to offer an all-through education for girls from three to eighteen on a single six-acre site in the heart of Gosforth.http://www.isc.co.uk/schools/england/tyne-and-wear-area/newcastle- upon-tyne/westfield-school The current school is now made up of three divisions: Junior House (which includes the Early Years), Senior House and Sixth Form. Uniform The school's uniform consists of a tartan blue and pink kilt with a pink shirt and a navy blue V-neck jumper, whilst the sixth form uniform consists of a navy suit along with the same pink and navy blue pullover as the rest of the school. Programmes As a Round Square school, Westfield frequently participates in exchange programmes and service projects with other member schools. Girls from most year groups have the opportunity to visit other Round Square schools. There are also opportunities for younger students to participate in Junior and Young Round Square conferences aimed specifically at their own age groups and usually held in the UK or Europe.Round Square Extracurricular Activities A wide variety of activities are available ranging from sport to interest clubs to performing arts. Outdoor pursuits for Duke of Edinburgh Award participantshttp://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/local-news/westfield-school- gosforth-newcastle-introduces-1350579 offers girls the opportunity to experience the outdoors through expeditions and camping trips.

They are used primarily in the study of the relationship of the complexity class NP with other classes. The complexity class of all sparse languages is called SPARSE. Sparse languages are called sparse because there are a total of 2n strings of length n, and if a language only contains polynomially many of these, then the proportion of strings of length n that it contains rapidly goes to zero as n grows. All unary languages are sparse. An example of a nontrivial sparse language is the set of binary strings containing exactly k 1 bits for some fixed k; for each n, there are only \\\\binom{n}{k} strings in the language, which is bounded by nk.  Relationships to other complexity classes  SPARSE contains TALLY, the class of unary languages, since these have at most one string of any one length. Although not all languages in P/poly are sparse, there is a polynomial-time Turing reduction from any language in P/poly to a sparse language.Jin-Yi Cai.

The phrases \\"on the bit\\", \\"behind the bit\\" and \\"above the bit\\" are equestrian terms used to describe a horse's posture relative to the reins and the bridle bit. \\"The Art of Classical Riding--On the Bit\\", ArtOfRiding.com, 2010, web: AoR-Bit . A position on the bit is submissive to the rider's rein aids, given through the bit. When a horse is behind the bit, the head is tucked too far down and rearward. If above the bit, then the head is too high.  Technique  Being on the bit requires the horse to engage the hips and raise the back, which it cannot do when its head is pulled rearward. The neck is connected to the shoulders, and impeding the shoulders prevents extension of the forehand. This will cause the horse to hollow its back. A horse is properly placed, on the bit, by creating impulsion (pushing power) from the rider's driving aids, and then containing this forward energy in the hands, via the reins and bit. Impulsion causes the horse to engage its hind end, lift its back, and finally (when it becomes submissive and accepts contact with the bit, without resistance) results in the horse flexing at the poll, maintaining an elastic contact that is equal on both sides of the bit. The horse stretches over its topline and follows the bit's contact forward and down. Being \\"on the bit\\" is more than just a fancy head position; seesawing on the bit causes tension throughout the body. On the bit is synonymous with \\"on the aids\\", where the horse is relaxed, using its back and hindquarters, and is responsive to the aids without tension. As a test, the rider can soften contact, and the horse will maintain the pressure and follow the bit downward. The horse does not have to have its head perfectly perpendicular to the ground; it is acceptable, in dressage tests, to have the nose slightly in front of the vertical.  Common faults  How coming \\"above the bit\\" causes the back to drop. A horse avoiding contact, coming \\"behind the bit\\" A horse is not \\"on the bit\\" only because its head is held \\"at the vertical,\\" or perpendicular to the ground, as a horse can maintain this headset while remaining stiff, heavy on the bit, and unresponsive to the rider's aids. The vertical headset is not a guarantee by any means that the animal is truly on the bit, and many novice riders achieve the vertical headset, while losing the impulsion from the horse, because they ride \\"front to back,\\" or pull the horse's head down in an effort to make the horse appear to be accepting the aids. This is also sometimes seen when the horse is ridden in certain gadgets, such as draw reins, especially if the rider is not skilled enough to correctly use the piece of equipment. A horse that is on its forehand or unbalanced will not be able to come correctly on the bit, and will usually either lean on the rider's hands, placing too much pressure on the bit, pull against the rider and \\"root\\" or else brace upward against rein pressure and come \\"above the bit\\". This makes the contact heavy, and the aids can not come \\"through.\\" Some horses will avoid contact with the bit, rather than correctly accepting it, and come \\"behind the bit\\". This may occur either due to evasion by the horse (so it does not have to listen to the rider) or because the rider is using the bit too strongly or physically trying to pull the horse on the bit. It is a very common fault if the rider \\"see-saws\\" on the reins. Sometimes the horse will have a very strong contact, most commonly if its head is purposefully pulled in by the rider. Additionally, the horse will bring its nose closer to his chest, or \\"behind the vertical.\\" The most important test is if the horse will follow the contact forward, and down, if the reins are softened by the rider. If the horse follows, it is so to speak the horse that chooses to touch the rider with its mouth. If this quality of contact is established, the horse is really working on the bit, even if its head is a little in front of or behind the vertical.  Uses  Horses are required to go on the bit in certain riding disciplines, such as dressage. However, all horses ridden on contact are generally encouraged to go on the bit, as this not only makes them more responsive to the rider's aids, but also allows them to move in a more athletic manner since the animal is raising its back and bringing its hocks further under its body.

Buckminster Fuller in 1938, is the ability of technological advancement to do \\"more and more with less and less until eventually you can do everything with nothing,\\" that is, an accelerating increase in the efficiency of achieving the same or more output (products, services, information, etc.) while requiring less input (effort, time, resources, etc.). Fuller's vision was that ephemeralization will result in ever-increasing standards of living for an ever-growing population despite finite resources. The concept has been embraced by those who argue against Malthusian philosophy.. The subsequently coined economics term \\"dematerialization\\" refers to essentially the same concept. Fuller uses Henry Ford's assembly line as an example of how ephemeralization can continuously lead to better products at lower cost with no upper bound on productivity. Fuller saw ephemeralization as an inevitable trend in human development. The progression was from \\"compression\\" to \\"tension\\" to \\"visual\\" to \\"abstract electrical\\" (i.e., nonsensorial radiation, such as radio waves, x rays, etc.). Length measurement technologies in human development, for example, started with a compressive measure, such as a ruler. The compressive technique reached an upper limit with a rod. For longer measures, a tensive measure such as a string or rope was used. This reached an upper limit with sagging of the string. Next was a surveyor's telescope (visual). This reached an upper limit with curvature of the earth. Next was radio triangulation (abstract electrical). The technological progression is a continuing increase in length- measuring ability per pound of instrument, with no apparent upper limit according to Fuller.R.

Consequences to society  Francis HeylighenFrancis Heylighen, Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain\\". In Globalization as evolutionary process: modeling global change (p. 284). Routledge. and Alvin TofflerAlvin Toffler, Future Shock (1970), The Third Wave (1980), and Powershift (1990) have written that ephemeralization, though it may increase our power to solve physical problems, can make non-physical problems worse. According to Heylighen and Toffler, increasing system complexity and information overload make it difficult and stressful for the people who must control the ephemeralized systems. This might negate the advantages of ephemeralization. The solution proposed by HeylighenFrancis Heylighen, Tackling Complexity and Information Overload: intelligence amplification, attention economy and the global brain, draft paper, to be submitted to The Information Society, pages 20-44, 2002-04-12 is the integration of human intelligence, computer intelligence, and coordination mechanisms that direct an issue to the cognitive resource (document, person, or computer program) most fit to address it. This requires a distributed, self-organizing system, formed by all individuals, computers and the communication links that connect them. The self-organization can be achieved by algorithms. According to Heylighen, the effect is to superpose the contributions of many different human and computer agents into a collective map that may link the cognitive and physical resources relatively efficiently. The resulting information system could react relatively rapidly and adaptively to requests for guidance or changes in the situation. In Heylighen's view, the system could frequently be fed with new information from its myriad human users and computer agents, which it would take into account to offer the human users a list of the best possible approaches to achieve tasks. Heylighen believes near-optimization could be achieved both at the level of the individual who makes the request, and at the level of society which attempts to minimize the conflicts between the desires of its different members and to aim at long term, global progress while as much as possible protecting individual liberty and privacy.

Gosudarstvennyi znak kachestva SSSR) was the official Soviet mark for the certification of quality established in 1967. It was used to mark consumer, production, and technical goods to certify that they met quality standards and, in general, to increase the effectiveness of the production system in the USSR. The goods themselves or their packaging were marked, as was the accompanying documentation, labels or tags. Rules of its use were defined by GOST, an acronym for 'state standard' (gosudarstvennyy standart), section 1.9-67 (April 7, 1967). The right to use the sign was leased to the enterprises for 2‚Äì3 years based on the examination of the goods by the State Attestation Commission (, Gosudarstvennaya Atestatsionnaya Komissiya) that should certify that the goods are of the \\"higher quality category\\". That is: * their quality \\"meets or exceeds the quality of the best international analogs\\", * parameters of quality are stable, * goods fully satisfy Soviet state standards, * goods are compatible with international standards, * production of goods is economically effective, and * they satisfy the demands of the state economy and the population. Obtaining the sign allowed the enterprises to increase the state controlled price for the goods by ten percent. When the sign was introduced it indeed suggested high quality of the goods but after some time a lot of Soviet-made goods were certified for the sign while their quality often remained below expectations of customers. The sign was a pentagonal shield with a rotated letter K (from Russian word Kachestvo ‚Äì quality) stylized as scales below the Cyrillic abbreviation for USSR (, SSSR). After dissolution of the Soviet Union Russian government introduced its own sign for certification of quality known as Rostest mark (or R mark).

In 1894, Victor Shoe described M√©nard's work in l'Art et la Vie (Art and Life) as \\"visions of a pacified, bathed nature, of dawn and of twilight, where the soul seems to immerse itself in the innocence of daybreak, and breathe the divine anointment that comes with the dawn.\\"Jean-David Jumeau-Lafond, Les Peintres de l'√Çme: le Symbolisme Idealiste en France, exhibition catalog, Mus√©e d'Ixelles, Brussels, October 15 ‚Äì December 1999, (Gent: Snoeck-Ducaju & Zoon, and Antwerp: Pandora, c. 1999) File:Ren√© M√©nard Les errants.jpgThe Wanderers File:√âmile-Ren√© M√©nard - De lente.JPGSpring File:V√¥ie Appinne (Paisaje) - √âmile-Ren√© M√©nard.jpgView of the Apennines File:√âmile-Ren√©_M√©nard_-_The_Three_Graces,_1923.jpgThe Three Graces, 1923 ReferencesExternal links Category:1861 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Artists from Paris Category:19th-century French painters Category:Alumni of the Acad√©mie Julian Category:French male painters Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:French Symbolist painters Category:French portrait painters Category:Mythological painters Category:French landscape painters Category:Animal painters Category:Officiers of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery ","title":"√âmile-Ren√© M√©nard"},{"id":"12769745","text":"Sound is a hamlet (at ) and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. The hamlet is located to the south west of Nantwich. The civil parish covers and also includes the small settlements of Newtown and Sound Heath,Genuki: Sound (accessed 6 April 2010) with a total population at the 2011 Census of 239. Nearby villages include Aston, Ravensmoor and Wrenbury. The name is of Saxon origin and means \\"a sandy place\\". The first record of the township is in 1310. It was raided by Royalist forces in 1643, during the Civil War. The Methodist chapel was built in 1838, and a primary school on the boundary with Broomhall opened in 1876. Other historic buildings include a rare example of a malt kiln. The River Weaver runs along the southern boundary and the Welsh Marches railway line crosses the parish. The area is mainly agricultural, with dairy farming predominating. The flat terrain has an average elevation of around 60 metres. There is a small Site of Special Scientific Interest and Local Nature Reserve named Sound Heath, which forms an important habitat for freshwater invertebrates and breeding birds. Nationally scarce species observed here include the mud snail, great raft spider, a species of water scavenger beetle and the beautiful snout moth. History Sound, or Soond, is a name of Saxon origin which means a sandy place.Latham, p. 16 Sound is not mentioned in the Domesday survey.Latham, p. 18 In 1200‚Äì1300, there is evidence for a hamlet named Fouleshurst, which is thought to have been located near Fouleshurst (now Fullhurst) Hall on Sound Lane, in the north of the modern civil parish. However, no traces have yet been uncovered of this settlement.Latham, p. 19 Records exist of the township of Sound itself from 1310.Latham, pp. 20‚Äì21 The area of the modern civil parish was divided between two administrative units in the Nantwich Hundred: part fell within Wrenbury chapelry, which was served by St Margaret's Church, Wrenbury, and part within the ancient parish of Acton, which was served by St Mary's Church, Acton.Latham, p. 9 The earliest landowners were the Sound family, but the manor had passed to the Chetwode family by the reign of Edward IV (1461‚Äì1483) and by 1800, it was owned by the Cholmondeleys.Latham, p. 23 In April 1643, during the Civil War, Sound was one of several townships raided by Royalist forces. The diarist Edward Burghall wrote: In 1831 there was a hopyard north of Sound Hall, which had a malt kiln.

Several unnamed brooks also run through the parish, and many small meres and ponds are scattered across its farmland and woodland. The majority of the terrain is relatively flat, with an average elevation of around 60 metres; near the northern parish boundary and adjacent to the Weaver in the southwest the land is more undulating in character. There are several areas of woodland within the parish, including Sound Heath and Asphodel. The small scattered settlements of Sound () and Sound Heath () are centred on the junction of Sound Lane and Wrenbury Heath Road. The hamlet of Newtown () lies adjacent to the A530, between Newtown Road and Wrenbury Heath Road. Occasional farmhouses and cottages also lie along Sound Lane and Wrenbury Heath Road. The area is predominantly rural, with the major land use being agricultural. Dairy farming predominates, but there is also sheep pasture, horse paddocks and some arable fields.

A porch protects from the weather to some extent. Some porches have an outer door, others a simple gate, and in some cases the outer opening is not closed in any way. The porch at St Wulfram's Church, Grantham, like many others of the period, has a room above the porch. It once provided lodging for the priest, but now houses Francis Trigge Chained Library. Such a room is sometimes called a parvise which spelt as parvis normally means an open space or colonnade in front of a church entrance. In Scandinavia and Germany the porch of a church is often called by names meaning weaponhouse.For example, Norwegian v√•penhus It used to be believed that visitors stored their weapons there because of a prohibition against carrying weapons into the sanctuary, or into houses in general; (Note l. 325.

Although only a single prototype was completed, this served throughout the war, being used by both the Vichy French and Free French navies. Development and design In May 1935, the French Navy issued a specification for a long-range flying boat to replace the obsolete Breguet 521. To meet this requirement, Lat√©co√®re designed the Lat√©co√®re 611. This was a cantilever monoplane powered by four Gnome-Rhone 14N radial engines and fitted with a twin tail. It was also fitted with stabilising floats that retracted into the outer engine nacelles. The prototype was assembled at Biscarrosse, and first flew on 8 March 1939. Although it was intended that the aircraft be armed with a 25 mm cannon in a dorsal turret, this was unavailable, and was replaced by one carrying two 7.5 mm Darne machine guns, with a further four machine guns firing through portholes and two in a retractable tail position. In December 1939 the French Navy placed an order for twelve of a modified version, the Lat√©co√®re 612, which was to be powered by four Pratt & Whitney R-1830 radial engines. These aircraft, however, were never delivered. Operational history The prototype Lat√©co√®re 611 was delivered to the French Navy on 12 April 1940 and named Achenar, being flown to North Africa in June 1940 and subsequently disarmed under the terms of the Armistice. After being damaged in a collision with another flying boat, it eventually entered full service with the Vichy French Navy on 15 October 1941, operating with Escadrille 4E at Port Lyautey and Dakar. In November 1942, following the Allied Invasion of North Africa, Escadrille 4E switched sides and joined the Free French, carrying out anti- submarine patrols over the South Atlantic, later (October 1943) being enlarged to form Flotille 7F, which continued to fly the Lat√©co√®re 611 alongside Short Sunderlands. The Lat√©co√®re was re-armed in 1944, with the dorsal turret being fitted with two 50 cal. Browning machine guns and a similar gun being fitted in the tail. The sole Lat√©co√®re 611 was finally retired from service as a transport in 1947.

The command is part of Unix and Unix-like operating systems. In Unix, a block storage device must be formatted with a file system before it can be mounted and accessed through the operating system's filesystem hierarchy. History The command was originally implemented in the first version of Unix as a method to initialize either a DECtape (using the \\"t\\" argument) or an RK03 disk pack (using the \\"r\\" argument). The initialization process would write formatting data to the device so that it contained an empty file system. It created the super-block, i-list, and free list on the storage device and established the root directory with entries for \\".\\" and \\"..\\" (self and parent, respectively). The RK03 disk packs had 4872 available blocks after initialization, while the tapes had 578 blocks (at 512 bytes/block). The mkfs executable was kept in the /etc directory instead of a binary directory so it would not be inadvertently called and destroy information. Later implementations of Unix-like operating systems included the mkfs command, including HP-UX,HP-UX 11i Version 3. Hewlett-Packard Company. September 2010 (PDF) Minix, SunOS and Linux.The Linux man-pages Project Syntax The basic syntax of the command, which is common to all modern implementations, is: $ mkfs -t where '\`fs type\`' is the type of the filesystem and '\`device\`' is the target UNIX device to write the filesystem data to. Usually the \\"device\\" is a drive partition. Often the command is simply a wrapper for another command that performs the formatting for a specific file system. For example, $ mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sda1 would call the command \`mke2fs\` while passing along the appropriate arguments to format the device \`/dev/sda1\` with the ext3 filesystem. The default options for the command are stored in the file \`mke2fs.conf\`, usually in the \`/etc\` directory. Depending on the implementation and the specific file system requested, the command may have many options that can be specified such as inode size, block size, volume label, and other features. (See file system for details) The filesystem-specific commands that mkfs calls may be invoked directly by the user from the command line. In Linux, the convention has been to name the filesystem-specific commands as: \`mkfs.\`. Where \`\` is an abbreviation for the file system, e.g., \`mkfs.ext2\`, \`mkfs.msdos\`, \`mkfs.minix\`, etc. File systems supported by the command vary by implementation and include: MSDOS, SCO bfs, CPM, ext2, ext3, ext4, minix, fat (vfat), HFS, VXFS, RF disk, RK disk, DECtape, and NTFS.

(Jockey Club de Bogot√° - August 7, 1934) Urdaneta had a long relationship to former Presidents of Colombia. He was the son in law of President Carlos Holgu√≠n Mallarino, brother in law of president Jorge Holgu√≠n, and both nephews of President Manuel Mar√≠a Mallarino. Carlos Holguin had also been married to the sister of President Miguel Antonio Caro. Thus, his election as President was seen by many as the \\"continuance of a family tradition\\".Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 220, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 At an early age Urdaneta showed great interest for politics and he enlisted in the Colombian Conservative Party. He was elected to the city council of Bogot√°, to the Assembly of Cundinamarca and to the House of Representatives several times. Later, he was designated as Permanent Representative of Colombia to the United Nations, and Ambassador to Per√∫ and Argentina. Urdaneta was also appointed to the Ministries of Defense, Finance, and Foreign Affairs.  The Presidency  Urdaneta became President of Colombia on November 5, 1951, when President Laureano G√≥mez became ill and had to resign from the presidency.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 219, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 New congressional elections took place in 1951. The liberal party did not participate in this election, and thus, the composition of the new Congress was totally conservative. On October 30, 1951, the new Congress is sworn in, with the majority of members as followers of former president Mariano Ospina P√©rez. On October 31, Congress is notified of the intentions of president Laureano G√≥mez to request leave of absence due to his illness. Congress moved promptly to elect a \\"Designado a la Presidencia\\" (interim president).Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 217, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 The candidate for the \\"Designatura\\" (office of interim president) with the majority of votes in Congress was Gilberto Alzate Avenda√±o, who happened to be the majority leader of Congress. Laureano G√≥mez opposed his nomination, and rather appealed for the candidacy of Roberto Urdaneta. Congress was persuaded by his impassionate appeal (the last wishes of a dying man), and elected Urdaneta as interim president. Thus, Urdaneta took the oath of President, before a joint session of Congress, on November 5, 1951. By June 1953, President Laureano G√≥mez had recovered and was feeling better, and decided to regain control of the presidency. Before he did so, G√≥mez requested Urdaneta to remove General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla from his post as Chief of Staff of the Army. When Urdaneta failed to do so, G√≥mez showed up at the \\"Palacio de Nari√±o\\" (the presidents' palace), early in the morning of June 13, 1953, and proclaimed to be retaking his office as President.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 221, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 Immediately after his announcement, Laureano G√≥mez left the \\"Palacio de Nari√±o\\". Urdaneta remained in the president's office. Within hours, that same afternoon, General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, accompanied by other Generals of the Army's high command, presented himself before Urdaneta and stated: \\"In the name of the Army's high command, I have the charge to express to your Excellency that we are here to request that you continue acting as President of Colombia\\". Urdaneta, astonished, responded: \\"This morning I was removed from my post for not accepting an imposition, and now, I cannot retake it, as another imposition\\".Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 222, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 General Duarte Blum, on behalf of the high command, explained that it was not an imposition, but the honest desire of the Generals of the armed forces, whom did not have the administrative qualifications and experience that he had. General Rojas Pinilla pleaded with Urdaneta's wife, Clemencia Holgu√≠n, to try to persuade her husband to accept the Generals‚Äô request. Urdaneta replied once again: \\"I am most grateful and moved by the Army's high command demonstration of trust and loyalty, but since this morning I am no longer the President, because G√≥mez has retaken his office. In order for me to accept your offer, President G√≥mez must resign again to his office\\". General Rojas Pinilla had already ordered the mobilization of troops throughout Bogota and in major cities of the country. In light of Urdaneta's reluctance to accept the Army's request, General Rojas Pinilla proclaimed himself to be in charge of the office of the presidency.

It was also filmed in 1968. Description The protagonist of the play is William Maitland, a 39-year-old English solicitor who has come to hate his entire life. Much of the play consists of lengthy monologues in which Maitland tells the audience about his life, a life he now regards as an utter failure. He readily acknowledges that he is bored with his wife and children, and just as bored by the petty, meaningless love affairs he's been carrying on with other women. His career revolves around sordid divorce cases, and he's come to despise both his clients and his colleagues. Maitland drinks heavily, and enjoys bullying and insulting everyone he comes into contact with. In Act One, like a prosecutor presenting a case, Maitland brutally shows the audience the utter despair and mediocrity of his life. In Act Two, Maitland's crimes receive their due punishment, as he is deserted by everyone he ever cared about, including his clerk, his mistress and his wife. At times the play uses the technique of intercut monologues, which are arranged like dialogue but involve no communication between the characters. The role of Maitland was created by Nicol Williamson who played the role in Anthony Page's original Royal Court production, in its Broadway debut, and in the 1968 movie version. In 1965 the play transferred to Wyndham's Theatre in London's West End. Williamson played Maitland, with John Hurt as Jones, Cyril Raymond as Hudson, Clare Kelly as Joy, and Eleanor Fazan as Liz.

Replaced by the High Level Architecture (simulation) (HLA), it was used by the US military to link analytic and training simulations. ALSP consists of: #ALSP Infrastructure Software (AIS) that provides distributed runtime simulation support and management; #A reusable ALSP Interface consisting of generic data exchange message protocols; and #Participating simulations adapted for use with ALSP. History In 1990, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) employed The MITRE Corporation to study the application of distributed interactive simulation principles employed in SIMNET to aggregate-level constructive training simulations. Based on prototype efforts, a community- based experiment was conducted in 1991 to extend SIMNET to link the US Army's Corps Battle Simulation (CBS) and the US Air Force's Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM). The success of the prototype and users' recognition of the value of this technology to the training community led to development of production software. The first ALSP confederation, providing air-ground interactions between CBS and AWSIM, supported three major exercises in 1992. By 1995, ALSP had transitioned to a multi-Service program with simulations representing the US Army (CBS), the US Air Force (AWSIM), the US Navy (RESA), the US Marine Corps (MTWS), electronic warfare (JECEWSI), logistics (CSSTSS), and intelligence (TACSIM). The program had also transitioned from DARPA's research and development emphasis to mainstream management by the US Army's Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Contributions ALSP developed and demonstrated key aspects of distributed simulation, many of which were applied in the development of HLA. * No central node so that simulations can join and depart from the confederation at will * Geographic distribution where simulators can be distributed to different geographic locations yet exercise in the same simulated environment * Object ownership so each simulation controls its own resources, fires its own weapons and determines appropriate damage to its systems when fired upon * A message- based protocol for distributing information from one simulation to all other simulations. * Time management so that the times for all simulations appear the same to users and so that event causality is maintained ‚Äì events should occur in the same sequence in all simulations. * Data management permits all simulations to share information in a commonly understood manner even though each had its own representation of data. This includes multiple simulations controlling attributes of the same object. * An architecture that permits simulations to continue to use their existing architectures while participating in an ALSP confederation. Motivation In 1989, the Warrior Preparation Center (WPC) in Einsiedlerhof, Germany hosted the computerized military exercise ACE-89. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) used ACE-89 as a technology insertion opportunity by funding deployment of the Defense Simulation Internet (DSI). Its packetized video teleconferencing brought general officers of NATO nations face-to-face during a military exercise for the first time; this was well received. But the software application of DSI, distribution of Ground Warfare Simulation (GRWSIM), was less successful. The GRWSIM simulation was unreliable and its distributed database was inconsistent, degrading the effectiveness of the exercise. DARPA was funding development of a distributed tank trainer system called SIMNET where individual, computerized, tank-crew trainers were connected over local area networks and the DSI to cooperate in a single, virtual battlefield. The success of SIMNET, the disappointment of ACE-89, and the desire to combine existing combat simulations prompted DARPA to initiate research that lead to ALSP. Basic Tenets DARPA sponsored the design of a general interface between large, existing, aggregate-level combat simulations. Aggregate-level combat simulations use Lanchestrian models of combat rather than individual physical weapon models and are typically used for high-level training. Despite representational differences, several principles of SIMNET applied to aggregate-level simulations: * Dynamic configurability. Simulations may join and depart an exercise without restriction. * Geographic distribution. Simulations can reside in different geographic locations yet exercise over the same logical terrain. * Autonomous entities. Each simulation controls its own resources, fires its own weapons and, when one of its objects is hit, conducts damage assessment locally. * Communication by message passing. A simulation uses a message-passing protocol distribute information to all other simulations. The ALSP challenge had requirements beyond those of SIMNET: * Simulation time management. Typically, simulation time is independent of wall-clock time. For the results of a distributed simulation to be \\"correct,\\" time must be consistent across all simulations.Lamport, L. (1978). \\"Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System,\\" Communications of the ACM, 21(7), pp. 558-565, July. * Data management. The schemes for internal state representation differ among existing simulations, necessitating a common representational system and concomitant mapping and control mechanisms. * Architecture independence. Architectural characteristics (implementation language, user interface, and time flow mechanism) of existing simulations differed. The architecture implied by ALSP must be unobtrusive to existing architectures. Conceptual Framework A conceptual framework is an organizing structure of concepts that facilitates simulation model development.Balci, O., Nance, R.E., Derrick, E.J., Page, E.H. and Bishop, J.L. (1990). \\"Model Generation Issues in a Simulation Support Environment,\\" In: Proceedings of the 1990 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 257-263, New Orleans, LA, 9‚Äì12 December. Common conceptual frameworks include: event scheduling, activity scanning and process interaction. The ALSP conceptual framework is object-based where a model is composed of objects that are characterized by attributes to which values are assigned. Object classes are organized hierarchically in much the same manner as with object-oriented programming languages. ALSP supports a confederation of simulations that coordinate using a common model. To design a mechanism that permits existing simulations to interact, two strategies are possible: (1) define an infrastructure that translates between the representations in each simulation, or (2) define a common representational scheme and require all simulations to map to that scheme. The first strategy requires few perturbations to existing simulations; interaction is facilitated entirely through the interconnection infrastructure. However, this solution does not scale well. Because of an underlying requirement for scalability, the ALSP design adopted the second strategy. ALSP prescribes that each simulation maps between the representational scheme of the confederation and its own representational scheme. This mapping represents one of the three ways in which a simulation must be altered to participate in an ALSP confederation. The remaining modifications are: * Recognizing that the simulation doesn't own all of the objects that it perceives. * Modifying the simulation's internal time advance mechanism so that it works cooperatively with the other simulations within the confederation. In stand-alone simulations, objects come into (and go out of) existence with the passage of simulation time and the disposition of these objects is solely the purview of the simulation. When acting within a confederation, the simulation-object relationship is more complicated. The simulation-object ownership property is dynamic, i.e. during its lifetime an object may be owned by more than one simulation. In fact, for any value of simulation time, several simulations may own different attributes of a given object. By convention, a simulation owns an object if it owns the \\"identifying\\" attribute of the object. Owning an object's attribute means that a simulation is responsible for calculating and reporting changes to the value of the attribute. Objects not owned by a particular simulation but within the area of perception for the simulation are known as ghosts. Ghosts are local copies of objects owned by other simulations. When a simulation creates an object, it reports this fact to the confederation to let other simulations create ghosts. Likewise, when a simulation deletes an object, it reports this fact to enable ghost deletion. Whenever a simulation takes an action between one of its objects and a ghost, the simulation must report this to the confederation. In the parlance of ALSP, this is an interaction. These fundamental concepts provide the basis for the remainder of the presentation. The term confederation model describes the object hierarchy, attributes and interactions supported by a confederation. ALSP Infrastructure Software (AIS) The object-based conceptual framework adopted by ALSP defines classes of information that must be distributed. The ALSP Infrastructure Software (AIS) provides data distribution and process coordination. Principal components of AIS are the ALSP Common Module (ACM) and the ALSP Broadcast Emulator (ABE). ALSP Common Module (ACM) The ALSP Common Module (ACM) provides a common interface for all simulations and contains the essential functionality for ALSP. One ACM instance exists for each simulation in a confederation. ACM services require time management and object management; they include: * Coordinate simulations joining and departing from a confederation.. * Coordinate simulation local time with confederation time. * Filter incoming messages, so that simulations receive only messages of interest. * Coordinate ownership of object attributes, and permit ownership migration. * Enforce attribute ownership so that simulations report values only for attributes they own. =Time management= Joining and departing a confederation is an integral part of time management process. When a simulation joins a confederation, all other ACMs in the confederation create input message queues for the new simulation. Conversely, when a simulation departs a confederation the other ACMs delete input message queues for that simulation. ALSP time management facilities support discrete event simulation using either asynchronous (next-event) or synchronous (time-stepped) time advance mechanisms.Nance, R.E. (1971). \\"On Time Flow Mechanisms for Discrete Event Simulations,\\" Management Science, 18(l), pp. 59-93, September. The mechanism to support next-event simulations is # A simulation sends an event- request message to its ACM with a time parameter corresponding to simulation time T, (the time of its next local event). # If the ACM has messages for its simulation with timestamps older than or the same as T, the ACM sends the oldest one to the simulation. If all messages have timestamps newer than T, the ACM send a grant-advance to the simulation, giving it permission to process its local event at time T. # The simulation sends any messages resulting from the event to its ACM. # The simulation repeats from step (1). The mechanism to support time-stepped simulation is: # The simulation processes all events for some time interval (T, T + ?T]. # The simulation sends an advance request to its ACM for time T+?T. # The ACM sends all messages with time stamps on the interval (T, T + ?T] to the simulation, followed by a grant-advance to T+?T. # The simulation sends any messages for the interval (T, T + ?T] to the ACM. # The simulation repeats from step (1). AIS includes a deadlock avoidance mechanism using null messages. The mechanism requires that the processes have exploitable lookahead characteristics. =Object management= The ACM administers attribute database and filter information. The attribute database maintains objects known to the simulation, either owned or ghosted, and attributes of those objects that the simulation currently owns. For any object class, attributes may be members of * Create set. Attributes minimally required to represent an object * Interest set. Useful, but not mandatory, information * Update set. Object attribute values reported by a simulation to the confederation Information flow across the network can be further restricted through filters. Filtering provides discrimination by (1) object class, (2) attribute value or range, and (3) geographic location. Filters also define the interactions relevant to a simulation. If (an update passes all filter criteria)  If (the object is known to the simulation) Send new attribute values to simulation  Else (object is unknown) If (enough information is present to create a ghost)  Send a create message to the simulation Else (not enough information is known)  Store information provided  Send a request to the confederation for missing data Else (the update fails filter criteria)  If (the object is known to the simulation) Send a delete message to the simulation  Else Discard the update data The ownership and filtering information maintained by the ACM provide the information necessary to coordinate the transfer of attribute ownership between simulations. ALSP Broadcast Emulator (ABE) An ALSP Broadcast Emulator (ABE) facilitates the distribution of ALSP information. It receives a message on one of its communications paths and retransmits the message on all of its remaining communications paths. This permits configurations where all ALSP components are local to one another (on the same computer or on a local area network). It also permits configurations where sets of ACMs communicate with their own local ABE with inter-ABE communication over wide area networks. Communication Scheme The ALSP communication scheme consists of (1) an inter-component communications model that defines the transport layer interface that connects ALSP components, (2) a layered protocol for simulation-to-simulation communication, object management, and time management, (3) a message filtering scheme to define the information of interest to a simulation, and (4) a mechanism for intelligent message distribution. Inter-component Communications Model AIS employs a persistent connection communications modelBoggs, D.R. Shoch, J.F., Taft, E.A., and Metcalfe, R.M. (1979). \\"PUP: An Internetwork Architecture,\\" Report CSL-79- 10, XEROX Palo Alto Research Center, July. to provide the inter-component communications. The transport layer interface used to provide inter-component communications was dictated by simulation requirements and the transport layer interfaces on AIS-supporting operating systems: local VMS platforms used shared mailboxes; non-local VMS platforms used either Transparent DECnet or TCP/IP; and UNIX-like platforms use TCP/IP. ALSP Protocol The ALSP protocol is based on a set of orthogonal issues that comprise ALSP's problem space: simulation-to-simulation communication, object management, and time management. These issues are addressed by a layered protocol that has at the top a simulation protocol with underlying simulation/ACM, object management, time management, and event distribution protocols. =Simulation Protocol= The simulation protocol is the main level of the ALSP protocol. It consists of four message types: * Update. Objects in ALSP are defined by a unique id number, a class, and a set of attributes associated with a c1ass. As a simulation changes the state its objects, it sends update messages to the ACM that provide initial or changed attribute values. The ACM then distributes the information via AIS to other simulations in that have indicated interest. * Interaction. Interactions between objects are identified by kind. Interaction kinds are described by parameters, just as objects are described by attributes. When a simulation's object engages either another simulation's object or a geographic area, the simulation sends an interaction message to the ACM for further dissemination to other interested simulations. * Refresh request. A simulation can request an update of a set of attribute values for any object or class of objects by sending a refresh request message to the confederation. * Delete. When a simulation causes one of its objects to cease to exist, the simulation sends a delete message to inform other simulations. The simulation protocol is text-based. It is defined by an LALR( 1) context- free grammar. The semantics of the protocol are confederation-dependent, where the set of classes, class attributes, interactions, and interaction parameters are variable. Therefore, the syntactical representation of the simulation protocol may be defined without a priori knowledge of the semantics of the objects and interactions of any particular confederation. =Simulation/ACM Connection Protocol= The simulation/ACM connection protocol provides services for managing the connection between a simulation and its ACM and a method of information exchange between a simulation and its ACM. Two services control distribution of simulation protocol messages: events and dispatches. Event messages are time-stamped and delivered in a temporally-consistent order. Dispatch messages are delivered as soon as possible, without regard for simulation time. Additional protocol messages provide connection state, filter registration, attribute lock control, confederation save control, object resource control, and time control services. =Object Management Protocol= The object management protocol is a peer-level protocol that sits below the simulation protocol and provides object management services. ACMs solely use it for object attribute creation, acquisition, release, and verification (of the consistency of the distributed object database). These services allow AIS to manage distributed object ownership. Distributed object ownership presumes that no single simulation must own all objects in a confederation, but many simulations require knowledge of some objects. A simulation uses simulation protocol update messages to discover objects owned by other simulations. If this simulation is interested in the objects, it can ghost them (track their locations and state) and model interactions to them from owned objects. Locks implement attribute ownership. A primary function of the object management protocol is to ensure that a simulation only updates attributes for which it has acquired a lock. The object manager in the ACM manages the objects and object attributes of the owned and ghosted objects known to the ACM. Services provided by the simulation/ACM protocol are used by the simulations to interact with the ACM's attribute locking mechanism. The coordination of status, request, acquisition, and release of object attributes, between ACMs, uses the object management protocol. Each attribute of each object known to a given ACM has a status that assumes one of three values: * Locked. A simulation controls the attribute and may update the attribute value. A simulation \\"owns\\" the attribute if it has that attribute locked. A simulation \\"owns\\" the object if it has its id attribute locked. * Unlocked. No simulation currently controls the attribute. Any simulation asking for control is granted control. * Gone. The state of control is held elsewhere in the confederation. From the ACM's perspective, objects come into existence through the registration process performed by its simulation or through the discovery of objects registered by other simulations. The initial state attribute locks for registered objects and discovered objects is as follows: * Object Registration places each object-attribute pair in the locked state. The simulation may optionally specify attributes to be in the unlocked state. * Object Discovery adds an object to the object database as a ghosted object. All of the attributes for this object are marked with a status of gone. =Time Management Protocol= The time management protocol is also a peer-level protocol that sits below the simulation protocol. It provides time management services for synchronizing simulation time among ACMs. The protocol provides services for the distributed coordination of a simulation's entrance into the confederation, time progression, and confederation saves. The join/resign services and time synchronization mechanisms are described in Section earlier. The save mechanism provides fault tolerance. Coordination is required to produce a consistent snapshot of all ACMs, translators and simulations for a particular value of simulation time. Message Filtering The ACM uses simulation message filtering to evaluates the content of a message received from the confederation. The ACM delivers messages to its simulation that are of interest, and pass filtering criteria and discards those that are not of interest. The ACM filters two types of messages: update messages and interaction messages. Update messages. The ACM evaluates update messages based on the simulation's update message filtering criteria that the simulation provides. As discussed in earlier, when an ACM receives an update message there are four possible outcomes: (1) the ACM discards the message, (2) the ACM sends the simulation a create message, (3) the ACM sends the simulation the update message, or (4) the ACM sends the simulation a delete message. Interaction messages. An ACM may discard interaction messages because of the kind parameter. The kind parameter has a hierarchical structure similar to the object class structure. The simulation informs its ACM of the interaction kinds that should pass or fail the interaction filter. Message Distribution To minimize message traffic between components in an ALSP confederation, AIS employs a form of intelligent message routing that uses the Event Distribution Protocol (EDP).Weatherly, R.M., Wilson, A.L. and Griffin, S.P. (1993). \\"ALSP - Theory, Experience, and Future Directions,\\" In: Proceedings of the 1993 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 1068-1072, Los Angeles, CA, 12‚Äì15 December. The EDP allows ACMs to inform the other AIS components about the update and interaction filters registered by their simulations. In the case of update messages, distribution of this information allows ACMs to only distribute data on classes (and attributes of classes) that are of interest to the confederation. The ABE also use this information to send only information that is of interest to the components it serves. For interaction messages, the process is similar, except that the kind parameter in the interaction message determines where the message is sent.

It lies on a narrow coastal plain flanked by the Pacific Ocean to the east and a steep sandstone precipice known as the Illawarra Escarpment to the west, most notably Mount Keira, joined to the escarpment by a high saddle. The coastal plain is widest in the south and narrows to the north. Despite being on a plain there are minor hills within it, most notably Mount Nebo to the west, and closest to Wollongong is the hill mass west of the railway of Mount Mangerton and Mount Saint Thomas which gives a distinct character to the town, Church Hill and Smiths Hill in the CBD and just north in the high-rise apartment district west of the harbour, Flagstaff Hill at Flagstaff Point, Cobblers Hill to the southwest of Figtree, Flagstaff Hill, home of the Nan Tien Temple, a local landmark, Cringila Hill to the south, and Hospital Hill to the west, north of a small vale separating it from Mount Mangerton. These hills do not generally exceed a hundred metres or so in height. Mount Keira road, the first and still used pass over the escarpment and past the mountain of that name, follows a low ridge, one of several such minor ridges in the plain, from Hospital Hill, formerly Garden Hill, on top of which the Wollongong Hospital is situated. The plain is much lower than the escarpment, but contains low hills and small valleys, which gives the city a distinct and interesting mix of altitude. Mangerton and Mount St Thomas both have very small areas of bushland reserve, but littering and illegal bikeriding have become a problem. However, efforts are being made to the contrary such as bushcare volunteering. To the northwest of the city foothills of Mount Keira travel down towards the coast creating a rippled look, as at the Wollongong Botanic Gardens. North of Wollongong is Stuart Park/Fairy Lagoon, part of the Fairy/Para Creek system. North of this is Puckeys Estate Reserve, site of a salt works, and a bushwalking reserve. This reserve is known for its birdlife and coastal wetlands. The shallow lagoon is prone to tidal change and has been known to flood. To the south of the city is J.J.Kelly Park and south of this the Rotary Greenhouse Park, once a waste pile it has been planted into a garden area and has a bike track and lookout over the city and Port Kembla steelworks. It also has views to the mountains and over the city. This hill has no official name but is known by some locals as 'the overseer'. Below this hill to the west is a small area of wetlands, the remnants of the once larger Tom Thumb Lagoon which once stretched to Swan Street but is now restricted to this small area of nature reserve. Most of the city's northern suburbs are on more level ground, with some mild hills such as Woonona and Bulli Ridges. Ground level in the plain generally lies under thirty metres until reaching the foothills. To the north of Wollongong the plain becomes so narrow that the coastal road Lawrence Hargrave Drive once precariously hugged the cliffline until rock falls forced its closure. It was replaced in 2005 by the Sea Cliff Bridge. The bridge carries both vehicular and pedestrian traffic just off the coast, crossing the submerged rock shelf. The Illawarra Railway must go through several tunnels to reach the Sydney metropolitan area. The Southern Freeway and Old Princes Highway provide alternative inland routes, descending the escarpment further south at Bulli Pass or at Mount Ousley, entering the coastal plain at Gwynneville, just north of Wollongong's city centre. Pass building was at first done by convicts and some old passes remain as tracks or management trails, such as O'Brien's Road at Mount Nebo and Rixons Pass west of Woonona. Wollongong Harbor The Escarpment ranges between 150 and 750 metres (490 and 2,460 ft) above sea level, with locally famous mountains such as Mount Keira, 464 metres, Mount Kembla, 534 metres, Broker's Nose (Corrimal), 440 metres and Mount Murray to the south, 768 metres. The Escarpment contains strata of coal measures, and the adit entrances to many coal mines have been established along the slopes of the Escarpment right throughout Wollongong. The plain itself is traversed by several short but flood-prone and fast-flowing streams and creeks such as Para Creek, Allans Creek and Mullet Creek. These plains consist of highly fertile alluvium, which made Wollongong so attractive to agriculturists in the 19th century. The coastline itself consists of many beaches characterised by fine pale gold-coloured sands; however, these beaches are sometimes interrupted by prominent and rocky headlands jutting into the sea. Just southeast of Wollongong City, near Red Point at Port Kembla, atop a coastal rise 71 meters above the sea, there is a military reserve and north of it sit the remains of defense constructions known as Hill 60 (used during World War II period). The fortifications were manned by the Illowra Battery. Below Hill 60 lies a beach, the southern end of which offers the less pleasant view of sewage works. However, out to sea across from the beach, there's a group of five islands (known as \\"The Five Islands\\"). The two northern islands are called the \\"Tom Thumb Islands\\" after the vessel used by late 18th century explorers/captains in the British Navy, George Bass and Matthew Flinders. The island closest to the reserve (among the southern three) is called Rocky Islet and is little more than a rocky projection from the water. The next island is called Big Island, and is made of two almost separated parts, an eastern and western, thus creating the common myth that it comprises two of the five islands. The third is Martins Island, named after Bass and Flinders' assistant. The islands are a wildlife refuge. A large coastal saltwater lagoon called Lake Illawarra is to the south of the city, south of the Wonwongarang ridge, separated from the Pacific Ocean by a long sandy spit, being once a bay. Just to the north of the lake is Port Kembla, a natural harbour that has been considerably expanded by human-made excavation and reclamation works. Inner City Geography The geography is characterised by Flagstaff Point to the east, and Wollongong Beach south of that. To the north is Wollongong Harbour, west of Flagstaff Point and going north, and north of this is North Wollongong or simply North Beach and the lagoon at Puckeys Estate Reserve. Wollongong Beach is a northern extenuation of Coniston Beach and goes relatively straight north to Flagstaff Point. West of the beach is Lang Park, originally a freshwater lagoon. This point is a headland with eroded low-level cliffs and rocky areas about it, including two 'formations', Pulpit Rock to the north and a similar blockier rock formation to the south. These rocks also include the old Nun's Baths and a seawall of the old fort. This hill is significant historically and contains within it old coke ovens, and was the site of a flagstaff and cottage, as well as military operations during the war (called Hill 60, see above). It is the site of several restored canons and two lighthouses, a feature peculiar to the city in the state. The older one, at the harbour entrance, dates to the 1880s and is made of boiler plate, the newer one, constructed in 1937, stands atop the hill and is still in use today, though using an automated system rather than a manned operation system. The point has a lookout and picnic area, a grassy area extends mostly over it and a cliff walk is available along the fence built to stop suicides and other dangers. A trigonometry station, though broken, stands at the eastern tip of the point. The point is shaped roughly like a B and has an inwards facing area to the right of the trigonometry station. To the west of Flagstaff Point is Belmore Basin and Brighton Beach. Belmore Basin is the man-made section of Wollongong Harbour and was built using convict labour and is a heritage site with plaques along a history walk. There are two eastern breakwaters, a small stubby one of cement topped stone for the old lighthouse, and a large artificial boulder one with a light at the end for aiding ships in fog. At the portside is the fish market and a number of restaurants. Along the harbour dock are several charter vessels and private fishing boats. In the main harbour are private yachts and recreational vessels. This is to the west. Brighton Beach has recently been heavily eroded by the sea and is very thin. It stretches from the Lions Park playgrounds to the east to the western breakwater to the west. This is owned by the department of lands and used by photographers. From here the coastal cliff runs to North Beach, passing the baths and indoor seapools. Along here the Wollongong to Thirroul Bike Track or Heartcare Walk runs, this section is the Peace Mile section and runs to North Beach. Atop the cliffs, the edge of Smiths Hill mass, is another path and Cliff Drive. Settlement goes up to this road. The cliffs and grass/bushland about them are managed by bushcare groups and include native and invasive weed species. Lantana and Bitou Bush are prevalent, as well as Moreton Bay Figs and Acacias. North of this is North Beach at the end of the cliff. This popular surfing spot is used for competitions and private recreation, though has been damaged by erosion in the June 2007 windgusts. North Beach stretches to Fairy Meadow Beach at Stuart Park Lagoon. West of this is a four to five-metre rise behind which is Stuart Park, a local recreational grounds. The lagoon is salt water and harbours many bird and fish species but is prone to littering.

He died in Nashville, Tennessee. Controversy A controversy followed the printing of his obituary in the press. Some of the photographs that had been attributed to O'Donnell were actually shot by other photographers. A photograph of a saluting John F. Kennedy Jr. during the funeral for his father in 1963 was taken by Stan Stearns for United Press International, not by O'Donnell. O'Donnell also claimed credit for a photograph showing Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill during a wartime meeting in Tehran, Iran, in 1943, but O'Donnell is not known to have been in Tehran at the time. O'Donnell's son Tyge O'Donnell attributes some of the instances of his father's taking credit for others' work to the onset of dementia in the 1990s.

New Jersey 101.5 * In 2005, Carton became embroiled with an on-the-air feud with the then Governor of New Jersey, Richard Codey. Carton made comments about Codey's wife Mary-Jo's battle with postpartum depression, prompting Codey himself to confront Carton in the studio. Carton would say \\"What Governor Codey ought to do is approve the use of medical marijuana so women can have a joint and relax instead of putting their babies in a microwave. Then all they want to do is cook Doritos. Women who claim they suffer from this postpartum depression ... they must be crazy in the first place.\\"Can‚Äôt Stop The Bleeding ¬ª NJ Governor Defends Wife‚Äôs Microwave Contemplation cantstopthebleeding.com Codey would go back to respond: \\"I wish I weren't governor, I'd take you out\\", but did not say he would challenge Carton to a fight.

He duplicated the stunt on January 8, 2010, after betting the New York Jets would miss the playoffs. * On May 28, 2013, the prologue to his book Loudmouth leaked. It begins with the second Brooklyn Bridge walk and it is rough on his \\"petty\\" co-workers Mike Francesa and Joe Benigno: \\"Joe [Benigno] had gone out of his way to be an asshole to us (Boomer and Carton) when we first started. Joe attacked because he thought he would ingratiate himself to Mike Francesa, the longtime afternoon show host who also, by his own admission, went out of his way to try to prevent us from being successful. In reality, Mike didn't give a shit what Joe thought, but he certainly cared about how the station was reacting to us...\\" Awards * Talkers Magazine has named him the second-most important and influential Sports Talk Show Host in America every year they have released their \\"Heavy Hundred Sports Talk Show List\\".

Prior to the enactment of this statute, land could be passed by descent only if and when the landholder had competent living relatives who survived him, and it was subject to the rules of primogeniture. When a landholder died without any living relatives, his land would escheat to the Crown. The statute was something of a political compromise between Henry VIII and English landowners, who were growing increasingly frustrated with primogeniture and royal control of land. The Statute of Wills created a number of requirements for the form of a will, many of which, , survive in common law jurisdictions. Specifically, most jurisdictions still require that a will must be in writing, signed by the testator (the person making the will) and witnessed by at least two other persons. The Uniform Probate Code in the United States carries forward the two witness requirement of the Statute of Wills, at Section 2-502., except that a document is valid as a holographic will, whether or not witnessed, if the signature and material portions of the document are in the testator‚Äôs handwriting.Uniform Probate Code s. 2-502.

Background The Neo- Assyrian Empire, from the year 639 BC, had been suffering from a decline in their power, culminating in Babylonian and Median invasions of their lands. The city of Arrapha fell in 615 BC, followed by Assur in 614 BC, and finally the famed Nineveh, the newest capital of Assyria, in 612 BC. Despite the brutal massacres that followed, the Assyrians survived as a political entity and escaped to Harran under their new king, Ashur-uballit II. Establishing Harran as a capital for the Assyrians caught the attention of the Babylonian King Nabopolassar and Median King Cyaxares, who were determined to forever destroy the threat of Assyrian resurgence. Siege Assyrian annals record no more after 610 BC \\\\- the presumed date of the siege. The siege lasted for another year before the city finally fell in 609 BC. Not much is known of the siege itself ‚Äî it is presumed that Ashur-uballit II was killed in the battle. Aftermath With the fall of Harran, the Assyrian empire ceased to exist as a state. Remnants of the former Assyrian empire's army met up with the Egyptian forces that had won at Megiddo. In 605 BC, the Babylonians were again successful, as they defeated Egyptians along with part of the army of the former Assyria at Carchemish, ending the Egyptian intervention in the Near East.

The village church is that of Transfiguration of the Lord ().The Orthodox Archdiocese of Nizhny Novgorod, Kstovo District Location The village is located near the intersection of the Russian highway M-7 (Nizhny Novogord‚ÄìKazan) and an important local road connecting Bolshaya Yelnya (a junction on the old Nizhny Novgorod‚ÄìKazan highway, with an easy connection with the important Verkhnie Pechery development in Nizhny Novgorod's north- eastern Nizhegorodsky District) with Shcherbinki (a similarly important development in the city's south-eastern Prioksky District). A railway runs by the village as well. This location, making the area of the village a convenient site for any facility intended to serve all of Nizhny Novgorod's Upper City as well as neighboring Kstovo, made the village see two large-scale construction projects within the last thirty years. GAST In the early 1980s, the construction of Gorky Nuclear District Heating Plant (, GAST) was started. Unlike a conventional nuclear power plant, the facility was meant not to generate electricity, but simply to heat water for heating apartment blocks throughout Nizhny Novgorod's Upper City. By the early 1990s, after spending some $1 billion of investment money, the station building (although not the nuclear equipment inside) and the hot-water pipelines connecting it to the city had been mostly completed; but completing the project became infeasible in the post-Chernobyl political climate. In the years since the abandonment of the project, the building has been either disused, or used by local entrepreneurs for a variety of purposes, including bottling liquor.On-line press conference with Sergey Obozov, director of Rosenergoprom , 21 Dec 2006. (Accessed August 14, 2007). MEGA In the 2000s, the same convenient location made the Fedyakovo the site of another major construction project. MEGA, the IKEA-owned Russian mall developer, chose the site for its first mall in Nizhny Novgorod metropolitan area. Open in October 2006, the megamall, anchored by an IKEA store and an Auchan hypermarket, has become one the region's premier retail facilities. Ample car parking, free shuttle buses to Nizhny Novgorod's outer neighborhoods and Kstovo, as well as service by regular commuter buses and \\"routed taxis\\" provide easy access for customers from throughout the metropolitan area.

Background Born in Abilene, Texas, Keedy grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her father worked for the United States Postal Service. She has a younger brother. Career In the mid-to late 1980s, Keedy was one of the lead singers of the Milwaukee club and dance music band, Gerard. The band, co- founded by Greg Gerard, was known for its rotation of lead singers that included Eric Ben√©t (who later signed with EMI) and his sister Lisa. In 1989, Keedy and Greg Gerard were married (they later divorced). That same year, the couple signed a publishing deal with Geffen Records. In February 1990, Keedy was signed Arista Records. Her debut album, Chase the Clouds, was released in March 1991 to mixed but mainly positive reviews. The album's first single, \\"Save Some Love\\", became a top 20 hit, peaking at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. To promote the album, Keedy toured Japan and Europe and opened for Michael Bolton during the Milwaukee Summerfest. The album's second single, \\"Wishing on the Same Star\\", was less successful, peaking at No. 86 on the Hot 100. Due to management changes at Arista Records, promotional support for the single was pulled, and no other singles from the album were released. For a time, Keedy remained at Arista and attempted to work on a second record, but continuing management shifts eventually led to the project being shelved. She was released by the record label soon after. Keedy then moved back to Wisconsin and continued making music. In the mid 1990s, she joined a local cover band, The Orphans. After leaving the band in May 1996, Keedy teamed up with then husband, guitarist Royce Hall of The Mosleys, to form the band The LuvByrds.

Formerly included within the grey apalis (A. cinerea) but is now commonly considered to be a separate species. It has two subspecies: A. a. alticola and A. a. dowsetti Description It is 12‚Äì13 cm long with a long tail and fairly long, slender bill. The legs and feet are pinkish and the eye is pale orange. The upperparts are grey-brown, becoming chocolate-brown on the crown and cheeks. The underparts are whitish. The adult male and female are alike; juvenile birds are more olive above and slightly yellowish below. In A. a. alticola, the outer tail-feathers have white tips and outer webs and the next three pairs of tail-feathers have small white tips. A. a. dowsetti has entirely white outer tail-feathers. The grey apalis is similar but has a grey-brown head and dark eye. The outer tail-feathers are white like those of A. a. dowsetti but it does not overlap in range with that subspecies. The song of the brown-headed apalis is a series of loud, high-pitched \\"chip\\" notes. Distribution and habitat It has a patchy distribution in central and east Africa. It inhabits forest and secondary growth at mid to high altitudes. It is often seen in pairs or small groups and frequently joins other bird species in mixed-species feeding flocks. A. a. alticola occurs in parts of Angola, Zambia, Malawi, south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania and the Nguruman Escarpment in southern Kenya. In locations where its range overlaps with the grey apalis, it is restricted to the forest edge. A. a. dowsetti is found only on the Marungu plateau in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

In the 1950s, there were attempts to overturn baseball's exemption from anti-trust laws, especially in Toolson v. New York Yankees. :\\"Well, Casey was winning...\\" Casey Stengel was the manager of the perennially great New York Yankees from 1949 until 1960, during which time they won the World Series seven times. :\\"Midget Gaedel\\": In 1951, St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck hired Gaedel for a one-day stunt, sending the 3-foot, 7-inch Eddie Gaedel up to the plate as a pinch-hitter. :\\"And Ike was the only one winning down in Washington\\" refers to U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower. The Washington Senators baseball club was a perennially losing team. :\\"The Oklahoma Kid\\": This refers to Mantle, who was from Oklahoma. :\\"Bobby Bonds can play for everyone\\": Bonds played for eight teams in his career, and by 1981 had played for all eight of those teams within eight seasons. :\\"Rose is at the Vet\\": After spending 16 years with the Cincinnati Reds in 1978 Pete Rose joined the Philadelphia Phillies, who at the time played at Veterans Stadium. :\\"Rusty again is a Met\\": Staub had been traded away by the New York Mets following the 1975 season but returned in 1981. :\\"And the great Alexander is pitchin' again in Washington\\" is actually a double reference--to Grover Cleveland Alexander and to U.S. President Ronald Reagan. When the song was released, Reagan had recently assumed the presidency; the line refers to the fact that in his former career as a film actor Reagan had portrayed Alexander in the movie The Winning Team. :\\"If Cooperstown is calling, it's no fluke\\": The Baseball Hall of Fame is sometimes referred to metonymically as \\"Cooperstown\\", as it is located in the town of Cooperstown, New York. Ultimately only five of the players mentioned in this verse were elected to the Hall of Fame. Jackson, Seaver, Carew, Perry, and Schmidt made it; Quisenberry, Garvey and Blue, were not. : \\"Say hey\\": Used in the final chorus, Willie Mays was known as \\"The Say Hey Kid.\\" : The refrain of the first two verses includes the line \\"They knew 'em all from Boston to Dubuque\\". In the baseball-themed movie Field of Dreams, released eight years after this song, most of the movie's Boston scenes were filmed in Dubuque, Iowa. Later versions The song quickly gained popularity among baseball fans, and soon Cashman began recording alternate versions of the song, each focusing on a single major-league team. In some cases, the team-specific versions have been rewritten and updated over time.

It was built in 1897 to serve the Holy Cross congregation of Batavia, many of whom were Irish immigrants who came to work in local quarries. The building operated as a church until the 1990s, when the property was transferred to the Batavia Park District. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History Col. Joseph Lyon moved to the area now known as Batavia, Illinois in 1834. He built the first schoolhouse in Kane County, which also served as the first building for organized religion in the county. Starting in the 1840s, Batavia became a major source of limestone for the Chicago region. Batavia was largely a Methodist settlement, due to large numbers of Swedish immigrants who came to work in the quarries. The first Catholic services were held in private homes in 1854. Led by Father Sullivan, the followers were mostly Irish immigrants. The Catholics took over a vacant church building for their services in 1870 and became the Holy Cross congregation. As the congregation grew in the late 19th century, they decided to construct a new building. Milo Kemp owned the piece of property on which the church was built. Fr. George Henry Rathz oversaw the construction of the Gothic Revival building. Construction was slowed due to the Panic of 1896 and was dedicated on June 15, 1897. Upon completion, the size of the congregation was 300 people. James William Shannon, a member of the church and owner of Shannon Quarry, donated the limestone for the project and functioned as the main builder. Due to large contributions from volunteers, the church only cost $12,000 to build. A small, one-story schoolhouse was added to the lot in 1960. In the 1980s, the congregation again needed a larger building to serve its needs. They purchased a site and built the church that is now known as Holy Cross Catholic Church at 2300 Main Street. On April 27, 1996, the old building was transferred to the Batavia Park District and serves as the assembly hall of the Eastside Community Center. A corridor was added between the former church and the schoolhouse to facilitate travel between the two buildings in their new capacity. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 20, 1999. The building is on a lot in a residential neighborhood three blocks east of the Fox River. The church itself is with an entrance facing the south. The nave is has been renamed Shannon Hall (for the builder). The north side of the building features a six-sided apse. The bell tower is in the southwest and rises with a steeply pitched gable. A window forms a quatrefoil surrounded with circles above the main door. The roof is covered with asbestos shingles.

Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 1994. 32: 277‚Äì318 This should happen as the ICM (a plasma) is quickly losing its energy by the emission of X-rays. The X-ray brightness of the ICM is proportional to the square of its density, which rises steeply towards the centres of many clusters. Also the temperature falls to typically a third or a half of the temperature in the outskirts of the cluster. The typical [predicted] timescale for the ICM to cool is relatively short, less than a billion years. As material in the centre of the cluster cools out, the pressure of the overlying ICM should cause more material to flow inwards (the cooling flow). In a steady state, the rate of mass deposition, i.e. the rate at which the plasma cools, is given by : \\\\dot{M} = \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\frac{L \\\\mu m}{kT}, where L is the bolometric (i.e. over the entire spectrum) luminosity of the cooling region, T is its temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant and Œºm is the mean molecular mass. Cooling flow problem It is currently thought that the very large amounts of expected cooling are in reality much smaller, as there is little evidence for cool X-ray emitting gas in many of these systems. This is the cooling flow problem. Theories for why there is little evidence of cooling include * Heating by the central Active galactic nucleus (AGN) in clusters, possibly via sound waves (seen in the Perseus and Virgo clusters) * Thermal conduction of heat from the outer parts of clusters * Cosmic ray heating * Hiding cool gas by absorbing material * Mixing of cool gas with hotter material Heating by AGN is the most popular explanation, as they emit a lot of energy over their lifetimes, and some of the alternatives listed have theoretical problems.

Life Konrad was the fourth son of Henry II the Pious, Duke of Silesia and High Duke of Poland from 1238, by his wife Anna, daughter of the P≈ôemyslid king Ottokar I of Bohemia. At the time of his father's death in the 1241 Battle of Legnica against the Golden Horde, he and his younger brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw were placed under the guardianship of their eldest brother Duke Boles≈Çaw II Rogatka. After Henry's sudden death, the Silesian Piasts were not able to maintain their dominant position: Boles≈Çaw II tried to succeed his father on the Polish throne at Krak√≥w, but eventually could not prevail against his Piast cousin Konrad I of Masovia. In order to avoid further fragmentation of the paternal lands, the elder duke, with the approval of their mother, sent Konrad to study in Paris, where he was to be educated with the intention of becoming a priest in the future. However, in 1248, when the young man found out about the division of the family lands between his older brothers Boles≈Çaw II, ruling as a Duke of Legnica, and Henry III the White, Duke at Wroc≈Çaw, he returned to the country and claimed his part of the Silesian inheritance. Soon an preliminary agreement was reached under which Konrad remained under the protection and care of his older brother, who gave him the title of co-ruler in Legnica. Boles≈Çaw II (who wanted to get rid of him) still proposed Konrad for spiritual posts: first, as Provost of G≈Çog√≥w Cathedral, and then Bishop of Passau in Bavaria. Though he had not reached the canonical age, he was elected by the Passau cathedral chapter to succeed the deposed bishop R√ºdiger of Bergheim; however, without approval by the Roman Curia. Konrad, nevertheless, didn't have any intention of pursuing an ecclesiastical career. He never entered Passau and soon resumed his conflict with Boles≈Çaw II. Partition of Silesia 1249‚Äì1273, Konrad's Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w in green In June 1249 Konrad fled to Greater Poland, where he could count on the support of Duke Przemys≈Ç I. In 1251 he campaigned Boles≈Çaw's ducal lands and he managed to conquer Bytom Odrza≈Ñski. Konrad's bonds with the Piast dukes of Greater Poland were reinforced after his marriage with Przemys≈Ç I's sister Salome. His other brother Henry III the White soon became another ally in the fight against Boles≈Çaw II. With the help of his new allies, and thanks to the revolt of the townspeople of G≈Çog√≥w, the campaign against Boles≈Çaw II ended in complete success. The Duke of Legnica was forced to accept his defeat and give the Lower Silesian lands of G≈Çog√≥w up to Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie and ≈ªaga≈Ñ to Konrad as a duchy in his own right. Until the end of his life Konrad's relations with his brother Boles≈Çaw II remain strained. In 1257 Konrad made a dangerous move and kidnapped Boles≈Çaw from his residence in Legnica. The duke regained his freedom after a few months, but it is unknown at what price. It can be said that after that the duke never left Boles≈Çaw II a moment of happiness, but in 1271 the Duke of Legnica managed to regain the town of Boles≈Çawiec near the B√≥br river. From about 1260 Konrad established closer contacts with the Kingdom of Bohemia and became involved in the expansionist politics of King Ottokar II. Also he promoted the colonization in his lands, mostly by German settlers. This was a decisive contribution to the institution of the Magdeburg town law in his G≈Çog√≥w residence in 1253. In contrast to his brother Boles≈Çaw II, Konrad vigorously supported Bishop Thomas I of Wroc≈Çaw in his defence of church rights. However, when the bishop died in 1268 Konrad began to violate the privileges conferred by him, which led to conflicts with the new Bishop Thomas II Zaremba. At the end of his life he founded a church in Zielona G√≥ra (now a Co-cathedral) dedicated to his grandmother, St. Hedwig of Silesia. The church was completed only twenty years after his death by his son and heir Henry III. Marriages and Issue In 1249 Konrad contracted his first marriage to Salome (b. ca. 1225 - d. April 1267?), daughter of Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Greater Poland. They had six children: #Anna (b. 1250/52 - d. 25 June 1271), married on 24 August 1260 to Duke Louis II of Upper Bavaria. #Henry III (b. 1251/60 - d. 9 December 1309). #Konrad II the Hunchback (b. 1252/65 - d. 11 October 1304). #Euphemia (b. 12 January 1254 - d. bef. 1275), married by 13 May 1266 to Count Albert I of Gorizia. #Przemko (b. 1255/65 - d. killed in battle, Siewierz, 26 February 1289). #Hedwig (b. 1265? - d. 9 June 1318), Abbess of St. Klara, Wroclaw (1283). By 1271, Konrad married his second wife, Sophie (b. ca. 1259 - d. 24 August 1318), daughter of Dietrich the Wise, Margrave of Landsberg (second son of Henry III, Margrave of Meissen) and ‚Äì according to some sources ‚Äì widow of the last legitimate male member of the House of Hohenstaufen, Conradin, King of Sicily and Jerusalem.

Handbook on the History of Ukraine It was founded in April 1917 based on separate groups and circles of SRs that existed on the territory of Ukraine since 1905. The left faction of the party dissolved it in 1918 forming a new party, while the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party was recreated in January 1919 by its right faction members. General outlook It was one of the most influential political parties in Ukraine as it was representing the interest of the major social class of Ukraine - peasants and in some extent soldiers. It closely cooperated with the All-Ukrainian Peasants Society (Spilka) on which the party relied its activities among peasantry. The party's program was based on unifying principles of national interests and ideas of liberal populism. The determining issue of revolutionary change, it considered the national question, and its ultimate goal was to build an sovereign Ukrainian independent state. In November 1917 the Ukrainian Socialist- Revolutionary Party consisted of 75,000 members. Ideas and principles * National-territorial autonomy of Ukraine * Non-class Ukrainian Nation * Nationalization of great land estates * Promoting principles of small farming peasantry History In the fall of 1906 the Simferopol circle of the Party established its new affiliations in Volyn and Podolie. The first organizations of the party appeared in the eastern region of the modern Ukraine: Kiev Governorate, Chernigov Governorate, Odessa Governorate, Poltava Governorate, and others. The First Party Conference took place in Kiev (February 1907) where the Party Central Committee (CC) was elected. However, already in August 1907 numerous of the Party's members were arrested and the CC was liquidated. The one who managed to escape prosecution has moved to Lviv (autonomous region of Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria). In 1910-1911 there were attempts to reestablish the organization in Kiev and Kharkiv. Although it was not until the 1913 when some of the Party underground organization have reappeared in Ukraine. Around 1914 the Kievan group of the Party published its program in the magazine Borotba (the Fight). First steps The Party officially was established on April 17, 1917 in Kiev. The first Party Constituent Congress took place on May 4, 1917 in Kiev as well where the party became officially the All-national. The second Party Congress took place on July 15‚Äì16, 1917 when the Party program and statutes were accepted. According to their rivals from the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party (SDeky or SDPists), the Party has rewritten its program from their colleagues the Russian Social- Revolutionaries. The Party press-media became the newspaper Narodna Volia (The People's Will) and the magazine Borotba. The Party obtain 50% of all votes in Ukraine to the Russian Constituent Assembly. The Party had several of its ministers in the General Secretariat of Ukraine, but after the IV Universal on January 30, 1918 the Party became in charge of the government splitting only couple of other ministries with SDeks. Already in June 1917 several radical leaders of the Party held a conference at the Left-bank Ukraine where they declared their disagreement with the Party's center course. After the October Revolution, the party's taken energetic measures not to allow strengthening of Soviets in Ukraine. Since the establishment of the Central Council of Ukraine (Rada), the party received majority in the parliament, while number of its member participated in the government of Ukraine. It was not until January 1918 when the Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionary Party became the nation's ruling party. Parliamentary life A crisis has arose in December 1917 during one of the sessions of the Central Rada (7th and 8th (December 1917)) where the parliamentarians could not agree on the agrarian question. The majority of agrarian deputies were absolutely against the conservative agrarian law projects of the social-federalists K.Matskevich and SDPist Borys Martos who were supported by part of SRs. At the 3rd Party Congress in December 1917 the left SRs with the support of deputies from the military political organizations requested from the Central Rada promptly to issue laws about the liquidation of private property and estates in particular, nationalization of series of various industries, and several other reforms that were part of the Party's program. Soon 12 members of the Party CC composed the nucleus of the left opposition in the Rada. After the Declaration of Independence a SR-government was formed (the Council of People's Ministers) headed by Vsevolod Holubovych. On January 18, 1918 under the influence of the Left-wing of the Party headed by O.Shumsky the Central Rada finally accepted a provisional decree about the socialization of estates. However, on January 26, 1918 Kiev was taken by the army of Mikhail Muravyov and the members of the Rada relocated to Zhytomyr. There the Ukrainian left SRs were publishing their newspaper Molot (Hammer). With the support of the Germany Ukraine was liberated from the Russian occupation by March 1918. However, on April 29 the German military administration dispersed the Rada and arrested the Prime Minister of Ukraine Vsevolod Holubovych accusing him in setting up a conspiracy by kidnapping a financial official on April 25, 1918. Split At the 4th Party Congress on May 13‚Äì16, 1918 the party split into a left faction (Left SR) and a center course (Right SR). The Right SR considered that the revolution was concluded and advocated for conducting a legal opposition to the government of Pavlo Skoropadsky. The Left SR propagated the Soviet form of power, demanded cooperation with Bolsheviks, advocated for the organization of underground resistance and preparation to an armed revolt against the Hetman of Ukraine. Capturing dominant position in the Central Committee, the Left SR demanded to dismiss the Right SR from the party and after dissolving all local party organizations transferred the party into an illegal status. Eventually the Left SR transformed into the party of Borotbists (Communists). On July 30, 1918 the party was in the middle of a political scandal after assassination of the German Field-Marshal Hermann von Eichhorn by the Russian citizen Boris Donskoy.

It began in 2002 and runs every two years in July on the full 13.65 km circuit also used for the annual modern day 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Le Mans Classic event of 2002 was the first time since 1923 that the full 24-hour Circuit, part of which is public road the rest of the year, was closed specifically for an event other than the annual running of the 24 heures du Mans with contemporary sportcars and prototypes, thus allowing car owners and gentleman drivers to experience what it must have been to race these cars on this circuit. The event consists of a series of races for cars which have competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans or for similar cars of the same model. Only cars from prior to 1979 are allowed, with all cars being broken into six different eras. To compete in the races a driver must own an FIA International Competition licence, meaning the drivers are of a professional level. Car shows and auctions are hosted on the Bugatti Circuit grounds, with various car clubs meeting to show off machinery. Car classes Each class of car competes separately on the full 13.65 km Circuit de la Sarthe (Original circuit of Le Mans race). The classes are divided by era in an attempt to equalize the pace of the cars in each event. The current classes are: # 1923-1939 (pre-WWII) # 1949-1956 # 1957-1961 # 1962-1965 # 1966-1971 # 1972-1979 Le Mans Classic Japan Beginning in 2005, the SERO organization launched the Le Mans Classic Japan event, meant to run in alternative years from the event in France. The initial event was held at the Mine Circuit, while in 2007 it moved to the Fuji Speedway where it was part of the Japan Le Mans Challenge event. Drivers and cars are required to fit the same qualifications as their French counterparts, meaning cars are broken into eras and drivers require competition licenses.

It was shot at the Tempelhof Studios in Berlin. The film's sets were designed by the art director Dieter Bartels and Ted Haworth. Plot The story takes place in East Berlin soon after the Berlin Wall is built, and is based on an actual escape on January 28, 1962. Kurt Schr√∂der is a chauffeur to East German Major Eckhardt and his seductive wife Heidi, and lives within sight of the Wall. Kurt is having an affair with Heidi. One night he sees a friend, G√ºnther Jurgens, who works at the garage where Kurt has the Major's car maintained, drive his truck into the wall, and get killed trying to escape to the west. G√ºnther's sister, Erika, comes looking for G√ºnther when he doesn't return, and is told that Kurt saw him last night. She then goes to Kurt's house, where he lives with his mother, Uncle Albrecht (a musician), sister Ingeborg and kid brother Helmut. Erika is intent on escaping to West Berlin, thinking that her brother made it. Kurt, reasonably satisfied with his life, has no intention of risking his life to attempt an escape. Erika then looks out beyond the barbed wire, but Kurt catches her as she tries to crawl under, and they pretend to be lovers to hide her intentions from suspicious guards. Kurt then hides her in his house. A piece of Erika's clothing is caught in the barbed wire, and the guards track her to the Schr√∂der's house. She hides in a room without a floor, and narrowly escapes the guards after they conclude that she could not be in the room. The Schr√∂ders and their neighbors, including a woman named Marga whose husband has already escaped to the west, want to escape East Germany. Kurt comes up with the idea of building a tunnel under the wall, through which they can escape to West Berlin. Although he will mastermind the plan, Kurt has no intention of going with them as he feels he can better serve them by staying behind and being their cover. They drill through the basement wall using Uncle Albrecht's band as a noise cover when the actual drilling takes place. One member of the family keeps watch while the others work on the tunnel itself. After they start digging the tunnel, they are joined by Walter Brunner, to whom Kurt's mother has promised to rent a room. All the while, Kurt is falling in love with Erika, and he eventually summons the courage to tell her that her brother is dead. Because of this burgeoning love, Kurt has changed his mind and will escape with the rest of his family and Erika. On January 27, 1962, the tunnel is completed when just before dawn Kurt reaches the other side, and the breakout is planned for the following night. However, Marga tells Erika's parents the news of their daughter, and Erika's father, a professor who favors the Communist regime, betrays the escape plan to Major Eckhardt. Kurt learns from Heidi that the authorities are after him (she not knowing why), and he hurries home. When he arrives home, Kurt learns that his family have invited Uncle Albrecht's band members to join the escape, bringing the number of escapees to 28. Kurt tells them of the betrayal, and that they must make their escape immediately. As the police besiege their house, the Schr√∂ders, their friends and Erika make their escape, with Kurt bringing up the rear. He is wounded when a soldier fires, and struggles to make his way through the tunnel as he collapses it behind him, but Erika comes back to find and help him. Together they make their way to the exit, where the others have already emerged to live in freedom.

MGM decided to take advantage of the public interest with a feature film inspired by real events.

It was the last of many skirmishes between Mass√©na's retreating French forces and those of the Anglo-Portuguese under Wellington, who were pursuing him after the failed 1810 French invasion of Portugal. In poor weather, with heavy rain and fog, Allied forces succeeded in forcing the demoralized French force into retreat. The victory was lauded by the British; Sir Harry Smith, then a junior officer of the 95th Rifles and a participant in the battle, remarked \\"Oh, you Kings and usurpers should view these scenes and moderate ambition\\" while Wellesley later referred to the Light Division's action in the battle as \\"one of the most glorious that British troops were ever engaged in\\".Portsmouth Napoleonic Society Battle of Sabugal 3 April 1811, Vic Powell and Colin Jones. Retrieved 14 August 2007 Background By October 1810, Marshal Massena‚Äôs French army had been halted by the Lines of Torres Vedras, and the Peninsular War had reached a stalemate. Realising that a drive on to Lisbon before the onset of winter was unlikely, Mass√©na prepared to see out the winter months and renew the fight in the spring, despite scorched earth policies by the Allies rendering foraging for food very difficult. Having survived the winter, however, Massena order a general retreat on 3 March 1811, and the British forces under Wellesley followed. By the onset of April, the French forces were just inside Portugal, aligned along the C√¥a river. Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon's 9th Corps defended to the north, Louis Henri Loison's 6th Corps was in the centre and Jean Reynier's 2nd Corps held the south flank at Sabugal. Resting in the rear areas was Jean-Andoche Junot's 8th Corps. It was at Sabugal that Wellesley attempted to crush the French flank by attacking forces of the isolated 2nd Corps. While the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th British-Portuguese divisions performed a frontal attack, the flanking Light Division miscalculated and attacked the French 2nd Corps in the flank rather than from the rear. With the leading British units cut off, and poor weather approaching, the British situation became increasingly difficult. The battle The 1st Brigade of the British-Portuguese Light Division crossed the C√¥a at 10.00 hrs on the morning of 3 April. The French 4th L√©g√©re (Light) from Pierre Hugues Victoire Merle's 1st Division was alerted by musket fire as the 1st Brigade drove off a small number of French pickets. The French formed a column and advanced on the British. While making good progress initially, the concentrated French force was driven back by British artillery. The 1st Brigade followed the retreating French forces up a nearby hill, but was quickly ousted by the remaining French forces, who still held a considerable numerical advantage. The British were forced back into cover behind some small stone walls. Heavy rain had also begun to interfere with the muskets of both sides. An attempted counter-attack by the 1st Brigade also ended in failure, as the French had in the meantime set up artillery. Together with further French reinforcements, Reynier forced the British back to the cover of the stone walls at the foot of the hill. The crest was attacked for a third time by the 1st Brigade, now supported by the 2nd Brigade, which had arrived on the battlefield. While the French were initially pushed back, Reynier sent in a stream of French units to meet the arriving British 16th Light Dragoons and the surviving soldiers of the 1st and 2nd. With the rain clearing, Reynier could also see the British divisions beginning a frontal assault. This sight persuaded Reynier to pull back; however, the British were successful in seizing both his and General Pierre Soult's baggage carts, even if bad weather did prevent them from mounting a full pursuit. A French commander, Baron Thi√©bault, blamed the collapse of the 2nd Corps for the French defeat on 3 April, stating that \\"It might have been avoided if General Reynier had had faith in Massena‚Äôs foresight\\". Sources differ in the number of French prisoners taken, ranging from 186 to over 1,500. Erskine's strange role Major-General William Erskine commanded the Light Division during the battle. Wellington planned to have the Light Division and two brigades of cavalry circle behind Reynier's open left flank while the other four divisions attacked in front. When the day dawned with heavy fog, the other commanders decided to wait until visibility improved. Undeterred, Erskine peremptorily ordered Lieut-Colonel Thomas Sydney Beckwith's 1st Brigade forward. Instead of crossing the C√¥a beyond Reynier's flank, the brigade drifted to the left in the fog, crossed at the wrong location and struck the French left flank. Erskine, who was very nearsighted and mentally unbalanced, then became cautious and issued explicit instructions to Colonel George Drummond not to support his fellow brigade commander. At this point, Erskine rode off to join the cavalry, leaving the Light Division leaderless for the rest of the battle. Reynier switched most of his 10,000-man corps against Beckwith's 1,500 and pressed the light infantry back. When Drummond heard the sounds of battle approaching, he deduced that Beckwith's men were retreating. Disobeying orders, Drummond led his 2nd Brigade across the C√¥a and joined Beckwith. Together they drove the French back. When the mist cleared, Reynier saw the other four divisions advancing in front, led by Thomas Picton's 3rd Division. He quickly withdrew the bulk of the II Corps, leaving 3,000 men of his right flank to hold off four divisions. William Grattan of the 88th Foot noted of the badly outnumbered French, \\"They never fought better. So rapidly did they fire that instead of returning their ramrods, they stuck them in the ground and continued to fight until overpowered by our men.\\" Reynier admitted the loss of 760 men.

It was designed by George S. Morison in 1888 for the Colorado Midland Railroad, one of the last viaducts in Colorado built for a standard gauge mountain railroad in the 19th century. Of the five steel bridges the Midland built, it is the only one still extant. Due to the later removal of most track and the rail depots, the bridge is the most visible remnant of rail service to Aspen. In 1985 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with other highway bridges in the state, including the Sheely Bridge, also in Aspen. When it was built, the Midland was ahead in its race with the Denver and Rio Grande to make the first rail connection to Aspen, then a booming silver mining center. The Midland had followed the Roaring Fork Valley up from its main line at Glenwood Springs, but was stalled at Maroon Creek by a delay in the bridge steel. The Rio Grande was thus able to make up the difference and bring the first train to Aspen, with the Midland following a few months later. Aspen's boom years ended a few years later, and by the 1920s the bridge was abandoned. It was soon expanded and converted to use as a road bridge. It served as the main entrance to Aspen for many visitors as the city's economy rebounded when the Aspen Mountain ski resort was developed after World War II. As growth spilled over to Aspen's west, it became a traffic choke point for the region. It remained in use until longstanding plans for a newer, wider bridge came to fruition in 2008. At that time the original bridge was the oldest one still in use on Colorado's state highways. The award-winning new bridge was designed to be aesthetically similar to its predecessor, which remains in service as a foot bridge. It may be used for a light rail line to further alleviate traffic problems in the valley. Structures Both bridges are located adjacent to each other along Highway 82 approximately one-half mile (1 km) east of the traffic circle where Maroon Creek Road, the access route to the Maroon Bells leaves to the south, just outside the developed portion of the city of Aspen. Due west of that are the remnants of the Holden Mining and Smelting Co. facility, also listed on the National Register as a historic district. The city's corporate limit follows the bridge, with the land to the north within Aspen and the south just Pitkin County. The creek flows through a deep gorge below, roughly 1 mile (1.6 km) upstream of where it drains into the Roaring Fork River to the north. On all corners but the southeast are golf courses; that corner has a small residential neighborhood of modern construction. A steel safety net has been installed since construction of the new bridge in the two-foot (60 cm) gap between the bridges. The original bridge has 20 plate girder spans supported by nine tapered steel piers. Two deep deck girders, iron plate webs with riveted angle flanges and web stiffeners, carry the road. The piers are made up of two bents, their legs made of two back-to-back steel channels with cover plate and double lacing. They are braced by tiers of compression beams and tension eyebars. At the ground they are supported by masonry piers. The new bridge is long, 30 feet (10 m) shorter than its older neighbor. It consists of a main span with two end spans. Its deck is formed from a 73-foot‚Äìwide () single-cell box girder at a constant depth of 13¬Ω feet () with ribbed elements supporting the long slab spans. Most segments are long, with a deck rib from the leading edge. The segments are laid out on pier table, with eight in the main cantilever, ten in the side spans and a 5-foot segment closing the two cantilevers. They are supported by A-shaped concrete piers with a capital at the top flared outward at the same angle as the outriggers on the historic bridge. The piers themselves are a constant 10 feet (3 m) in the direction of the bridge but stretch from 6 feet (2 m) at the top to 10 feet (3 m) at the bottom. Their footings are on 12 4-foot‚Äìwide () drilled 20 feet (6 m) deep into the bedrock. The abutments on either side of the gorge are supported by 72 micropiles designed to support 150 kips each. History The bridge's history is intertwined with the city it serves. Built during a scramble to exploit its silver deposits, it outlasted the railroads that used it to become the main road entrance to Aspen, eventually becoming their only remnant. Stressed as the city rebounded when it became a popular ski resort, it was later augmented with a modern bridge specifically designed to echo it aesthetically. 1870s‚Äì1887: Aspen's boom What would very quickly become the city of Aspen began as one of several mining camps in the upper Roaring Fork Valley established by prospectors drawn west from Leadville, in the late 1870s. The mineral veins there had already been thoroughly exploited, and those first settlers defied an order from governor Frederick Walker Pitkin to cross the Continental Divide at Independence Pass into what was still Ute country. They were drawn by reports of vast silver deposits. Aspen eventually became the center of settlement in the region due to its location at the confluence of Castle Creek and the Roaring Fork. It was not closest to the Divide or the richest deposits, but it had an ample supply of level ground and forests including the trees that gave it its name, which were readily harvested to build the first log cabins. The silver was difficult to exploit at first since the ore had to be taken to Leadville to be smelted. The route over the pass was long even in warm weather, and suited only for mule trains (even today, Highway 82 through it is closed during wintertime). Once the smelter at the Holden property was opened in the mid-1880s, mining profits and population grew rapidly, helped by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act's requirement that the federal government purchase the metal. Two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, began building routes to the remote city, racing to be the first.Fraser, Clayton and Strand, Jennifer; ; History Colorado; August 31, 1997; retrieved September 22, 2011; pp. 43‚Äì45. alt=A sepia-toned oval portrait of a mustached man with a jacket and bowtie 1887‚Äì1893: Bridge construction and early railroad use Formed in 1883, the Midland had existed purely legally for its first four years since it lacked the money to actually build anything. That changed rapidly when James John Hagerman, an Easterner who had already grown rich from mining iron ore in Michigan and silver in Aspen, joined the railroad in 1885. By the end of the next year the Midland had laid of standard gauge track from Colorado Springs to Leadville. The Hagerman Tunnel, at the time the world's highest, got it across the Divide to Glenwood Springs, where it continued the line to Aspen. The previous year the Rio Grande had been forced into receivership and sold to its bondholders as a result of growing too fast in its earlier years. William S. Jackson, its new president, had tried to convince the board to expand to Aspen ahead of the Midland, but they were too afraid of further financial failure. The next year a new president, David Moffat, changed their minds and the railroad began laying track on the north side of the Roaring Fork, where they did not have to worry about crossing Maroon Creek. That decision proved to be beneficial in overcoming the Midland's lead and bringing the first train to Aspen in October 1887. At that point the Midland's crews had laid track almost as far as Maroon Creek. The railroad had hired renowned engineer and bridge designer George S. Morison to design and build the viaduct using his innovative double-bent piers, first used on the Portage Viaduct in New York and later on the Boone Viaduct in Iowa. A timber trestle could have been built, but when the crews reached the creek in December they had to wait as the structural steel for Morison's bridge had been delayed leaving its fabricator back East. They continued working through the difficult mountain winter and completed the bridge in time for the Midland's first train to cross it and arrive in Aspen in February 1888. Although the Midland lost the race, its bridge, one of the last viaduct bridges built in Colorado that century, was more significant since it connected Aspen to its standard-gauge main line, the first built into the state's mountains. In 1890 the Rio Grande widened its branch to standard gauge. The two railroads competed vigorously as the city's population swelled to over 10,000. The Aspen City Railway, a mule-pulled streetcar, connected the two depots. alt=A black and white photograph of a small steam-powered train crossing the bridge, seen from upstream. There is a house along the creek at the bottom Aspen's boom years ended in 1893, when Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in response to that year's economic crisis. With the market no longer artificially supported, the price of silver dropped and many of the city's mines closed, beginning a long period of the city's history known as \\"the quiet years\\". The railroad, which had recently built the Busk‚ÄìIvanhoe Tunnel, which improved service along its main line, continued operating even as it went bankrupt in 1897, and reemerged as a new company with the same name. The second Colorado Midland went bankrupt again in 1919, as most of Aspen's remaining silver mines shut down. The bridge remained, unused. 1894‚Äì1946: Road redevelopment and quiet years Ten years later, with the state expanding and improving its highway network in response to growing use of the automobile, the bridge was revived. Drivers began using it during the 1920s, almost as soon as the railroad abandoned it. After being widened with a paved timber deck and the outriggers to accommodate a road, it was reopened in 1929 for road traffic as part of the construction of Highway 82. The goal of the widening was to link Aspen with the state's growing road network and thus improve the prospects of the remaining silver miners. But the onset of the Great Depression stifled any chance of that happening, and both the road and the railroad were primarily used to transport livestock raised by the area's ranchers to market. The road and railroad would eventually figure in Aspen's economic rebirth, though not from the source originally envisioned. Near the end of the Depression, a local landowner showed some photographs of mountainside property he saw mining potential in to Ted Ryan, an heir to Thomas Fortune Ryan. He was a downhill skiing enthusiast who saw that the slopes would be ideal for development as a ski area. By the end of the decade the first crude ski lift had been built, some Swiss ski instructors hired, and the first trails cut. Members of the Tenth Mountain Division who trained at nearby Camp Hale also came to appreciate Aspen's offerings. After the war, some came back to develop the ski resort established by Walter Paepcke, the president of the Container Corporation of America. He and his wife Elizabeth had found Aspen an ideal place to establish a music festival, and invested heavily in rebuilding the city. Early in 1947, a special train brought dignitaries from out of town, including one of Colorado's U.S. senators and its governor-elect, to Aspen for a ceremony marking the opening of the new chairlift, at the time the world's longest. The breaking of a champagne bottle across the bottom station ended the quiet years. 1946‚Äì2003: Resort growth and stresses The Rio Grande ran ski trains, which mixed passenger and freight traffic, up to Aspen from its main line at Glenwood Springs. But many preferred to drive or be driven up Highway 82 from that point. The Aspen Skiing Company developed the greater Aspen/Snowmass complex, including the Buttermilk ski area just west of the bridge in 1958 and Snowmass further west, both contributing to traffic over the bridge.Hammond, Jennifer; ; July 22, 1995; retrieved September 28, 2011; pp. 1‚Äì6. The bridge's importance as the gateway to Aspen increased further when Aspen‚ÄìPitkin County Airport was built in 1953 just outside the city. Over the 1950s the population of Pitkin County grew 44%, due to migration to the upper Roaring Fork Valley, the second highest growth rate on Colorado's Western Slope. Ten years after the airport was opened, in 1963, the bridge was expanded to its current width to handle the traffic increase. Ranchers began selling their lands for skiing and housing development, some of which became the town of Snowmass, where the workers in Aspen's hotels, restaurants and shops settled, eventually incorporating in the mid-1970s. Aspen became a destination for more than just skiing, and its population continued to grow. In 1969 eight decades of rail transport to Aspen came to an end when the Rio Grande ran its last train from the city, a development that attracted less local attention than the first trains had. The tracks were removed and its depot demolished, leaving the bridge as the only significant remnant of Aspen's railroad era. When the railroad finally turned its Rio Grande Zephyr service between Denver and Salt Lake City over to Amtrak in 1983, the last private intercity rail route to do so, Amtrak did not restore service to Aspen. Service along the branch was finally abandoned completely when the last coal train left Carbondale in 1994, ending the Roaring Fork Valley's railroad era. alt=The bridge seen from a greater distance, with trees in front and below changing color By that time the bridge was showing its age. Traffic across the bridge grew at an average annual rate of 4.4% during the 1980s., City of Aspen; Winter 2007; retrieved September 26, 2011; p. 6 In 1990 the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) released a plan for a new bridge at the site. The twin three-span steel box girder concept did not meet with public approval due to concerns about its aesthetics, environmental impact and effect on other roads of traffic diverted during construction, since its closure would necessitate a long detour on local roads through Woody Creek. Drivers on the bridge also had to contend with pedestrian users. The roadway was too narrow to install a sidewalk or walkway. In 1998 a pedestrian bridge of eight segments was built immediately to the north. It was a temporary solution to the increasing traffic problem and was never very popular locally. In the first years of the 21st century its sufficiency rating slipped to 9 out of a possible 100. It was temporarily closed to trucks while cracks in the masonry at the piers' base were repaired, restoring it to a sufficiency rating of 24. In 2004, after the municipal governments of Aspen and Snowmass decided to fund the design work, CDOT announced that it was expediting the planning process and hoped that construction would begin the following year. Traffic could continue to use the old bridge in the meantime. There were some objections to the disruption that would be caused pedestrians, since the old pedestrian bridge would have to be dismantled. 2004‚Äìpresent: The new bridge Ultimately, a cast-in-place segmental concrete box girder design was decided on. The piers were tapered to echo the pinched-waist appearance of the old trestle next to it. Construction began in late 2005. Environmental considerations required that no more than of the protected wetland below the bridge be disturbed during construction, and half that area be permanently disturbed for the bridge piers. The bridge was therefore built from the top down, using a balanced cantilever construction method. To allow concrete construction to continue through the winter, the contractor insulated the forms and ran glycol-filled pipes along their exteriors. By late 2007, two years after work started, the main span was done. The entire bridge was completed in early 2008. Up to that point, the 120-year-old bridge remained in use, the oldest still in use on Colorado's state highways. After construction of new road approaches, including designated bus lanes, the new bridge opened in the middle of the year, its final cost almost $14 million. as the Colorado Department of Transportation had classified it as \\"unstable\\" at near capacity. After the new bridge (a concrete box girder bridge) was completed, the existing bridge was left in place to honor its historic designation. In 2010, CDOT won a Bridge Award for Excellence from the National Segmental Bridge Institute. In late 2010 a body found under the bridge was identified as George Aldrich, a ski-lift operator who had recently moved to Snowmass from Rhode Island. He had been missing for over two weeks since getting off a bus near the bridge following a night of drinking with friends in Aspen. The county coroner ruled that he had died from injuries sustained in a fall, which had likely occurred when a heavily intoxicated Aldrich accidentally stepped in the gap between the two bridges in the dark. CDOT later installed the safety netting between the two bridges to prevent similar accidents in the future. Future Rail transport may yet return to the bridge. In 1975 Aspen voters approved a referendum permitting the city to endorse the county's application to the federal Urban Mass Transportation Authority for the funding of a light rail system to connect downtown Aspen to the airport, and perhaps the Buttermilk ski area and eventually all the way to Glenwood Springs using either of the old rights-of-way. Later votes endorsed other aspects of the proposal., Colorado Department of Transportation; retrieved September 26, 2011. In 1997 the Federal Highway Administration and CDOT issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in favor of a light-rail network and improvements to Highway 82, including the new bridge eventually built.; Colorado Department of Transportation; August 1988; retrieved September 26, 2011. The light rail line would likely use the old bridge and the old Midland route where it exists, since those tracks had already accounted for the steep grades in the valley, not a common problem with light-rail lines. After the ROD, another referendum found city voters still supporting light rail but county voters opposed. The federal government nonetheless set aside funding for the segment to the airport, which would have been the first rural light rail line built in the U.S. Later referendums on bond issues to fund the city's portion failed, and after the failure of another referendum to build a monorail between Denver and ski resorts along I-70 the project did not seem likely to begin until money was available from another source.

Sheridan documents how, in the essay \\"El Intelectual\\", Mej√≠a Madrid takes extended portions of Said's original text without crediting the author, or citing Said's work. In a more recent piece in the same publication Guillermo Sheridan has again demonstrated the extensive nature of Mej√≠a Madrid's plagiarisms, this time by exposing how he has taken material from authors such as Deleuze, Isaacson, Douglas Day, Alain Corbin, and Giorgio Agamben without quoting them or giving any sort of credit.https://www.letraslibres.com/mexico/cultura/el-escritor-fabrizio-el- plagio-como-reencarnacion See also * Bogota39  References  Category:Mexican male writers Category:Writers from Mexico City Category:1968 births Category:Living people ","title":"Fabrizio Mej√≠a"},{"id":"12770759","text":"Gmina Pobiedziska is an urban-rural gmina (administrative district) in Pozna≈Ñ County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.

He had previously served as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the Beaches constituency from 1948 to 1951. He returned to politics in 1969 as a Toronto city alderman. Scott, a law student at the time, defeated 22-year incumbent Thomas Alexander Murphy when he was elected to the Ontario legislature as the MPP for Beaches in the 1948 provincial election. At age 21, he set the record for youngest MPP ever elected which remained unbroken until the election of 19 year old Sam Oosterhoff in a 2016 by-election. Scott ran for federal office in the 1962 election and was elected as the NDP candidate for Danforth. While an MP, he played a role in the \\"Great Flag Debate\\". Serving on the all-party committee charged with recommending a new flag, Scott successfully lobbied Social Credit and Cr√©ditiste MPs to back the Maple Leaf flag as it did not have \\"symbols of the past\\". His efforts secured a majority on the committee in favour of what became the new flag of Canada. Reid was the last surviving member of the Parliamentary Committee that selected the design of the new flag. He did not stand in the 1968 Canadian federal election. After leaving federal politics, Scott served as a Toronto City Councillor from 1969 to 1976. He led the effort in the 1969 Toronto municipal election to introduce party politics into the municipal level by leading a slate of 13 NDP candidates for city council.\\"Reid Scott, the tactful diplomat\\", Toronto Star (1971-2009); Toronto, Ontario [Toronto, Ontario]02 July 1973: 10.

The experiment was conducted for a week in 1971 attracting 50,000 people a day and then for longer periods during the summers of 1972 and 1973 but was ended due to mounting complaints by businesses about shoplifting and vagrancy. Scott stood for the position of Chairman of Metropolitan Toronto after Albert Campbell stepped down due to ill health.

Torres-Nieves, Puerto Rico's Secretary of the Senate of Puerto Rico first served during the tumultuous years of 2005-2008 in which the Senate was controlled by the pro-statehood New Progressive Party (NPP) while the governorship had been controlled by the pro-status quo Popular Democratic Party, served a second consecutive term as Senate Secretary after having served as Acting President of the Senate from January 1‚Äì12, 2009, between the Senate presidencies of Kenneth McClintock and Thomas Rivera Schatz. He then served as Puerto Rico's first Electoral Comptroller before his third election as Secretary of the Senate during Rivera Schatz' historic second non- consecutive term as Senate President. Private life Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico on April 9, 1965, and a long-time resident of Puerto Rico's largest public housing project, with his parents' help he was able to excel in school and obtain an associate degree (ABA) and a bachelor's degree (BBA), both in Business Administration majoring in Management with the distinction \\"Magna Cum Laude\\" from the Universidad del Este of the Sistema Universitario Ana G. M√©ndez. He obtained his master's degree in Public Administration (MPA)from the University of Puerto Rico with a major in Administration and Fiscal Policy, with the distinction of \\"Summa Cum Laude\\", on June 29, 2011. He is now taking courses leading to an additional specialty in Personnel Management. In 1991 joined the Puerto Rico National Guard. Since 2016 he is a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE). A member of the Police Athletic League and the Boys and Girls Club of San Juan, he also excelled in basketball. A widower and a member of the Episcopal Church, he is the father of Jessica and Alex Manuel, a CBP federal agent and the father of Torres' only granddaughter and grandson. Public life Torres began his public service career in 1991 as Ranking Minority Staffer in the Youth Affairs Committee of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. He subsequently served in the highly sensitive position of Director of the Ethics Committee Office at the House, Chief of Staff to the House Majority Leader and Advisor to the Director of the Puerto Rico Office of Legislative Services. For two years, he served as one of Puerto Rico's two representatives in the Council of State Governments Committee on Suggested State Legislation. Gov. Pedro Rossell√≥ appointed Torres to the board of directors of the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund Corporation, which has a monopoly on workmen's compensation, and to the board of the Puerto Rico Automobile Accident Compensation Administration (ACAA). He was confirmed both times by the Senate of Puerto Rico in a unanimous vote. From 2001 to 2004 he was Chief of Staff to the Senate Minority Leader and legislative advisor to the Deputy Mayor of the City of San Juan. Within the NPP, Torres was active for years in its NPP Youth organization. He also was member of the party's Rules Committee, as well as its State Board. After the 2004 election, incoming Senate President Kenneth McClintock appointed Torres to head the Senate's transition committee and on January 10, 2005, Torres was elected by the Senate as its Secretary, its top staffer. During the 2005-2008 term, the Senate Secretary confronted the particular challenges created by the split within the majority party caucus over whether former governor Pedro Rossell√≥ should topple McClintock and replace him as Senate President, a split which ended in March 2008 after party primaries, and by the fact that there was a partisan split between the Governor and the Legislative Assembly. Torres probably was the most high-profile Senate Secretary since 1949, when the Senate Presidency ceased to be the most powerful elective position held by a Puerto Rican, upon the election of Senate President Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n as Puerto Rico's first elective governor. On January 1, 2009, after McClintock's term ended, Torres became acting president of the Senate, gavelling in the new Senate on January 12, when the legislative body elected Thomas Rivera Schatz as the fourteenth President of the Senate. Rivera Schatz announced on November 26, 2008 that Torres would be reelected as Secretary of the Senate on January 12, 2009, making him the longest-serving Senate Secretary in half a centuryhttp://www.primerahora.com/noticia/politica/noticias/confirmara_a_los_jueces/251740 and the first to serve two consecutive terms under different Senate presidents. In May 2009, Torres was inducted to the Hall of Distinguished Alumni of the Universidad del Este, which is part of the Ana G. Mendez University System. In August 2010, Torres published his Master's thesis, entitled \\"Effect of the Full-Time Legislator in the Puerto Rican Legislature\\". Electoral Comptroller In January, 2012, Torres was appointed by Governor Luis G. Fortu√±o as the first Electoral Comptroller of Puerto Rico, a newly created post under Law 222 of 2011. He was confirmed by the Senate by a wide marginhttp://www.vocero.com/puerto-rico-es/senado-confirma-a-comisionado- electoral with a few notable exceptions,http://www.ppdpr.net/noticias/?n=1352 and by a unanimous vote in the House on March 5, 2012. He was sworn in by McClintock, Puerto Rico's Secretary of State on March 9, after resigning his post as Secretary of the Senate on March 8 after almost 7 years and 2 months holding that office. As the U.S. territory's first Electoral Comptroller, Torres came under fire from leaders of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) for his strict enforcement of Puerto Rico's new campaign finance law.http://www.elnuevodia.com/torresnievestienedemasiadopoder...-1327941.html The law, the first state campaign finance law enacted after the landmark United States Supreme Court case Citizens United v. FEC, prohibits deficit spending in political campaigns and includes strict campaign finance reporting. On January 8, 2017, Torres resigned his post as Electoral Comptroller and was elected and sworn in the next day once again as Secretary of the Senate upon the election of Rivera Schatz to a second term as President of the Senate, becoming the only Senate President to serve two non-consecutive terms in that leadership post.

His Irish name was Aodh O'Raghallaigh and his ancestors were the Lords of East Breifne and Chiefs of the O'Reilly clan. Reilly was a close relative of John O'Reilly of Caulfield, Laragh Parish, Co. Cavan who was an ancestor of John Charles McQuaid, Archbishop of Dublin.\\"The O'Reillys and MacQuaids of Lisdoagh\\" by Francis J. MacKiernan in Breifne Journal, Vol VIII, No.2 (1991), p. 191 Hugh Reilly was born in County Cavan, Ireland about 1630 and studied at the Irish Bar where he qualified as a barrister about 1650. Hugh Reilly was legal advisor to Saint Oliver Plunkett, Archbishop of Armagh during his trial in 1681, after Plunkett's previous advisor Sir Nicholas Plunkett died. Plunkett said about Reilly \\"he took many risks for me\\". On 22 May 1686 Reilly was appointed Master in Chancery. He lived in the parish of Laragh, County Cavan and in 1689 was elected from there, along with Philip Og O'Reilly, as an M.P. to represent the Borough of Cavan in the Dublin Patriot Parliament of King James II. In the 1689 Irish Jacobite Government he was appointed as Clerk of the Privy Council (Hugh Riley) on 5 March 1689. After the defeat of King James II by King William III, Reilly fled to France with the king. In 1690 James II appointed him Lord Chancellor of Ireland at St. Germains, but it was a titular title only as James then had no power to so appoint. Hugh Reilly was attainted in 1691 by King William III and his land in County Cavan was confiscated. In 1695 he published Ireland's Case briefly stated; a second edition, appeared in 1720. It gives an account of the conduct and misfortunes of the Roman Catholics in Ireland from the reign of Elizabeth to that of James II, and complains of the neglect they suffered under Charles II. The statements throughout are general, and few dates or particular facts are given. The last speech of Oliver Plunkett is added. It is said that James II, offended by the tone of Reilly's book, dismissed him from his service. Harris in his edition of Ware's Works, (Ware, Sir James, Works: Walter Harris. Dublin 1764, vol. 2, p. 259), states- \\"King James was so offended at Reilly's free treatment of him, that he took away his small salary, and turned him out of his titular office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland; the loss of which lay so heavy upon his spirits that he died soon after, about the year 1694. It is said King James restored him to his pension a short time before his death and I have been assured that he shewed his book to King James before he put it under the press, who had the perusal of it for three weeks, and upon returning it, told the author there was too much truth in it; but did not forbid him to make it public‚Äîyet, when it appeared abroad, he treated him as before related.\\" He is believed to have died in 1695. The Impartial History of Ireland (London, 1754)https://archive.org/stream/impartialhistor00plungoog#page/n13/mode/2up is a reprint of Reilly's Ireland's Case, and it was again issued under the same title at Dublin in 1787, and as the Genuine History of Ireland at Dublin in 1799 and in 1837. Burke's speech at the Bristol election of 1780 is printed with the edition of 1787, and a memoir of Daniel O'Connell with that of 1837. The form, paper, and type of the book show that it was bought by the populace in Ireland; its popularity was due to no special merit, but to the fact that it was long almost the only printed argument in favour of Irish Roman Catholics.

St Peter's is located to the northeast of the abbey. St Michael's lies to the west among the foundations of the old basilica (law- court) of Roman Verulamium, where Alban was condemned to die.

Ulsinus diverted Watling Street, which linked St Stephen's and St Michael's, in order to bring traffic through the town centre (the abbey owned the market rights and also charged tolls). This brought traffic up Holywell Hill, which is named after a medieval holy well, and it was along this route that the supplies for the Abbey were transported.Wotherspoon, M. et al., Archaeological Solutions, \\"18 & 19 George Street, St. Albans: Historic Building Appraisal References Category:Abbots of St Albans Category:10th-century Christian clergy Category:10th-century Christian monks ","title":"Wulsin (Abbot Ulsinus)"},{"id":"12770951","text":"Babbington is a hamlet in Nottinghamshire, England.

The place-name 'Babingley' is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as Babinghelea. The name means 'the clearing of Babba's people'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.21. It was a separate parish but is now part of the civil parish of Sandringham. The modern hamlet is a small group of houses along the A149 road linking King's Lynn and Hunstanton. The site of the abandoned village is in fields west of the main road, marked by the ruin of St Felix's parish church. Saint Felix Village sign, showing at top the legend of St Felix and the beaver which he consecrated as a bishop. Babingley is said to be where St Felix of Burgundy, Apostle to the East Angles, landed in Britain in about AD 615. The Wuffingas, the East Anglian royal family, invited Felix to evangelise their kingdom. Babingley is remote from the former royal capital at Rendlesham, but Felix is said to have arrived here via the River Babingley after his ship took shelter from a violent storm. He made his way to Canterbury where Honorius, Archbishop of Canterbury, ordained him as a bishop at the request of King Sigebert of East Anglia in about 630. St Felix made his cathedral on the other side of the kingdom at Dummoc, the modern Walton. A legend claims that Felix was shipwrecked on the River Babingley but a colony of beavers saved him from drowning, so in gratitude Felix consecrated the chief beaver as a bishop. The village sign records the legend, showing a beaver wearing a bishop's mitre, ministering to other beavers. Manor The Domesday Book of 1086 records a manor of Babingley with one carucate of land, and another three carucates held by tenants. Churches 1880 \\"tin tabernacle\\" mission church Babingley has had two Church of England churches: a 14th-century parish church and a 19th- century mission church. The 14th-century parish church of St Felix was used for worship until the 19th century and is now a ruin. It is in a field near the River Babingley and is now part of the nearby Sandringham estate. It is said to be the site of the first Christian church to be built in Norfolk. The surviving ruin, however, is mainly 14th-century Decorated Gothic, with a 15th- century south porch built of brick. The chancel was described as \\"decayed\\" in a survey of 1602 and \\"dilapidated\\" by 1752. The last rector, James Sharp, was appointed in 1732. According to Nikolaus Pevsner there is a record of an attempt to repair the church in 1849. A photograph taken in 1949 shows it still partially roofed, but the building is now entirely roofless. The church consisted of a nave, north and south aisles with two-bay arcade, chancel, and west tower. The chancel was taller and higher than the nave. While the church was still in use the north aisle was demolished and its arcade blocked. The chancel arch has been bricked up and a Decorated Gothic window from the south side of the chancel re-set in the brickwork. In 1880 a new mission church of SS Mary and Felix was built by the main road. It has a timber frame clad with corrugated iron. Unusual among \\"tin tabernacles\\", this one has a thatched roof. After the new church was consecrated the 14th-century one was abandoned. Its condition has significantly declined since the 1970s, and what remains now is the 14th-century tower and empty shell of the nave and south aisle. It is one of several church ruins in west Norfolk that the artist John Piper painted in the early 1980s. Since then ivy has grown over much of the ruin, including all of the tower. It is a Grade I listed building and a scheduled ancient monument. The church ruin is on private land, and may be visited only with permission of the landowner. Butler's Cross Butler's Cross is the base and broken shaft of a medieval stone boundary cross. It is on a traffic island at the junction where the minor road to West Newton meets the A149 main road. Its name is derived from that of the de Boteler family, who held the manor of West Hall, Babingley from the mid-13th-century.

Ronnie became known in the 1960s associated with Brazilian rock, and between 2004 until 2019 presents currently between Mondays and Fridays the TV night show Todo Seu (Portuguese for \\"All Yours\\") on TV Gazeta.  Biography  Some of his greater successes include the hits Meu Bem ‚Äì a Portuguese version of The Beatles' Girl ‚Äì and A Pra√ßa. He quickly earned the nickname O pequeno pr√≠ncipe, or Little Prince, after participating in an interview with Hebe Camargo. Ronnie started hosting his own television program in 1966, O Pequeno Mundo de Ronnie Von. Os Mutantes became a regular guest band on the show. Besides opening the door for the band, Ronnie Von also brought Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso to appear on the show regularly, which would be the beginnings of the Tropic√°lia movement, even though he was never part of the movement. During this period, the press tried to create a supposed rivalry between him and Roberto Carlos. In 1968, he released a self-titled album that broke from the na√Øvet√© of his previous work and ventured in more psychedelic and experimental sounds. Following this release came A Misteriosa Luta do Reino de Parassempre Contra o Imp√©rio de Nuncamais (1969) and M√°quina Voadora (1970). Though it did not meet with much success, today Ronnie's experimental work is being rediscovered by a new generation of rock listeners, rendering him a high degree of underground cult status.[ Allmusic Biography]  Discography  *1966 ‚Äì Ronnie Von ‚Äì Meu Bem *1967 ‚Äì O Novo √çdolo *1967 ‚Äì Ronnie Von n¬∫3 *1968 ‚Äì Ronnie Von *1969 ‚Äì A Misteriosa Luta do Reino de Parassempre Contra o Imp√©rio de Nuncamais *1970 ‚Äì M√°quina Voadora *1972 ‚Äì Ronnie Von *1973 ‚Äì Ronnie Von *1973 ‚Äì Ronnie Von *1977 ‚Äì Ronnie Von *1977 ‚Äì Deje mi Vida ‚Äì in Spanish *1978 ‚Äì Ronnie Von *1981 ‚Äì Sinal dos Tempos *1984 ‚Äì Ronnie Von *1987 ‚Äì Vida e Volta *1988 ‚Äì Ronnie Von *1996 ‚Äì Estrada da Vida *2019 ‚Äì One Night Only  References  External links  * Senhor F ‚Äì 40 Years of \\"O Pequeno Mundo de Ronnie Von\\" (Portuguese) * Complete discography of Ronnie Von (Portuguese) * Ronnie Von in CliqueMusic (Portuguese) Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian male singers Category:Brazilian rock musicians Category:Brazilian businesspeople Category:Brazilian television presenters Category:Jovem Guarda Category:People from Niter√≥i Category:Brazilian rock singers Category:Brazilian Roman Catholics Category:Brazilian people of German descent Category:Brazilian people of Portuguese descent ","title":"Ronnie Von"},{"id":"12771124","text":"Edward Norman Fadeley (December 13, 1929 ‚Äì August 30, 2015) was an American attorney and politician in the state of Oregon, United States.

She was the only U.S. Navy ship named for the Escalante River in Utah. History Escalante (AO-70), formerly SS Shabone, was constructed for the Maritime Commission by the Bethlehem Steel Sparrows Point Shipyard, Inc., Sparrow's Point, Maryland, in 1942 and sponsored by Mrs. Walter E. Than. She was acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 30 January 1943, Lieutenant Commander C. L. Bolton, USNR, in command. After a brief shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay area, she transported a cargo of aviation gasoline from Houston, Texas, to the Panama Canal Zone. She was then assigned to duty with the Atlantic Fleet, with Task Forces 60 and 61. Between May 1943 and 30 October 1944 she made six trips to North Africa and two to United Kingdom ports where she fueled ships for the Normandy invasion. Escalante returned to Norfolk Navy Yard for overhaul to fit her for duty in the Pacific. On 4 December 1944 she loaded fuel at Aruba, passed through the Panama Canal and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 26 December. She reported to Service Squadron 10 to operate mainly from Ulithi in refueling units of the U.S. 3rd Fleet and the U.S. 5th Fleet at sea and thereby taking part in the action against Luzon, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and the Japanese homeland. From 26 September 1945 until 20 October she fueled ships in Tokyo Bay and then set sail for San Francisco, California, arriving on 31 October. She was placed out of commission on 12 December 1945 and transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal. She served in commercial service as the SS George McDonald until 30 June 1960 when she foundered approximately 165 miles east of Savannah, GA.

Retrieved 17 November 2009 is a secondary comprehensive school, in Long Eaton, Derbyshire. It was rated 'Good' at its last OFSTED inspection (November 2016). History It opened in 1954 as the Wilsthorpe Secondary Modern School. Neighbouring the school was the Parklands County Secondary Modern School, which became an infants school. During the Eighties it was known as Wilsthorpe Community School and still retains the 'community school' status. The school gained Business and Enterprise specialist school status in 2005. Harrington School ‚Äì one of the three schools on the one site The secondary school shares its site with Parklands Infants School and Harrington Junior School, enabling children to stay on the same site from their first year of school all the way to the Sixth Form of approximately 140 students. Also on the same site are Brackenfield Special School and English Martyrs RC Junior School. Following its gaining Business and Enterprise status, the school used its capital grant to fund a separate building which was named The Enterprise Centre. In 2009 this was extensively refitted as a state-of-the-art teaching facility for 'catering'. In July 2017, work began on the building of an entire new school building, behind the existing school buildings. The current Sports Hall will remain (with a gymnasium in the new building) as will the Enterprise Centre and the current Sixth Form building, which will be repurposed. It is hoped that the new building will be available for staff and students to move into in September 2018. After that, the existing school buildings will be demolished and the area landscaped. The school now has proven strength in all academic areas, according to OFSTED. In addition it is strong in Sports and Drama, both of which are well catered for in the new building. In recent years Wilsthorpe has developed a strength in the production of stage shows which have included Little Shop of Horrors, Singin' in the Rain, Fame!, Hairspray, Grease, The Sound of Music and, in 2017, Les Mis√©rables. The show currently in rehearsal for February 2018 is West Side Story. There are also secondary productions including A Midsummer Night's Dream (2016) which was also performed at the RSC's Other Place in Stratford-on-Avon. Film The school was involved in the filming of Shane Meadows' film This Is England in 2005.BBC News report 12 September 2005 The school is the location for the opening/fight sequence in the film. Leadership and facilities The headteacher, appointed in 2008, is Jonathan Crofts, a former teacher at the school, who was Deputy Headteacher at Chellaston School prior to the appointment. The school has a floodlit astro- turf pitch, named the Bainbridge Astro in memory of a former Head of Sport and Recreation, John Bainbridge. The Enterprise Centre was opened by Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire, in May 2008. Academic performance The school's academic performance has been rapidly improving over recent years, and students at both GCSE and A Level now perform consistently at or above national norms and averages.

Born in Wales, he started work in a factory aged ten, but studied in his spare time and won a scholarship to University College Nottingham. He was ordained as a Baptist minister in Warrington and Liverpool, and became president of the Liverpool Free Church Council.Body without soul: The Philosophical Outlook of British Freemasonry 1700-2000 , by Professor Andrew Prescott.

From 1929 to 1931 he was Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, and Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Dunnico also holds the distinction of being the Labour Party's first backbench rebel, when on 21 February 1924 he became the first Labour MP ever to vote against a Labour government. The vote was on the First Labour Government's programme of building light cruisers, to which Dunnico (a former secretary of the Peace Society International Peace Society Records, 1817-1948 He is listed as the Secretary of the International Peace Society in the 1921 edition of the Labour International Handbook]) objected because he feared the start of an arms race, and because believed that the Parliamentary Labour Party had not been properly consulted. At the 1931 general election, he was defeated in Consett by the Liberal National candidate John Dickie. In January 1935 Dunnico announced that he felt it his duty to support the National Government because he felt political partisanship was damaging to the national interest.\\"Labour Leader And National Unity\\", The Times, 28 January 1935, p. 14. He was National Labour candidate at Wednesbury at the 1935 general election but narrowly failed to win election.  Freemasonry  Dunnico was involved in founding an unusual masonic lodge, the New Welcome Lodge No. 5139, which was consecrated in 1929, shortly before the formation in 1929 of the second Labour Government. It was created at the suggestion of the then Prince of Wales, afterwards King Edward VIII, who was concerned by the antagonism between Freemasonry and the British left towards Freemasonry. The New Welcome Lodge was intended to form a link between Freemasonry and the new governing party, and was open to Labour MPs and for employees of trade unions and the Labour party; its members included Labour's deputy leader Arthur Greenwood. However, when the Parliamentary Labour Party was reduced in strength after its split at the 1929 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of the National Government, numbers were reduced, and in 1934 membership was opened to all men working in the Palace of Westminster. Dunnico was Master of the New Welcome Lodge in 1931.\\"The Mason's candidate New Welcome Lodge No.5139 and the Parliamentary Labour Party\\" by John Hammill and Andrew Prescott (2006) in Labour History Review, Vol. 71, No. 1, April 2006 He was knighted in the New Year Honours 1938, \\"for political and public services\\".London Gazette, Issue 34469 published on 31 December 1937.

Baling twine or baler twine is a small diameter sisal or synthetic twine used to bind a quantity of fibrous material (notably hay or straw) into a more compact and easily stacked form. Tensile strengths of single-ply baling twine range from to .  Properties  Sisal fibers are made of 65% cellulose, 12% Hemicellulose, 9.9% Lignin, and 2% Waxes. Sisal fibers can be available as plaid, herringbone, or twill. The fibers have good sound and impact absorbing properties. They have natural anti-static properties that do not trap dust or absorb moisture easily. The original plain color allows it to easily be dyed and allow for a large range of different color. Sisal twine is also naturally biodegradable. Polypropylene Twine is made out of 100% polypropylene. It is lightweight, inexpensive, strong, and has low density, which allows it to float. It has amazing strength and knots easily. Polypropylene twine and netting, however, is often not removed and makes its way into animal feed. There have been instances where animals suffered serious digestive tract blockages as a result. https://largeanimal.vethospitals.ufl.edu/2012/09/13/notice-to-horse- owners-dangers-with-round-bale-netting/ The consequences of microplastics in the food chain are currently unknown, but pose a significant threat. Also, plastic twine and netting is difficult to handle, and often enters the environment when carried by the wind. Small, often invisible pieces, as well as large masses.https://www.progressivecattle.com/topics/feed- nutrition/remember-to-dispose-of-hay-bale-net-wrap-properly  Processing  Sisal fibers are extracted from the Agave plant; the leaves of the plant are cut and then taken to a machine that splits them apart and extracts the sought after fiber (this process is called decortication). The fibers are then fluffed and brushed out before being washed and then left to dry for 24 hours. The fibers are then sorted based on grade; the lower grades are used for twine. The fibers are brushed together to be made into long strands. The strands are loaded onto a twisting type machine to make the twine, which is made by twisting multiple sisal fibers together into a single strand. The more strands there are, the thicker the twine will be, and it will be able to carry heavier weight.  Applications  Baling twine is used in farming to bind straw or hay bales together (small square, large square, and large round bales) and can be used as rope; it is also strong and durable, so can be used for many rope like applications.  Sisal twine vs. polypropylene twine  The tensile testing of the polypropylene and sisal twines was done with the aid of an Instron tensile testing machine using capstan grips in the Material Science Lab at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. At the point of each type of twine‚Äôs ultimate tensile strength, it is apparent that polypropylene is a stronger material. With approximately an ultimate tensile strength of 270 MPa, it has more than 100% more tensile strength than that of sisal twine which has an ultimate tensile strength of 100 MPa. The two twines broke differently, however, as it can be seen in the two videos. Polypropylene twine had a straight break, where all of its fibers broke at once; this resulted in the straight line dropping to zero on the graph. The sisal twine broke in a different fashion. As the force load increased on the twine sample, individual fibers that were carrying the load broke and new ones became engaged. Thus was created the popping noises in the video; these properties directly correlate to the strength properties. Because all the fibers are engaged at once in polypropylene, it gives the twine high strength; the downside is that all the fibers break at once. Because only certain fibers in sisal twine carry the force of the load at one time, it doesn‚Äôt have as high of a strength as polypropylene twine. It does, however, allow the twine to stay intact much longer as each new fiber becomes engaged.Videos of the testing: polypropylene twine - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b38OVa__pKU sisal twine - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzrX3QNFrEU centrecentre ReferencesExternal links Category:Ropework ","title":"Baling twine"},{"id":"12771198","text":"Jacob Rugh Brandt (c. 1836 - 1911), a.k.a. \\"Blue Jeans\\" Brandt, was an American civil engineer who built many truss covered bridges in Ohio in the 19th century, born in Greenfield Township, Fairfield County, Ohio. Biography The son of Adam and Elizabeth Brandt, Jacob was born in Greenfield Township, Fairfield County, Ohio, an area southeast of Columbus, Ohio. Growing up on the family farm, he is believed to have learned his bridge-building trade from Jonathon Coulson (correct spelling). In addition to constructing bridges, he also was known to build several schools and bridges. One bridge, the Rushville Bridge in Fairfield County, was first constructed by Coulson in 1845 and later reconstructed by Brandt in 1891. He began his professional career working for Fairfield County commissioners in 1858 as a building planner, providing layouts for churches, schools and small bridges in the area. In 1864 he constructed his first large bridge in Baltimore, Ohio, the McLeery Bridge. His second large one was a king post bridge with arches near Loucks Mill. That bridge was apparently closed to traffic in the 1970s, and amazingly deconstructed and moved to Texas in 1983 (never to be rebuilt). In the late 19th century, Brandt built bridges in several other counties, as well as another in Fairfield County in 1888 known as the Peter Ety Bridge. In 1911 Brandt died.

Weekes played halfback for the Columbia University Lions (1899-1902),Columbia Faculty Active ‚Äì Five More Men Besides Harold Weekes Prevented from Playing Football on Local Eleven. The New York Times. September 29, 1901. and he served as team captain during his senior year. Weekes received induction into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954 . \\"A human projectile, Harold Weekes participated in one of the most dangerous of all football plays - the \\"flying hurdle.\\" Mounted on the shoulders of teammates, Weekes was catapulted head-long across the line of scrimmage, landing on his feet and streaking away from the stunned defenders. He was gifted with unique agility and became known for his long- yardage runs. For example, as a freshman in 1899, Harold broke loose and streaked 55 yards to a touchdown that proved the decisive points in a 5-0 upset of previously unbeaten Yale. It was Columbia's first victory over the Elis in 18 seasons. For the next three years, Harold Weekes continued to dazzle enemy defenses, earning All-America honors each season. Walter Camp claimed Weekes \\"was powerful and fast, and had that certain burst of speed at just the right moment.\\" During Weekes' four- year career at Columbia, the Blue and White won 29 games, 19 by shutout. Following graduation, Weekes worked as a successful broker on the New York Stock Exchange.\\" as the first of seven Columbia players enshrined. In 1962, the book Football Immortals profiled Weekes for their selection of the greatest 64 American football players from the game's first 93 years. The Bill Shannon Biographical Dictionary of New York Sports termed him a \\"145-pound lightning bolt\\" who \\"hit the college football scene like a shot\\". \\"A 145-pound lightning bolt from Morristown (N.J.) School, Harold Weekes hit the college football scene like a shot in 1899 when Columbia resumed intercollegiate competition after an eight-year absence.\\" During Weekes's college football career, Columbia won 29 games, including 19 shutouts. Early life and education Weekes was born on April 2, 1880. He grew up in the town of Oyster Bay, New York on Long Island. In 1899, Weekes graduated from the Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey after playing in the backfield on the school's football team. Columbia He graduated from Columbia with his bachelor's degree in 1903 after serving as class vice president. Weekes's graduating class voted him \\"most popular man\\" on campus, \\"best athlete\\", and \\"most modest man\\". Beyond football, Weekes attained achievements in other athletic pursuits at Columbia. Weekes, who competed on the track team, equaled the world indoor record for the 60-yard dash in 1900 with a time of 0:06 2-5. The following year, he set Columbia's school records for the indoor 40-yard dash (with a time of 0:04 4-5) and the 180-yard dash (with a time of 0:19 2-5). That April, Columbia hung a tablet in the school gymnasium to showcase 11 recently shattered athletic records, including Weekes's. He later set the school record for the indoor 100-yard dash that year with a time of 0:10 1-5. During his athletic career, Weekes played as an outfielder (left/center field) on Columbia's baseball team and as a member of second crew for their rowing team. In 1901, he won Columbia's strongman competition with a score of 1709 points on the strength test. In the spring of his senior year, Weekes competed in intramural hockey at Columbia. He played the position of point (now known as defenseman). Football Weekes dives for a touchdown in Columbia's 12-5 loss to Yale in 1900; this was one of just two touchdowns given up by Yale during the 1900 season. In the 1902-1903 school year, noted poet George Edward Woodberry (then a Columbia professor) penned a poem titled \\"To 1903, Columbia\\". He dedicated this poem to the senior class. The eighth and ninth stanzas of \\"To 1903, Columbia\\" paid tribute to Weekes's achievements on the football field: During Weekes's time at Columbia, an article in the school literary magazine (Columbia Literary Monthly) noted how he helped arouse the school spirit. Describing his impact on Columbia's athletics and student life, a 1902 New York Times article titled \\"Columbia's Football Hero\\" wrote: In 1927, Weekes and two other former Columbia Lions (Bert Wilson and David Smythe) visited Columbia to speak at Baker Field (now Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium). George Trevor, The New York Sun's football editor, selected Weekes for First Team on Columbia's all- time football team that year. Trevor named him as Columbia's greatest football player of all time. In 2000, a panel of journalists and historians selected Weekes for Columbia's 24-member Football Team of the Century. Twelve years later, Columbia inducted Weekes into their athletic hall of fame at a ceremony held at the school's Low Memorial Library. =1899: upset of Yale= During his freshman year, Weekes played an integral role in the Columbia Lions' 1899 upset of the Yale Bulldogs at Manhattan Field. The heavily favored Bulldogs entered the game undefeated with a 5-0 record. While notching five consecutive shutouts in those games, Yale had scored a combined 115 points (for an average of 23 points per game.) College Football 1899 Games At the time, Yale carried a reputation as a perennial powerhouse. In stark contrast, Columbia had just resumed playing football that season after a seven-year absence from the game (1892-1898). Returning a kick in the second half of Columbia's game against Yale, Weekes sprinted 50 yards to score a touchdown. During the run, he successfully thwarted the tackling attempts of several Yale players, including the team captain. Weekes's scoring play for Columbia marked the only points in a 5-0 shutout of Yale. Columbia's surprise upset victory represented the first time in 28 seasons that a team other than Harvard, Princeton, or the University of Pennsylvania shut out Yale. The 1899 victory also marked Columbia's first defeat of Yale in 24 years. =1900-1902: three time All- American= A week after Yale, Weekes hurdles the line against Princeton. Weekes and teammate Charles Wright were the first two Columbia Lions football players to make the College Football All-America Team. Playing under head coaches George Foster Sanford and Bill Morley, Weekes received selection to the All-America Team three times (1900-1902). Walter Camp, an official selector, selected him for the 1900 All-America team and the 1901 All-America team. Caspar Whitney, another official selector, selected Weekes for the 1902 All-America team. Using his athletic talents, Weekes achieved particular notoriety in football for his prowess with the \\"flying hurdle\\", a daredevil play. After the hurdler stood atop the shoulders of his teammates, they propelled him over the defenders' heads to launch long runs. Weekes showed a natural talent for keeping his feet post-hurdle, which enabled him to sprint past frequently surprised defenses. In December 1902, more than 600 Columbia students attended a mass meeting held to honor the accomplishments of Weekes and football coach Bill Morley. The student body presented Weekes with a silver loving cup to show their appreciation for his accomplishments at the school. Drawing tears, Weekes thanked them with a short speech : In the fall of 1903, Weekes returned to the school to work as an assistant coach on the Columbia football team. =Legacy= Weekes demonstrated a knack for making best use of his combination of speed, strength, and athletic judgement. In 1909, Walter Camp penned an article for Outing Magazine titled \\"Heroes of the Gridiron\\" that described this prowess. Camp identified Weekes as \\"unquestionably, in his day, the best end runner in the country\\". Camp's article further noted: Herbert Reed's 1913 book Football for Public and Player concurred with Camp's assessment of Weekes's gift for speed. Reed noted: Career after college After college, Weekes entered his professional career as a stockbroker with a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. He joined the firm Thomas, Maclay, and Company. Stamp collecting While working in finance, Weekes grew an expansive stamp collection. In 1934, he sold this stamp collection for $1 million. Describing the sale, a magazine about philately (the study of stamps and stamp collecting) suggested it was likely the \\"largest all-cash transaction that has ever been negotiated for a stamp collection\\". Bruin's tree climb Harold Weekes and his younger brother Bradford Weekes (who also played for Morristown School) owned a 300-pound brown bear named Bruin as a pet. In the spring of 1907, Bruin broke loose, made for a nearby tree, and climbed it. His climb led to widespread commotion among the townspeople who tried various methods to get him down. They unsuccessfully tried lassoing Bruin away from the tree and then scaring him from the tree by setting a fire. Finally, Bruin smelled the scent of food placed at the foot of the tree and descended to his den. Family Harold Weekes married Louisine Peters Weekes in 1906. They had a daughter together, Hathaway Weekes Scully. Following his divorce from Louisine Peters Weekes in 1926, Weekes married Frances Stokes Clark Weekes from Roslyn, New York in 1933. After Harold Weekes died in 1950, Scully endowed the Trade with the Orient Exhibit at the American Museum in Britain in memory of her father. She also established the Harold H. Weekes Fund at Columbia. The Weekes Fund supported Columbia's Phlamoudhi Archeological Project in Phlamoudhi, a village on the island of Cyprus. Home at Wereholme Harold Weekes and Louisine Peters Weekes owned a house known as Wereholme in Islip, New York on Long Island. Built by noted architect Grosvenor Atterbury, the building showcases the French Provincial style of architecture. See also: In 2006, Suffolk County, New York purchased Wereholme.

The party was more influential during the NEP era in the Bolshevist Russia and the Soviet Union, and the Ukrainization in the Soviet Ukraine. Its influence faded away in 1930s due to Stalin's terror regime in the USSR and execution of his policies in Ukraine by Lazar Kaganovich. At times, the Communist Party of Western Ukraine was split into different wings, the pro-Soviet faction and more independent one. In 1927, the majority of the Central Committee of the CPWU supported the 'nationalist' faction of Alexander Shumsky in the CPU(B). Consequently, Kaganovich, who was the general secretary of the CPU(B), accused the Western Ukrainian communists of treason. The CPWU split into majority 'nationalist' faction and a pro-Kaganovich minority. On 18 February 1928 the majority-CPWU led by Ivan Krilyk and Roman Turyansky was expelled from the Comintern. By the end of 1928, the CPWU (majority) disbanded itself and its leaders who expressed regrets because of their 'errors' went to the USSR, where they were later repressed.

Description The park is not fully \\"completed\\", plans were to have a larger park, taking over the complete infenced area, however, the city underestimated the costs, and the $380,000 budget was soon drained. The park is still functional despite not being 100% complete, and also is one of the most sought after Skateparks in Missouri. Locals can be seen at Penn Valley Skatepark on a daily basis, mainly because of the many different aspects of the park itself. Also the park is so close to the Kansas border that it makes it a quick drive from both sides of the border. [edit] The park is completed now thanks to a donation by Rob Drydek and street league. A series of three smaller banks leading to one large bank make up the \\"Street Course\\", or Plaza, on the east side of the park. The southern portion of the park includes a set of stairs, and a foot-tall square \\"handrail\\". This is the part of the skatepark that is considered unfinished, and grass is now growing where the original park was intended to continue. On the west side of the park can be found the most remarkable feature of the park, the Bowl. The Bowl is 6 foot-deep, that waterfalls to a 9 foot-deeper end. The bowl is very well constructed, with real concrete pool coping and tile on one side. This feature attracts many of the \\"old-school\\" skateboarders from the bowl skateboarding eras of the 1970s and 80s, they bring with them a unique style that is rare in today's skateboarding generation. Location The skatepark itself shares a group of tennis courts, and basketball court. It overlooks Downtown Kansas City. The park practically shares a parking-lot with One-Park Place, a recognizable building in the Kansas City Skyline. Also the park is close to Penn Tower. The Park rests atop the same grass hill as the Kansas City Scout Statue, and has views of Liberty Memorial and the Federal Building.

The village is located on the edge of Dartmoor, in the parish of Buckland Monachorum and is approximately from the village of Yelverton, from the city of Plymouth and from Tavistock. History During the Second World War, Crapstone was the nearest village to RAF Harrowbeer. Members of the RAF crew were housed in the nearby villages of Crapstone, Yelverton and Buckland Monachorum. The Ministry of Defence maintained a defence site in Crapstone until the 1980s when the site was cleared and converted for residential use. In 2007 Crapstone was used as the name of the village in a television advert for the RAC. Local residents started a protest group on the social networking site Facebook complaining that the village used in the television advert was not actually Crapstone but a location using its name. As a child, Christopher Hitchens lived for some years in the village, and noted his embarrassment at the name in his autobiography, as well as in the pages of Vanity Fair. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. Other previous residents include singer Michael Ball and the writer Emma Smith.
